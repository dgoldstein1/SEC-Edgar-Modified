Item 5.   Other Events.
          -------------

     On May 9, 1997, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Microsoft"),
entered into a License, Development and Marketing Agreement (the "Development
Agreement") which provides for the licensing to Microsoft of certain of the
Company's multi-user software enhancements to Microsoft's Windows NT Server and
for the cooperation between the parties for the development of future multi-user
versions of Microsoft Windows NT Server, code-named Hydrix 4.x and Hydrix 5.x.
The agreement also provides for each party to develop its own enhancements or
"plug-ins" to the jointly developed products which may provide access to the
Hydrix base platform from a wide variety of computing devices, such as a Company
developed plug-in that implements the ICA protocol on the new platform.

     On May 30, 1997, pursuant to the terms of the Development Agreement, the
Company received an aggregate of $75,000,000 as a non-refundable royalty payment
and for engineering and support services to be rendered by the Company.  Under
the terms of the Development Agreement, the Company will be eligible to receive
royalty payments of up to an additional $100,000,000 based on Microsoft's
release and shipment of Hydrix 4.x and Hydrix 5.x products.  In addition,
Microsoft and the Company have agreed to engage in certain joint marketing
efforts to promote use of Windows NT Server-based multi-user software and the
Company's ICA/(R)/ protocol.  Additionally, for a period of at least two and
one-half years, Microsoft has agreed to endorse only the Company's ICA protocol
as the preferred way to provide multi-user Windows access for devices other than
Windows client devices.  Further, subject to the terms of the Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled to license versions of its WinFrame technology based
on Windows NT v.3.51 until at least September 30, 2001.

     The Company's relationship with Microsoft is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties.  First, the Hydrix-based platforms will allow Microsoft to create
plug-in products that could become competitive with at least some of the
Company's current WinFrame products and future Hydrix-related plug-in product
offerings.  Second, as stated above, Microsoft has agreed to endorse only the
Company's ICA protocol as the preferred method to provide multi-user Windows
access for devices other than Windows clients for a period of two and one-half
years.  After the two and one-half year period expires, it is possible that
Microsoft will market or endorse other methods to provide non-Windows client
devices multi-user Windows access.  Finally, the Company's royalties pursuant to
the Development Agreement rely significantly on Microsoft's ability to market
the Hydrix 4.x and 5.x products.  Microsoft's distributors and resellers are not
within the control of the Company and, to the Company's knowledge, are not
obligated to purchase products from Microsoft.  If Microsoft (1) develops
competitive plug-in products, (2) endorses in the future other methods to
provide non-Windows client devices multi-user Windows access or (3) is unable to
successfully market the Hydrix-based products, the Company's business, results
of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

     In addition to the factors outlined in the preceding paragraph, there are
other risks and uncertainties pertaining to the Company's relationship with
Microsoft that appear in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations --

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1997, which are
hereby incorporated by reference.

                  LICENSE, DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING AGREEMENT


This LICENSE, DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered
into and effective as of May 9, 1997 (the "Effective Date"), by and between
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a Washington corporation (hereinafter "Microsoft"), and
CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware Corporation (hereinafter "Citrix").

                                    RECITALS

A.   Microsoft and Citrix desire to work together as provided in this Agreement
     to develop multi-user functionality for Microsoft's Windows NT Server
     operating system which will be owned and marketed by Microsoft;

     multi-user software enhancements to Microsoft's Windows NT Server, as
     provided in this Agreement;

C.   Microsoft desires to cooperate with Citrix as provided in this Agreement in
     the development of plug-ins and other complementary product offerings; and

D.   Microsoft and Citrix desire to engage in joint marketing to promote use of

     this Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT

1    Definitions

          Established Product of the other Party.  An Established Product is a
          product publicly released or released for significant public beta
          testing, and designed, developed, or acquired before the introduction

          drivers, network protocols, etc., where such similarity with the user
          interface or APIs is dictated by adherence to an industry standard
          which was widely recognized prior to the release of a party's product.
          A party's product shall not be deemed to be a Clone Product solely on
          the basis that it provides the same or substantially the same
          functionality as a product of the other Party.  For the purposes of
          this definition, neither the ICA protocol nor Microsoft created
          interfaces and protocols

          emulating terminals) which terminals only display the output of, and
          gather input for, the applications running on the server computer.  A
          Multi-User configuration is distinguished from a networked
          configuration in that the controlling application programs for the
          users at terminals in a Multi-User configuration execute only on the
          server and not on the computer terminals.  The parties have utilized a
          definition of "Multi-User" in Exhibit F which is different from the
          foregoing.  The definition in this Section shall apply to all of the
          provisions of this Agreement other than Exhibit F.

     1.14 "Object Code" shall mean machine-executable computer software code in
          binary form.

          product, less reasonable adjustments for returns, rebates, freight
          charges, and sales, use, value-added, and other applicable taxes,
          provided that any returns or rebates are computed in accordance with
          the last two sentences of Section 9.1.2.5 hereof.

     1.17 "Plug-In Software" shall mean Windows NT Server-based server side
          software, developed by Citrix or Microsoft that (i) implements Citrix
          or Microsoft protocols, (ii) allows a remote client to execute
          applications on the server as described in Section 1.13, and (iii)
          utilizes the Hydrix Plug-In Interface.

     1.18 "Pure ICA Device" shall mean a device comprising hardware and
          software, whether now known or hereafter invented, that will
          communicate with application servers using only ICA presentation
          service protocols.  Pure ICA Devices may have local execution of
          applets that have been pre-installed or loaded by an administrator,
          but shall not contain applets downloaded by an end user or offer any
          other substantial functionality except via an ICA connection to an
          application server.  A device which meets the definition of a Pure ICA
          device but which can be rebooted to run an alternative software
          environment not meeting the definition of a Pure ICA Device shall
          still be considered a Pure ICA Device when running solely as a Pure
          ICA Device.

          resource files, bitmaps, icons, and help file source code for the
          applicable software product.

     1.20 "Technical Coordinators" shall mean the representatives of the
          parties who are so identified pursuant to Section 7.

     1.21 "Windows CE" shall mean the current Windows CE product offered by
          Microsoft, or its equivalent and follow-on versions and derivative
          works thereof.

     1.22 "Windows Client Devices" shall mean computers and other electronic
          devices, whether now known or hereafter developed, which use any
          Microsoft Windows family operating system now known or hereafter
          developed, including without limitation Microsoft Windows 3.x (whether
          running alone or in conjunction with any other operating system (such
          as MS-DOS or OS/2)), and derivatives and successors, Microsoft Windows
          95 and derivatives and successors, Windows CE and derivatives and
          successors, Windows NT Workstation and derivatives and successors, and
          Windows NT Server and derivatives and successors. In no event,
          however, shall "Windows Client Devices" include any computer or other
          electronic device which uses an MS-DOS branded operating system
          product or an OS/2 branded operating system product as its only
          operating system.

          offered under the name "WinFrame."  "WinFrame 2.0/3.51" shall mean any
          WinFrame product which (i) is based on Windows NT Server v. 3.51 code;
          and (ii) corresponds with the specifications existing as of the
          Effective Date for WinFrame 2.0/4.0, but which is ported back to
          Windows NT Server v.3.51, including any limitations which are
          necessitated by such downgrade.  "WinFrame 2.0/4.0" shall mean a
          version of the WinFrame 2.0 product which is based on Windows NT
          Server v.4.0 as such version exists or has been described in Citrix'
          specifications as of the Effective Date.

          Exhibits C and D.  The parties agree that Hydrix is to be a superset
          of Windows NT Server, and will be made commercially available through
          Microsoft's standard distribution channels.  Both parties 

<PAGE>
 
                                      -5-

          recognize that a goal of this Agreement is to reconcile the interfaces
          for Citrix Plug-in Software and Microsoft Plug-in Software, but that
          this goal may not be achieved with respect to Hydrix 4.0.

          3.1.1  The Technical Coordinators (or their designees) are responsible
                 for all issues relating to staffing and assignments. Each party
                 shall pay its own employees' salaries and expenses.

          3.1.2  Microsoft shall provide office space and appropriate computer
                 equipment to Citrix employees located in Redmond performing
                 work hereunder. Microsoft will allow Citrix engineers to have
                 unescorted access to its Redmond facility as is reasonable for
                 the purpose of performing work hereunder. Citrix engineers
                 shall abide by all rules and regulations pertaining to work at
                 Microsoft's campus.

     3.2  Enhancements to Hydrix Plug-in Interface.  Microsoft and Citrix will
          ----------------------------------------                            
          jointly architect and develop enhancements to the Hydrix Plug-In
          Interface and system capabilities required to support the Hydrix Plug-
          In Interface.

     3.3  Procedure for Considering Enhancement Proposals by Either Party.  Each
          ---------------------------------------------------------------       
          party's development team may present proposals for possible
          enhancements to Hydrix and to the Hydrix Plug-In Interface to the
          development team of the other party.  In selecting and implementing
          any such enhancement, each party will use commercially reasonable good
          faith efforts to take into account the strategic goals, reliability
          requirements, and schedule constraints of the other.  Should a
          proposed enhancement be rejected by either development team the
          proposing party may elect to escalate such proposal to the Technical
          Coordinators and then the Named Executives; provided, however, that
          Microsoft shall retain final authority over the Hydrix architecture,
          including enhancements to the Hydrix Plug-In Interface.  In making
          such determinations, Microsoft agrees to evaluate possible
          enhancements to the Hydrix Plug-In Interface in light of the following
          mutual goals of the parties:  (i) not disadvantaging Citrix Plug-In
          Software vis-a-vis Microsoft Plug-In Software; (ii) ensuring that the
          performance and scalability of Hydrix following the proposed
          enhancement will not be materially worse than is provided by the
          current Hydrix product offering, or, for the first Hydrix release,
          than that provided by WinFrame 2.0/4.0; and (iii) ensuring that
          enhancements do not cause Citrix Plug-In Software to materially
          regress in terms of performance or functionality.  The parties agree
          that the foregoing goals may be overridden by Microsoft's need to
          address market demand for enhancements to Hydrix which cause a minor
          regression in the performance and functionality of Citrix Plug-In
          Software, and which regression it is technically impracticable to
          prevent within a commercially reasonable development schedule.  If
          after escalation, Microsoft rejects a proposed enhancement which
          Citrix considers essential, Microsoft will cooperate with Citrix to
          determine an alternative business and technical solution which will
          allow Citrix to develop and distribute such enhancement with its Plug-
          In 

<PAGE>
 
                                      -6-

          Software.  Neither party may charge any fee to the other party in
          connection with cooperative efforts undertaken pursuant to the
          foregoing sentence.

          3.3.1  Citrix shall have the option of maintaining a reasonable
                 technical liaison staff at Microsoft for the purpose of
                 participating in the architecture and implementation of
                 enhancements to the Hydrix Plug-In Interface.

     3.4  Support Documentation.  Citrix will provide Microsoft on an ongoing
          ---------------------                                              
          basis with current technical and support documentation concerning
          Citrix' Hydrix-related products, including but not limited to the
          Citrix Plug-In Software, in order to enable Microsoft technical
          support personnel to be able to identify errors or support issues
          which are related to the Citrix Plug-In Software.

     3.5  Support Responsibilities for Hydrix and Plug-In Software.  Microsoft
          --------------------------------------------------------            
          will provide initial end user support contacts and problem diagnosis
          for all versions of Hydrix.  Citrix will provide Microsoft with all
          technical assistance and code modifications necessary to resolve end
          user support requests from Hydrix 4.x end users which cannot be
          addressed by Microsoft support personnel through reference to standard
          product support materials.  In providing such Hydrix technical support
          to Microsoft, Citrix will comply with the response time requirements
          set forth in Exhibit G. Any code modifications generated as part of
          this effort shall be included in Hydrix service packs unless Microsoft
          elects otherwise on a case-by-case basis.  If Microsoft elects not to
          include any such modification in Hydrix service packs, Microsoft will
          make such modifications generally available through an alternative
          distribution mechanism.  Each party will provide all customer support
          for its respective Plug-In Software.  The parties will work in good
          faith to design an infrastructure for referral and escalation of
          Hydrix and Plug-In Software-related support requests, and amend
          Exhibit G as appropriate.

     3.6  Location of Work.  Except as provided above and except as mutually
          ----------------                                                  
          agreed by the Technical Coordinators, the parties agree that all work
          to be performed hereunder shall be performed at the facilities of the
          party performing such work.

     3.7  Marketing.  The parties will make the announcements and conduct the
          ---------                                                          
          joint marketing and promotions provided for in Exhibit E and as agreed
          upon by the Technical Coordinators or Named Executives from time to
          time.

     3.8  Quarterly Reviews.  Quarterly review meetings relating to the work to
          -----------------                                                    
          be performed hereunder will be held at either Microsoft or Citrix
          within a reasonable time after the end of each calendar quarter.  The
          purpose of these meetings is for the Named Executives or their
          designees to disclose relevant product strategies and plans to one
          another, as appropriate, and to encourage a periodic exchange of views
          by Microsoft and Citrix personnel having an interest in, and/or
          responsibility for, the progress of the work to be performed
          hereunder.

     3.9  Further Product Plans.  Microsoft agrees to consider, in good faith, a
          ---------------------                                                 
          plan for Microsoft to offer an entry-level Hydrix product that
          incorporates the Hydrix Plug-In Interface, targeted at small business
          and replicated sites with low-cost characteristics.

          such Confidential Information, provided that such party shall maintain
          the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as provided
          herein, except to the extent that disclosure is inherent from selling,

8    Covenants
     ---------

     8.1  In order to facilitate the exchange of information and the joint
          development work to be performed hereunder, and in consideration of
          the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties shall abide by
          the following covenants during the term of this Agreement (unless
          otherwise specified below):

     8.2  Hydrix shall support ICA in an equitable manner in comparison to the
          support provided by such server offerings for other protocols of
          Microsoft or third party clients.

     8.3  Microsoft will [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ to allow client
          devices implementing ICA to attach to Hydrix servers.  Citrix
          acknowledges that such licensing scheme may require the use of Key
          System Client Software.  Without limiting the generality of the
          foregoing, Microsoft's [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ for
          Windows CE Key System Client Software licenses [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
          REQUESTED]/*/ in comparison to [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/
          for Key System Client Software licenses for end users of Pure ICA
          Devices.

     8.4  After Microsoft begins to market and distribute Hydrix, Microsoft
          agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make Hydrix available
          in at least the same set of international versions and on at least the
          same set of platforms as Windows NT Server is offered.  Microsoft will
          use commercially reasonable efforts to release

                                      -15-

          such additional versions in a timely manner given the development
          requirements therefor, and provided that Microsoft in its sole
          discretion shall determine its release schedule for all versions of
          Hydrix.

     8.5  Provided that Microsoft ships a Hydrix 4.0 product and a Hydrix 5.0
          product, during the term of this Agreement, Citrix agrees to limit
          updates of its current Multi-User product (currently known as
          "WinFrame") as follows: [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/.
          "Product Release" shall mean a major release of Product which is
          designated by Citrix in its sole discretion as a change in the
          digit(s) to the left of the decimal point in the product version
          number [(x).xx]; and "Version Release" shall mean a release of Product
          containing only minor enhancements and bug fixes which is designated
          by Citrix in its sole discretion as a change in the tenths digit in
          the product version number [x.(x)x].  For as long as Citrix complies
          with the foregoing limitation, Microsoft shall provide it with Windows
          NT Server v.3.51 Source Code as necessary to develop and maintain such
          authorized WinFrame 2.0/3.51 versions in localized form.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Microsoft, despite making
          commercially reasonable efforts, is unable to release (i) a Hydrix 4.0
          product within [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] /*/ of the Effective
          Date, (ii) a Hydrix 5.0 product within the later of a) [CONFIDENTIAL
          TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ after initial release of a Hydrix 4.0 product
          and b) [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ after the Effective Date,
          or (iii) a Hydrix product for the second Product Release of Windows NT
          Server following the Effective Date (currently assumed to be Windows
          NT Server v.6) within [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ after
          initial release of Hydrix 5.0 product, then Citrix may offer, license
          and distribute [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ of WinFrame for
          Windows NT Server v. 3.51 without violating its obligations under this
          Section.

     8.6  Provided that Microsoft is in compliance with Section 8.9, Citrix
          agrees [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ developing or assisting
          any third party in developing, [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/
          as defined in this Agreement, without Microsoft's prior written
          consent.

     8.7  For the first [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ after the
          Effective Date of this Agreement, Microsoft agrees to refrain from
          shipping any Multi-User client device support for any device other
          than a Windows Client Device and will not make any representation or
          announcement of its intention to develop or ship such Plug-In Software
          for [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ after the Effective Date.

     8.8  Microsoft agrees to endorse only ICA as the preferred way to provide
          Multi-User Windows access for devices other than Windows Client
          Devices for a period of two and one-half (2.5) years from the
          Effective Date.

     8.9  Provided that Citrix is in compliance with Section 8.6, Microsoft
          agrees [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ developing or assisting
          third parties in developing [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/, as
          defined in this Agreement, [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/,
          without Citrix' prior written consent.

     8.10 In the event Citrix fails to actively pursue the market for
          supporting specific client device types (e.g., Macintosh) with Citrix
          Plug-In Software and provide a commercially competitive product on
          those specific client device types on an on-going basis, Microsoft
          shall have the right to lift restrictions in Sections 6.3 and 8.7 for
          those affected client device types upon written notice to Citrix,
          provided Citrix does not cure such failure within [CONFIDENTIAL
          TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ of notice or a technically reasonable time
          period.

     8.11 Microsoft agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to bundle
          ICA client software as supplied by Citrix with Microsoft Windows
          family products during the term of the Agreement, provided that
          Microsoft shall not be obligated to do so if such bundling materially
          increases product costs and/or materially increases end-user
          electronic download times.  Microsoft shall offer this through its
          standard delivery mechanisms, but not require its OEMs to bundle such
          client software.

     8.12 Microsoft shall continue to make Hydrix 4.x products commercially
          available for [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ beyond the release
          (if any) of Hydrix 5.0 and Hydrix 5.x for [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT
          REQUESTED]/*/ beyond the release of Hydrix products for the second
          Product Release of Windows NT Server following the Effective Date
          (currently assumed to be Windows NT Server v.6).

     8.13 Microsoft covenants that it will not distribute a Multi-User server
          which provides Multi-User access to Windows-based applications during
          the term of this Agreement other than the Multi-User Windows NT
          defined as Hydrix herein, unless such server is a functional
          replacement, including the Hydrix Plug-In Interfaces, for Hydrix that

                 Microsoft shall pay the following additional royalties to

                 9.1.2.1  For Hydrix products which Microsoft prices separately
                          and the primary function of which is to add Multi-User

                 9.1.2.3  In each quarter, Microsoft shall calculate the

                          distributed as "free," "complimentary," "no charge,"
                          or at nominal prices to cover shipping and handling,
                          in support of normal marketing activities, or (ii) MS'
                          internal use and sale to employee copies. Microsoft
                          shall be entitled to withhold from all royalty sums
                          otherwise payable hereunder a reasonable reserve, made
                          in good faith, against anticipated returns of Hydrix
                          products and Key System Client Software which it
                          distributes, provided that such reserve shall not
                          exceed fifteen percent (15%) of all amounts due
                          hereunder for the two (2) most recent calendar
                          quarters, without adjustment for reserve, and which
                          reserve shall be reviewed quarterly in light of the
                          actual returns of the preceding two (2) quarters. The
                          excess (short-fall), if any, of such reserve balance
                          at the time of such quarterly review over (under) the

                 associated with Hydrix 4.x, Microsoft's obligation to make any
                 further payments under Section 9.1.2 associated with Hydrix 4.0
                 shall cease.

                 such calendar quarter pay an additional amount to Citrix such
                 that the cumulative payment for such quarter equals

     9.6   Audits.
           ------ 

           9.6.1  During the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years
                  thereafter, Microsoft agrees to keep all usual and proper
                  records and books of account and all usual and proper entries
                  relating to Hydrix sufficient to substantiate the number of
                  copies of Hydrix, distributed or otherwise disposed of by or
                  for Microsoft. Microsoft shall maintain such records for
                  itself and for each Microsoft subsidiary which exercises
                  rights under this Agreement.

           9.6.2  In order to verify statements issued by Microsoft and
                  Microsoft's compliance with the terms of this Agreement, upon
                  prior written notice to Microsoft, Citrix may cause (i) an
                  audit to be made of Microsoft's and/or Microsoft's
                  subsidiaries' books and records; and/or (ii) an inspection to
                  be made of Microsoft's and/or Microsoft's subsidiaries'
                  facilities and procedures. Any audit and/or inspection shall
                  be conducted during regular business hours at Microsoft's
                  and/or Microsoft's subsidiaries' facilities. Any audit shall
                  be conducted by a nationally recognized independent certified
                  public accountant selected by Citrix (other than on a
                  contingent fee basis).

           9.6.3  Microsoft agrees to provide Citrix' designated audit or
                  inspection team access to the relevant Microsoft and/or
                  Microsoft subsidiaries' records and facilities.

           9.6.4  Prompt adjustment shall be made to compensate for any errors
                  or omissions disclosed by such audit. Any such audit shall be
                  paid for by Citrix unless material discrepancies are
                  disclosed. "Material" shall mean more than five percent (5%)
                  of the amount that was reported. If material discrepancies are
                  disclosed, Microsoft agrees to pay Citrix for the costs
                  associated with the audit. In no event shall audits be made
                  more frequently than annually.

           to cure that breach within ninety (90) days after receipt of written
           notice thereof.

     10.3  In the event that Citrix ships a Product Release incorporating
           technology from Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51, except as
           permitted by Section 8.5, (i) Citrix' rights to Windows NT Server
           v.3.51 Source Code and Object Code, as they exist as of the Effective

           Section 10.3(i), (ii), and (iii) at any time in its sole discretion,
           provided that such election of remedies shall be Citrix' sole and
           exclusive remedy in the event of any breach by Microsoft of Section
           8.3 or its development obligations hereunder.

     10.5  The following Sections shall survive any expiration or termination of

           PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
           ANY KIND. ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTEES MADE BY EITHER PARTY TO
           ITS CUSTOMERS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY LAW OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING

           PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
           FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

           boundaries of the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, the

12   Indemnity
     ---------

     12.1  Each party shall (the "Indemnifying Party"), at its expense and upon
           request, defend any claim or action brought against the other party,
           and the other party's subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,
           employees, agents and independent contractors (the "Indemnified
           Party"), which, if true, would constitute a breach of a warranty set
           forth in Section 11, and the party will indemnify and hold the other
           party harmless from and against any costs, damages and fees
           reasonably incurred by the other party, including but not limited to
           fees of attorneys and other professionals, that are attributable to
           such claim; provided that: (i) the Indemnified Party provides the
           Indemnifying Party with reasonably prompt notice in writing of any
           such claim or action and permits the Indemnifying Party, through
           counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, to answer and
           defend such claims or action; and (ii) the Indemnified Party provides
           the Indemnifying Party information, assistance and authority to help
           the Indemnifying Party to defend such claim or action. The
           Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party upon demand
           for any payments made or loss suffered by the Indemnified Party at
           any time after the date hereof in respect of any liability or claim
           to which the foregoing indemnity relates, and which has resulted in
           an adverse judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or has been
           settled with the consent of the Indemnifying Party.

     12.2  The Indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
           and participate in the defense of any claim or action at its expense.

     12.3  Following notice of an Infringement Claim, the Indemnifying Party
           may, at its expense, without obligation to do so, procure for the
           Indemnified Party the right to continue to market, use and have
           others use the information or materials claimed to be infringing or,
           without obligation to do so, may replace any information or materials
           to make them non-infringing. If the Indemnifying Party 

<PAGE>
 
                                      -23-

           elects to replace or modify any information or materials, such
           replacement shall meet substantially the specifications for such
           information or materials provided for in this Agreement, if any, and
           shall be subject to any acceptance provisions of this Agreement
           applicable to the delivery of such information or materials.

     12.4  Neither party shall have any liability for any infringement claim
           based on the other party's (i) use or distribution of products after
           receipt of notice from the other party that the party should cease
           use or distribution of the product due to an infringement claim; or
           (ii) combination of information or materials delivered by the other
           party hereunder with other programs or data, if such infringement
           claim would have been avoided by the exclusive use of the information
           or materials delivered hereunder. For all infringement claims arising
           under this Section 12.4, the other party agrees to indemnify and
           defend the delivering party from and against all damages, costs and
           expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

           INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES,
           EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
           DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. The parties acknowledge that other parts of this
           Agreement rely upon the inclusion of this Section.

     13.2  Notwithstanding Section 13.1, Citrix may recover against Microsoft
           indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages that are
           awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction following exhaustion of
           all appeals to which Microsoft is entitled, up to a total cap of
           [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]/*/ for any uncured, material
           breach of Section 6.3.

     13.3  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect or limit either party's right
           to collect any amounts otherwise due under the terms of this
           Agreement or to institute and prosecute proceedings in any court of
           competent jurisdiction (as provided in Section 19), under any
           applicable laws, seeking direct damages for breach of this Agreement,
           specific performance of this Agreement, or an order enjoining the
           other party from activities in violation of this Agreement.

           this Agreement.

     14.2  Personnel used or supplied by Microsoft in the performance of work
           hereunder shall be employees or contractors of Microsoft, and under
           no circumstances are such personnel to be considered employees or

           supervision and control of its personnel, payment of salary,
           including withholding of income taxes and social security taxes,
           worker's compensation, disability benefits and the like.

           any Engineer (as defined below) to terminate his or her employment
           with the other party while such person is serving as an Engineer,
           provided that it shall not be a breach of this Section for either
           party to hire an Engineer of the other party who has responded to
           general advertisements or has applied for a position via normal
           recruitment channels. An "Engineer" refers to a development or test
           engineer who has significant experience in working with Multi-User

     ------------------------------------

     Each party agrees that it will not export or re-export any product or
     technical data of the other party to any country, person, entity or end

     20.1  Neither party shall assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or

           company for as long as such negotiation discussions continue. Any
           attempted assignment in derogation of the foregoing shall be void.

21   Pre-Agreement Claims
     --------------------

     21.1  Citrix covenants and agrees that it (and any other person or entity
           under its direction or control, and any other person or entity which
           Citrix has engaged to act on its behalf) will not assert any claims
           against Microsoft, any Microsoft employee, or any Microsoft
           subsidiary based upon any matter that occurred prior to the Effective
           Date of this Agreement ("Pre-Agreement Claims"). Notwithstanding
           anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, Citrix may assert
           any Pre-Agreement Claims against Microsoft, Microsoft employees, or
           Microsoft subsidiaries in the event that (a) Microsoft commits a
           material breach of the Agreement which has not been cured within
           sixty (60) days of notice of breach, and Citrix elects to terminate
           the Agreement because of such breach; or (b) Microsoft terminates the
           Agreement for any reason other than material breach by Citrix which
           has not been cured within sixty (60) days of notice of breach.

     21.2  Microsoft covenants and agrees that it (and any other person or
           entity under its direction or control, and any other person or entity
           which Microsoft has engaged to act on its behalf) will not assert any
           claims against Citrix, any Citrix employee, or any Citrix subsidiary
           based upon any matter that occurred prior to the Effective Date of
           this Agreement ("Pre-Agreement Claims"). Notwithstanding anything to
           the contrary in the preceding sentence, Microsoft may assert any Pre-
           Agreement Claims against Citrix, Citrix employees, or Citrix
           subsidiaries in the event that 

<PAGE>
 
                                      -27-

           (a) Citrix commits a material breach of the Agreement which has not
           been cured within sixty (60) days of notice of breach, and Microsoft
           elects to terminate the Agreement because of such breach; or (b)
           Citrix terminates the Agreement for any reason other than material
           breach by Microsoft which has not been cured within sixty (60) days
           of notice of breach.

     21.3  This Section 21 shall survive expiration of the five-year term of the
           Agreement but shall not survive termination for breach of the
           Agreement.

22   Construction
     ------------

     If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
     this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of
     the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to
     effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will
     continue in full force and effect. Failure by either party to enforce any
     provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future
     enforcement of that or any other provision. This Agreement has been
     negotiated by the parties and their respective counsel and will be
     interpreted fairly in accordance with its terms and without any strict
     construction in favor or against either party.

23   Entire Agreement
     ----------------

     This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to its subject matter and merges all prior and contemporaneous
     communications, and this Agreement supersedes those provisions of the
     License, Development, and Marketing Agreement dated July 9, 1996 between
     the parties pertaining to Microsoft's distribution of a Multi-User product.
     It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to
     the date of this Agreement and signed on behalf of Citrix and Microsoft by
     their respective duly authorized representatives.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
modify any agreement between the parties entered into prior to the Effective
Date.

           2.1.2.  A Combination Product is licensed under a claim of a
                   Microsoft Subject Patent only to the extent that there would
                   not have been infringement (direct or indirect) of such claim
                   by the non-Citrix components of the Combination Product but
                   for the combination of the third party Product with the
                   Citrix Product. The fact that a Combination Product is
                   unlicensed under any claim shall not limit, restrict or
                   otherwise affect the license granted to the Citrix Product

                   Clone Product is not licensed under this License.

           2.1.3.  Except to the extent necessary to allow Citrix and its

                   make, use, sell offer for sale or import, to have made, to
                   commercially exploit, to promulgate any specification related
                   to, to provide any service, or to test any Microsoft
                   Products.

           2.2.2.  A Combination Product is licensed under a claim of a Citrix
                   Subject Patent only to the extent that there would not have
                   been infringement (direct or indirect) by the non-Microsoft
                   component of the Combination Product but for the combination
                   of the third party Product with the Microsoft Product. The
                   fact that a Combination Product is unlicensed under any claim
                   shall not limit, restrict or otherwise affect the license

           2.2.4.  In the case of those Citrix Subject Patents licensable

                   third party, Microsoft shall be responsible for payment of
                   such fees, and Microsoft's license hereunder shall be at
                   Microsoft's request and option and subject to payment of such
                   fees and to any other applicable restrictions of the third
                   party licensor.

     2.3.  Subsidiaries: The licenses granted by each Party in Sections 2.1 and
           2.2 shall include the right of the Parties to grant the benefit of
           such licenses to their respective Subsidiaries. To obtain such
           benefit, the Subsidiary shall be bound by the terms and conditions of

           Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary during the term of this License
           and holds any Subject Patents under which a Party hereto has been
           granted a license, such license will continue for the life of such
           Subject Patents. The right to any other licenses shall terminate on
           the date such Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary. The license
           granted to the Subsidiary under Section 2 becomes a limited license

MICROSOFT AND CITRIX SIGN TECHNOLOGY CROSS-LICENSING AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT


REDMOND, Wash., May 12 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:  MSFT) today
announced a joint development agreement with Citrix Systems Inc. (Nasdaq:  CTXS)
to provide Windows(R)-based terminal support for the Microsoft(R) Windows NT(R)
Server network operating system.  Under the agreement, Microsoft will license
Citrix multiuser technology and the companies will cooperate on the development
of advanced multiuser capabilities for both Windows NT Server 4.0 generation
servers and Windows NT Server 5.0 generation servers.  These advanced multiuser
capabilities allow applications to be executed from the server and support the
concept of "Windows-based terminals."

A Windows-based terminal is a true "thin client" that launches and runs Windows
NT-based applications from the server.  These Windows-based terminals can be
used by task-based workers who only need a limited-function device on their
desktop.  The Windows-based terminal is 100 percent Windows-compatible across a
full range of solutions.  This means customers will be able to deploy a
combination of Windows-based terminals, NetPCs and PCs, depending upon user
requirements, and will know that their applications will run across all types of
Windows-based systems.  The Windows-based terminal completes the broad range of
Windows family solutions, from handheld PCs running Windows CE to NetPCs to PCs
to high-end Windows NT Workstation-based systems.

"Customers have told us that reducing total cost of ownership is a critical
issue," said Paul Maritz, group vice president of platform and applications at
Microsoft.  "We are evolving the Windows platform with key hardware and software
initiatives to aggressively address this fundamental issue for our customers."

With Microsoft's Zero Administration for Windows initiative, businesses can
reduce the cost of managing users, software and hardware.  In addition,
Microsoft is addressing the fundamental cost of computing hardware by endorsing
two new corporate Windows-based devices, the NetPC and the Windows-based
terminal.  The NetPC is a redefined personal computer providing all of the power
of a normal PC while providing hardware-related management features, such as a
sealed case, to reduce end-user support costs.  The Windows-based terminal will
round out the Windows product family, providing the "thinnest" and most
manageable of the Windows-based clients and will provide the lowest cost of
ownership.  The Zero Administration initiative improvements will apply to all PC
devices, not just these two new members of the hardware family.

Microsoft and Citrix will cooperate on the development of base multiuser
capabilities.  These base capabilities will be marketed by Microsoft as part of
its Windows NT Server 4.0 and 5.0 generations of server products.  Citrix and
Microsoft will each develop and market additional components, built upon these
base services, to support their ICA and T.Share protocols, respectively.  These
protocols are used to remotely display the user interface of applications
running on the server on the client device.  Microsoft will support the T.Share
protocol, which is currently used in products such as NetMeeting(TM)
conferencing software, for support of clients

                                      -2-

running Windows-family operating systems such as Windows CE. ICA is the protocol
that has been developed by Citrix, and will be the preferred protocol for
heterogeneous devices and clients. The Citrix environment will include full
support for features and functions currently supported by its existing WinFrame
servers, and Citrix will continue to provide support to its customer base.

Citrix is a leader in multiuser Windows-based application server software with
an installed base of more than 500,000 concurrent user connections to its
WinFrame servers.  WinFrame is a proven solution for thousands of organizations
across a broad range of industries worldwide.

"This is the next logical step in the close relationship we've enjoyed with
Microsoft since Citrix was founded over eight years ago," said Edward Iacobucci,
Citrix chairman and chief technical officer.  "This joint development agreement
will result in a Windows NT Server platform on which we can continue to address
growing customer demand for innovative thin client solutions through our
Independent Computing Architecture."

Microsoft also announced today an agreement with Prologue Software to license
its multiuser technology and for Prologue to cooperate in the development and
deployment of multiuser capabilities for Windows NT Server.  Prologue engineers
will cooperate to further enhance these efforts.  Prologue Software, a leading
supplier of multiuser operating systems in Europe, has more than 20 years
experience in multiuser operating systems and more than four years experience
developing terminal support for Windows NT Server.

"Prologue Software looks forward to helping Microsoft produce a great product
and assisting its customers in the deployment of Windows-based terminals," said
Georges Seban, chairman of the board and president at Prologue Software.
"Prologue Software plans to provide Windows NT-based multiuser administration
tools along with consulting and training services for Windows NT Server
multiuser solutions."

Citrix's Windows NT Server-based WinFrame enterprise software will continue to
be available for customers deploying solutions today and Citrix will offer a
smooth migration to the future Windows NT Server-based multiuser solutions.
More details on the product availability and beta test time line will be
announced in the future.  Information for Windows NT Server can be found at
