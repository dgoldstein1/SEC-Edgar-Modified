                        CITRIX TO ACQUIRE VIEWSOFT, INC.
                Acquisition to Enhance Citrix's Role in Web-based
                      Application Deployment and Management

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - July 12, 1999 - Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS) today
announced a merger agreement pursuant to which ViewSoft, Inc. will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix. ViewSoft is a Utah-based firm specializing in
software for multi-tier and Web-based application development and deployment.
The transaction is valued at approximately $32 million. Both the Citrix and
ViewSoft boards have approved the transaction, and the companies plan to
complete the transaction during the third quarter of 1999, subject to customary
closing conditions. Citrix will use the proprietary technology to extend the
flexibility and cost benefits of server-based computing to Web-enabled and
multi-tier applications including applications based on Microsoft's DCOM and DNA
component architectures as well as those containing Java and HTML front ends.

     A portion of the purchase price is expected to be allocated to in-process
research and development for which Citrix expects to incur a one-time charge to
its operations, amounting to approximately $2 million in the quarter ending
September 30, 1999.

     "Today's emerging Web-based applications often force a choice between
application thinness and richness," said Mark B. Templeton, president and chief
executive officer of Citrix.  "This new software will deliver a rich user
experience and a new level of interactivity to Web-based applications with a
thin-client footprint."

     The technology allows customers to add greater interactivity to Web-based
applications, similar to the interactivity that users enjoy with Windows-based
applications. Citrix will leverage this proprietary technology to build its
leadership in the rapidly growing market for deploying and managing Web-based
applications, an arena in which the company has pioneered such capabilities as
Application Launching and Embedding (ALE). Citrix's ALE technology enables full-
function Windows-based applications to be launched from or embedded into HTML
pages providing instant online access to any existing application from any Web
browser without application rewrites. For a demo of Citrix ALE technology, users
