              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                                  (Unaudited)
                               September 30, 1998
                                        

   1.  Basis of Presentation

   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
   been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
   interim financial information and with Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
   Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
   required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
   statements.  All adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are
   considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for
   the periods shown are of a normal recurring nature and have been reflected in
   the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  The results of
   operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of  the
   results expected for the full fiscal year or for any future period.   The
   information included in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
   statements should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and
   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein and the
   consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the
   Citrix Systems, Inc. (the Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
   year ended December 31, 1997.

   2.  Restatement of Financial Statements

   In a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
   ("AICPA"), the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") expressed its views
   on the recording of in-process research and development ("IPR&D").  As a
   result, the Company has re-evaluated the amount of purchased IPR&D recorded
   in connection with its acquisition of Insignia Solutions, plc. ("Insignia"),
   APM Ltd., parent company of Digitivity Inc. ("APM"), and VDOnet Corporation
   Ltd. ("VDOnet") and its licensing of technology from EPiCON, Inc. ("EPiCON")
   based on its understanding and interpretation of the aforementioned letter.
   The re-evaluations  resulted in a decrease in the amount of purchase price
   that was allocated to IPR&D and an increase in the amount allocated to
   purchased technology and goodwill. Specifically, the Company reduced the
   amount of previously reported write-offs for purchased IPR&D to $2.4 million
   and increased amortization of intangible assets to $4.2 million and increased
   net intangible assets to $50.6 million for the quarter ended September 30,
   1998.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the Company reduced the
   amount of previously reported write-offs for purchased IPR&D to $18.4 million
   and increased amortization of intangible assets to $6.4 million and increased
   net intangible assets to $50.6 million.

   The effects of the adjustments on the Company's previously reported
   consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 1998 is as
   follows:

   3.  Use of Estimates

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
   accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
   that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial
   statements and accompanying notes.  While the Company believes that such
   estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with the condensed
   consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole,
   the actual amount of such estimates, when known, may vary from these
   estimates.

   4.  Revenue Recognition

   In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
   (AICPA) issued Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, "Software Revenue
   Recognition," which the Company has adopted for transactions entered during
   the year beginning January 1, 1998.  SOP 97-2 provides guidance for
   recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes SOP 91-1,
   "Software Revenue Recognition."  In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-4,
   "Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
   Recognition."  SOP 98-4 defers, for one year, the application of certain
   passages in SOP 97-2 which limit what is considered vendor-specific objective
   evidence necessary to recognize revenue for software licenses in multiple-
   element arrangements when undelivered elements exist.  Additional guidance is
   expected to be provided prior to adoption of the deferred provision of SOP
   97-2.  The Company will determine the impact, if any, the additional guidance
   will have on current revenue recognition practices when issued.  Adoption of
   the remaining provisions of SOP 97-2 did not have a material impact on
   revenue recognition during the first three quarters of 1998.

   5.  Acquisitions

   On February 5, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain in-
   process software technologies and assets of Insignia Solutions, plc for
   approximately $17.5 million.  A portion of the purchase price was allocated
   to in-process research and development, which had not reached technological
   feasibility and had no alternative future use.  The allocation resulted in a
   pre-tax charge of approximately $2.7 million to the Company's operations in
   the first quarter of 1998, after giving effect to the re-evaluation described
   in Note 2 above. Further, on June 30, 1998, the Company completed its
   acquisition of APM Ltd. for approximately $40.4 million.  A portion of the
   purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development which had
   not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.  The
   allocation resulted in a pre-tax charge of approximately $10.7 million to the
   Company's operations in the second quarter of 1998, after giving effect to
   the re-evaluation described in Note 2 above.   In July 1998, the Company
   completed its acquisition of VDOnet Corporation Ltd. for approximately $8
   million.  This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
   accounting with the purchase price being principally allocated to purchase
   technologies and intangible assets.  Approximately $2.4 million of the total
   purchase price represented the value of in-process research and 

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
   development that had not reached technological feasibility and had no
   alternative future use and, as such, was recorded as a non-recurring charge
   for in-process research and development in the third quarter of 1998, after
   giving effect to the re-evaluation described in Note 2 above.

   6.  Licensed Technology

   In January 1998, the Company licensed certain in-process software technology
   from EPiCON, Inc. for approximately $8.0 million.  A portion of the licensing
   fee was allocated to in-process research and development which had no
   alternative future use.  The allocation resulted in a pre-tax charge of
   approximately $2.6 million to the Company's operations in the first quarter
   of 1998, after giving effect to the re-evaluation described in Note 2 above.

   7.  Earnings per Share

   In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128,
   "Earnings Per Share."  Statement 128 replaced the calculation of primary and
   fully diluted earnings per share.  Unlike primary earnings per share, basic
   earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and
   convertible securities.  Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
   previously reported fully diluted earnings per share.  All earnings per share
   amounts for all periods have been presented, and where appropriate, restated
   to conform to the Statement No. 128 requirements.  All common share and per
   share data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the three-for-two
   stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on February 20, 1998, which
   stock dividend was paid to stockholders of record as of February 12, 1998.

   The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings
   per share:

   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
   period presentation.

   9.  Legal Matters

   The Company received a letter dated February 25, 1998 from a third party
   alleging that certain technology incorporated in the Company's WinFrame
   product line may infringe a patent held by the third party, and requesting
   that the Company 

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
   contact the third party to discuss a licensing arrangement for such patent.
   The Company believes that its existing products do not infringe the patent
   held by the third party. There can be no assurance that the Company would
   prevail in the defense of an infringement claim, if made, or that the Company
   could obtain a license to the patent on a reasonable basis, if at all. Any
   patent dispute or litigation, or any royalty-bearing license, could have a
   material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or
   results of operations.

   In addition, the Company may from time to time be a party to legal claims
   arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes the ultimate
   resolution of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on its
   financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

  The Company develops, markets, sells and supports innovative client and 
server-based computing software that enables effective and efficient deployment
of enterprise applications that is designed for Microsoft Windows operating
systems. The Company was incorporated in April 1989, and shipped its initial
products in 1991.

  From its introduction in the second quarter of 1993 through the second quarter
of 1995, the Company's WinView product represented the largest source of the
Company's revenues.  The Company began shipping its WinFrame product in final
form in the third quarter of 1995 and MetaFrame(TM) in the second quarter of
1998, and these products, together with their related options, have been the
largest source of the Company's revenue.

  On May 9, 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") entered
into a License, Development and Marketing Agreement, as amended (the
"Development Agreement"), which provides for the licensing to Microsoft of
certain of the Company's multi-user software enhancements to Microsoft's Windows
NT Server and for the cooperation between the parties for the development of
certain future multi-user versions of Microsoft Windows NT Server, called
Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition.  The Development Agreement also
provides for each party to develop its own enhancements or "plug-ins" to the
jointly developed products which may provide access to the Windows NT Server
Terminal Server Edition base platform from a wide variety of computing devices.
In June 1998, the Company released its MetaFrame product, a Company-developed
plug-in that implements the Independent Computing Architecture (ICA(R)) protocol
on the new platform, which provides Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition
with capabilities similar to those currently offered in the WinFrame product
line. Pursuant to the terms of the Development Agreement, in May 1997, the
Company received an aggregate of $75 million as a non-refundable royalty payment
and for engineering and support services to be rendered by the Company.  Under
the terms of the Development Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive
payments of an additional $100 million, in quarterly payments, a portion of
which has already been received.  In addition, Microsoft and the Company have
agreed to engage in certain joint marketing efforts to promote use of Windows NT
Server-based multi-user software and the Company's ICA protocol.  Additionally,
subject to the terms of the Development Agreement, Microsoft has agreed to
endorse only the Company's ICA protocol as the preferred way to provide multi-
user Windows access for devices, other than Windows client devices until at
least November 1999 and the Company shall be entitled to license its WinFrame
technology based on Windows NT v.3.51 until at least September 30, 2001.

  As a result of the Development Agreement, the Company will continue to support
the Microsoft Windows NT platform but the MetaFrame products and later releases
will no longer incorporate Windows NT technology directly into the Company's
future offerings. The MetaFrame product line was first shipped in June 1998. The
Company plans to continue developing enhancements to its MetaFrame product line
and expects that this product, WinFrame products and associated options and
royalties derived under the terms of the Development Agreement will constitute a
majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future.

  Revenue is recognized when earned.  The Company's revenue recognition policies
are in compliance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Statement of Position 97-2 (as amended by SOP 98-4), "Software Revenue
Recognition." Product revenues are recognized upon shipment only if no
significant Company obligations remain and collection of the resulting
receivable is deemed probable.  The initial fee of $75 million relating to the
Development Agreement is being recognized ratably over the term of the contract,
which is five years.  The additional $100 million due pursuant to the
Development Agreement, as amended, is being recognized ratably over the
remaining term of the contract, effective April 1998.  In the case of non-
cancelable product licensing arrangements under which certain Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEMs) have software reproduction rights, initial recognition of
revenue also requires delivery and customer acceptance of the product 

                                       11
<PAGE>
 
master or first copy. Subsequent recognition of revenues is based upon reported
royalties from the OEMs as well as estimates of royalties due through the
Company's reporting date. Product returns and sales allowances, including stock
rotations, are estimated and provided for at the time of sale. Non-recurring
engineering fees are recognized ratably as the work is performed. Revenues from
training and consulting are recognized when the services are performed. Service
revenues from customer maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product
updates are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically
twelve months. Service revenues, which are immaterial when compared to net
revenues, are included in net revenues on the face of the statement of income.

  The Company has recently acquired or licensed technology that is related to
its strategic objectives. On February 5, 1998, the Company completed its
acquisition of certain of the assets, technology and operations of Insignia
Solutions, plc for approximately $17.5 million. In January 1998, the Company
licensed certain technology from EPiCON, Inc., for approximately $8.0 million.
On June 30, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding securities of APM
Ltd., parent company of Digitivity Inc., for approximately $40.4 million.  In
July 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain technologies from
VDOnet Corporation Ltd. for approximately $8.0 million. These transactions were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting with the purchase price
being principally allocated to purchased technologies and intangible assets.

  These acquisitions and licensing arrangement were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations."  The Company allocated
the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values using valuation methods believed to be
appropriate at the time.  The acquired intangible assets included in-process
technology projects, among other assets, which were related to research and
development that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there
was no alternative future use.  As a result of the SEC's letter to the AICPA
dated September 9, 1998 regarding its views on write-offs of purchased in-
process research and development ("IPR&D"), the Company revised its calculations
of the value of the acquired in-process technology based on adjusted after-tax
cash flows and reduced the amount of the write-offs for purchased IPR&D related
to the Insignia, APM and VDOnet acquisitions to $2.7 million, $10.7 million and
$2.4 million, respectively, and $2.6 million related to the licensing agreement
with EPiCON.  These reductions have been reallocated to other intangible assets.
After giving effect to the re-evaluation, the Company recorded amortization of
intangible assets of $4.2 million and $6.4 million and IPR&D of $2.4 million and
$18.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1998,
respectively, in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements.

  The discussion below relating to the individual financial statement captions,
the Company's overall financial performance, operations and financial position
should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in
"Overview" and "Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results" which, it is
anticipated, will impact the Company's future performance and financial
position.

  Net Revenues.  The increase in net revenues in the third quarter of 1998
compared to the third quarter of 1997 was primarily attributable to revenues
recognized in connection with the shipment of the Company's MetaFrame product,
the inter-operable products associated with the MetaFrame and WinFrame products,
and the recognition of revenue related to the Development Agreement with
Microsoft, which were partially offset by a decline in the volume of shipments
of its WinFrame products. The increase in net revenue in the nine month period
ended September 30, 1998 compared to the nine month period ended September 30,
1997, was primarily attributable to the inter-operable products associated with
the MetaFrame and WinFrame products, revenues recognized in connection with the
shipment of the Company's MetaFrame product, the recognition of revenue related
to the Development Agreement with Microsoft and an increase in the volume of
shipments of its WinFrame products.

  An analysis of Company net revenue is detailed in the table below. Net revenue
is segregated into five main categories: WinFrame-based products, MetaFrame-
based products, Inter-operable products, OEM revenue, Microsoft royalties and
Other revenue. Inter-operable products include additional user licenses as well
as other options, which are applicable to both the MetaFrame and WinFrame
product lines. The OEM revenue consists of license fees and royalties from third
party manufacturers who are granted a license to incorporate and/or market the
Company's multi-user technologies in their own product offerings. Both the
Company's WinFrame/MetaFrame and OEM revenues represent product license fees
based upon the Company's multi-user NT-based technology. Microsoft royalties
represent fees recognized in connection with the Development Agreement (see
discussion above).

  International. International revenues (sales outside of the United States)
accounted for approximately 27% and 18% of net revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. International revenues
accounted for approximately 27% and 17% of net revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

  Cost of Goods Sold.  Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of
royalties, product media and duplication, manuals,  packaging materials and
shipping expense.  Cost of OEM revenues included in cost of goods sold primarily
consists of cost of royalties, except where the OEM elects to purchase shrink-
wrapped products, in which case such costs are as described in the 

                                       13

previous sentence. All development costs incurred in connection with the
Development Agreement are expensed as incurred as a component of cost of goods
sold. Costs associated with non-recurring engineering fees are included in
research and development expenses and are not separately identifiable. All
development costs included in the research and development of software products
and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred.
Consequently, there is no amortization of capitalized research and development
costs included in cost of goods sold.

  Gross Margin.  The increases in gross margin in the three month and the nine
month periods ended September 30, 1998, was primarily attributable to changes in
product mix, representing initial licensing since June 1998, of the MetaFrame
product, which has a higher gross margin percentage, an increase in the volume
of shipments of inter-operable products and different products within the
WinFrame product line.

  Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consisted
primarily of personnel-related costs.  The increases in research and development
expenses in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 1998 as
compared to the prior respective periods, resulted mainly from additional
staffing, associated salaries and related expenses as a result of recent
acquisitions and additional hirings required to expand and enhance the Company's
product lines. These increases were partially offset by the allocation of
certain research and development expenses to cost of goods sold for the portion
of these expenses associated with Development Agreement revenues.

  Sales, Marketing and Support Expenses. The increases in sales, marketing and
support expenses in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 1998 as
compared to the prior respective periods, resulted primarily from increases in
promotional activities, such as advertising literature production and
distribution and trade shows, as well as distributor programs, largely in
connection with the launch of the MetaFrame product.  Sales, marketing and
support staff and associated salaries, commissions and related expenses also
increased, resulting from efforts to expand the Company's product distribution.

  General and Administrative Expenses. The increases in general and
administrative expenses in the three months and nine months ended September 30,
1998 as compared to the prior respective periods, is primarily due to increased
expenses associated with additional staff, associated salaries and related
expenses necessary to support overall increases in the scope of the Company's
operations. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 1998 was
partially offset by a decline in legal fees from the levels incurred in the
previous period, which were high due to the costs associated with non-recurring
contractual negotiations and litigation defense incurred in 1997.

  Amortization of Intangible Assets. The increase in amortization of goodwill
and identifiable intangible assets in the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 1998 as compared to the prior respective periods is due to the
Insignia, APM and VDOnet acquisitions and EPiCON licensing arrangement.  As of
September 30, 1998, after giving effect to the re-evaluation discussed in "--
Overview" and in Note 2 to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements ("Note 2"), the Company had other net intangible assets of $50.6
million, associated with the DataPac Australasia Pty Limited, an October 2, 1997
acquisition, Insignia, APM and VDOnet acquisitions and the EPiCON licensing
arrangement, remaining to be amortized over four years following each of the
transactions.  See "--In-Process Research and Development Expenses."

  In-Process Research and Development Expenses.  During 1998, the Company
completed the acquisition and licensing of certain in-process software
technologies in which it allocated a portion of the purchase price to IPR&D.
The Company allocated $2.7 million, $10.7 million and $2.4 million for IPR&D
related to the Insignia, APM and VDOnet acquisitions, respectively and $2.6
million for IPR&D related to the licensing agreement with EPiCON, after giving
effect to the re-evaluation as further discussed in "--Overview" and in Note 2.

  Since the respective dates of acquisition and licensing, the Company has used
the acquired in-process technology to develop new product offerings, which have
or will become part of the Company's suite of products when completed.

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
Functionality included in products using the acquired in-process technology has
been introduced at various times following the respective transaction dates of
the acquired assets and licensing, and the Company currently expects to complete
the development of the remaining projects at various dates between 1999 and
2000.  Upon completion, the Company offers the related products to its
customers.

   The nature of the efforts required to develop and integrate acquired in-
process technology into commercially viable products or features and
functionalities within the Citrix suite of existing products principally relate
to the completion of all planning, designing and testing activities that are
necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design
requirements, including functions, features and technical performance
requirements. The Company currently expects that products utilizing the acquired
in-process technology will be successfully developed, but there can be no
assurance that commercial viability of any of these products will be achieved.
Furthermore, future developments in the software industry, particularly the 
server-based computing environment, changes in technology, changes in other
products and offerings or other developments may cause the Company to alter or
abandon product plans.

   The fair value of the in-process technology in each acquisition was based on
analyses of the markets, projected cash flows and risks associated with
achieving such projected cash flows.  In developing these cash flow projections,
revenues were estimated based on relevant factors, including aggregate revenue
growth rates for the business as a whole, individual service offering revenues,
characteristics of the potential market for the service offerings and the
anticipated life of the underlying technology. Operating expenses and resulting
profit margins were estimated based on the characteristics and cash flow
generating potential of the acquired in-process research and development, and
included assumptions that certain expenses would decline over time as operating
efficiencies were obtained. The Company assumed material net cash inflows would
commence in 1999 for the Insignia acquisition and EPiCON licensing agreement and
in 2000 for the APM and VDOnet acquisitions.  Appropriate adjustments were made
to operating income to derive net cash flow, and the estimated net cash flows of
the in-process technologies in each acquisition were then discounted to present
value using rates of return that the Company believes reflect the specific
risk/return characteristics of these research and development projects. The
selection of discount rates for application in each acquisition were based on
the consideration of: (i) the weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which
measures a company's cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the
percentage of debt and percentage of equity in its target capital structure;
(ii) the corresponding weighted average return on assets ("WARA") which measures
the after-tax return required on the assets employed in the business weighted by
each asset group's percentage of the total asset portfolio; and (iii) venture
capital required rates of return which typically relate to equity financing for
relatively high-risk  business projects.  The risk adjusted discount rates were
35%, 40%, 50% and 50% for the EPiCON licensing agreement, Insignia, APM and
VDOnet acquisitions, respectively.

   Failure to complete the development of these projects in their entirety, or
in a timely manner, could have a material, adverse impact on the Company's
operating results, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance
can be given that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired
in-process research and development will not deviate from the projections used
to value such technology in connection with each of the respective acquisitions.
Ongoing operations and financial results for acquired assets and licensed
technology, and the Company as a whole, are subject to a variety of factors
which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such transaction, and
the estimates discussed below should not be considered the Company's current
projections for operating results for the acquired assets or licensed technology
or the Company as a whole.

   Revenues attributable to the acquired in-process technology associated with
these acquisitions were assumed to increase depending on the product between the
first one to four years of two to six year projection periods at annual rates
ranging from 20% to 264% before decreasing over the remaining years at rates
ranging from 7% to 68% as other products are released in the marketplace.
Projected annual revenue attributable to the products ranged from approximately
$0.6 million to $74.6 million over the term of the projections. These
projections were based on aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a
whole, 

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
individual product revenues, giving consideration to transaction volumes and
prices, anticipated growth rates for the server-based computing market,
anticipated product development and product introduction cycles, and the
estimated life of the underlying technology. Projected revenues from the in-
process research and development were assumed to peak during periods between
1999 and 2002, depending on the product, and decline from 2000 to 2004 as other
new products are expected to enter the market.

   Gross profit was assumed to increase in the first one to four years of the
projection period, depending on the product, at annual rates ranging from 20% to
266%, decreasing over the remaining years at rates ranging from 7% to 68%
annually, resulting in annual gross profits ranging from approximately $0.6
million to $69.2 million. The gross profit projections assumed a growth rate
approximately the same as the revenue growth rate.

   Operating profit was assumed to increase depending on the product, in the
first one to four years of the projection period at annual rates ranging between
19% and 255%, and decrease over the remaining years at rates between 3% and 75%
annually, resulting in annual operating profits of approximately $0.3 million to
$31.2 million. Operating profit projections assumed a growth rate approximately
the same as the revenue growth rate.

   The Company used discount rates ranging from 35% to 50% for valuing the in-
process research and development acquired in these transactions, which the
Company believes reflected the risk associated with the completion of the
individual research and development projects acquired and the estimated future
economic benefits to be generated subsequent to the projects' completion.

   A description of the in-process research and development and the estimates
made by the Company for EPiCON, Insignia, APM and VDOnet are summarized below.
All of the acquired projects are targeted for the server-based computing market.
After the acquisition or license of each technology, the Company has continued
the development of these in-process projects.

EPiCON

   The in-process research and development acquired in the license of EPiCON
technology consisted of one significant research and development project,
Application Installation Services. This project enables an application to be
installed once on a server and then replicated to all other servers in a server
farm configuration, and is targeted for the server-based computing market. At
the date of licensing, EPiCON was shipping its Windows NT 3.51 version of its
ALTiS application deployment product and was testing its Windows NT 4.0 version.
Neither the Windows NT 3.51 version or the Windows NT 4.0 version of the ALTiS
product was operating in a Citrix MetaFrame or WinFrame environment at the date
of licensing. After licensing the EPiCON technology, the Company continued the
development of this in-process project, which the Company estimated was less
than 60% complete at the date of licensing. The aggregate value assigned to the
in-process research and development was $2.6 million, after giving effect of the
re-evaluation described in "--Overview" and in Note 2. At the time of the
valuation, the expected cost to complete the project was approximately $300,000.
As of September 30, 1998, approximately $275,000 had been incurred since the
date of licensing. The Company estimates that approximately $840,000 will be
required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is
expected to be completed during the first half of 1999. The remaining efforts to
complete the project are primarily the migration of the core processing from the
client environment to the server environment and the integration of such
technology into the Company's MetaFrame and WinFrame products. The research and
development risks associated with this project primarily reside with the
migration of the Application Installation Services technology to the Company's
MetaFrame and WinFrame platforms, which are based on server-based computing
technology.

Insignia

   The in-process research and development acquired in the Insignia acquisition
consisted primarily of one significant research and development project, Keoke,
a video display protocol designed to add performance and bandwidth management
enhancements to ICA in WinFrame and MetaFrame software. The Company estimated
this project was less than 40% complete at the date of acquisition. The
aggregate value assigned to in-process research and development was $2.7
million, after giving effect to the re-evaluation discussed in "--Overview" and
in Note 2. At the date of the valuation, the expected cost to complete the Keoke
and other projects related to the acquisition was approximately $1.9 million. As
of September 30, 1998, approximately $500,000 had been incurred since the date
of acquisition. The Company estimates that approximately $800,000 will be
required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is
expected to be completed by the end of 1999. The remaining efforts to complete
the project are primarily the utilization of performance enhancements and
algorithmic methodologies of the Keoke protocol to create similar improvements
in the Company's Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol. The research
and development risks associated with this project primarily relate to the
integration of key performance features of Keoke into the Company's ICA
protocol.

APM

   The in-process research and development acquired in the APM acquisition
consisted primarily of one significant research and development project. The
project is a Windows NT-based application server for Java, which is similar to
WinFrame software, but actually runs Java applications. At the date of the
acquisition, APM was shipping a secure server-based enterprise solution that
helped companies deploy and manage intranet and Internet-based Java
applications. The Company estimated this project was less than 45% complete at
the date of acquisition. The aggregate value assigned to the in-process research
and development was $10.7 million, after giving effect to the re-evaluation
discussed in "--Overview" and in Note 2. At the time of the valuation, the
expected cost to complete the project was approximately $8.0 million. As of
September 30, 1998, approximately $760,000 had been incurred since the date of
acquisition. The Company estimates that approximately $4.8 million will be
required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is
expected to be completed in 2000. The remaining effort to complete the project
is primarily the utilization of acquired technology to develop an application
server for Java that would operate in a MetaFrame and WinFrame environment. The
research and development risks associated with this project relate primarily to
updating the acquired technology to be compatible with Sun Microsystems' Java
2.0, integrating and porting such technology into a variety of server-based
computing environments.

VDOnet

   The in-process research and development acquired in the VDOnet acquisition
consisted primarily of one significant research and development project, ICA
video services. This project allows video applications and applications
containing video to be viewed on an ICA client, and is targeted for the server-
based computing market. At the date of acquisition, VDOnet was shipping a
client/server video streaming product. The product operated in a client/server
environment but was not operational in a Citrix MetaFrame or WinFrame
environment. After acquiring VDOnet, the Company continued the development of
this in-process project, which the Company estimates was less than 65% complete
at the date of acquisition. The aggregate value assigned to the in-process
research and development was $2.4 million, after giving effect to the 
re-evaluation discussed in "--Overview" and in Note 2. At the time of the
valuation, the expected cost to complete the project was approximately $200,000.
As of September 30, 1998, approximately $350,000 had been incurred since the
date of acquisition. The Company estimates that approximately $2.5 million will
be required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is
expected to be completed in 2000. The remaining effort to complete the project
is primarily the utilization of acquired technology to develop a video server
that will provide video applications to an ICA client. The research and
development risks associated with this project relate primarily to integrating
this product into a server-based computing environment.

                                       17

   There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional charges
in subsequent periods to reflect costs associated with these transactions or
that the Company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further
develop these technologies.

   Interest Income, Net.  Interest income, net, increased during the nine months
ended September 30, 1998 compared to the respective period in the prior year
primarily due to interest income earned on additional cash generated from the
receipt of an initial license fee under the terms of the Development Agreement.

  Income Taxes.  The Company's effective tax rate amounted to 36% for the three
months and nine months ended September 30, 1998 and 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  During the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the Company's activities
resulted in positive operating cash flows of approximately $60.4 million, which
includes cash used to purchase and license in-process research and development
of $18.4 million. These amounts were also affected by an increase in trade
receivables during the period.  During the same period, the Company also
recognized tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock options and
disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of approximately $14.7
million.  The Company purchased and sold short-term investments for
approximately $155.1 million and $159.3 million, respectively, during the nine
months ended September 30, 1998.  Additionally, the Company expended
approximately $11.2 million in the same period for the purchase of leasehold
improvements and equipment.  These capital expenditures were primarily
associated with the Company's expansion into new facilities.

  As of September 30, 1998, the Company had approximately $133.1 million in cash
and cash equivalents, $84.9 million in short-term investments and $219.0 million
of working capital.  The Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments are invested in investment grade, interest-bearing securities to
minimize interest rate risk and allow for flexibility in the event of immediate
cash needs. At September 30, 1998, the Company had approximately $33.1 million
in trade receivables, net of allowances, and $75.7 million of deferred revenues,
of which the Company anticipates $36.6 million will be earned over the next
twelve months.
 
  The Company believes existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

  The Company paid cash amounting to approximately $3,000 in lieu of fractional
shares in connection with its three-for-two stock split effected February 20,
1998.  The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Common
Stock in the foreseeable future.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure and Related Information

  Until recently, many computer programs were written using two digits rather
than four digits to define the applicable year in the twentieth century.  Such
software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year
2000.  The consequences of this issue may include systems failures and business
process interruption to the extent companies fail to upgrade, replace or
otherwise address year 2000 problems.  The year 2000 problem may also result in
additional business and competitive differentiation.  Aside from the well-known
calculation problems with the use of 2-digit date formats as the year changes
from 1999 to 2000, the year 2000 is a special case leap year. As a result,
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential
impact of the year 2000 problem.

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
  The Company believes that it has four general areas of potential exposure with
respect to the year 2000 problem: (1) its own software products; (2) its
internal information systems; (3) computer hardware and other equipment related
systems; and (4) the effects of third party compliance efforts.

  The Company's existing principal software product lines consist of WinFrame
and MetaFrame.  The Company's WinFrame product line is an authorized extension
to Microsoft Windows NT, v.3.51.  The Company's MetaFrame product line adds
additional functionality to Microsoft's Windows NT Server, Terminal Server
Edition.  Customers can obtain current information about the year 2000
compliance of the Company's products from the Company's web site. Information on
the Company's web site is provided to customers for the sole purpose of
assisting in planning for the transition to the year 2000.  Such information is
the most currently available concerning the behavior of the Company's products
in the next century and is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

  While the Company believes that the current versions of its WinFrame and
MetaFrame products are currently capable of storing four-digit year data,
allowing applications to differentiate between dates from the 1900s and the year
2000 and beyond, potential incompatibility with two-digit application programs
may limit the Company's sales of product in those situations.  Further,
notwithstanding the operating system's ability to store four-digit year data, it
is typically the application's function to collect and properly store date data.
There can be no assurance that the Company's products will not be integrated by
the Company or its customers with, or otherwise interact with, non-year 2000
compliant software or other products which may malfunction and expose the
Company to claims from its customers or other third parties.  The foregoing
could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the Company's
products and services, increased service costs to the Company or payment by the
Company of compensatory or other damages.  Although the Company believes that
many Windows applications do store four-digit year dates today, it is possible
that some applications are now or have historically only collected two-digit
year data, and in such cases WinFrame cannot create four-digit year data for
applications which have collected only two digits in year fields.  Further,
there can be no assurance that the Company's software products that are designed
to be year 2000 compliant contain all necessary technology to make them year
2000 compliant.  If any of the Company's licensees experience year 2000
problems, such licensees could assert claims for damages against the Company.

  With respect to internal information systems, the Company has commenced, but
has not yet completed, a testing and compliance program to identify any year
2000 problems.  An audit will be conducted to identify all business critical
applications and responses sought from vendors as to whether the application is
compliant or not and what plans they have in place to ensure compliance before
December 1,1999.

  The third type of potential year 2000 exposure relates to the Company's
computer hardware and other equipment related systems including such equipment
as the Company's workstations, phone systems, security systems and elevator
systems. The Company is in the early stages of identifying and evaluating such
systems' year 2000 exposure. Due to the early stage of analysis with respect to
the Company's computer hardware and other equipment related systems, the Company
cannot yet estimate the costs involved, although the Company does not expect
such costs to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

  The fourth aspect of the Company's year 2000 analysis involves evaluating the
year 2000 efforts of third parties, including critical suppliers and other
strategic relationships.  The Company intends to contact critical suppliers and
other strategic relationships through written and/or telephone inquiries. The
Company is conducting such inquiries with existing personnel and does not expect
the costs of such inquiries to be material. If the Company determines, after
conducting the aforementioned survey, that the year 2000 exposure of any
critical suppliers or other strategic relationships could result in material
disruptions to their respective businesses, the Company may develop appropriate
contingency plans. Further, if certain critical third party providers, such as
those supplying outsourced manufacturing, electricity, water, or
telecommunications services, experience difficulties resulting in a material
interruption of services to the Company, such interruption would likely result
in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations
and financial condition.

                                       19

  To date, the Company has not incurred any material expenditure in connection
with identifying or evaluating year 2000 compliance issues.  The Company
estimates it will not incur any material levels of expenditure on this issue
during 1998 and 1999 to support its compliance initiatives.  Most of these
expenses have been, and in the future are expected to be, related to the
opportunity costs of employees evaluating the Company's financial and accounting
software, the current versions of the Company's products, and year 2000
compliance matters generally. The Company believes that it is unlikely to
experience a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of
operations due to year 2000 compliance issues. However, since the assessment
process is ongoing, year 2000 complications are not fully known, and potential
liability issues are not clear, the full potential impact of the year 2000 on
the Company is not known at this time.

  As the Company has recently replaced its fundamental financial and accounting
software, no significant problems are anticipated which would result in either
the delay or the inability to process accounting and financial data. If the
audit of the other software applications used by Company lead to the discovery
of further year 2000 compliance issues, the Company intends to evaluate the need
for one or more contingency plans relating to such issues.

  The Company's expectations as to the extent and timeliness of modifications
required in order to achieve year 2000 compliance is a forward-looking statement
subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary materially as a
result of a number of factors, including, among others, those described in this
paragraph. There can be no assurance however, that the Company will be able to
successfully modify on a timely basis such products, services and systems to
comply with year 2000 requirements, which failure could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's operating results.  Further, while the Company believes
that its year 2000 compliance efforts will be completed on a timely basis, and
in advance of the year 2000 date transition, there can be no assurance that
unexpected delays or problems, including the failure to ensure year 2000
compliance by systems or products supplied to the Company by a third party, will
not have an adverse effect on the Company, its financial performance, or the
competitiveness or customer acceptance of its products. Further, the Company's
current understanding of expected costs is subject to change as the project
progresses and does not include potential costs related to actual customer
claims, or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal
course of business unless such installation has been accelerated to provide
solutions to year 2000 compliance issues.


European Monetary Union

  On January 1, 1999 eleven of the existing members of the European Union (the
"EU") will join the European Monetary Union (the "EMU").  This will lead, among
many other things, to fundamental changes in the way participating EU states
implement their monetary policies and manage local currency exchange rates.
Ultimately, there will be a single currency within certain countries of the EU,
known as the Euro and one organization, the European Central Bank, responsible
for setting European monetary policy.  While some believe that the change will
bring a higher level of competition within Europe and a greater sense of
economic stability within that region, there is no certainty that the Company's
activity in this region will necessarily realize any benefits as a result of
such changes. The Company has reviewed the impact the Euro will have on its
business and whether this will give rise to a need for significant changes in
its' commercial operations or treasury management functions.  While it is
uncertain whether there will be any immediate direct benefits from the planned
conversion, the Company believes it is properly prepared to accommodate any
changes deemed necessary after January 1, 1999 without any significant changes
to its current commercial operations, treasury management and management
information systems.

Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results

  The Company does not provide financial performance forecasts.  The Company's
operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the
future vary significantly depending on a number of factors.  Except for the
historical information contained herein, the matters contained in this report
include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  The
following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and
presented elsewhere by management from time to time.  Such factors, among
others, may have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, results
of operations and financial condition.

  Reliance Upon Strategic Relationship with Microsoft.  Microsoft is the leading
provider of desktop operating systems.  The Company is dependent upon the
license of certain key technology from Microsoft, including certain source and
object code licenses, technical support and other materials.  The Company is
also dependent on its strategic alliance agreement with Microsoft which provides
for cooperation in the development of  technologies for advanced operating
systems, and the promotion of advanced Windows application program interfaces.
On May 9, 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into a License, Development
and Marketing Agreement, as amended (the "Development Agreement"), which
provides for the licensing to Microsoft of certain of the Company's multi-user
software enhancements to Microsoft's Windows NT Server and for the cooperation
between the parties for the development of certain future multi-user versions of
Microsoft Windows NT Server, known as the Windows NT Server, Terminal Server
Edition.  The Development Agreement also provides for each party to develop its
own enhancements or "plug-ins" to the jointly developed products which may
provide access to the Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition base platform
from a wide variety of computing devices. In June 1998, the Company released its
MetaFrame product, a Company-developed plug-in that implements the Independent
Computing Architecture (ICA(R)) protocol on the new platform, that provides
capabilities similar to those currently offered in the WinFrame product line.
Pursuant to the terms of the Development Agreement, in May 1997 the Company
received an aggregate of $75 million as a non-refundable royalty payment and for
engineering and support services to be rendered by the Company. Under the terms
of the Development Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive payments of an
additional $100 million, in quarterly payments, a portion of which has already
been received.  In addition, Microsoft and the Company have agreed to engage in
certain joint marketing efforts to promote use of Windows NT Server-based multi-
user software and the Company's ICA protocol.  Additionally, subject to the
terms of the Development Agreement, Microsoft has agreed to endorse only the
Company's ICA protocol as the preferred way to provide multi-user Windows access
for devices other than Windows client devices, until at least November 1999 and
the Company shall be entitled to license its WinFrame technology based on
Windows NT v.3.51 until at least September 30, 2001.

  The Company's relationship with Microsoft is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties.  First, the Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition based
platforms will allow Microsoft to create products that may be competitive with
the Company's current WinFrame and MetaFrame products.  Second, as stated above,
Microsoft has agreed to endorse only the Company's ICA protocol as the preferred
method to provide multi-user Windows access for devices other than Windows
clients until at least November 1999.  Subsequent to November 1999, or before
such date upon the occurrence of certain events contemplated by the Development
Agreement, it is possible that Microsoft will market or endorse other methods to
provide non-Windows client devices multi-user Windows access.  Third, the
Company's ability to successfully commercialize its MetaFrame product will be
dependent on Microsoft's ability to market and sell its Windows NT Server,
Terminal Server Edition products.  Finally, there may be delays in the release
and shipment of future releases of Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition.
Microsoft's distributors and resellers are not within the control of the Company
and, to the Company's knowledge, are not obligated to purchase products from
Microsoft.  Additionally, the Company may hire additional development, marketing
and support staff to the extent they are needed in order to fulfill the
Company's responsibilities under the terms of the Development Agreement.
Further, if Microsoft (1) develops competitive plug-in products, (2) endorses
other methods to provide non-Windows client devices multi-user Windows access,
(3) is unable to successfully market and sell the Windows NT Server, Terminal
Server 

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
Edition products, or (4) encounters delays in the release and shipment of
future releases of Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition, the Company's
business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

  Dependence Upon Broad-Based Acceptance of ICA Protocol.  The Company believes
that its success in the markets in which it competes will depend upon its
ability to cause broad-based acceptance of its ICA protocol as an emerging
standard for supporting distributed Windows applications, thereby creating
demand for its server products.

  Dependence Upon Strategic Relationships.  In addition to its relationship with
Microsoft, the Company has relationships with NCD, Tektronix, Wyse and others.
The Company is dependent on its strategic partners to successfully incorporate
the Company's technology into their products and to successfully market and sell
such products.

  Competition.  The markets in which the Company competes are intensely
competitive.  Most of the competitors and potential competitors, including
Microsoft, have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing
and other resources than the Company.  Additionally, the announcement of the
release, and the actual release of products competitive to the Company's
existing and future product lines, such as Microsoft's Windows NT Server,
Terminal Server Edition and related plug-ins, could cause existing and potential
customers of the Company to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of the
Company's existing and future product offerings, which would adversely impact
its net revenues, operating results and financial condition.  Further, the
Company's ability to market ICA, MetaFrame and other future product offerings
will be dependent on Microsoft's licensing and pricing scheme to allow client
devices implementing ICA, MetaFrame or any such future product offerings to
attach to the Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition.

  Dependence on Proprietary Technology.  The Company relies primarily on a
combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary
rights.  Despite the Company's precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized
third parties to copy certain portions of the Company's products or to obtain
and use information regarded as proprietary.  Additionally, the laws of some
foreign countries do not protect the Company's intellectual property to the same
extent as do the laws of the United States and Canada.  There can be no
assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the
Company in the future or that any such assertion will not result in costly
litigation or require the Company to obtain a license to intellectual property
rights of such third parties.  In addition, there can be no assurance that such
licenses will be available on reasonable terms or at all, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and
financial condition.

  Product Concentration.  The Company anticipates that its MetaFrame and
WinFrame product lines will constitute a majority of its revenues for the
foreseeable future.  The Company's ability to generate revenue from its
MetaFrame product will be highly dependent on market acceptance of Windows NT
Server, Terminal Server Edition products, with which its product is intended to
be combined to provide capabilities similar to those currently offered in the
WinFrame technology line.  The Company expects that revenue from the MetaFrame-
based products will constitute an increasing percentage of total revenue in the
foreseeable future and that the revenue from WinFrame-based products will
decrease over time as percentage of total revenue.  The Company may experience
declines in demand for products based on WinFrame technology, whether as a
result of new competitive product releases, price competition, lack of success
of its strategic partners, technological change or other factors.  In addition,
the introduction of products based upon the MetaFrame technology may be
competitive with the Company's WinFrame product line and may delay or replace
orders of either technology.

  Management of Growth and Anticipated Operating Expenses.  The Company has
recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations, the number of
its employees, and the geographic area of its operations.  In addition, the
Company has completed certain international acquisitions since October 1997, and
assimilating the operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed
and may continue to place a significant strain on the Company's managerial,
operational and financial resources.  To manage its growth effectively, the
Company will be required to continue to implement and improve additional

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
management and financial systems and controls, and to expand, train and manage
its employee base.  Although the Company believes that it has made adequate
allowances for the costs and risks associated with these expansions, there can
be no assurance that the Company's systems, procedures or controls will be
adequate to support the Company's current or future operations or that Company
management will be able to effectively manage this expansion and still achieve
the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market opportunity for the
Company's products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner.  The
Company's future operating results will also depend on its ability to manage its
expanding product line, expand its sales and marketing organizations, and expand
its support organization commensurate with the increasing base of its installed
products.  If the Company is unable to manage growth effectively or unable to
achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market window for the
Company's products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

  Additionally, the Company expects that its requirements for office facilities
and equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate.  The Company plans to
increase its professional staff during 1998 and 1999 as sales, marketing and
support and product development efforts as well as associated administrative
systems are implemented to support planned growth.  As a result of this planned
growth in staff, the Company believes that additional facilities will be
required during 1998 and 1999. Although the Company believes that the cost of
expanding in such additional facilities will not significantly impact its
financial position or results of operations, the Company anticipates that
operating expenses will increase during 1998 as a result of its planned growth
in staff and that such increase may reduce its income from operations and cash
flows from operating activities in 1998 and 1999.

  Year 2000. Until recently, many computer programs were written using two
digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year in the twentieth
century.  Such software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than the year 2000.  The consequences of this issue may include systems failures
and business process interruption to the extent companies fail to upgrade,
replace or otherwise address year 2000 problems.  The year 2000 problem may also
result in additional business and competitive differentiation.  Aside from the
well-known calculation problems with the use of 2-digit date formats as the year
changes from 1999 to 2000, the year 2000 is a special case leap year and in many
organizations using older technology, dates were used for special programmatic
functions. As a result, significant uncertainty exists in the software industry
concerning the potential impact of the year 2000 problem. The Company believes
that it has four general areas of potential exposure with respect to the year
2000 problem: (1) its own software products; (2) its internal information
systems; (3) computer hardware and other equipment related systems; and (4) the
effects of third party compliance efforts. The Company has not yet completed its
assessment of the Year 2000 compliance issues with respect to all of these
areas. Since the year 2000 complications are not fully known, there can be no
assurance that potential year 2000 problems will not result in the Company's
business, results of operations and financial condition being materially
adversely affected.

  Information Systems Conversion.  The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
all utilize separate applications to process their accounting transactions.  As
a result, the Company and its subsidiaries are currently in the process of
converting a significant part of its business operations to a single accounting
application purchased from a third-party vendor.  Although the Company believes
it has addressed all the significant issues related to this conversion, there
can be no assurance that unanticipated software and hardware problems will not
arise, which may result in delays in customer billings and vendor payments, as
well as extended accounts receivable payment cycles.

  Dependence on Key Personnel.  The Company's success will depend, in large
part, upon the services of a number of key employees.  The effective management
of the Company's anticipated growth will depend, in large part, upon the
Company's ability to retain its highly skilled technical, managerial and
marketing personnel as well as its ability to attract and maintain replacements
for and additions to such personnel in the future.

                                       23

  New Products and Technological Change.  The markets for the Company's products
are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving
industry standards, changes in end-user requirements and frequent new product
introductions and enhancements, including enhancements to certain key technology
licensed from Microsoft.  The Company believes it will incur additional costs
and royalties associated with the development, licensing, or acquisition of new
technologies or enhancements to existing products which will increase the
Company's cost of goods sold and operating expenses.  To the extent that such
transactions have not yet occurred, the Company cannot currently quantify such
increase.  The Company may use a substantial portion of its cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments to fund these additional costs, in which
case, the Company's interest income will decrease if not offset by cash flows
from future operations.  Additionally, the Company and others may announce new
products, new MetaFrame capabilities or technologies that could replace or
shorten the life cycle of the Company's existing product offerings.  These
market characteristics will require the Company to continuously enhance its
current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with
technological developments and respond to evolving end-user requirements.  The
Company may hire additional development staff to the extent they are needed in
order to fulfill the Company's responsibilities under the terms of the
Development Agreement.  To the extent the Company is unable to add additional
staff and resources in its development efforts, future enhancements and
additional features to its existing or future products may be delayed, which may
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations
and financial condition.
 
  Potential for Undetected Errors.  Despite significant testing by the Company
and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products
until after commencement of commercial shipments.  Additionally, third party
products, upon which the Company's products are dependent, may contain defects,
which could reduce the performance of the Company's products or render them
useless.

  Reliance Upon Indirect Distribution Channels and Major Distributors.  The
Company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the
marketing and distribution of its products.  The Company's distributors and
resellers are not within the control of the Company, are not obligated to
purchase products from the Company, and may also represent other lines of
products.

  Need to Expand Channels of Distribution.  The Company intends to leverage its
relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to
encourage these parties to recommend or distribute the Company's products.  In
addition, an integral part of the Company's strategy is to expand its direct
sales force and add third-party distributors both domestically and
internationally.  The Company is currently investing, and intends to continue to
invest, significant resources to develop these channels, which could adversely
affect the Company's operating margins and related cash flows from operating
activities.

  Revenue Recognition Process.  The Company continually re-evaluates its
programs, including specific license terms and conditions, to market its various
current and future products and services.  The Company may implement new
programs which may include, among other things, specified and unspecified
enhancements to its current and future product lines.  Revenues associated with
such enhancements may be recognized after the initial shipment or licensing of
the software product or may be recognized over the product's life cycle.  The
timing of the implementation of such programs, the timing of the release of such
enhancements as well as factors such as determining vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value of each element offered separately and whether upgrades
and enhancements are defined as upgrade rights pursuant to Statement of Position
(SOP) 97-2 will impact the timing of the Company's recognition of revenues and
related expenses associated with its products, related enhancements and
services.  Because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of the re-
evaluation of its programs, the determination of vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value and whether upgrades and enhancements will be defined as
upgrade rights pursuant to SOP 97-2, and its impact on revenue recognition, the
Company cannot currently quantify the impact of such re-evaluation on its
business, results of operations and financial condition.

                                       24

  Product Returns and Price Reductions.  The Company provides most of its
distributors with product return rights for stock balancing or limited product
evaluation.  The Company also provides most of its distributors with price
protection rights.  The Company has established reserves for each of these
circumstances where appropriate, based on historical trends and evaluation of
current circumstances.  Although the Company believes that it has adequate
reserves to cover product returns, there can be no assurance that the Company
will not experience significant returns in the future or that such reserves will
be adequate.

  International Operations. The Company's continued growth and profitability
will require expansion of its international operations.  To successfully expand
international sales, the Company will need to establish additional foreign
operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international
resellers.  Such international operations are subject to certain risks, such as
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, dependence on
independent relicensors, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements, variability of
foreign economic and political conditions and changing restrictions imposed by
regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by United States
export laws, costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign
countries, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax
consequences, including restrictions on repatriation of earnings and the burdens
of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

  Fluctuations in Economic and Market Conditions.  The demand for the Company's
products depends in part upon the general demand for computer hardware and
software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending
levels and general economic conditions.

  Growth Rate.  The Company's revenue growth rate in the current year may not
approach the levels attained in 1997 and 1996, which were high, due primarily to
the increased market acceptance of WinFrame software during that period.
However, to the extent the Company's revenue growth continues, the Company
believes that its cost of goods sold and certain operating expenses will also
increase.  Due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses,
together with the possibility of slower revenue growth, the Company's income
from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may
decrease in the current year.

  Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results.  The Company's quarterly
operating results have in the past varied and may in the future vary
significantly depending on factors such as the success of the Company's WinFrame
or MetaFrame products, the size, timing and recognition of revenue from
significant orders, increased competition, the proportion of revenues derived
from distributors, OEMs and other channels, changes in the Company's pricing
policies or those of its competitors, the financial stability of major
customers, problems caused by year 2000 complications, new product introductions
or enhancements by competitors and partners, delays in the introduction of
products or product enhancements by the Company or by competitors and partners,
customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products, market
acceptance of new products, or new versions of existing products, the timing and
nature of sales and marketing expenses (such as trade shows and other
promotions), other changes in operating expenses, changes in the allocation of
amounts paid for purchases of businesses and licensing of technology to in-
process research and development, personnel changes (including the addition of
personnel), foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions.
The Company operates with little order backlog because its software products
typically are shipped shortly after orders are received.  In addition, like many
systems level software companies, the Company has often recognized a substantial
portion of its revenues in the last month of a quarter with these revenues
frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of the quarter.  As a result,
the product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked
and shipped in that quarter, and revenues for any future quarter are not
predictable with any degree of certainty.  Any significant deferral of purchases
of the Company's products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular
quarter, and to the extent significant sales occur earlier than expected,
operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected.  Royalty
and license revenues are impacted by fluctuations in OEM licensing activity and
certain end user licensing and deployment activity from quarter to quarter
because initial license fees generally are recognized upon customer acceptance
and continuing royalty and subsequent 

                                       25
<PAGE>
 
ongoing license revenues are recognized when the amount of such licensing
activity can be reasonably determined. The Company's expense levels are based,
in part, on its expectations as to future orders and sales, and the Company may
be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any sales
shortfall. If sales are below expectations, operating results are likely to be
adversely affected. Net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction
in sales because a significant portion of the Company's expenses do not vary
with revenues. The Company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending
in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. In particular,
if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other
competitive factors require the Company to invest significantly greater
resources in research and development efforts, the Company's operating margins
in the future may be adversely affected.

  Uncertainty as to IPR&D Valuation.  With respect to the statements made
regarding the adjustment of amounts previously charged to in-process research
and development, the amount and rate of amortization of such amounts included in
this report are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including,
without limitation, the effects of any changes in accounting standards or
guidance adopted by the SEC or the accounting profession.   In the event of any
changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the SEC, such changes may
materially affect future results of operations through increased amortization
expense.

  Because of these factors, the Company believes that period-to-period
comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.  Due to all of
the foregoing factors, it is likely that in some future quarter the Company's
operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors.  In such event, the price of the Company's Common Stock would likely
be materially adversely affected.
