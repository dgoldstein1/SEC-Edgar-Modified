ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

        PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

        On November 23, 1999, Intuit Inc. ( the "Company" or "Intuit") announced
its financial results for fiscal quarter ended October 31, 1999.

        Intuit reported revenue of $163.1 million for its first quarter 2000, an
increase of 46% over the same quarter a year ago. Revenue from CRI, the payroll
processing company acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, was included
in these results but not in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Excluding this
revenue, Intuit posted a 38% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Strong market demand for QuickBooks, sales from the launches of new versions of
Quicken and continued growth in Internet-based revenue were largely responsible
for this growth.

        The Company reported a net loss for the quarter of $61.7 million, or
$0.33 per share, consistent with Intuit's seasonal revenue pattern which
produces lower revenue and profits outside of the tax season. This quarter
included an unrealized loss on the Company's investment in Excite@Home of
approximately $17.3 million resulting from the re-measurement of this marketable
security. The results for the same fiscal quarter last year reflected a net loss
of $49.2 million, or $0.28 per share. All per share figures reflect the 3-for-1
stock split effective September 30, 1999.
