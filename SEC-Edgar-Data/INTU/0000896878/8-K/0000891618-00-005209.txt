ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

        PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

        On November 21, 2000, Intuit Inc. (the "Company" or "Intuit") announced
its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2000.

        Intuit reported revenue of $187.5 million for its first quarter of
fiscal 2001, an increase of 6% compared to $176.9 million in the same quarter a
year ago. The Company reported a net loss for the quarter of $33.8 million, or
$0.16 per share, which included net pre-tax losses on marketable securities and
other investments of $3.9 million. It also included the cumulative effects of
changes in accounting for derivatives, net of taxes, of approximately $14.3
million. These results are consistent with Intuit's seasonal pattern that
produces lower revenue and typically losses outside of the tax season. In the
year ago quarter Intuit reported a net loss of $65.9 million, or $0.33 per
share, which included $17.3 million in net pre-tax losses on marketable
securities and other investments.

(i)  This statement of operations information for the three month periods ended
     October 31, 1999 and 2000 is for illustrative purposes only and is not
     prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It
     shows the operating results of the Company, excluding acquisition related
     charges of $40.8 million and $42.7 million for the three month periods
     ended October 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively. The three month period ended
     October 31, 1999 excludes reorganization costs of $3.5 million. The three
     month periods ended October 31, 1999 and 2000 excludes losses on marketable
     securities and other investments, net, of $17.3 million and $3.9 million,
     respectively. The three month period ended October 31, 2000 excludes
     cumulative gains from the effect of an accounting change, net of taxes, of
     $14.3 million. Assuming no additional acquisitions and no impairment of
     value resulting in an acceleration of amortization, pre-tax amortization of
     acquisition related charges will be approximately $178.7 million, $176.4
     million, $152.3 million and $73.0 million for the years ending July 31,
     2001 through 2004, respectively.
