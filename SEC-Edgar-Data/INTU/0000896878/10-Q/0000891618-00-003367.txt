INTUIT INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company

Intuit Inc. develops, sells and supports small business accounting, tax
preparation and consumer finance desktop software products, financial supplies
(such as computer checks, envelopes and invoices), mortgage loans and
Internet-based products and services for individuals, small businesses, and
financial professionals. Our products and services are designed to automate
commonly performed financial tasks and to simplify the way our customers manage
their finances. We sell our products throughout North America and in many
international markets. Sales are made primarily through retail and OEM
distribution channels, traditional direct sales to customers and via the
Internet.

Basis of Presentation

Intuit has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial statements. We have included all adjustments considered
necessary to give a fair presentation of our operating results for the periods
shown. Results for the nine months ended April 30, 2000 do not necessarily
indicate the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2000 or
any other future period. All financial statements presented are restated to
include the results of our Rock Financial Corporation ("Rock") and Title Source,
Inc. ("Title Source") subsidiaries which were acquired on December 8, 1999 in a
transaction which was accounted for as a pooling of interests. These statements
and accompanying notes should be read together with the audited consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1999 included in
Intuit's Form 10K-A, Amendment No. 1, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Principles of Consolidation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include all of our accounts and
those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in which management intends
to maintain more than a temporary 20% to 50% interest, or otherwise has the
ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity
method. Investments in which we have less than a 20% interest and/or do not have
the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost
or estimated realizable value.

Use of Estimates

To comply with generally accepted accounting principles, we make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
disclosures made in the accompanying notes. Our most significant estimates are
related to reserves for product returns and exchanges, reserves for rebates and
the collectability of accounts receivable. We also use estimates to determine
the remaining economic lives and carrying value of goodwill, purchased
intangibles, and fixed assets. Despite our intention to establish accurate
estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.

Net Revenue

Intuit recognizes revenue upon shipment of our shrink-wrapped products based on
"FOB shipping" terms. Because, under FOB shipping terms, title and risk of loss
are transferred, and we have no continuing obligations, once our products are
delivered to the shipper, we recognize revenue upon shipment, net of reserves
based on historical experience. To recognize revenue, it must be probable that
we will collect the accounts receivable from our customers. Reserves are
provided for returns of excess quantities of current product versions, as well
as previous versions of products still in the distribution channel when new
versions are launched. In some situations, we receive advance payments from our
customers. Revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until the
products are shipped or services are provided. We also reduce revenue by the
estimated cost of rebates when products are shipped. Warranty reserves are
provided at the time revenue is recognized for the estimated cost of replacing
defective products.



                                      -6-
<PAGE>   7

We recognize revenue from Internet products and services when that revenue is
"earned" based on the nature of the particular product or service. For Internet
products and services that are provided over a period of time, revenue is
recognized pro rata based on the passage of the contractual time period during
which the product or service is to be provided or in accordance with agreed upon
performance criteria. However, where the Internet product or service is to be
delivered or provided at one point in time, revenue is recognized immediately
upon delivery of the product or completion of the service, rather than over
time. For example, we earn advertising revenues from third parties that
advertise on certain of our websites and contract to run such advertisements for
a particular period of time. In that case, the associated advertising revenue is
recognized ratably over the contractual time period during which the advertising
is to be placed. By contrast, for on-line transactions for which we receive a
payment, revenue is recognized upon completion of the transaction, assuming
there are no remaining obligations on our part. To recognize revenue, it must be
probable that we will collect the accounts receivable from our customers.

Intuit also offers several plans under which customers are charged for technical
support assistance. Fees charged for these plans are collected in advance and
are recognized as revenue over a period of time (generally one year) at a rate
that is based on historical call volumes for support, which approximates when
these services are performed. Costs incurred for fee for support plans are
included in cost of goods sold.

We defer loan origination revenue and associated incremental direct costs on
loans held for sale until the related loan is sold. We recognize gains and
losses on loans at the time we sell them, based upon the difference between the
selling price and the carrying value of the related loans sold. We recognize
loan servicing revenue as the related principal is collected. We recognize
interest income on mortgage loans as it is earned, and we recognize interest
expenses on related borrowings as we incur them.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and technical support costs include the costs associated with
performing order processing, answering customer inquiries and providing
technical assistance by telephone, fax, email, and the Internet. In connection
with the sale of certain products, Intuit provides limited free telephone
support service to customers. This free service, also referred to as
post-contract customer support, is included in this expense category. We do not
defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products,
since the cost of providing this free support is insignificant. The support is
provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and
enhancements are minimal and infrequent. The estimated cost of providing this
free support is accrued upon product shipment.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Intuit considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Both cash equivalents and
short-term investments are considered available-for-sale securities and are
carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Available-for-sale
securities are classified as current assets based upon our intent and ability to
use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant
short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal and
cyclical nature of our business. Based on our significant business seasonality,
cash flow requirements within quarters may fluctuate dramatically and could
require us to use a significant amount of the cash investments held as
available-for-sale securities.

Marketable Securities

As explained in greater detail below, we currently hold several marketable
securities, most of which we acquired in connection with strategic business
transactions and relationships. Our available for sale marketable securities are
carried at fair value and we include unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, in
stockholders' equity. We have designated our investments in At Home Corporation
("At Home") and VeriSign as trading securities and fluctuations in the market
value of these shares are reported in net income. We held the following
marketable securities at July 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000:

In connection with At Home Corporation's acquisition of Excite in May 1999, our
shares of Excite were converted into At Home common stock. We have elected to
report these converted At Home shares as a trading security. As a result, we are
reporting both positive and negative fluctuations in the market value of this
stock in net income. At April 30, 2000, we owned approximately 1.9 million
shares (or approximately 0.4%) of At Home common stock and reported a realized
valuation loss of approximately $53.5 million for these securities for the
period between August 1, 1999 and April 30, 2000. The closing price of At Home
(symbol ATHM) at April 30, 2000, was $18.625 per share. The average daily
closing price of At Home between August 1, 1999 and April 30, 2000 was $38.18
per share.

In January 1997, we sold our online banking and bill payment transaction
processing business to Checkfree Corporation. We obtained marketable securities
in Checkfree as a result of this sale. We account for the investment in
Checkfree as an available-for-sale equity security, which accordingly is carried
at market value. Checkfree common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol CKFR. The closing price of Checkfree common stock at April 30,
2000 was $50.8125 per share. At April 30, 2000, we held 4.7 million shares, or
approximately 8.1%, of Checkfree's outstanding common stock.

In August 1999, we acquired 729,165 shares of common stock of Homestore.com,
Inc. ("Homestore.com") upon conversion of our preferred shares in connection

National Market under the symbol HOMS. The closing price of Homestore.com common
stock at April 30, 2000 was $18.25 per share. At April 30, 2000, we held 576,865
shares, or approximately 1.0%, of Homestore.com's outstanding common stock.

MetLife Insurance, Intuit's dental insurance provider demutualized in September
of 1999. As a policy holder, Intuit obtained 13,130 shares of MetLife common
stock when they began trading publicly in April 2000 (under the symbol MET). The
stock closed on April 30, 2000 at $16.563 resulting in a market value of
$217,472.

In August 1999, we acquired approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock of
Mortgage.com, Inc. ("Mortgage.com") upon conversion of our preferred shares in
connection with Mortgage.com's initial public offering. We account for the
investment in Mortgage.com as an available-for-sale equity security, which
accordingly is carried at market value. Mortgage.com common stock is quoted on
the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol MDCM. The closing price of
Mortgage.com common stock at April 30, 2000 was $1.9375 per share. At April 30,
2000, we held 3.1 million shares, or approximately 7.2%, of Mortgage.com's
outstanding common stock. Subsequent to April 30, 2000, we sold all of our
shares of Mortgage.com common stock.

In February 1999, we purchased one million shares of common stock of
Quotesmith.com, Inc. ("Quotesmith.com"). We purchased an additional 272,727
shares of Quotesmith.com in August 1999 at the time of its initial public
offering. We account for the investment in Quotesmith.com as an
available-for-sale equity security, which accordingly is carried at market
value. Quotesmith.com common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol QUOT. The closing price of Quotesmith.com common stock at April 30,
2000 was $3.4375 per share. At April 30, 2000, we held approximately 1,197,327
shares, or approximately 6.2%, of Quotesmith.com's outstanding common stock.

In May 1999, we purchased 970,813 shares of common stock of Security First
Technologies. In November 1999, Security First Technologies changed its name to
S1 Corporation ("S1"). We account for the investment in S1 as an
available-for-sale equity security, which accordingly is carried at market
value. S1 common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
SONE. The closing price of S1 common stock at April 30, 2000 was $54.3125 per
share. At April 30, 2000, we held 970,813 shares, or approximately 1.9%, of S1's
outstanding common stock. In connection with the above purchase, we also
received an option to purchase up to an additional 4,579,187 shares of S1
exercisable at a per share purchase price of $51.50. We account for these
options as available-for-sale equity securities, and accordingly the options are
carried at market value.

In connection with VeriSign Corporation's acquisition of Signio in February
2000, our shares of Signio were converted into VeriSign common stock. We have
elected to report these converted VeriSign shares as a trading security. As a
result, we are reporting both positive and negative fluctuations in the market
value of this stock in net income. At April 30, 2000, we owned approximately
194,308 shares (or approximately 0.2%) of VeriSign common stock and reported a
realized valuation loss of approximately $22.1 million for these securities for
the period between August 1, 1999 and April 30, 2000. The closing price of
VeriSign (symbol VRSN) at April 30, 2000, was $139.375 per share. The average
daily closing price of VeriSign between August 1, 1999 and April 30, 2000 was
$121.99 per share.

Checkfree, At Home, S1, Mortgage.com, Homestore.com, VeriSign, and
Quotesmith.com are high technology companies whose stock prices are subject to
substantial volatility. Accordingly, it is possible that the market price of one
or more of these companies' stocks could decline substantially and quickly,
which could result in a material reduction in the carrying value of these
assets.

Mortgage Lines of Credit

For mortgage lines of credit we estimate fair value based on the discounted
value of contractual cash flows using interest rates currently in effect for
similar maturities and collateral requirements. The carrying amount of these
lines of credit approximates their estimated fair values since all of the
borrowings have variable interest rates that approximate current market interest
rates for similar types of lines of credit and are due upon demand. We held the
following mortgage lines of credit at July 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000:

We carry mortgage loans at estimated realizable value, and we estimate their
fair value using quoted market prices for similar loans, adjusted for
differences in loan characteristics, including credit quality. The carrying
amount of accrued interest receivable approximates the assets' fair value. We

credit losses of $1.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

As of July 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000, there were approximately $1.8 million
and $0.3 million, respectively of mortgage loans that were greater than 90 days
past due.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

We record goodwill when the cost of net assets we acquire exceeds their fair
value. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from
3 to 5 years. The cost of identified intangibles is generally amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 1 to 10 years. We regularly
perform reviews to determine if the carrying value of assets is impaired. The
reviews look for the existence of facts or circumstances, either internal or
external, which indicate that the carrying value of the asset cannot be
recovered. No such impairment has been indicated to date. If, in the future,
management determines the existence of impairment indicators, we would use
undiscounted cash flows to initially determine whether impairment should be
recognized. If necessary, we would perform a subsequent calculation to measure
the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over
the fair value of the impaired assets. If quoted market prices for the assets
are not available, the fair value would be calculated using the present value of
estimated expected future cash flows. The cash flow calculations would be based
on management's best estimates, using appropriate assumptions and projections at
the time.

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets consisted of the following:

Concentration of Credit Risk

Intuit operates in an industry which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Many circumstances could have an unfavorable impact on Intuit's operating
results. Examples include significant technological changes in the industry,
changes in customer requirements or the emergence of competitive products or
services with new capabilities.

We are also subject to risks related to our significant balances of short-term
investments, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. At April 30,
2000, we held approximately $386 million in marketable securities, as described
in "Marketable Securities", above in Note 1. Fluctuations in the market value of
our shares in At Home and VeriSign are treated as realized gains and losses in
our statement of operations on an ongoing basis, since these investments are
treated as trading securities. If there is a permanent decline in the value of
any other marketable securities below cost, we will need to report this decline
in our statement of operations. See "Marketable Securities,"



                                      -11-
<PAGE>   12

above in Note 1 for a discussion of risks associated with our marketable
securities. Our remaining portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of
short-term investment-grade securities.

To reduce the credit risk associated with accounts receivable, Intuit performs
ongoing evaluations of customer credit. Generally, no collateral is required. We
maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically
been within our expectations.

Recent Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133"). FAS 133 provides a
comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of
derivatives and hedging activities. Implementation is required for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. Upon adoption, we will report transition
adjustments in net income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate,
reflecting the effect of a change in accounting principle. We have not yet
determined whether adoption of FAS 133 will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified and restated to
include the results of our Rock and Title Source subsidiaries acquired on
December 8, 1999. Certain other previously reported amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation format.

2.   PER SHARE DATA

Basic income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed using
the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of the shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options under the treasury stock method. In
loss periods, basic and dilutive loss per share is identical since the impact of
equivalent shares is anti-dilutive.

On September 8, 1999, our Board of Directors declared a three-for-one stock
split, to be effected as a stock dividend of two shares of common stock for each
share of Intuit's common stock outstanding. Stockholders of record on September
20, 1999 were issued two additional shares of common stock for each share of
Intuit's common stock held on that date. The payment date for the stock dividend
was September 30, 1999. We have restated all share and per share amounts
referred to in the financial statements and notes to reflect this stock split.

3.   COMPREHENSIVE NET INCOME

SFAS 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" provides rules for the reporting and
display of comprehensive net income and its components. However, it has no
impact on our net income or stockholders' equity as presented in our financial
statements. SFAS 130 requires foreign currency translation adjustments and
changes in the fair value of available for sale securities to be included in
comprehensive income.

The components of comprehensive net income, net of tax, are as follows:

4.   ACQUISITIONS

On May 3, 1999, we completed our acquisition of Computing Resources, Inc.
("CRI"), a Reno, Nevada-based provider of payroll services for a combination of
cash and Intuit stock. CRI is one of the country's largest payroll services
companies and a leader in providing payroll services to small businesses. The
purchase price for privately-



                                      -12-
<PAGE>   13

held CRI was approximately $200 million, consisting of approximately $100
million cash and approximately $25 million of Intuit stock that was paid at
closing, and $75 million in cash to be paid in three annual installments of $25
million each beginning in May 2000. We accounted for the acquisition of CRI as a
purchase for accounting purposes and allocated approximately $187 million to
identified intangible assets and goodwill. These assets are being amortized over
a period of three to five years. The following table shows pro forma net
revenue, net income from continuing operations and diluted net loss per share
from continuing operations of Intuit and CRI as if we had acquired CRI at the
beginning of fiscal 1999:

On November 30, 1999, we completed the purchase of all of the outstanding common
stock of Turning Mill Software, Inc. ("Turning Mill") for approximately $22
million in stock. Turning Mill is a developer of software and web based products
based in Acton, Massachusetts. We accounted for the acquisition of Turning Mill
as a purchase for accounting purposes and allocated approximately $22 million to
identified intangible assets and goodwill. These assets are being amortized over
periods of three to five years.

On December 8, 1999, we completed the purchase of all of the outstanding shares
of Rock Financial Corporation ("Rock") for approximately 8.6 million shares of
Intuit common stock. Rock is a provider of consumer mortgages and is based in
Michigan. In connection with the acquisition, Intuit assumed all of Rock's
outstanding employee stock options, which were converted into options to
purchase approximately 1.2 million shares of Intuit common stock. In a related
transaction, Intuit also completed the acquisition of Title Source, Inc., an
affiliate of Rock, for approximately 150,000 shares of Intuit stock. Title
Source provides title insurance and escrow services to real estate agents,
lenders, attorneys, corporations and homeowners. We accounted for the
acquisitions of Rock and Title Source as a pooling of interests for accounting
purposes and have restated all previously reported amounts to reflect the effect
of the pooling.

5.   BORROWINGS

We have two mortgage lines of credit. Advances under the first line of credit
are based on a formula computation, with interest due monthly. Advances are due
on demand and are collateralized by residential first and second mortgages.
Advances may be drawn for working capital and sub-prime, high loan-to-value and
conventional prime mortgage loans. Interest rates are variable and are based on
the federal funds rate and prime rate, depending on the type of advance. The
interest rates in effect at July 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000 were 6.29% and
7.25%, respectively. The weighted average interest rates for the year ended July
31, 1999 and quarter ended April 30, 2000 were 6.45% and 8.38%, respectively.

Our second line of credit currently provides for up to $50 million principal
amount of demand loans secured by mortgage loans and other assets. Interest
rates on loans vary depending on the type of underlying loan, and the loans are
subject to sublimits, advance rates and warehouse terms that vary depending on
the type of underlying loan. The interest rates in effect at July 31, 1999 and
April 30, 2000 were 6.37% and 7.50%, respectively, while the weighted average
interest rates for the three month periods ended July 31, 1999 and April 30,
2000 were 5.92% and 7.35%, respectively. We are required to maintain a minimum
tangible net worth and to satisfy other financial covenants, as outlined in the
line of credit agreements. We were in compliance with the requirements as of
July 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000.

Our reverse repurchase agreement entered into in 1997 provided that the lender
will purchase from us, subject to our agreement to repurchase on a specified
date, up to $200 million of conventional prime and sub-prime mortgage loans at
par, as of January 1, 2000. Loans subject to purchase are fixed and adjustable
rate, fully-amortizing first or junior lien residential mortgage loans and home
equity loans that comply with our origination guidelines and conform to
whole-loan sale requirements. The reverse repurchase agreement was not a
committed facility and the lender could elect to discontinue the repurchase
agreement at any time. The terms of the financing under the repurchase agreement
matured and could be renewed on a daily basis. In any event, the arrangement
terminated in March 2000. Interest rates were variable and were based on the
London Interbank Offered Rate, depending on the



                                      -13-
<PAGE>   14

type of advance. The interest rate in effect at July 31, 1999 was 5.75%. The
weighted average interest rate for the year ended July 31, 1999 was 5.92%. There
were no borrowings on this line for the quarter ended April 30, 2000.

Drafts payable represent funds advanced for mortgages originated which have not
yet been drawn against the lines of credit.

7.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

Intuit has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting No. 131, "Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," ("SFAS 131"). SFAS 131
establishes standards for the way in which public companies disclose certain
information about operating segments in the Company's financial reports.
Consistent with SFAS 131, we have determined our operating segments based on
factors such as how our operations are managed and how results are viewed by
management. Since Internet-based revenues and expenses cut across all of our
business divisions, we do not report results of our Internet-based businesses as
a separate business segment in our financial statements. Instead, each of our
business divisions reports Internet-based revenues and expenses that are
specific to its operations and are included in its results. The accounting
policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. Intuit does not track assets by
operating segments. Consequently, we do not disclose assets by operating
segments. The following unaudited results are broken out by our operating
segments for the nine month periods ended April 30, 1999 and 2000:

8.   NOTES PAYABLE AND COMMITMENTS

In March 2000, our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, entered into a one-year loan
agreement with Japanese banks for approximately $34.7 million which was used to
refinance the three year loan that was entered into in March 1997 to finance our
acquisition of Nihon Micom. The loan is denominated in Japanese yen and is
therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuations when translated to U.S.
dollars for reporting purposes. The interest rate is variable based on the Tokyo
inter-bank offered rate or the short-term prime rate offered in Japan. At April
30, 2000, the rate was approximately 0.8%. The fair value of the loan
approximates cost as the interest rate on the borrowings is adjusted
periodically to reflect market rates (which are currently significantly lower in
Japan than in the United States). We are obligated to pay interest only on the
loan until March 2001.

9.   INCOME TAXES

Intuit computes the provision (benefit) for income taxes by applying the
estimated annual effective tax rate to recurring operations and other taxable
items. Our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily
because of tax credits, tax exempt interest income, state taxes and certain
foreign losses.

10.     LITIGATION

Intuit was a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit in California
which alleged that certain of its Quicken products have on-line banking
functions that are not Year 2000 compliant. On October 13, 1999 the court
dismissed the case without leave to amend. In May 2000, plaintiffs were awarded
nominal attorneys' fees. If plaintiffs do not appeal the case dismissal or the
fees award, this case will be over.

On March 3, 2000 a class action lawsuit, Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in the
United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division.
Two virtually identical lawsuits were later filed: Rubin v. Intuit Inc., was
filed on March 8, 2000 in the United States District Court, Southern District of
New York and Newby v. Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in the United
States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. A
similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on March 22, 2000 in the
Superior Court of State of California, San Bernadino County, Rancho Cucamonga
Division. These purported class actions allege violations of various federal and
California statutes and common law claims for invasion of privacy based upon the
alleged intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and private customer
information entered at Intuit's Quicken.com website. The complaints seek
injunctive relief, orders to disgorge profits related to the alleged acts, and
statutory and other damages. To date, the Rubin complaint has not been served.

In addition, on April 19, 2000, Bosch v. Intuit Inc. was filed in the Superior
Court, State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District. This
lawsuit alleges violations of California statutes for alleged false and
deceptive advertising and unlawful business practices related to QuickBooks
products and purchasing the Tax Table Service. Plaintiff seeks injunctive
relief, an order to disgorge profits, restitution and attorneys' fees.

Intuit is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal
course of our business. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of
liability, if any, for any pending actions (either alone or combined) will not
materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either
unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact.
Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because
of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.


11.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As of April 30, 2000, we held approximately 8.1% of Checkfree's outstanding
common stock. In exchange for providing connectivity between Checkfree's bill
payment processing service and our Quicken products, we reported revenues of
$1.6 million and $4.0 million from Checkfree for the three and nine months ended
April 30, 1999 and $1.7 million and $5.3 million for the three and nine months
ended April 30, 2000, respectively. We held receivables due from Checkfree for
$0.1 million and $2.2 million at July 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000, respectively.

As of April 30, 2000, we held a 49% non-voting equity interest in Venture
Finance Software Corp. ("VFSC"). We have entered into agreements with VFSC to
provide them with services related to ongoing development of Web-oriented
finance products and services. We have an option to purchase the equity
interests of the other investors in VFSC between May 4, 2000 and May 4, 2002, at
a price to be determined by a formula. We held receivables due from VFSC for
$6.7 million and $8.5 million at July 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000, respectively.

ITEM 2
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAUTIONS ABOUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS

This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements about events and
circumstances that have not yet occurred. For example, statements with words
like "expect," "anticipate," or "believe" and statements in the future tense,
are forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that actual results
may differ materially from our expectations expressed in this report because of
risks and uncertainties about the future. We will not necessarily update
information in this Form 10-Q if any forward-looking statement later turns out
to be inaccurate. Details about risks and uncertainties that affect various
aspects of our business, and may affect future results and performance, are
discussed throughout this Form 10-Q. This section should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Investors
should consider all of these risks carefully, and should pay particular
attention to the following:

- -    Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly and annual
     financial results fluctuate significantly.

- -    We face intense competition from many companies in all of our business
     areas. Intense competition can have a material negative impact on revenue,
     profitability and market position.

- -    Competition in the personal tax preparation software business is
     particularly intense. Although Microsoft ultimately withdrew from the
     desktop personal tax market this season, there are other formidable current
     and potential competitors in the private sector, and we also face potential
     competition from the Internal Revenue Service and state tax agencies.

- -    In our online mortgage and insurance businesses, we face competition from
     many newly public companies that have a narrower business focus, increasing
     financial resources and less demanding earnings expectations.

- -    We must continue to establish and maintain important distribution
     relationships for our Internet-based products and services and successfully
     market and promote these products and services.

- -    We must maintain high reliability for our server-based Web services in
     order to attract and retain customers. In particular, our web-based tax
     preparation and electronic filing services effectively handled extremely
     heavy customer demand during the peak tax season this year, but must
     continue to successfully do so in future tax seasons.

- -    If we fail to provide responsive customer service and technical support, we
     could lose customers.

- -    Our Internet businesses face risks relating to customer privacy and
     security and increasing regulation that could adversely affect our ability
     to offer online services and derive advertising revenue from our Internet
     operations.

- -    Our Internet businesses require significant research and development and
     marketing expenditures.

- -    Page views and reach statistics for our Quicken.com site can vary
     significantly from month to month due to seasonal trends, site performance,
     the timing of launches, performance of the major stock market indices,
     competitors' activities and other factors. Adverse changes in page view and
     reach statistics could adversely affect our ability to earn advertising
     revenue from our Quicken.com site.

- -    In order to succeed in the payroll services business, we must continue to
     improve the integration of the operations of our payroll processing
     subsidiary, streamline customer activations for our online payroll
     processing service and focus our traditional payroll service on existing
     distribution channels.

- -    The technology and services of certain alliances for our QuickBooks
     Internet Gateway initiative still need to be completed and integrated with
     QuickBooks, and are subject to risks and uncertainties involved in the
     product development process, including technological difficulties, possible
     delays, and possible unavailability of financial resources. Significant
     delays in implementing key services, or failure to implement, could delay
     or eliminate our ability to recognize contractually committed revenues.

- -    The anticipated benefits of certain proposed small business services to
     Intuit (including the Site Builder website creation tool, Site Solutions
     services and QuickBooks Internet Gateway services) will depend on a number
     of variables, including the rate at which customers upgrade to QuickBooks
     2000 and future versions of the product, customer acceptance of new and
     proposed services, and the level of satisfaction of third party
     participants. Customer upgrade rates for QuickBooks 2000, which was
     released in January 2000, have been negatively impacted by heavier upgrade
     activity during 1999 due to Year 2000 concerns.

- -    The success of the small business alliances will depend on establishing and
     maintaining a number of important business relationships, and there can be
     no assurance that key relationships will be established and, if
     established, will continue.

                                      -17-
<PAGE>   18

- -    Our Tax and Quicken Internet Gateway initiatives, and related new services
     to be offered in these areas, are in very early stages. Success of these
     initiatives will depend on establishing and maintaining business
     relationships with key participants and completing necessary technology
     development and integration, as well as achieving broad customer acceptance
     of the services to be offered.

- -    We offer electronic bill payment and bill presentment services, and the My
     Finances web-based personal finance management service, through licensing
     arrangements with a joint venture in which we are a participant. The
     success of these services for Intuit will depend on a number of factors,
     including timely and cost-effective completion of ongoing development
     efforts, customer and biller adoption and participation rates, and the
     status of the relationship with the joint venture. Intuit has an option to
     purchase the interests in the joint venture that it does not currently own
     between May 2000 and May 2002, at a formula-driven price that would likely
     exceed $100 million. If we do not exercise the purchase option, our rights
     to use the technology developed by the joint venture will be subject to
     future negotiation.

- -    We face increasing competition for access to retail and OEM distribution
     channels.

- -    The integration of acquired companies poses ongoing operational challenges
     and risks. In addition, our recent acquisitions have resulted in
     significant acquisition-related expenses.

- -    Our mortgage business is subject to interest rate fluctuations, and the
     impact of interest rates on Intuit's operating results has become more
     significant since the acquisition of Rock Financial was completed. The
     recent increase in interest rates is also adversely affecting our mortgage
     business.

- -    We hold investments that have been very volatile.

Additional information about factors that could affect future results and events
is included in our fiscal 1999 Form 10-K/A, our fiscal 2000 Form 10-Qs, and
other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

OVERVIEW

Intuit's mission is to revolutionize the way individuals, small businesses, and
financial professionals manage their finances. As we execute this mission, our
strategy is to greatly expand the world of electronic finance. "Electronic
finance" encompasses three types of products and services: (1) desktop software
products, such as Quicken(R), QuickBooks(R) and Quicken TurboTax(R), that
operate on customers' personal computers to automate financial tasks; (2) online
products and services, such as Quicken.com(SM), QuickenLoans(SM),
QuickenInsurance(SM) and Quicken TurboTax for the Web(SM), that are delivered
via the Internet; and (3) products and services, such as QuickBooks Online
Payroll(SM) service, that connect Internet-based services with desktop software
to enable customers to integrate their financial activities.

While desktop software and related products and services now provide most of our
revenue, our Internet-based revenue is growing rapidly. For the three months
ended April 30, 2000, Internet-based revenue more than doubled compared to the
same period last year and accounted for approximately 35% of total revenue in
the quarter ended April 30, 2000, compared to approximately 20% in the prior
year quarter. We expect Internet revenues to be approximately 25% of total
revenues for the full fiscal year. We use the term Internet-based revenue to
include revenue from both Internet-enabled products and services as well as
revenue from electronic distribution. Internet products and services include
activities where the customer realizes the value of the goods or services
directly on the Internet or an Intuit server. Internet product revenues include,
for example, advertising revenues generated on our Quicken.com website, online
tax preparation and electronic tax filing revenues, online payroll service
revenue and transaction and processing fees from our online insurance and online
mortgage services. Electronic distribution includes revenues generated by
electronic ordering and/or delivery of traditional desktop software products and
financial supplies. We also use the Internet to host our technical support
website where we can quickly and cost-effectively provide patches for product
bugs and provide customers with answers to frequently asked questions.

While we believe that the Internet provides an opportunity to increase future
revenue, we also anticipate continued increases in spending in an effort to
capitalize on new business opportunities. While we have made significant
progress in our Internet-based businesses, investors should be aware that many
of these businesses are in their initial stages, and are not yet generating
significant revenue or profit. In particular, we continue to expect increased
research and development expenses due to investments in Internet-based
initiatives. Since Internet-based revenues and expenses cut across all of our
business divisions, we do not report results of our Internet-based businesses as
a separate business segment in our financial statements. Instead, each of our
business divisions reports Internet-based revenues and expenses that are
specific to its operations and are included in its results.

Our business is highly seasonal. Sales of tax products are heavily concentrated
from November through March. Sales of consumer finance and small business
products are typically strongest during the year-end holiday buying



                                      -18-
<PAGE>   19

season, and therefore our major product launches usually occur in the fall to
take advantage of this customer buying pattern. These seasonal patterns mean
that revenue is usually strongest during the quarters ending January 31 and
April 30. We experience lower revenues for the quarters ending July 31 and
October 31, while our operating expenses to develop and manage products and
services continue to be incurred at relatively consistent levels during these
periods. These seasonal trends can result in significant operating losses,
particularly in the July 31 and October 31 quarters when our revenues are lower.
Operating results can also fluctuate for other reasons, such as changes in
product release dates, non-recurring events such as acquisitions and
dispositions, and product price cuts in quarters that have relatively high fixed
expenses. Acquisitions and dispositions in particular can have a significant
impact on the comparability of both our quarterly and yearly results, and
acquisition-related expenses have had a negative impact on earnings.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Set forth below are certain consolidated statements of operations data for the
three and nine-month periods ended April 30, 1999 and 2000. Investors should
note that results for the three and nine-month periods ended April 30, 2000
include activity for our CRI subsidiary, which was acquired in May 1999. The
corresponding year ago periods did not include results for CRI (see Note 4).
Results for all periods include results for Rock Financial Corporation and Title
Source, Inc. (collectively, "Rock") which we acquired in December 1999. The
acquisition of Rock has been accounted for as a pooling of interests, so all
prior periods have been restated to reflect combined results of Rock and Intuit.
The inclusion of Rock's results in the comparison periods for both fiscal 1999
and fiscal 2000 had a significant impact on our financial results. Rock's
revenue declined approximately 50% for the comparison periods, due to Rock's
transition from a traditional mortgage business to an online mortgage business
as well as rising interest rates. Although Rock's operating expenses decreased
in absolute dollars between the comparison periods, they increased significantly
as a percentage of revenue and resulted in operating losses for Rock during the
fiscal 2000 comparison periods (compared to operating profits in the fiscal 1999
periods), which partially offset growth in operating income for our other
businesses as a whole.

The following revenue discussion is categorized by our business divisions, which
is how we examine results internally. Our domestic supplies business is
considered a part of our small business division while the international
supplies business is considered part of our international division. For more
information regarding revenue by division, see Note 7.

Small Business Division. Small business division revenues come primarily from
the following sources:

     -    QuickBooks product line

     -    Supplies products (including checks, envelopes and invoices)

     -    Payroll services

     -    Support fees for the QuickBooks Support Network

Overall, revenue for the division was up 10% and 44% for the three and
nine-month periods ended April 30, 2000, respectively, compared to the same
periods a year ago. QuickBooks revenue for the third quarter declined compared
to the third quarter of fiscal 1999. However, for the nine-month period, we
experienced significant growth in our QuickBooks product line revenue, driven
primarily by higher unit sales, as well as increased average selling prices as a
result of consumer preferences toward higher priced, greater functionality
products. This unusual quarterly revenue pattern is due to two primary factors.
First, we encouraged owners of older versions of QuickBooks to upgrade prior to
January 2000 in order to minimize Year 2000 issues. Second, we gave over 350,000
online customers free upgrades to bring them into Y2K compliance. These actions
resulted in strong first-half revenue growth, while producing a decline in
customer upgrades and resulting revenue for the third quarter. The third quarter
trend is expected to continue into the fourth quarter.

Domestic supplies revenues, which are part of the small business division, grew
by 7% and 14% for the three and nine-month periods ended April 30, 2000 as a
result of our increasing base of small business customers who use



                                      -19-
<PAGE>   20

QuickBooks and Quicken. In addition, in August 1999, we began charging for
shipping and handling for domestic supplies shipments which also contributed to
our domestic supplies revenue.

QuickBooks Deluxe Payroll Service (launched in October 1998) and CRI's
traditional payroll business (acquired in May 1999) both contributed to
increased revenues during the three-month and nine-month periods ended April 30,
2000. Tax tables service revenue and revenue from our QuickBooks Support Network
also grew in the three and nine-month periods ended April 30, 2000 compared to
the same periods a year ago.

We offer different types of payroll services. Our Basic Payroll Service is a
payroll tax table subscription service for small business customers that need
current tax tables to prepare their own payroll. Our QuickBooks Deluxe Payroll
service, which is integrated with our QuickBooks products, is an online payroll
services that handles all aspects of payroll processing, with our CRI subsidiary
providing the processing services. Our Premier payroll services provides
traditional payroll processing services for former customers of CRI. In
addition, we offer QuickPayroll, a subscription-based payroll service for
customers who do not use QuickBooks. While the payroll processing business
provides us with a significant opportunity to generate revenue, there are
business risks associated with the payroll processing business and the continued
integration of CRI into our existing business model. For example, if we are
unable to provide accurate and timely payroll information, cash deposits or tax
return filings, that failure could be costly to correct and may have a
significant negative impact on our ability to attract and retain customers, who
have a low tolerance for payroll processing errors. The success of our premier
payroll service will depend in part on retaining existing customers and
maintaining relationships with certain banks and other third parties. If we are
unable to do so, it could result in a negative impact on our consolidated
results. While the customer base for the QuickBooks Deluxe Payroll service
continues to expand, the service is not yet generating material revenues and we
must continue to focus on streamlining the customer activation process.

QuickBooks 2000 features the QuickBooks Internet Gateway platform of connected
and integrated electronic services. It is designed to offer small businesses
direct access to business services from third parties, such as electronic
postage and merchant account services, that can help them more easily and
efficiently manage their business. It also features QuickBooks Site Solutions, a
new web site creation and domain name registration tool that enables small
businesses to quickly establish a presence on the Web. These new features are
strategically important to Intuit as a way to expand our customer base and
generate more revenue and profit per customer. While we are encouraged by
preliminary results for these services, future revenues and profits are subject
to a variety of risks and uncertainties. See "Cautions about Forward-Looking
Statements and Investment Considerations," above.

Tax Division.  Tax division revenues come primarily from the following sources:

     -    Quicken TurboTax and MacInTax personal desktop tax preparation
          products

     -    Professional tax preparation products (ProSeries and Lacerte product
          lines)

     -    Quicken TurboTax for the Web electronic tax preparation services

     -    Electronic filing services

Overall, tax division revenues for the three and nine-month periods ended April
30, 2000 increased by 47% and 13% respectively, compared to the same periods
last year. The increase in revenue for the three-months ended April 30, 2000 was
due primarily to the deferral of significant electronic filing and state product
revenues in our second fiscal quarter which were subsequently recognized in our
third fiscal quarter. These deferrals were significantly higher this year as a
result of the increased popularity of electronic filing and more aggressive free
state product promotions with certain versions of our Quicken Turbo Tax product.
While we experienced significant unit sales growth for the three and nine months
ended April 30, 2000, we also experienced extreme pricing pressures from both
H&R Block's aggressively priced TaxCut product and from Microsoft's TaxSaver
product, including free product offerings from Microsoft. The increased
competition resulted in lower average selling prices in response to these
pricing pressures. We also experienced significantly higher revenues and volume
for Quicken TurboTax for the Web and for electronic filing compared to last
year. Unit sales and revenue from our Quicken TurboTax for the Web increased by
approximately 470% and 120%, respectively, for the nine months ended April 30,
2000 compared to the same period last year. Unit growth was driven in part by
free units offered through our Quicken Tax Freedom Project. Unit sales and
revenue from our electronic filing services increased by approximately 73% and
88%, respectively, for the nine months ended April 30, 2000 compared to the same
period last year. While we are encouraged by 1999 tax season results, we do not
expect comparable growth rates for our web-based offerings in our 2000 tax
season.

In March 2000, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue its TaxSaver
product after the 1999 tax season. However we believe they plan to offer H&R
Block's TaxCut product on the MSN network for the 2000 tax season. Accordingly,
we expect the personal tax market to remain extremely competitive for the
foreseeable future.



                                      -20-
<PAGE>   21

Although we are encouraged by the year-to-date results for our personal tax
products, revenues for the full tax season are still subject to product returns
from our retail distribution channels. While we expect our reserves for returned
products will be adequate to cover retailers' returns of unsold products during
the next two quarters, higher than expected returns could have a negative impact
on revenue for the full season.

Revenues for our professional tax (ProSeries) products and products from our
Lacerte subsidiary increased by 22% and 13% for the three and nine-month periods
ended April 30, 2000 respectively, compared to the same periods last year. This
growth is attributable to a combination of a continued shift to higher priced
products, increased pay-per-return revenues and growth in our customer base due
in part to our acquisitions of Compucraft and TaxByte during 1999. In addition,
we continue to experience a high customer renewal rate.

Consumer Finance Division. Consumer finance division revenues come primarily
from the following sources:

     -    Quicken product line

     -    Advertising and sponsorship fees from the consumer areas of our
          Quicken.com website

     -    Implementation, marketing and transaction fees from financial
          institutions (including marketspace participants) providing services
          through Quicken and Quicken.com

     -    Consumer mortgage placement and servicing fees through Quicken Loans

Overall, consumer finance division revenues were down 10% and roughly flat for
the three and nine-month periods ended April 30, 2000, respectively, compared to
the same periods a year ago. These results reflect strong revenue growth for our
Quicken product line and growth in Internet-based revenues, offset by a
significant decline in revenues for Rock's mortgage business from the year-ago
periods. Quicken revenue increased compared to the same periods of the prior
year primarily due to strong consumer demand resulting from aggressive retail
promotions with our tax products. While overall Quicken revenue growth is strong
year-to-date, Quicken revenue in the third quarter this year was relatively flat
compared to the third quarter of fiscal 1999. We believe this is attributable to
a significant number of customers upgrading in the first half of the fiscal
year, due to Year 2000 concerns. We anticipate that this shift will continue to
impact upgrade sales and that Quicken revenue may continue to decline compared
to fiscal 1999 levels for the remainder of our fiscal year.

Our Quicken product line faces many challenges in the desktop personal financial
software market. For example, we continue to face competition from Microsoft's
Money product. In addition, personal financial software functionality is
increasingly becoming available on the Internet at no cost, which has a negative
impact on desktop product sales. There is also an increasing emphasis on
packaging desktop software with original equipment manufacturers' personal
computers, which results in lower revenues per unit shipped.

Consumer division revenue growth also benefited from an increase in certain
Internet-based revenue compared to the same periods last year. This increase was
largely due to higher advertising, sponsorship and transaction-related revenue
through Quicken.com and Quicken. However, revenue growth was not uniform across
all of our Internet product and service offerings in the Consumer division. For
example, advertising revenue from our Quicken.com site has grown relatively
rapidly. However, revenue from Quicken Loans was substantially lower than in the
same periods a year ago. Quicken Loans now encompasses Intuit's online mortgage
business as well as the online and traditional mortgage businesses of Rock
Financial, which we acquired in December 1999. The decline in mortgage revenue
was primarily due to Rock's decision to close many of its traditional mortgage
branch offices in order to focus resources on Internet-based lending, as well as
increasing interest rates. Revenue from mortgage transaction fees may continue
to be adversely impacted if interest rates continue to rise, and as we continue
to phase out Rock's traditional mortgage business. In addition, the acquisition
of Rock will continue to result in new business risks and integration challenges
common in all acquisitions. For example, our ability to successfully facilitate
the application, approval, and closing process in loan applications on a timely
basis will have a significant impact on our ability to attract customers to our
mortgage service. Our ability to succeed in the mortgage business will depend in
part on maintaining relationships with certain banks and other third parties who
we will rely on to provide access to capital, and later, service the loans. If
we are unable to do so, it could have a negative impact on our consolidated
results.

The revenue growth we've experienced in our Internet products and services has
been generated in part by collaborating with third party online service and
content providers such as At Home Corporation (doing business as "Excite@Home")
and AOL, which have helped to increase traffic to our Quicken.com website. The
Excite@Home agreement calls for us to share revenue generated from our
Quicken.com site and the AOL agreement calls for us to make significant
guaranteed payments to AOL over the term of the agreement. While the Internet
provides a significant opportunity for revenue growth, our financial commitments
to these and other third party providers are significant and we must continue to
increase traffic and revenue in order for our Internet businesses to become



                                      -21-
<PAGE>   22

profitable. Our ability to maintain important relationships with Internet
portals, distributors and content providers will also have an impact on traffic
and revenues. If our website traffic and revenue expectations aren't met, there
could be a significant negative impact on our operating results.

International Division. International division revenues come primarily from the
following sources:

     -    Japanese QuickBooks and other small business products

     -    Canadian Quicken, QuickBooks and Tax products

     -    German Quicken, QuickBooks and Tax products

     -    United Kingdom Quicken and QuickBooks products

In addition to the above, we also operate in smaller European, Asian and Latin
American markets. Overall, international division revenues increased 67% and 46%
for the three and nine-month periods ended April 30, 2000 compared to the same
periods last year. This increase is a result of stronger sales of Quicken and
QuickBooks in both Canada and the U.K., higher sales of the Yayoi small business
product in Japan, and favorable currency fluctuations in Japan. Partially
offsetting these increases was a decline in revenues in Germany, which
experienced reduced revenue but increased profitability due to a shift in our
German business model from direct participation in the market to a third party
distribution arrangement.

</TABLE>

There are two components of cost of goods sold. The largest is the direct cost
of manufacturing and shipping products and offering services. The second
component is the amortization of purchased software, which is the cost of
products obtained through acquisitions. Total cost of goods sold increased to
24% and 25% of revenue for the three and nine-months ended April 30, 2000
compared to 21% and 23% for the same periods of the prior year. These increases
are primarily attributable to two factors. First, consistent with our growing
Internet-based business, we are experiencing a significant increase in related
hardware and infrastructure costs as we purchase equipment to increase our
Internet capability and capacity. These costs are classified as cost of goods
sold and, as a percentage of revenue, are significantly higher than the costs of
goods sold for our traditional desktop software business. Second, our service
businesses, such as payroll processing and QuickBooks Support Network, generally
have higher cost of goods sold compared to the sale of packaged software. As
these businesses contribute a higher proportion of total revenue, we anticipate
that our cost of goods sold will continue to increase. Note that results from
CRI, our payroll processing subsidiary that we acquired in May 1999, are
included in fiscal 2000 results but not in the fiscal 1999 comparison periods,
which contributed to the year-over-year increase in cost of goods sold.

</TABLE>

Customer Service and Technical Support. Customer service and technical support
expenses were 10% and 12% of revenue for the three and nine-months ended April
30, 2000 compared to 11% and 13% for the same periods of the prior year. This
improvement reflects the acquisition of CRI which experiences comparatively
lower customer service and technical support expenses as a percentage of
revenue. We have also benefited from our efforts to provide customer service and
technical support less expensively through websites and other electronic means
and from the expansion of our fee-for-support programs.

Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing expenses were 18% and 23% of
revenue for the three and nine-months ended April 30, 2000 compared to 19% and
23% for the same periods of the prior year. The decrease in selling and
marketing costs for the three month period is attributable to our acquisition of
CRI, which experiences comparatively lower selling and marketing expenses as a
percentage of revenue. This was partially offset by the aggressive marketing
programs relating to the expansion of our Internet-based businesses and the
extremely competitive personal tax season.

Research and Development. Research and development expenses were 12% and 14% of
revenue for the three and nine-months ended April 30, 2000 compared to 13% and
14% of revenue for the same periods of the prior year. This decline in the
three-month period reflects the acquisition of CRI which experiences
comparatively lower research and development expenses as a percentage of
revenue. We expect to continue significant investments in research and
development due to our efforts to develop our Internet-based businesses and
believe that these expenditures will impact our results for the remainder of
fiscal 2000 and beyond. If such expenses exceed our current expectations, they
may have an adverse effect on operating results. This could occur, for example,
if we were to undertake a costly product development venture in response to
competitive pressures or other market conditions.

General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were 6% and 7%
of revenue for the three and nine-months ended April, 2000 compared to 7% and 8%
for the same periods of the prior year. For fiscal 2000, we



                                      -23-
<PAGE>   24

expect general and administrative expenses to remain roughly flat as a
percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 1999.

Charge for Purchased Research and Development. For the nine months ended April
30, 2000, we recorded charges for purchased research and development as a result
of our Boston Light and Hutchison acquisitions. In connection with these
acquisitions, we used third party appraisers' estimates to determine the value
of in-process projects under development for which technological feasibility had
not been established. The total value of these projects at the time of the
acquisitions was determined to be approximately $1.3 million and was expensed in
the three months ended October 31, 1999. The value of the projects was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the in-process technology into
commercially feasible products, estimating the net cash flows we believed would
result from the products and discounting these net cash flows back to their
present value. We believe the products related to these charges will be
completed during our fiscal year 2000, and that the risk of these products not
being successfully completed is low.

Other Acquisition Costs. Other acquisition costs include the amortization of
goodwill and purchased intangibles and deferred compensation costs that are
recorded as part of an acquisition. These costs increased to $37.3 million and
$118.8 million for the three and nine-months ended April 30, 2000 compared to
$20.9 million and $62.8 million for the same periods of the prior year. These
increases ware primarily attributable to the amortization of intangibles
associated with our acquisition of CRI in May 1999, and our acquisitions of
Secure Tax, Boston Light and Hutchison in August 1999, and Turning Mill Software
in November 1999.

The high levels of non-cash amortization expense related to completed
acquisitions will continue to have a negative impact on operating results in
future periods. Assuming no additional acquisitions and no impairment of value
resulting in an acceleration of amortization, amortization will be approximately
$167.3 million, $148.0 million, $142.8 million and $118.7 million for the years
ending July 31, 2000 through 2003, respectively. If we complete additional
acquisitions or accelerate amortization in the future, there could be an
incremental negative impact on operating results.

Reorganization Costs. Reorganization costs represent the costs associated with
Rock's closure of numerous branch offices in Michigan prior to its acquisition
by Intuit as the mortgage business began to transition from a traditional
branch-based business to an on-line transaction-based business. These costs
increased to $3.5 million for the nine-month period ended April 30, 2000 from
$2.0 million for the same period of the prior year.

OTHER INCOME

For the three and nine months ended April 30, 2000, interest and other income
and expense, net, increased to $14.5 million and $30.0 million compared to $5.3
million and $12.6 million for the same periods a year ago, reflecting increased
cash and short-term investment balances due primarily to the sale of marketable
securities. For the three and nine-months ended April 30, 2000, we recorded
gains from marketable securities of $422.2 million and $402.1 million compared
to $58.6 million and $68.7 million for the same periods a year ago. We have
elected to report our At Home and VeriSign common stock as trading securities
and are required to mark to market the fluctuations in the stock price and
report the fluctuations in our earnings. Recent volatility in the market has
significantly impacted the value of our trading securities and consequently, our
operating results and we expect this to continue as long as we hold these
securities. See Note 1 for additional information regarding our marketable
securities.

INCOME TAXES

For the three and nine-months ended April 30, 2000, we recorded income tax
provisions of $200.2 million and 195.6 million on a pretax income of $497.2
million and $483.9 million, respectively. This compares to income tax provisions
of $38.6 million and $56.3 million on a pretax income of $114.0 million and
$179.9 million, respectively for the same periods of the prior year. At April
30, 2000, there was a valuation allowance of $11.6 million for tax assets of our
international subsidiaries based on management's assessment that we may not
receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At April 30, 2000, our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $962.1
million, a $407.9 million increase from July 31, 1999. Liquidity improvement was
the result of net cash provided by operating, investing, and financing
activities. Cash from operating activities is driven by the seasonality of our
business, which typically results in the



                                      -24-
<PAGE>   25

majority of net revenues and cash receipts occurring in the January and April
quarters, though operating expenses are incurred throughout the year.

Our operations provided $218.5 million in cash during the nine months ended
April 30, 2000. Primary sources of cash were net income of $288.5 million, net
income adjustments made for non-cash items such as acquisition charges,
depreciation, gains from the sale of marketable securities and an increase in
liabilities. The increase in liabilities was driven primarily by increased
income taxes payable from our realized gains from the disposition of marketable
securities, such as Checkfree, At Home, and VeriSign Inc. (see Note 1). We also
experienced increased liabilities due to the seasonality of our business and the
resulting increase in accruals for product returns, customer rebates and accrued
technical support expenses. These sources of cash were offset significantly by
an increase of $64.4 million in accounts receivable that is attributable to the
large volume of seasonal product shipments to retailers and distributors that
typically occur in our second and third fiscal quarters.

Investing activities generated $129.6 million in cash for the nine months ended
April 30, 2000. The primary contributor to cash included net proceeds of $519.2
million from the sale of our marketable securities. This was significantly
offset by net purchases of $219.2 million in short-term investments, the
purchase of $71.7 million in property and equipment and the purchase of $16.5
million in marketable securities. Property and equipment purchases were made to
support our ongoing operations, information system upgrades and our growing
Internet-based businesses. We also used $54.6 million in cash for our
acquisitions of SecureTax and Hutchison.

Financing activities provided $59.8 million for the nine months ended April 30,
2000, primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of employee stock
options. This was partially offset by the decrease in our line of credit as we
funded new consumer mortgage loans during the period.

We currently hold investments in a number of publicly traded companies (see Note
1). The volatility of the stock market and the potential risk of fluctuating
stock prices may have an impact on our future liquidity. Due to our reporting of
the At Home and VeriSign shares as trading securities, future fluctuations in
the carrying values of At Home and VeriSign will impact our earnings (see Note
1). If future declines in our other marketable securities are deemed to be
permanent, they will also impact our earnings. Investors should note that many
high technology companies, including At Home and VeriSign, have recently
experienced significant declines in their stock prices.

In connection with our acquisition of CRI (see Note 4), we are required to pay
three annual installments of $25 million, one of which was paid in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2000. In the normal course of business, we enter into leases
for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and international locations. We
also evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing
strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Accordingly, it
is possible that we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such
activities in the future. For example, if we exercise our option to purchase
VFSC (see Note 11) and elect to pay all or a significant portion of the exercise
price in cash, this would have a negative impact on our liquidity.

We believe that our unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.


                                    YEAR 2000

The following is a Year 2000 readiness disclosure under the Year 2000
Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.

Intuit established a Year 2000 Project Office to address the impact of the year
2000 date transition on its operations, products and services globally. We
adopted a five-phase approach for reviewing and preparing the significant
elements of operations, products and services for the Year 2000 date transition.
Through the date of this filing, we have had no major Y2K-related issues. In
addition, all substantive claims in the lawsuits filed against Intuit in
connection with alleged Y2K problems with our products and services have been
dismissed, with only one possible appeal remaining. Customers can find Intuit's
Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure about our products, and order free solutions,
where required, on our Corporate Year 2000 Resource Center at
www.intuit.com/y2k.

Costs directly attributed to our Year 2000 project were approximately $6.5
million in fiscal 1999. We currently anticipate direct costs in the range of $8
to $12 million for fiscal year 2000, including costs associated with ongoing
maintenance and support activity in fiscal year 2000, and including costs
associated with the manufacture and



                                      -25-
<PAGE>   26

distribution of free solutions for products that are not Year 2000 compliant or
in certain cases that were not tested for Year 2000 compliance. For example, we
gave approximately 350,000 of our QuickBooks online customers free upgrades to
bring them into Y2K compliance. We don't know how many of those customers would
have paid for a new product if we had not provided the free upgrade, so we are
unable to precisely quantify the amount of lost revenue due to the free
upgrades. However, this action did lead to a decline in customer upgrades and
resulting QuickBooks revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2000, and the
third quarter trend is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. We are
experiencing a similar pattern in fiscal 2000 quarterly revenue for Quicken,
due in part to free Y2K upgrades provided to online customers.

ITEM 3
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short-term investment
portfolio. Our short-term investments consist of instruments that meet high
quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy dictates
that we diversify our holdings and limit our short-term investments to a maximum
of $5 million to any one issuer. Our policy also dictates that all short-term
investments mature in 30 months or less.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

We also carry significant balances in marketable equity securities as of April
30, 2000. These securities are subject to considerable market risk due to their
volatility. See Note 1 of the financial statement notes for more information
regarding risks related to our investments in marketable securities.

INTEREST RATE RISK

Interest rate risk represents a component of market risk to us and represents
the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in
our net income and in the value of our interest rate sensitive assets,
liabilities and commitments. In a higher interest rate environment, borrower
demand for mortgage loans declines. Interest rate movements also affect the
interest income earned on loans we hold for sale in the secondary market,
interest expense on our lines of credit, the value of mortgage loans we hold for
sale in the secondary market and ultimately the gain on the sale of those
mortgage loans. In addition, interest rate movements affect the interest income
earned on investments we hold in our short-term investment portfolio and the
value of those investments.

As part of our risk management programs, we enter into financial agreements and
purchase financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our
exposure to interest rate risk with respect to our Conventional Loans and our
government-insured loans (together, "Prime Loans"), but not with respect to our
Sub-Prime Loans or Home Equity Lines of Credit. We use these financial
agreements and financial instruments for the explicit purpose of managing
interest rate risks to protect the value of our mortgage loan portfolio.

Management actively monitors and manages our exposure to interest rate risk on
Prime Loans, which is incurred in the normal course of business. The committed
and closed pipelines of Prime Loans, as well as the related forward commitments
and derivatives, are valued daily. We refer to the loans, pipeline, commitments
and derivatives together as the "hedge position." The hedge position is
evaluated against a spectrum of interest rate scenarios to determine expected
net changes in the fair values of the hedge position in relation to the changes
in interest rates. We do not enter into instruments for trading purposes. Our
interest rate risk exposure is evaluated daily using models which estimate
changes in the fair value of the hedge position and compare those changes
against the fair value of the underlying assets and commitments.

(1) In the ordinary course of our mortgage business, expected maturity is based
on the assumption that loans will be re-sold in the indicated period.

Based on the carrying values of our mortgage loans and lines of credit that we
held at April 30, 2000, we do not believe that short-term changes in interest
rates would have a material effect on the interest income we earn on loans held
for sale in the secondary market, interest expense on our lines of credit or the
value of mortgage loans that we hold for sale in the secondary market. See Notes
1 and 5 of the financial statement notes for more information regarding risks
related to our mortgage loans and lines of credit.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES

During fiscal 1999, the currency of our Japanese subsidiary strengthened while
the currencies of our other subsidiaries remained essentially stable. As of
April 30, 2000, the currency of our Japanese subsidiary has continued to
strengthen and the currencies of our other subsidiaries have remained
essentially stable since the end of our 1999 fiscal year. Because we translate
foreign currencies into U.S dollars for reporting purposes, currency
fluctuations can have an impact, though generally immaterial, on our results. We
believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is
insignificant, primarily because our international subsidiaries invoice
customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their
local currencies. For the quarter ended April 30, 2000, there was an immaterial
currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions. Currency exchange
risk is also minimized since foreign debt is due almost exclusively in local
foreign currencies. As of April 30, 2000, we did not engage in foreign currency
hedging activities.

PART II
ITEM 1
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Intuit was a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit in California
which alleged that certain of its Quicken products have on-line banking
functions that are not Year 2000 compliant. On October 13, 1999 the court
dismissed the case without leave to amend. In May 2000, plaintiffs were awarded
nominal attorneys' fees. If plaintiffs do not appeal the case dismissal or the
fees award, this case will be over.

On March 3, 2000 a class action lawsuit, Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in the
United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division.
Two virtually identical lawsuits were later filed: Rubin v. Intuit Inc., was
filed on March 8, 2000 in the United States District Court, Southern District of
New York and Newby v. Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in the United
States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. A
similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on March 22, 2000 in the
Superior Court of State of California, San Bernadino County, Rancho Cucamonga
Division. These purported class actions allege violations of various federal and
California statutes and common law claims for invasion of privacy based upon the
alleged intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and private customer
information entered at Intuit's Quicken.com website. The complaints seek
injunctive relief, orders to disgorge profits related to the alleged acts, and
statutory and other damages. To date, the Rubin complaint has not been served.

In addition, on April 19, 2000, Bosch v. Intuit Inc. was filed in the Superior
Court, State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District. This
lawsuit alleges violations of California statutes for alleged false and
deceptive



                                      -27-
<PAGE>   28

advertising and unlawful business practices related to QuickBooks
products and purchasing the Tax Table Service. Plaintiff seeks injunctive
relief, an order to disgorge profits, restitution and attorneys' fees.

Intuit is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal
course of our business. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of
liability, if any, for any pending actions (either alone or combined) will not
materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either
unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact.
Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because
of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

                  (ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED ON FEBRUARY 1, 1993)




        INTUIT INC., a Delaware corporation, hereby certifies that the Restated

which is incorporated herein by this reference, and which restates and

                                   EXHIBIT "A"

                      RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
                                       OF
                                   INTUIT INC.

                                    ARTICLE I

        The name of the corporation is Intuit Inc. (the "Company").


                                   ARTICLE II

        The address of the registered office of the corporation in the State of
Delaware is 1013 Centre Road, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, DE
19805. The name of its registered agent at that address is Corporation Service
Company.


                                   ARTICLE III

        The purpose of the Company is to engage in any lawful act or activity
for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware.


                                   ARTICLE IV

        A.     AUTHORIZATION OF SHARES.

        The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Company has
authority to issue is 751,344,918 shares, consisting of two classes as follows:
750,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common
Stock"), and 1,344,918 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Preferred Stock").

        B.     DESIGNATION OF FUTURE SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

        The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations
prescribed by the law of the State of Delaware, to provide for the issuance of
the shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, and, by filing a
certificate of designation pursuant to the applicable law of the State of
Delaware, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in
each such series, to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the
shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof, and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such series
(but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding). The number
of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not
below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the stock of the Company entitled to vote, unless a
vote of any other holders is required pursuant to a certificate or certificates
establishing a series of Preferred Stock.

<PAGE>   3

        Except as expressly provided in Part C of this Article IV or except as
may be expressly provided in any Certificate of Designation designating any
series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article
IV, any new series of Preferred Stock may be designated, fixed and determined as
provided herein by the Board of Directors without approval of the holders of
Common Stock or the holders of Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, and any
such new series may have powers, preferences and rights, including, without
limitation, voting rights, dividend rights, liquidation rights, redemption
rights and conversion rights, senior to, junior to or pari passu with the rights
of the Common Stock, the Preferred Stock, or any future class or series of
Preferred Stock or Common Stock.

        C.     SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK.

               1. Designation. One Hundred Forty-Four Thousand Nine Hundred
Eighteen (144,918) of the shares of Preferred Stock of the Company are hereby
designated Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (hereinafter
referred to as the "Series A Stock"), with the powers, preferences, rights,
limitations and restrictions specified herein.

               2. Dividends. Subject to the payment of dividends on senior
series of Preferred Stock which may be created by the Board of Directors
pursuant to this Article IV, the holders of the Series A Stock shall be entitled
to receive, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors, out of any
assets legally available therefor, dividends at the rate determined by the Board
of Directors. No dividend other than a stock dividend shall be paid on any share
of Common Stock unless a dividend for each share of Series A Stock in an amount
equal to the dividend for each share of Series A Stock in an amount equal to the
dividend for each share of Common Stock multiplied by the number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Series A Stock is then convertible is
first declared and paid (or set apart for payment) on the Series A Stock. Such
dividends shall not be cumulative and no right to such dividends shall accrue to
holders of Series A Stock unless declared by the Board of Directors.

               3. Liquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary,
distributions to the shareholders of the Company shall be made in the following
manner:

                      (a) Subject to and after the distribution of the
liquidation preference(s) of all senior series of Preferred Stock which may be
created by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Article IV, the holders of
the Series A Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any of the assets or surplus funds of the Company to the holders
of the Common Stock by reason of their ownership of such stock, the amount of
Seven Dollars and Fifty Cents ($7.50) for each share of Series A Stock then held
by them, adjusted for any combinations, consolidations or stock distributions or
dividends with respect to the shares of Series A Stock (a "Series A Stock
Recapitalization Event"), plus any declared but unpaid dividends on the Series A
Stock. If the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the Series
A Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full
aforesaid preferential amount, then, subject to the rights of any future series
of Preferred Stock which may be created by the Board of Directors pursuant to
this Article IV, the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available
for distribution shall be distributed among the holders of the Series A Stock in
proportion to the number of shares of Series A Stock then held by them.

                      (b) After payment to the holders of Series A Stock of the
amounts set forth in paragraph 3(a) hereof, the entire assets and funds of the
Company legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed among
the holders of the Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares of Common
Stock then held by them.

                                       2

<PAGE>   4


                      (c) The liquidation rights of the Series A Stock shall not
be participating, and accordingly the holders of Series A Stock shall not be
entitled to any payments on liquidation except as expressly set forth in this
Section 3.

                      (d) A consolidation or merger of the Company with or into
any other corporation or corporations, or a sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution,
or winding up within the meaning of this Section 3.

               4. Voting Rights. Except as otherwise required by law, the holder
of each share of the Series A Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A
Stock could then be converted, shall have voting rights and powers equal to the
voting rights and powers of the Common Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of
any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Company.
Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting
rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which
shares of Series A Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be
rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded up).

               5. Conversion. The holders of the Series A Stock shall have
conversion rights as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

                      (a) Right to Convert.

                             (i) Each share of Series A Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time after the date of issuance
of such share, at the office of the Company or any transfer agent of the Series
A Stock, into two (2) fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. (The
number of shares of Common Stock into which one (1) share of Series A Stock may
be converted is hereinafter referred to as the "Conversion Rate".)

                             (ii) Each share of Series A Stock shall
automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then effective
Conversion Rate upon the first to occur of (i) August 31, 1993, or (ii) the last
day of the first fiscal year in which the Company has net income after provision
for income taxes, as shown on the Company's audited financial statements, of at
least $9,000,000, or (iii) the closing of an underwritten public offering of the
Company's Common Stock at an aggregate public offering price of at least
$10,000,000 and a per share price equal to or greater than $7.00, (as
appropriately adjusted for any combinations, consolidations, or stock
distributions or dividends with respect to shares of Common Stock (a "Common
Stock Recapitalization Event"), or (iv) the vote or written consent by holders
of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the then outstanding shares of Series A Stock to
convert the Series A Stock into Common Stock or (v) when less than 250,000
shares of Series A Stock (as appropriately adjusted for any Series A Stock
Recapitalization Event) remain outstanding (the "Automatic Conversion Events").
Upon an Automatic Conversion Event, each outstanding option, warrant or right to
purchase or acquire one (1) share of Series A Stock shall automatically be
converted into an option, warrant or right to purchase or acquire that number of
shares of Common Stock into which each outstanding share of Series A Stock was
converted upon such Automatic Conversion Event.

                      (b) Mechanics of Conversion. Before any holder of Series A
Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he
shall surrender the certificate or certificates for such shares, duly endorsed,
at the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the Series A Stock, or
notify the Company or its transfer agent that such Series A Stock certificates
have been lost,

                                       3

<PAGE>   5

stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Company to
indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such
certificates, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office that
he elects to convert the same and shall state in the notice the name or names in
which he wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be
issued. The Company shall then, as soon as is practicable, issue and deliver at
such office to such holder of Series A Stock, or to his nominee or nominees, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he
shall be entitled. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of surrender of the shares of Series
A Stock to be converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such
date; provided, however, that in the event of automatic conversion pursuant to
paragraph 5(a)(ii), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made upon the
occurrence of the Automatic Conversion Event triggering such conversion without
any further action by the holders of shares of Series A Stock, though the
Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates
evidencing such shares of Series A Stock are delivered to the Company or its
transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Company or its
transfer agent that such Series A Stock certificates have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the
Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.

                      (c) Mechanics for Combinations or Consolidations of Common
Stock. In the event the Company at any time or from time to time after the date
that a share of Series A Stock is first issued (hereinafter referred to as the
"Original Issue Date") effects a subdivision or combination of its outstanding
Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, then and in each such
event the Conversion Rate shall be increased (in the case of a subdivision) or
decreased (in the case of a combination) proportionately.

                      (d) Adjustment for Certain Dividends, Distributions and
Common Stock Equivalents. In the event the Company at any time or from time to
time after the Original Issue Date shall make, use or fix a record date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other
distribution payable (hereinafter referred to as "Common Stock Equivalents")
convertible into or entitling the holder to receive additional shares of Common
Stock, without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional
shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional
shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise), then, and in each
such event, the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument
relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein for
subsequent adjustment of such number) of Common Stock issuable in payment of
such dividend or distribution or upon conversion or exercise of such outstanding
as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date shall have
been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date. In each such event
the Conversion Rate shall be increased as of the time of such issuance or, in
the event such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business
on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Rate by a fraction.

                             (i) the numerator of which shall be the total
number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding or deemed to be issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
in payment of such dividend or distribution or upon conversion or exercise of
such Common Stock Equivalents; and

                                       4
<PAGE>   6

                             (ii) the denominator of which shall be the total
number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding or deemed to be issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of
business on such record date; provided, however, (A) if such record date shall
have been fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is
not fully made on the date fixed for such distribution, then the Conversion Rate
shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date
and the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph 5(d) as of
the time of actual payment of such dividend or distribution; (B) if such Common
Stock Equivalents provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any
decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or
exercise thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto),
then the Conversion Rate, and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall,
upon any such decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such
decrease insofar as it affects the rights of conversion or exercise of the
Common Stock Equivalents then outstanding; (C) upon the expiration of any rights
of conversion or exercise under any unexercised Common Stock Equivalents, the
Conversion Rate computed upon the original issue (or upon the occurrence of a
record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon,
shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if the only additional shares of
Common Stock issued were the shares of such stock, if any, that were actually
issued upon the conversion or exercise of such Common Stock Equivalents; and (D)
in the case of Common Stock Equivalents that expire by their terms not more than
sixty (60) days after the date of issuance, no adjustment of the Conversion Rate
shall be made until the expiration or exercise of all such Common Stock
Equivalents, whereupon such adjustment shall be made in the manner provided in
clause (C).

                      (e) Adjustments for Other Reclassifications, Dividends and
Distributions. In the event the Company at any time or from time to time after
the Original Issue Date shall effect a reclassification of its Common Stock
(other than one resulting in the issue of additional shares of Common Stock) or
shall make, issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in
securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, then, and in each
such event, provision shall be made so that the holders of Series A Stock shall
receive upon conversion of each share of Series A Stock the number of shares of
stock or other securities to which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock of the Company deliverable upon conversion of such Series A Stock would
have been entitled in such reclassification, dividend or distribution.

                      (f) Adjustments for Merger or Reorganization, etc. In the
event of any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another
corporation (other than a merger in which the Company is the surviving
corporation) or the conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company to another corporation, such share of Series A Stock shall thereafter be
convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or property
to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company
deliverable upon conversion of such Series A Stock would have been entitled upon
such consolidation, merger or conveyance; and, in any such case, appropriate
adjustment (as determined by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the
application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and
interest thereafter of the holders of the Series A Stock, to the end that the
provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect to changes in and
other adjustments of the Conversion Rate) shall thereafter be applicable, as
nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other
property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A Stock.

                      (g) No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of

assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,

issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed under this Article IV by the Company, but will at all times in good
faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 5 and in
the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of the Series A Stock against
impairment.

                      (h) Certificate as to Adjustment. Upon the occurrence of
each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section
5, the Company at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or
readjustment in accordance with the terms of this Section 5 and prepare and
furnish to each holder of Series A Stock a certificate setting forth such
adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such
adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request
at any time of any holder of Series A Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Rate in effect at the time, and (iii) the
number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property that
at the time would be received upon the conversion of the Series A Stock.

                      (i) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking by
the Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the
purpose of determining the holders of such securities who are entitled to
receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any
Common Stock Equivalents or any right to subscribe for, purchase, or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or
to receive any other right, the Company shall mail to each holder of Series A
Stock at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified in such
notice, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for
the purpose of such dividend, distribution, or rights, and the amount and
character of such dividend, distribution, or right.

                      (j) Issue Taxes. The Company shall pay any and all issue
and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of
shares of Common Stock on conversion of shares of Series A Stock.

                      (k) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The
Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversion of the shares of the Series A Stock such number of its shares of
Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all outstanding shares of Series A Stock. If at any time the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect
the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Stock, the Company
will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such
number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.

                      (l) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be
issued upon the conversion of any share or shares (including fractional shares)
of Series A Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions) issuable
upon conversion of shares of Series A Stock by a holder of such stock shall be
aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in
the issuance of any fractional share. If, after aggregation, the conversion
would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, the Company
shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay the holder otherwise
entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the fair market value of such
fraction on the date of conversion (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company).

                      (m) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
Section 5 to be given to the holders of shares of Series A Stock shall be deemed
given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to
each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Company.

               6. Amendment. Any of the rights of the Series A Stock specified
in this Certificate may be reduced, restricted, or eliminated (either generally
or in a particular instance and either retrospectively or prospectively) with
the written consent of (a) the Company and (b) the holders of a majority of the
Series A Stock then outstanding. All other amendments to this Part C of this
Article IV and any waiver of the observance of any form hereof, shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as in effect from to time. Any such reduction, restriction,
elimination, amendment, or waiver so effected shall be binding upon the Company
and any holder of Series A Stock or Common Stock.

               7. Status of Converted Shares. Upon the conversion of all
outstanding shares of Series A Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to an
Automatic Conversion Event, such converted shares of Series A Stock shall be
cancelled and shall not thereafter be issuable by the Company.




        D.      SERIES B JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK.

        The powers, preferences and relative participating, optional and other
special rights, and qualifications, limitations, and restrictions of the
Company's Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, as designated pursuant
to a Certificate of Designation filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware on May 5, 1998, as amended by a Certificate of Increase
filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on
November 9, 1999, are as follows:

               Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series
        shall be designated as "Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock"
        (the "Series B Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting
        the Series B Preferred Stock shall be 250,000. Such number of shares may
        be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors;
        provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series B
        Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then
        outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the
        exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the
        conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation
        convertible into Series B Preferred Stock.

               Section 2. Dividends and Distributions.

                      (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of
        any series of Preferred Stock (or any other stock) ranking prior and
        superior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the
        holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
        receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
        legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash
        on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year
        (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend
        Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
        after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series B
        Preferred Stock, in an amount (if any) per




                                       7
<PAGE>   9
        share (rounded to the nearest cent), subject to the provision for
        adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1000 times the aggregate per
        share amount of all cash dividends, and 1000 times the aggregate per
        share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other
        distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock,
        par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company or a
        subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
        reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the
        immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect
        to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance
        of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock. In the
        event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on
        the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a
        subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of
        Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a
        dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of
        shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which
        holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately
        prior to such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by
        multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
        number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
        event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
        Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

                      (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or
        distribution on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph
        (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or
        distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in
        shares of Common Stock).

                      (C) Dividends due pursuant to paragraph (A) of this
        Section shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of
        Series B Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next
        preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of
        such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend
        Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to
        accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of
        issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record
        date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred
        Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly
        Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall
        begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment
        Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends
        paid on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock in an amount less than
        the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on
        such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among
        all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix
        a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B
        Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
        distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than
        60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

               Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series B
        Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

                      (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter
        set forth, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall entitle the
        holder thereof to 1000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the
        stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at
        any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in
        shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or
        consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by

                                       8
<PAGE>   10


        reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of
        Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock,
        then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of
        shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to
        such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction,
        the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
        outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
        the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
        prior to such event.

                      (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other
        Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any
        similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred
        Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other
        capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote
        together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders
        of the Corporation.

                      (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided
        by law, holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no special voting
        rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent
        they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth
        herein) for taking any corporate action.

               Section 4. Certain Restrictions.

                      (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or
        distributions payable on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in
        Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid
        dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of
        Series B Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the
        Corporation shall not:

                             (i)    declare or pay dividends, or make any other
        distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to
        dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series
        B Preferred Stock;

                             (ii)   declare or pay dividends, or make any other
        distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to
        dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the
        Series B Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series B
        Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable
        or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of
        all such shares are then entitled; or

                             (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for
        consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends
        or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B
        Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem,
        purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in
        exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (as
        to dividends and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the
        Series B Preferred Stock.

                      (B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the
        Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any
        shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under
        paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such
        shares at such time and in such manner.

                                       9
<PAGE>   11

               Section 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series B Preferred
        Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner
        whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition
        thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized
        but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a
        new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions
        on issuance set forth herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation, or in
        any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred
        Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.


               Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.

                      (A) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
        Corporation, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
        entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any
        assets of the Corporation to the holders of Common Stock, the amount of
        $10.00 per share for each share of Series B Preferred Stock then held by
        them. Thereafter, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
        shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to
        the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1000 times
        the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of
        Common Stock plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends.
        In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any
        dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or
        effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding
        shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment
        of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number
        of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount
        to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled
        immediately prior to such event under the preceding sentence shall be
        adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which
        is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
        such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of
        Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

                      (B) If the assets of the Corporation legally available for
        distribution to the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock upon
        liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are
        insufficient to pay the full preferential amount set forth in the first
        sentence of paragraph (A) above, then the entire assets of the
        Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of Series
        B Preferred Stock shall be distributed among such holders in proportion
        to the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then held by them.

                      (C) The foregoing rights upon liquidation, dissolution or
        winding up provided to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be
        subject to the rights of the holders of any other series of Preferred
        Stock (or any other stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series B
        Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

               Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation
        shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other
        transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or
        changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or other property, then
        in any such case each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall at the
        same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share,
        subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to
        1000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any
        other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for
        which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event
        the Corporation shall at any time declare


                                       10
<PAGE>   12

        or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common
        Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the
        outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise
        than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater
        or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the
        amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange
        or change of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by
        multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
        number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
        event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
        Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               Section 8. No Redemption.  The shares of Series B Preferred Stock
        shall not be redeemable.

                                    ARTICLE V

        To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the Company shall
be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, if the Delaware
General Corporation Law is hereafter amended to authorize the further
elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability of
a director of the Company shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.

        Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article V, nor the adoption of
any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this
Article V, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation
on the personal liability of a director of the Company existing at the time of
such amendment, repeal or adoption of such an inconsistent provision.


                                   ARTICLE VI

        The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the power to adopt,
amend or repeal Bylaws of the Company.


                                   ARTICLE VII

        Election of directors need not be by written ballot, unless the Bylaws
of the Company shall so provide.

        [ADDRESS]

               Re:  Separation Terms

        Dear Mark:

        This letter confirms the terms of your separation from the employment of
Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation, with offices at 2535 Garcia Avenue,
Mountain View, CA 94043 (the "Company").

        1. Termination Date. Your employment with the Company is terminated
effective May 15, 2000 (the "Termination Date"). Your current employment status,
salary and benefits will remain unchanged between the date you sign this
Agreement and May 15, 2000.

        2. Shares. Assuming you do not exercise any stock options between
today's date and the Termination Date, on the Termination Date, you will hold

price of $7.91 per share. You have until August 13, 2000 in which to exercise
these vested options.

        In addition, assuming you do not exercise any stock options between
today's date and the Termination Date, on the Termination Date, you will hold
vested options to purchase 74,189 shares of Intuit's Common Stock at a purchase
price of $7.64 per share. You have until August 13, 2000 in which to exercise
these vested options.

        Furthermore, assuming you do not exercise any stock options between
today's date and the Termination Date, on the Termination Date, you will hold

        Finally, assuming you do not exercise any stock options between today's

Improvement (defined in Section 2.4). Landlord will not require the use of any
specific general contractor or subcontractors (so long as they are reasonably
acceptable to Landlord). Landlord will not require any payment or performance
bonds (unless at Landlord's sole expense). Further, Landlord will not charge a

conjunction with Tenant's improvements in the Leased Premises. Tenant shall have
sole responsibility to arrange for and pay the costs of all items included as
part of any Improvements. All construction work required or permitted by this
Lease shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner, and in compliance with all
applicable laws and ordinances, regulations, and orders of governmental
authority and insurers of the Property, the Building and Leased Premises.
Landlord may inspect the work of Tenant at reasonable times and shall give
notice to Tenant of any observed defects. Tenant shall have reasonable access to
the Leased Premises, subject to prior notice, prior to the date of delivery to
Tenant, for space planning purposes. For purposes of this Lease, "Improvement"

Improvements.

            2.4 Surrender of Possession. Immediately prior to the expiration or

signs from the exterior of the Building and shall remove all of Tenant's
equipment, trade fixtures, furniture, supplies, wall decorations and other

remain pursuant to this Lease, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Tenant shall
repair all damage to the Leased Premises, the exterior of the Building and to
the Property caused by Tenant's removal of Tenant's property. Tenant shall patch
and refinish, to Landlord's reasonable satisfaction, all penetrations made by
Tenant or its employees to the floor, walls or ceiling of the Leased Premises
and Building, whether such penetrations were made with Landlord's approval or
not. Tenant shall repair or replace all stained or damaged ceiling tiles, wall
coverings and floor coverings to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord. Tenant
shall repair all damage caused by Tenant to the exterior surface of the Building
and the paved surfaces of the Property and, where necessary, replace or
resurface the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right
to require Tenant to remove at the end of the Lease Term any Specialized
Improvements installed in the Building or on the Property as part of initial or
subsequent Tenant improvements, including, but not limited to, raised floor
computer areas,


                                       4
<PAGE>   5

vaults, and other improvements of such a nature as not likely to be generally
usable (in Landlord's reasonable determination) by likely future tenants of the
Building (collectively, the "Specialized Improvements"); provided that if Tenant
shall request of Landlord, in writing, at the time of approval of Tenant's plans
for Tenant's improvements or alterations whether such improvements or
alterations constitute Specialized Improvements for purposes of this Section
2.4, Landlord shall use good faith efforts to promptly determine at that time,
if reasonably possible, whether such improvements or alterations constitute
Specialized Improvements, Reserved Improvements or Standard Improvements. If
Landlord determines, in good faith, that it cannot make such "Specialized
Improvement" determination at such time, then Landlord may reserve such
determination until the expiration or termination of the Lease (each, a
"Reserved Improvement"). If Landlord subsequently requires removal of the
Reserved Improvement, Tenant shall, upon expiration or termination of the Lease,
remove any such Reserved Improvements and repair all damage caused by such
removal. (If after receiving a request from Tenant for a classification of
certain Improvement Landlord determines that such improvements are not
Specialized Improvements or Reserved Improvements, then such improvement shall
be a standard improvement that Tenant is not required to remove (each, a
"Standard Improvement"). Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for all costs
incurred by Landlord in returning the Leased Premises, the Building and the
Property to the required condition, together with interest (at the maximum rate
allowed by law) on all costs so incurred from the date paid by Landlord until
paid by Tenant. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of all costs so incurred
plus such interest thereon within ten (10) days after Landlord's delivery to
Tenant of a bill for the same. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against loss or
liability resulting from delay by Tenant in surrendering the Leased Premises,
Building, and Property, including, without limitation, any claims made by any
succeeding tenant or any losses to Landlord with respect to lost opportunities
to lease to succeeding tenants.

                                    SECTION 3
                               TERM OF THE LEASE

            3.1 Lease Term. The term "Initial Lease Term" shall mean the term of
this Lease, which shall be for a period of One Hundred Twenty (120) full
calendar months (plus the partial month, if any, immediately following the
Commencement Date), commencing on the Commencement Date and ending at midnight
on the last day of the One Hundred Twentieth (120th) full calendar month
thereafter, unless this Lease is extended or sooner terminated according to its
terms or by mutual agreement. The term "Lease Term" shall mean the Initial Lease
Term and any extensions thereof.

            3.2 Postponement. If, for any reason, Landlord is unable to deliver
possession of the Premises to Tenant on the Commencement Date, the commencement
of the Lease Term will be postponed, without liability to either party or
affecting the validity of this Lease, and the term shall begin on such date as
Landlord is able to deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Tenant;
provided, that Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease without
further liability of Landlord or Tenant if Landlord is unable to deliver
possession of the Leased Premises within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
scheduled Commencement Date of July 15, 2000.

            3.3 Lease Extension.

                (a) Extension. Tenant may, at its option (if it is not then in
default under the Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period), extend
the Initial Lease Term for an additional sixty (60) month period commencing at
the end of the Initial Lease Term (the "Extended Term"). This option shall be
exercised, if at all, by Tenant's written notice (the "Option Notice") to
Landlord stating Tenant's exercise of its option, delivered not less than one
(1) year (nor more


                                       5
<PAGE>   6

than 15 months) prior to the end of the Initial Lease Term. The Extended Term
shall be upon all terms and conditions of this Lease (but with no further option
to extend) other than the Base Monthly Rental, which shall be the then fair
rental value of the Premises as determined in accordance with Section 3.3(b) and
adjusted in accordance with this Section 3.3(a). The Base Monthly Rental
determined in accordance with Section 3.3(b) shall be increased on the first day
of the second year of the Extended Term and each anniversary thereafter during
the Extended Term by three percent (3%).

                (b) Extended Monthly Rent. If within thirty (30) days after the
Landlord receives the Option Notice the parties agree to what the fair rental
value is, they shall immediately execute an Addendum to this Lease stating the
Base Monthly Rental during the Extended Term. If the parties are unable to agree
on the minimum monthly rent for the Extended Term within such 30-day period,
then within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of that period each party, at
its cost and by giving notice to the other party, shall appoint a commercial
real estate broker ("Appraiser") with at least five years full time commercial
appraisal or brokerage in the Mountain View, California area to appraise and set
the minimum monthly rent for the Extended Term. Each Appraiser shall deliver
their appraisal within thirty (30) days after expiration of the selection of the
Appraisers. If the higher appraisal of rental value is not more than 105% of the
lowest as to the fair rental value, then the average of their appraised value
shall be adopted by the parties. If the higher appraisal is greater than 105% of
the lower then the two Appraisers shall appoint a third Appraiser with similar
qualifications who has not previously represented either party, and who shall
appraise the Leased Premises to determine its fair rental value, and the two
closest in dollar terms of the three offered values shall be averaged and
adopted by the parties as the fair rental value for the purposes of determining
the Base Monthly Rental during the Extended Term. The parties shall equally
share the costs and expenses of the third Appraiser.

                                    SECTION 4
                                      RENT

            4.1 Base Monthly Rental/Prepaid Rent. Subject to the increases
described in Section 4.2, Tenant shall pay Landlord One Hundred Four Thousand
Twenty-Five Dollars ($104,025) as "Base Monthly Rental", in advance, on the
first (1st) day of each calendar month commencing on the Commencement Date and
continuing throughout the Lease Term. The Base Monthly Rental is based on an
amount equal to Three and 65/100 Dollars ($3.65) per square foot multiplied by
the Leased Premises (i.e., initially, agreed and deemed to be 28,500 square
feet). Upon execution of the Lease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a check in
the amount of the Base Monthly Rental which Landlord shall apply towards
Tenant's prepayment of the first payment of Base Monthly Rental. For purposes of
the calculation of the Base Monthly Rental (and other amounts under this Lease),
Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that the approximate square footage of
the Leased Premises set forth in Section 1.2 is deemed to be the actual square
footage of the Leased Premises.

            4.2 Annual Adjustment/Adjustment Of Base Monthly Rental. The Base
Monthly Rental shall be increased during the Initial Lease Term as follows: (a)
on the first day of the second year of the Initial Lease Term and each
anniversary thereafter through the fifth year of the Initial Lease Term, Eleven
Cents ($.11) per rentable square foot per year (i.e., $3,135); and (b) on the
first day of the sixth year of the Initial Lease Term and each anniversary
thereafter during the Initial lease Term, Twelve Cents ($.12) per rentable
square foot per year (i.e., $3,420).

            4.3 Additional Rent. In addition to the Base Monthly Rental, Tenant
shall pay to Landlord as additional rent ("Additional Rent") the amounts
described in Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6.


                                       6
<PAGE>   7
                (a) Billing. Tenant shall pay, as Rent, Tenant's Pro Rata Share
of Operating Expenses. At Landlord's election, Tenant shall pay Operating
Expenses by one or more of the following methods: (i) paying the invoice for
such expenses submitted to Tenant by Landlord; (ii) Landlord may bill Tenant on
a periodic basis, and Tenant shall pay such bill within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof; and/or (iii) Landlord may deliver to Tenant a written estimate
of any such expenses which Landlord anticipates will be paid or incurred for the
ensuing calendar or fiscal year, and Tenant shall pay such estimated expenses in
equal monthly installments along with the payment of installments of Base
Monthly Rent. Landlord may change the billing method from time to time in
Landlord's sole discretion on not less than thirty (30) days' notice.

                (b) Operating Expenses. The term "Operating Expenses" shall
mean: (i) all of Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses of operation, repair
and maintenance of the Property (including the Common Area) as determined by
Landlord in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or other
recognized accounting principles, consistently applied, including, without
limitation, (1) maintenance and other services, (2) power, water, waste disposal
and other utilities (to the extent not paid directly by Tenant), (3) materials
and supplies, (4) maintenance and repairs (including, but not limited to,
non-structural repairs and maintenance of the roof), and (5) the cost of all
insurance (excluding earthquake), which Landlord or Landlord's lender deems
necessary for the Property and any deductible portion of an insured loss; (ii)
costs, or a portion thereof, properly allocable to the Building of any capital
improvements made to the Property by Landlord which comprise labor-saving
devices or other equipment intended to improve the operating efficiency of any
system within the Building (such as an energy management computer system), which
costs shall be amortized over the useful life thereof without interest; and
(iii) costs properly allocable to the Property of any capital improvements made
to the Property by Landlord that are required under any governmental law or
regulation that was not applicable to the Property at the time of the
Commencement Date, or that are reasonably required for the health and safety of
tenants in the Building, the costs, or allocable portion thereof, to be
amortized over the useful life thereof (as determined by generally accepted
accounting principles), together with interest upon the unamortized balance at
the prime rate as announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal at the
commencement of such capital improvement plus one (1) basis point or such higher
rate as may have been paid by Landlord on funds borrowed for the purpose of
constructing the capital improvements; and (iv) the management fee described in
Section 4.5. Operating Expenses shall not include any of the following items:
depreciation on the Property, including personal property; costs of tenant
improvements; real estate brokers' commissions; professional and administrative
fees (excluding fees to the extent arising from the acts or omissions of
Tenant); and work other than that caused by the acts or omissions of Tenant or
Tenant's agents, employees or contractors, and capital items other than those
referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) above. For purposes of this Lease,
"capital items" shall mean those items which would be capitalized pursuant to
generally accepted accounting principles.

                (c) Estimated Operating Expenses. During December of each
calendar year during the Term, or as soon thereafter as practicable, Landlord
may give Tenant written notice of Landlord's good faith estimate of the Tenant's
Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses for the ensuing calendar year. On or before
the first day of each month during the ensuing calendar year, Tenant shall pay
to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12) of the estimated amount; provided, that if notice
is not given in December, Tenant shall continue to pay on the basis of the then
applicable Rent until the month after the notice is given. If at any time it
appears to Landlord that the increased amount payable for the current calendar
year will vary from Landlord's estimate by more than five percent (5%), Landlord
may give notice to Tenant of Landlord's revised estimate for the year, and
subsequent payments by Tenant for the year shall be based on the revised
estimate; provided, that Landlord shall not give notice of a revised estimate
for any year more frequently than once a calendar quarter.


                                       7
<PAGE>   8
                (d) Adjustments To Operating Expenses. Within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the close of each calendar year of the Lease Term, or as soon
after the one hundred twenty (120) day period as practicable, Landlord shall
deliver to Tenant a statement of the adjustment to the Operating Expenses for
the prior calendar year. If, on the basis of the statement, Tenant owes an
amount that is less than the estimated payments for the calendar year previously
made by Tenant, Landlord shall apply the excess to the next payment of Tenant's
Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses due (or refund such excess to Tenant within
thirty (30) days if the Lease has terminated). If, on the basis of the
statement, Tenant owes an amount that is more than the estimated payments for
the calendar year previously made by the Tenant, Tenant shall pay the deficiency
to Landlord within thirty (30) days after delivery of the statement. The
statement of the Tenant's Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses shall be presumed
correct and shall be deemed final and binding upon Tenant unless (i) Tenant in
good faith objects in writing thereto within sixty (60) days after delivery of
the statement to Tenant (which writing shall state, in reasonable detail, all of
the reasons for the objection); and (ii) Tenant pays in full, within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the statement to Tenant, any amount owed by Tenant with
respect to the statement which is not in dispute. Landlord shall provide Tenant
with such supporting information as Tenant may reasonably request in connection
with such statement, at Tenant's sole cost. If Tenant objects to Landlord's
allocation to this Property of the cost of self-insurance or blanket insurance,
such allocation shall nonetheless be presumed correct and shall be deemed final
and binding upon Tenant unless Tenant's timely written objection includes
credible evidence that Landlord could have obtained substantially comparable
insurance coverage for this Property alone at lower cost. If the Tenant objects
in good faith, then such dispute shall be resolved by accountants selected by
the procedure set forth in Section 3.3(b), except that three accountants
selected shall (i) be certified public accountants with at least five (5) years
experience in the commercial real estate industry and (ii) determine by majority
vote whether the Landlord's or Tenant's statement is deemed correct.

            4.4 Additional Rent/Real Property Taxes. Tenant shall pay, as Rent,
the Tenant's Pro Rata Share of Real Property Taxes in accordance with Section 6,
which Tenant's Pro Rata Share is initially agreed to be One Hundred Percent
(100%) unless and until Tenant leases less than 100% of the Building. Tenant
shall also pay as Additional Rent to Landlord an amount equal to Landlord's
share of consideration received by Tenant for assignments and sublettings, legal
fees and costs that Tenant is obligated to pay or reimburse to Landlord, and any
other reimbursement items under this Lease.

            4.5 Property Management Fee. Landlord shall provide property
management services, including management of the Common Area (if any),
supervision of Operating Expenses and general management and administrative
services. In consideration for Landlord's property management services, Tenant
shall pay Landlord a property management fee equal to three and one-half percent
(3.5%) of the Base Monthly Rental (the "Property Management Fee"). The Property
Management Fee shall be paid in accordance with Section 4.8.

            4.6 Late Payment. Any sum of Base Monthly Rental or Additional Rent
payable under this Lease by Tenant that is not paid on or before the fifth (5th)
day of the month shall be subject to a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of
the late payment; provided that Landlord shall provide Tenant with one (1)
written notice of nonpayment per calendar year before imposing the late charge,
which charge shall be applied on the fifth (5th) day after the date of such
written notice.

            4.7 Security Deposit. Upon the execution of this Lease, Tenant shall
deliver to Landlord as a security deposit One Hundred Four Thousand Twenty-Five
Dollars ($104,025) (the "Security Deposit"). Landlord shall hold the Security
Deposit as security for Tenant's faithful performance of all the terms of this
Lease by it to be observed and performed. Tenant shall not mortgage, assign,
transfer, or encumber the Security Deposit without Landlord's prior written
consent. Any of these acts by Tenant shall be without effect and shall not be
binding upon


                                       8
<PAGE>   9

Landlord. If Tenant is in default pursuant to Section 12 of this Lease beyond
the applicable notice and cure period, then Landlord may, at Landlord's option
and without prejudice to any other remedy, appropriate and apply the entire
Security Deposit or so much of it as may be necessary to remedy such default or
to compensate Landlord for loss or damage sustained by Landlord as a result of
such default. Under such circumstances, Landlord may require Tenant to restore
the Security Deposit to its original amount. If Tenant complies with all of the
terms and promptly pays all amounts when due under the Lease, the Security
Deposit, shall be returned in full to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the
end of the Lease Term. If bankruptcy or other debtor-creditor proceedings
against Tenant occur, the Security Deposit shall be offset against any unpaid
amounts due under this Lease. Landlord shall not be deemed a trustee of the
Security Deposit, and Landlord may use the Security Deposit in Landlord's
ordinary business and shall not be required to segregate it from general
accounts. Tenant shall not be entitled to any interest on the Security Deposit.
If Landlord transfers the Building and/or Property during the Lease Term,
Landlord shall pay the Security Deposit to Landlord's successor in interest in
accordance with Civil Code Sec. 1950.7 or any successor statute, in which event
the transferring Landlord shall be released from all liability for the return of
the Security Deposit.

            4.8 Payment of Rent. All rent and Property Management Fees required
to be paid in monthly installments shall be paid in advance on the first (1st)
day of each calendar month during the Lease Term. All rent shall be paid in
lawful money of the United States, without any abatement, deduction or offset
whatsoever, except to the extent expressly permitted hereunder and without any
prior demand therefor. Tenant's failure to timely pay Additional Rent shall be
treated the same as the failure to timely pay Base Monthly Rent, and Landlord
shall have the same rights and remedies as Landlord would have for failure to
pay Base Monthly Rent when due. All rent shall be paid by check delivered to
Landlord at 105 South Drive, Suite 200, Mountain View, California 94040 or at
such other place as Landlord may designate from time to time. Tenant's
obligation to pay rent shall be prorated at the commencement and expiration of
the Lease Term.

                                    SECTION 5
                                USE AND UTILITIES

            5.1 Common Area Use. Tenant and its employees, invitees and
customers may, together with other tenants in the Building, if any, make
reasonable use of any Common Area (if any). This right shall terminate upon the
termination of this Lease. Landlord reserves the right to, from time to time,
make changes to the shape, size, location, extent and amount of Common Area (if
any); provided that such changes shall not materially decrease Tenant's
available parking area or otherwise materially adversely affect Tenant's
occupancy. Tenant and its employees and customers shall comply with all
regulations reasonably promulgated by Landlord for use of the Common Area (if
any), and such regulations shall become a part of this Lease when received by
Tenant. The rules and regulations shall be binding upon Tenant upon delivery to
Tenant of a copy of such rules, and Tenant shall observe and abide by such
rules. Such rules may be reasonably amended by Landlord from time to time, with
or without advance notice, and all amendments shall be effective upon delivery
to Tenant. Tenant shall have the exclusive use of one hundred percent (100%) of
the parking spaces on the Property. Tenant shall not abandon, and shall not
permit to be abandoned, any inoperative vehicles or equipment on any portion of
the Property. Tenant shall make no alterations, improvements or additions to the
Common Area (if any) without Landlord's prior written consent. No portion of the

                              REAL PROPERTY TAXES

            6.1 Real Property Taxes Defined. The term "Real Property Taxes", as
used in this Lease, shall mean: (i) all taxes, assessments, levies and other
charges of any kind or nature whatsoever, general and special, foreseen and
unforeseen (including all installments of principal and interest required to pay
any general or special assessments for public improvements and any increases
resulting from reassessments caused by any change in ownership) now or hereafter
imposed by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority or special district
having the direct or indirect power to tax or levy assessments, which are levied
or assessed against, or with respect to the value, occupancy or use of all, or
any portion of the Property (as now constructed or as may at any time hereafter
be constructed, altered or otherwise changed), or Landlord's interest therein;
the fixtures, equipment and other property of Landlord, real or personal, that
are an integral part of and located on the Property; the gross receipts, income
or rentals from the Property; or the use of parking areas, public utilities or
energy within the Property and (ii) all charges, levies or fees imposed by
reason of environmental regulation or other governmental control of the
Property. If any Real Property Tax is based upon property or rents unrelated to
the Property, then only that part of such Real Property Tax that is fairly
allocable to the Property shall be included within the meaning of the term "Real
Property Taxes". Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Real Property Taxes"
shall not include estate, inheritance, transfer, gift or franchise taxes of
Landlord, or the federal or state net income tax imposed on Landlord's income
from all sources.

            6.2 Payment of Real Property Taxes by Tenant.

                (a) Tenant shall pay, as Rent, the Tenant's Pro Rata Share of
Real Property Taxes.

                (b) Landlord may cause Tenant to pay Real Property Taxes in
accordance with any of the methods set forth in Section 4.4, or at Landlord's
election, as provided in this Section 6.2. During December of each calendar year
during the Lease Term, or as soon thereafter as practicable, Landlord may give
Tenant written notice of the amount of Real Property Taxes for the ensuing
calendar year. On or before the first day of each month during the ensuing
calendar year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12) of the estimated
amount; provided, that if notice is not given in December, Tenant shall continue
to pay on the basis of the then applicable Rent until the month after the notice
is given. If at any time it appears to Landlord that the increased amount
payable for the current calendar year will vary from Landlord's estimate by more
than five percent (5%), Landlord may give notice to Tenant of Landlord's revised
estimate for the year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for the year shall be
based on the revised estimate; provided, that Landlord shall not give notice of
a revised estimate for any year more frequently than once a calendar quarter.


                                       11
<PAGE>   12

                (c) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each
calendar year of the Lease Term, or as soon after the one hundred twenty (120)
day period as practicable, Landlord may deliver to Tenant a statement of the
adjustment to the Real Property Taxes for the prior calendar year; the statement
shall be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. If, on the basis of the
statement, Tenant owes an amount that is less than the estimated payments for
the calendar year previously made by Tenant, Landlord may apply the excess to
the next payment of increased Real Property Taxes due (or refund such excess to
Tenant within thirty (30) days if the Lease has terminated). If, on the basis of
the statement, Tenant owes an amount that is more than the estimated payments
for the calendar year previously made by Tenant, Tenant shall pay the deficiency
to Landlord within thirty (30) days after delivery of the statement.

                (d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Tenant shall pay
the full amount of any Real Property Taxes during the Lease Term resulting from
any and all alterations and tenant improvements of any kind whatsoever placed
in, on or about the Property for the benefit of, at the request of, or by
Tenant. Tenant shall pay, prior to delinquency, all taxes assessed or levied
against Tenant's personal property in, on or about the Property. When possible,
Tenant shall cause its personal property to be assessed and billed separately
from the real or personal property of Landlord.

                (e) Upon request by Tenant, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a
copy of the most recent tax bill for the Property. Tenant shall have the right
to contest the validity or amount of any Real Property Taxes payable for the
Property by appropriate proceeding diligently conducted in good faith. Under no
circumstances shall Tenant join Landlord as a party to such proceedings. If
Tenant undertakes any such contest, Tenant may withhold or defer payment or pay
under protest; provided, that upon the request of the Landlord, prior to
delinquency of the Real Property Taxes in question Tenant shall obtain and
deliver to Landlord a good and sufficient surety bond or other assurance of
payment protecting Landlord and the Property from any lien, claim, demand, loss,
cost, liability or expense which Landlord or the Property might suffer or incur
as a consequence of the withheld or protested payment. Upon termination of any
contest, Tenant shall pay the amount finally determined to be payable, together
with all fines, interest, penalties or other charges incurred or payable as a
result thereof. Landlord shall not be subject to any liability for the payment
of any costs or expenses in connection with any such proceedings, and Tenant
will indemnify, protect, defend by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord
and hold Landlord harmless from any such costs and expenses, reimbursing
Landlord therefor upon demand unless Landlord has initiated the proceedings.
Tenant shall be entitled to any refund of any Real Property Taxes and penalties
or interest from any governmental authority to the extent the refund represents
monies paid to the governmental authority by Tenant or paid by Landlord and
fully reimbursed by Tenant. In addition, Tenant shall be entitled to recover
from any Real Property Taxes the reasonable cost (but in no event greater than
the savings obtained) in obtaining such refund.

                6.3 Taxes on Tenant's Property. Tenant shall pay, before
delinquency, any and all taxes, assessments, license fees and public charges
levied, assessed or imposed against Tenant or Tenant's estate in this Lease, or
the property of Tenant situated within the Leased Premises, which become due
during the Lease Term. On demand by Landlord, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with
satisfactory evidence of these payments.

                   INSURANCE, SUBROGATION AND INDEMNIFICATION

            7.1 Tenant's Insurance. Tenant shall maintain in full force and
effect during the Lease Term the following insurance:


                                       12
<PAGE>   13

                (a) A policy or policies of comprehensive general liability
insurance, including property damage, against liability for personal injury,
bodily injury, death and damage to property occurring in or about, or resulting
from an occurrence in or about the Leased Premises or resulting from Tenant's
use or occupancy of the Leased Premises, with combined single limit coverage of
not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).

                (b) A policy or policies of fire and property damage insurance
in so called "fire and extended coverage" form with a sprinkler leakage
endorsement (if the Building contains fire sprinklers) insuring its personal
property, inventory, trade fixtures and leasehold improvements within the Leased
Premises for the full replacement value thereof. The proceeds from any of such
policies shall be used for the repair or replacement of such items so insured;
provided that if the Lease shall terminate as a result of such insured loss, the
proceeds shall be the property of Tenant.

                (c) (intentionally omitted].

                (d) Workers' compensation and any other employee benefit
insurance sufficient to comply with all laws.

                (e) Landlord, and such others it designates, shall be named as
additional insured on the policies of insurance described in this Section 7.1
(a) and (b). All insurance required by this Section 7.1 shall: (i) as to the
liability insurance only, be primary insurance which provides that the insurer
shall be liable for the full amount of the loss, up to and including the total
amount of liability set forth in the declarations without the right of
contribution from any other insurance coverage of Landlord; (ii) provide that
such policies shall not be subject to cancellation or change, except after at
least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Landlord; and (iii) not have a
"deductible" in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) on property insurance
and Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) on liability insurance per
occurrence. Each such policy shall also contain a waiver of any right of
subrogation against Landlord. Copies of such policy or policies, or duly
executed certificates for them, together with satisfactory evidence of the
payment of the premium thereon, shall be deposited with Landlord prior to the
time Tenant enters into possession of the Leased Premises, and upon renewal of
such policies, but not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
term of such coverage.

                (f) Any insurance coverage required of Tenant in this Section
7.1 may be satisfied by a blanket policy or policies of insurance, provided that
the total amounts of insurance available with respect to the Property and
Tenant's liability under this Lease shall be at least the equivalent of separate
policies carried in the amounts required in this Lease.

            7.2 Landlord's Insurance.

                (a) Landlord shall maintain, as the minimum coverage required of
it by this Lease, a policy or policies of fire and property damage insurance, in
so-called "fire and extended coverage" form, insuring Landlord (and such others
as Landlord may designate) from physical damage to the Building including the
leasehold improvements made thereto at the commencement of the Lease Term, with
coverage of not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the full replacement
value thereof; provided, that such insurance may have a deductible in a
commercially reasonable amount. Landlord may so insure the Building separately,
or may insure the Building with other buildings and improvements within the
Property which Landlord elects to insure together under the same policy or
policies. Landlord shall not be required to cause such insurance to cover any
trade fixtures, leasehold improvements (except as provided above) or any
inventory or other personal property of Tenant.


                                       13
<PAGE>   14


                (b) Landlord shall maintain, as minimum coverage, comprehensive
general liability insurance, including property damage, against liability for
personal injury, bodily injury, death and damage occurring in or about, or
resulting from, an occurrence in or about the Leased Premises, with combined
single-limit coverage of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).

            7.3 Release and Waiver of Subrogation: Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Lease, the parties hereto release each other, and their
respective agents, employees and contractors, from any claims for injury to any
persons or damage to property that are caused by or result from risks insured
against under any insurance policies carried by the parties and in force at the
time of such damage, but only to the extent such claims are covered by such
insurance. This release shall be in effect only so long as the applicable
insurance policies contain a clause to the effect that this release shall not
affect the right of the insured to recover under such policies. Each party shall
cause each insurance policy obtained by it to provide that the insurance company
waives all rights of recovery by way of subrogation against either party in
connection with any damage covered by such policy, so long as such waiver is
available without unreasonable, additional cost. In the event any party is
unable to so obtain such waiver, such party shall notify the other, in writing,
and the other party may, if it so desires, obtain such waiver by payment of any
additional premium therefor.

            7.4 Limitation on Landlord's Liability and Indemnity. Except to the
extent of Landlord's active neglect or greater culpability, Landlord shall not
be liable to Tenant for, and Tenant hereby releases Landlord and its members,
managers, officers, employees, agents and representatives from any liability for
(a) any injury to or damage suffered by Tenant, Tenant's agents,
representatives, employees, contractors or invitees; (b) any damage to Tenant's
property or business due to any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited
to, the failure or destruction of any utilities such gas, electrical, water,
mechanical systems (e.g., HVAC), etc.; and (c) the failure to provide security
or the blockage of the Property. Tenant hereby waives the application of Civil
Code Section 1542, which provides that:

               "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
               does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
               executing the release, which, if known by him, must have
               materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

Commencing upon Tenant's entry on the Leased Premises, Tenant shall indemnify
Landlord and its officers, members, agents, representatives and employees, and
hold them harmless from all losses, claims, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and costs) and damages
(collectively, "Losses" or, separately, a "Loss") arising out of the use,
occupancy or enjoyment of the Leased Premises by Tenant or any licensee,
invitee, employee, contractor, representative, or agent of Tenant, except that
which is caused by the active neglect or greater culpability of Landlord, or
arising out of Tenant's failure to perform any of its obligations under this
Lease. Tenant waives any right to recover from Landlord for any such Loss to any
person or property, including loss of income; it being Tenant's right and
obligation to insure against such Loss, by reason of the use, occupancy or
enjoyment of the Premises by Tenant, or any licensee, invitee, agent or employee
of Tenant. This indemnity shall survive the termination or expiration of this
Lease.

be responsible for maintaining and repairing the roof, including damage
resulting in leaks. This Section shall in no way limit Landlord's right to
charge Tenant the costs of such repairs as Additional Rent. Landlord shall
maintain the Common Areas (if any) in good condition at all times. The manner in
which the Common Area shall be maintained and the expenditures for such
maintenance shall be at the reasonable discretion of Landlord, consistent with
other first class office building in the same geographic area. Landlord shall
have the right to establish and enforce reasonable rules and regulations
applicable to all tenants concerning maintenance, management, use, and operation
of the Common Areas; and to close temporarily any of the Common Areas for
maintenance purposes. Landlord shall bill Tenant for Tenant's share of Operating
Expenses for the Common Area as provided in Section 4.3. Landlord shall not be
liable for any failure to make any such repairs or to perform any maintenance
unless such failure shall persist for an unreasonable time after receipt of
notice of the need of such repairs.

            8.3 Tenant's Obligations. Tenant shall have the following
obligations with respect to the Leased Premises:

                (a) Except as provided in Section 8.2 of this Lease, Tenant

maintain in good order the Leased Premises and the Building including, without
limitation: (i) all interior walls, floors and ceilings; (ii) all windows,

provide Landlord with a copy of such service contract and all periodic service
reports. At Landlord's request, Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost, shall hire a
licensed contractor to regularly and periodically inspect and perform
maintenance on the HVAC, or Landlord may contract for such services itself and
charge such costs to Tenant as Additional Rent.

                (e) Tenant waives all rights to make repairs at the expense of
the Landlord and to deduct the cost of such repairs from the Rent and
specifically waives all rights under Sections 1941 and 1942 of the California
Civil Code or any similar law regarding a Tenant's right to make repairs and
deduct the cost of such repairs from the Rent. (Without in any way limiting the
effect of the foregoing waiver, the parties acknowledge and agree that in the
case of an emergency, Tenant may make a repair that Landlord is otherwise
required to make and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs
thereof. In the absence of an "emergency", Tenant shall not be reimbursed. For
purposes of this Section 83(e), "emergency" shall mean (i) material damage to
the Leased Premises (not caused by Tenant) which results in an immediate threat
to life, serious bodily injury or material damage to a substantial portion of
Tenant's personal property or fixtures and (ii) Tenant has made repeated and
reasonable, but unsuccessful, attempts to notify Landlord. However, if Tenant
successfully notifies Landlord, then Landlord shall, in good faith, determine
whether an emergency exists. For purposes of an emergency under this Section
83(e), notice shall be deemed proper if notice is given by telephone and
promptly confirmed in writing by fax by an authorized officer.) There shall be
no allowance to Tenant for diminution of rental value, and no liability on the
part of Landlord by reason of inconvenience, annoyance or injury to business
arising from the making of or the failure to make, any repairs, alterations,
decorations, additions or improvements in or to any portion of the Leased
Premises or the Building or Common Area (or any of the areas used in connection
with the operation thereof, or in or to any fixtures, appurtenances or
equipment), or by reason of the negligence of Tenant or any other tenant or
occupant of the Property. In no event shall Landlord be responsible for any
consequential damages arising or alleged to have arisen from any of the
foregoing matters. Tenant hereby agrees that Landlord shall not be liable for
injury to Tenant's business or any loss of income therefrom or for damage to the
goods, wares, merchandise or other property of Tenant, Tenant's employees,
invitees, customers, or any other person in or about the Leased Premises, the
Building, or the Common Area, nor shall Landlord be liable for injury to the
person of Tenant, Tenant's employees, agents or contractors whether such damage
or injury is caused by or results from fire, steam, electricity, gas, water or
rain, or from the breakage, leakage, obstruction or other defects of pipes,
sprinklers, wires, appliances, plumbing, air conditioning or lighting fixtures,
or from any other cause, whether such damage or injury results from any other
cause, whether such damage or injury results from conditions arising upon the
Property or upon other portions of the Building, or from other sources or places
and regardless of whether the cause of such damage or injury or the means of
repairing the same is inaccessible to Tenant, except to the extent any of the
foregoing arises from the gross negligence of Landlord. Landlord shall not be
liable for any damages arising from any act or neglect of any other tenant, if
any, of the Building or the Property.

                (f) Tenant shall obtain and pay for all permits required for
Tenant's occupancy of the Property, other than permits relating to the physical
condition of the Property, and shall take all actions necessary to comply with
all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders and requirements
regulating the use by Tenant of the Property, including any occupational safety
and health laws, provided that Tenant shall not be obligated to make any
physical changes in, or improvements to, the Property unless such changes or
improvements are required solely by reason of the unique nature of Tenant's use
of the Property (as opposed to standard office and research and development
usage).

shall surrender to Landlord the Leased Premises broom clean, in the same
condition as they existed on the date of completion of the Tenant Improvements
described in Section 2.3, together with such changes as are permitted to remain
pursuant to this Lease, excepting only such ordinary wear and tear as could not
have been avoided by routine maintenance.

                (i) It is the intention of Landlord and Tenant that, at all
times during the Term, Tenant shall maintain the Property in an attractive first
class and fully operative condition. Tenant's repair obligation is unconditional
and does not depend on whether the repairs are necessitated by Tenant's use or
whether the means of repair or item needing repair is readily accessible to
Tenant. If Tenant fails to perform proper maintenance or repair, including
preventative maintenance where appropriate, Landlord may, after seven (7) days
written notice to Tenant (or without notice for emergency repairs), cause the
same to be performed, and the cost thereof will promptly be paid by Tenant upon
receipt of a statement from Landlord setting forth the amount due. Any such
amount shall be deemed additional rent.

        Landlord shall have no maintenance or repair obligations whatsoever with
respect to the Leased Premises except as expressly provided in Section 8.2.
Tenant shall, upon Landlord's request, provide Landlord with copies of all
maintenance and service reports and records, including, but not limited to,
electrical and HVAC reports.

                                    SECTION 9
                    TRADE FIXTURES AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

            9.1 Trade Fixtures and Leasehold Improvements. Tenant shall not
construct any leasehold improvements or additions or otherwise alter the Leased
Premises without Landlord's prior written approval, which approval may be
withheld in Landlord's reasonable discretion; provided that Tenant may make
non-structural improvements of up to Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) to
the Leased Premises without Landlord's consent, if Tenant has provided Landlord
with (a) copies of all such plans and specifications and (b) a certificate of an
authorized officer of Tenant certifying that all permits, consents and required
approvals for such Improvements have been obtained and do not violate any laws
or this Lease. In no event shall Tenant make any alterations to the Leased
Premises which could affect the structural integrity or the design of the
Building without Landlord's prior consent. All such approved leasehold
Improvements shall be installed by Tenant at Tenant's expense using a licensed
contractor. All construction done by Tenant shall be done in accordance with all
laws (including valid building permits issued by the appropriate governmental
authority) and in a good and workmanlike manner, using new materials of good
quality. All leasehold Improvements shall remain the property of Tenant during
the Lease Term. At the termination of this Lease, the alterations, additions and
improvements made by Tenant shall remain on the Leased Premises and become the
property of Landlord, except that at Landlord's option, Specialized Improvements
and Reserved Improvements (as described in Section 2.4), shall be removed by
Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense, and Tenant shall restore the portions
of the Leased Premises affected by such Reserved Improvements and/or Specialized
Improvements to their prior condition. (Tenant and Landlord acknowledge and
agree that the items described in Sections 5.2 and 14.16 shall be removed and
the Leased Premises, Building and Property shall be restored to Landlord's
complete satisfaction, determined in Landlord's sole discretion.) Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all heating, lighting, electrical
(including all wiring, conduit, outlets, drops, buss, ducts, main and
subpanels), air conditioning, partitioning, drapery, and carpet installations
made by Tenant regardless of how affixed to the Leased Premises, together with
all other additions, alterations and improvements that have become an integral
part of the Building, shall be and become the property of the Landlord upon
termination of the Lease, and shall not be deemed trade fixtures, and shall
remain upon and be surrendered with the Leased Premises at the termination of
this Lease. If during the Lease Term, any alteration, addition or change to the
Common Area is required by law, regulation, ordinance or order of any public
agency, Landlord shall make the same and the costs of such alteration, addition
or change shall be a Common Area charge and Tenant shall pay its share of its
costs as provided in Section 4.3 above. Landlord may require Tenant to post a
payment and performance bond for one and one-half (1.5) times the estimated cost
of all work prior to commencement of any work by Tenant on the Leased Premises,
provided Tenant shall not be required to post such a bond if Tenant has a net
worth in excess of $11,000,000 or otherwise provides adequate assurance that
Tenant's share of any improvement costs will be timely paid.

            9.2 Landlord's Improvements. All fixtures, improvements or equipment
which are installed, constructed on or attached to the Property by Landlord, at
its expense, shall become a part of the realty and belong to Landlord.

            9.3 Liens. Tenant shall keep the Leased Premises and the Property
free from any liens and shall pay when due all bills arising out of any work
performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by Tenant, its agents,
employees or contractors relating to the Leased Premises. If any claim of lien
is recorded, Tenant shall bond against or discharge the same within ten (10)
days after the same has been recorded against the Leased Premises and/or the
Property. Tenant shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold Landlord and the
Property harmless and free from any liens, claims, liabilities, demands,
encumbrances, or judgments created or suffered by reason of any labor or
services performed for, materials used by or furnished to, Tenant or any
contractor employed by Tenant with respect to the Property. Tenant shall give
notice to Landlord in writing five (5) days prior to employing any laborer or
contractor to perform services related to, or receiving materials for use upon
the Property. Tenant shall permit Landlord to post a notice of
non-responsibility in accordance with the statutes or requirements of California
Civil Code Section 3094 or any amendment thereof.

            9.4 Signs. Tenant may, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, install
and maintain on the Property during the Lease Term a monument and building
facade sign with Tenant's name and logo, subject to compliance with the
requirements of the City of Mountain View and Landlord's consent, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant will not install any exterior signs
except in conformance with Landlord's reasonable rules and regulations. Signs
installed by Tenant not conforming to Landlord's rules and regulations may be
removed and/or replaced by Landlord at Tenant's cost.

                                   SECTION 10
                           DAMAGE TO LEASED PREMISES

            10.1 Landlord's Duty to Restore. If the Leased Premises and Building
are damaged by any peril after the Commencement Date of this Lease, Landlord
shall restore the same to a similar condition as existed prior to such damage,
unless the Lease is terminated by Landlord pursuant to Section 10.2, or by
Tenant, pursuant to Section 10.3. All insurance proceeds available from the fire
and property damage insurance carried by Landlord pursuant to Section 7.2, shall
be paid to and become the property of Landlord. If this Lease is not terminated,
then upon receipt of the insurance proceeds (if the loss is covered by
insurance) and the issuance of all necessary governmental permits, Landlord
shall commence and diligently proceed to complete the restoration of the Leased
Premises and/or Building, to the extent then allowed by law, to substantially
the same condition in which the Leased Premises and/or Building were immediately
prior to such damage. Landlord's obligation to restore shall be limited to the
Leased Premises and/or Building approved as they existed as of the Commencement
Date, leasehold improvements, trade fixtures and/or personal property
constructed or installed by Tenant in the Leased Premises; provided that
Landlord shall restore such leasehold improvements, trade fixtures and/or
personal property to the extent covered by the insurance policies described in
Section 7.2. Tenant shall forthwith replace or fully repair all leasehold
improvements and trade fixtures installed by Tenant and existing at the time of
such damage or destruction, to the extent not covered by Landlord as described
in the preceding sentence.

            10.2 Landlord's Right to Terminate. Landlord shall have the option
to terminate this Lease in the event any of the following occurs, which option
may be exercised only by


                                       19
<PAGE>   20

delivery to Tenant of a written notice of election to terminate within thirty
(30) days after the date of discovery of such damage:

                (a) The Building is damaged by any peril to such an extent that
the estimated cost to restore the Building exceeds the lesser of (i) the
insurance proceeds available from insurance actually carried by Landlord (unless
Tenant, at its option, agrees to pay the differential) or (ii) fifty percent
(50%) of the then replacement value thereof.

                (b) The Building is damaged by any peril both (i) not covered by
the type of insurance Landlord is required to carry pursuant to Section 7.2 and
(ii) not covered by valid and collectible insurance actually carried by Landlord
and in force at the time of such damage or destruction.

                (c) The Leased Premises are materially damaged by any peril
within six (6) months of the last day of the Lease Term. For purposes of this
Section 10.2(c), "material" means that the damage, based on Landlord's good
faith estimate, cannot be completely repaired within sixty (60) days after the
date such damage occurs.

                (d) The Building is damaged by any peril and, because of the
laws then in force, the Building: (i) may not be restored at reasonable cost to
substantially the same condition in which it was prior to such damage (unless
Tenant, at its option, agrees to pay the differential); or (ii) may not be used
for the same use being made thereof before such damage, whether or not restored
as required by this Section 10.2.

            10.3 Tenant's Right to Terminate. If the Leased Premises are damaged
by any peril, and Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease, or is not
entitled to terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 10.2, then as soon as
reasonably practicable (using good faith efforts to expedite the matter),
Landlord shall furnish Tenant with the written opinion of Landlord's architect
or construction consultant as to when the restoration work required of Landlord
may be completed. Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease in the
event any of the following occurs, which option may be exercised only by
delivery to Landlord of a written notice of election to terminate within thirty
(30) days after Tenant receives from Landlord the estimate of the time needed to
complete such restoration:

                (a) The Leased Premises are damaged by any peril and, in the
reasonable opinion of Landlord's architect or construction consultant, the
restoration of the Leased Premises cannot be substantially completed within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such damage.

                (b) The Leased Premises are materially damaged by any peril
within six (6) months of the last day of the Lease Term. For purposes of this
Section 10.3(b), "material" shall have the same meaning as set forth in Section
10.2(c) above.

            10.4 Abatement of Rent. In the event of damage to the Leased
Premises which does not result in the termination of this Lease, the Base
Monthly Rental and Additional Rent as then adjusted shall be temporarily abated
during the period of restoration in proportion to the degree to which Tenant's
use of the Leased Premises is impaired by such damage. Tenant shall not be
entitled to any compensation or damages from Landlord for loss of Tenant's
property or any inconvenience or annoyance caused by such damage or restoration;
provided that Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
disruption to the operation of Tenant's business in the Leased Premises.
Landlord and Tenant hereby waive the provisions of Section 1932, Subdivision 2,
and Section 1933, Subdivision 2, and Section 1933, Subdivision 4, of the
California Civil Code and the provisions of similar laws hereinafter enacted.

                                   SECTION 11
                                 EMINENT DOMAIN

        If a public authority acquires all or any portion of the Premises
through eminent domain, or under threat thereof, and if Tenant's business may
not reasonably be continued on the portion of the Leased Premises not taken,
then this Lease shall terminate as of the date that the public authority becomes
entitled to possession of the property taken. In such event, Tenant shall be
entitled to receive such portion of the condemnation award as is designated by
the public authority as compensation for Tenant's trade fixtures, moving
expenses or loss of goodwill, and the balance of the condemnation award shall be
paid to Landlord.

                                   SECTION 12
                              DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

            12.1 Tenant's Default and Landlord's Remedies. The following
breaches by Tenant shall constitute material defaults entitling Landlord to the
remedies described in this Section:

                (i) abandonment of the Leased Premises;

                (ii) failure to pay rental or any other sum due Landlord within
five (5) business days after written notice by Landlord that such sum is past
due;

                (iii) a general assignment by Tenant for the benefit of
creditors or the commencement of any proceedings by or against Tenant under the
federal bankruptcy Code; or

                (iv) failure by Tenant to cure its breach of any other term,
condition or covenant of this Lease within a period of thirty (30) days after
the date of Landlord's written notice to Tenant of such breach is given;
provided if such default shall not be curable within such thirty (30) day
period, Tenant shall not be in default if Tenant shall have, within such thirty
(30)-day period, commenced cure of such default and shall thereafter pursue such
cure to completion. Upon any such default, Landlord may elect to terminate this
Lease and Tenant's right to possession of the Leased Premises, whereupon
Landlord may recover from Tenant: (a) the worth at the time of award of the
unpaid rent that had been earned at the time of termination; (b) the worth at
the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent, which would have been
earned after termination until the time of award, exceeds the amount of such
rental loss that Tenant proves could have reasonably been avoided; (c) the worth
at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of
the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
Tenant proves could reasonably be avoided; computed by discounting such amount
at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of
award, plus one percent (1%); or (d) any other amount necessary to compensate
Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform
its obligations under the Lease, or which, in the ordinary course of things,
would be likely to result therefrom. If Landlord does not specifically elect, in
writing, to terminate Tenant's right to possession after Tenant has defaulted,
Landlord may enforce all its rights and remedies under the Lease, including the
right to recover the rent as it comes due.

            12.2 Landlord's Default and Tenant's Remedies. If Landlord fails to
perform its obligations under this Lease, Landlord shall nevertheless not be in
default under the terms of this Lease until such time as Tenant shall have first
given Landlord written notice specifying the nature of such failure to perform
its obligations, and then only after Landlord shall have had thirty (30) days
after its receipt of such notice within which to perform such obligations;
provided that, if


                                       21
<PAGE>   22

longer than thirty (30) days is reasonably required in order to perform such
obligations, Landlord shall have such longer period as is reasonably necessary
so long as Landlord makes a good faith effort to commence such cure within such
thirty (30) day period and diligently pursue the cure to completion thereafter.
In the event of Landlord's default as described above, then, and only then,
Tenant may then proceed in equity or at law to compel Landlord to perform its
obligations and/or to recover damages approximately caused by such failure to
perform (except as and to the extent Tenant has waived its right to damages as
provided in this Lease). Tenant's recourse shall be limited to Landlord's
interest in the property.

            12.3 Waiver. One party's consent to or approval of any act by the
other party requiring consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render
unnecessary the other party's consent to or approval of any subsequent similar
act. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy accruing to
either party upon any breach by the other party under this Lease shall impair
such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver of any such breach theretofore,
or hereafter occurring. The waiver by either party of any breach of any
provision of this Lease shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent
breach of the same or any other provisions herein contained.

            12.4 Holding Over. The Lease shall terminate and become null and
void without notice upon the expiration of the Lease Term. If Tenant holds over
for any period after the Lease Term, Landlord may, at its option, treat Tenant
as a tenant from month-to-month commencing on the first day after the Lease
Term, subject to the conditions in the Lease at a rental amount of one hundred
and fifty percent (150%) of the last Base Monthly Rental, plus all other charges
(if any). If Tenant fails to surrender the Property, Tenant shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Landlord from and against any and all losses, claims
and liabilities resulting therefrom or thereafter.

                                   SECTION 13
                    ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING, SUBORDINATION

            13.1 Assignment and Subletting. Tenant shall not perform any of the
following acts without Landlord's prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld: (a) assign or sublet all or any portion of Tenant's
interest in this Lease or in the Leased Premises; (b) pledge, mortgage or
hypothecate its interest in the Leased Premises; and (c) perform or suffer any
other act whereby any right of Tenant under this Lease is transferred (which act
shall be deemed to be an assignment for the purposes of this Section 13.1).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may, without Landlord's consent, assign
this Lease or sublet all or any portion of the Premises to an Affiliate of
Tenant if Tenant guarantees the obligations of such Affiliate's performance of
this Lease (in a form of guaranty reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant)
or remains primarily liable under this Lease, at Landlord's option. A change in
control of Tenant shall be deemed an assignment subject to Landlord's consent.
For purposes of this Lease, "change in control" shall mean the sale or transfer
of substantially all of Tenants assets to an entity which has a net worth less
than the net worth of Tenant as of the Commencement Date; provided that Tenant
shall have the burden of establishing the net worth of the proposed assignee.
"Affiliate" means any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Tenant with
the power to direct the policies and management of such entity (including, but
not limited to, subsidiaries) or the surviving entity after the merger of Tenant
with or into another entity. Landlord's consent to any one assignment,
subletting, or other transfer shall not constitute consent to any subsequent
transfer. Any attempted subletting or assignment without Landlord's prior
written consent, at Landlord's election, shall constitute a default by Tenant
under the terms of this Lease. The acceptance of rent by Landlord from any
person or entity other than Tenant, or the acceptance of rent by Landlord from
Tenant with knowledge of a violation of this Section 13.1, shall not be deemed
to be a waiver by Landlord


                                       22
<PAGE>   23

of any provision of this Section 13.1 of this Lease or to be a consent to any
such subletting or assignment by Tenant. Without limiting the circumstances in
which it may be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to an assignment
or subletting, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that it shall be reasonable for
Landlord to withhold its consent in the following instances:

                (a) the proposed assignee or sublessee is a governmental agency;

                (b) in Landlord's reasonable judgment, the use of the Leased
Premises by the proposed assignee or sublessee will involve occupancy by other
than primarily general office personnel, would entail any alterations which
would lessen the value of the leasehold improvements in the Leased Premises, or
would require increased services by Landlord;

                (c) in Landlord's reasonable judgment, the proposed assignee
does not meet the credit standards supplied by Landlord;

                (d) the proposed assignee (or any other of its Affiliates) has
been in material default under a lease, has been in litigation with a previous
landlord, or in the ten (10) years prior to the assignment, has filed for
bankruptcy protection or has otherwise been involved in an insolvency
proceeding;

                (e) Landlord has experienced a previous default by or is in
litigation with the proposed assignee or sublessee;

                (f) in Landlord's reasonable judgment, the Leased Premises will
be used in a manner that will violate any negative covenant as to use contained
in this Lease;

                (g) the use of the Leased Premises will violate any applicable
law;

                (h) the proposed assignment or sublease fails to include all of
the terms and provisions reasonably required to be included by the Landlord;

                (i) Tenant is then in default of any obligation under this Lease
beyond the applicable notice and cure period, or Tenant has defaulted under this
Lease on three (3) or more occasions beyond the applicable notice and cure
period during the twelve (12) months preceding the date that Tenant requests
such consent; or

                (j) in the case of a subletting of less than the entire Leased
Premises, if the subletting will require improvements to be made which are
unacceptable to Landlord, in Landlord's reasonable discretion.

            13.2 Additional Rent. If Tenant assigns this Lease or subleases the
Premises, Tenant shall, in consideration therefor, pay to Landlord, as
additional rent:

                (a) In the case of an assignment (excluding an assignment to an
Affiliate), an amount equal to fifty percent (50%0) of all sums and other
consideration paid to Tenant by the assignee for, or by reason of, such
assignment (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
sums paid for the sale of Tenant's fixtures or leasehold improvements, less the
then net unamortized or undepreciated cost thereof determined on the basis of
Tenant's Federal income tax returns) less the costs actually incurred by Tenant
for commissions (at fair market rates) and reasonable attorneys' fees; and

                (b) In the case of a sublease (excluding subleases to
Affiliates), fifty percent (50%) of any rents, additional charges, or other
consideration payable under the sublease by the subtenant to Tenant that are in
excess of the rent and expenses accruing during the term of


                                       23
<PAGE>   24

the sublease in respect of the subleased space (at the rate per square foot
payable by Tenant under this lease) pursuant to the terms hereof (including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all sums paid for the sale or
rental of Tenant's fixtures or leasehold improvements, less, in the case of the
sale thereof, the then net unamortized or undepreciated cost thereof determined
on the basis of Tenant's federal income tax returns) less the costs actually
incurred by Tenant for commissions (at fair market rates) and reasonable
attorneys' fees, all such costs to be amortized without interest over the length
of the sublease term.

                The sums payable under Section 13.2(a) above shall be paid to
Landlord as and when received by Tenant. The sums payable under Section 13.2(b)
above shall be paid to Landlord as and when paid by the sublessee to Tenant.
Within thirty (30) days after written request therefor by Landlord, Tenant shall
at any time and from time to time furnish evidence to Landlord of the amount of
all such sums or other consideration received or expected to be received.

            13.3 Assignment By Landlord. Landlord and its successors in interest
shall have the right to transfer their interest in the Leased Premises and the
Property at any time and to any person or entity. In the event of any such
transfer, but only in the event the transferee, in writing, delivered to Tenant,
shall have assumed all liability of Landlord hereunder, the Landlord originally
named herein (and in the case of any subsequent transfer, the transferor) from
the date of such transfer, shall be automatically relieved, without any further
act by any person or entity, of all liability for the performance of the
obligations of Landlord hereunder which may accrue after the date of such
transfer.

            13.4 Subordination. This Lease is subject and subordinate to all
mortgages and deeds of trust which affect the Property and are of public record
as of the date of this Lease, and to all renewals, modifications,
consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof. However, if any lender
holding such mortgage or deed of trust shall advise Landlord that it desires or
requires this Lease to be prior and superior thereto, then, upon written request
of Landlord to Tenant, Tenant shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver
any and all documents or instruments which Landlord or such Lender reasonably
deems necessary to make this Lease prior thereto (provided no such document
shall alter, amend or modify any provision of this Lease). At Landlord's
election, this Lease shall become and thereafter remain subject and subordinate
to any and all future mortgages or deeds of trust affecting the Property which
may hereafter be executed and placed on public record after the effective date
of this Lease, or any renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements or
extensions thereof, for the full amount of all advances made or to be made
thereunder and without regard to the time or character of such advances, so long
as the Lender holding the mortgage or deed of trust to which this Lease is to be
subordinated agrees in writing that it will recognize Tenant's rights under this
Lease and not disturb its quiet possession of the Leased Premises so long as
Tenant is not in default hereunder. Tenant will, within fifteen (15) days after
Landlord's written request therefor, execute, acknowledge and deliver upon
request of Landlord any and all documents or instruments as described above.
Landlord shall use its best efforts to provide Tenant current lender information
and a nondisturbance and attornment agreement.

            13.5 Landlord's Recapture Right. Despite any other provision of this
Section 13, Landlord has the option, by written notice to Tenant (the "Recapture
Notice") within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of Tenant's desire to
sublet fifty percent (50%) or more of the Premises for a term in excess of three
(3) years, to recapture the Premises by terminating this Lease or taking an
assignment or sublease of the Premises from Tenant. A timely Recapture Notice
terminates this Lease or creates an assignment or a sublease for the Premises
for the same term as proposed by Tenant, effective as of the date specified in
Tenant's notice. If Landlord declines or fails to timely deliver a Recapture
Notice, Landlord shall have no further right under this Section 13.5 unless and
until Tenant's subsequent attempt to sublet such Premises. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Lease, this Section 13.5 shall not apply to a
transfer to an Affiliate.

                                   SECTION 14
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

            14.1 Landlord's Right to Enter. Landlord and its agents may enter
the Leased Premises at any reasonable time, but only upon twenty-four (24) hours
prior notice delivered during regular business hours, for the purpose of: (a)
inspecting the same; (b) posting notices of non-responsibility; (c) supplying
any service to be provided by Landlord to Tenant; (d) showing the Leased
Premises to prospective purchasers, mortgagees or, during the last nine (9)
months of the Lease Term, tenants; (e) making necessary alterations, additions
or repairs; (f) performing Tenant's obligation when Tenant has failed to do so
after written notice from Landlord; and for (g) placing upon the Leased Premises
ordinary "for lease" or "for sale" signs during the last nine (9) months of the
Lease Term. In case of an emergency, Landlord may enter the Leased Premises
without prior written notice, but shall notify Tenant as soon as possible and
shall take reasonable precautions to protect the security of Tenant's Premises.

            14.2 Surrender of the Leased Premises. Immediately prior to the
expiration, or upon the sooner termination of this Lease, Tenant shall vacate
and surrender the Leased Premises to Landlord in the condition required pursuant
to Section 2.4 above.

            14.3 Estoppel Certificates. At all times during the Lease Term,
Tenant will, following any request by Landlord, promptly execute and deliver to
Landlord an Estoppel Certificate: (a) certifying that this Lease is unmodified
and in full force and effect, or, if modified, stating the nature of such
modification and certifying that this Lease, as so modified, is in full force
and effect; (b) stating the date to which the rent and other charges are paid in
advance, if any; (c) acknowledging that there are not, to Tenant's knowledge,
any uncured defaults on the part of Landlord hereunder, or if there are uncured
defaults on the part of Landlord, stating the nature of such uncured defaults;
(d) the amount of Base Monthly Rent then in effect; and (e) certifying such
other information about the Lease as may be reasonably required by Landlord.
Tenant's failure to deliver an Estoppel Certificate within fifteen (15) days
after delivery of Landlord's request therefore shall be a conclusive admission
by Tenant that, as of the date of the request for such statement: (i) this Lease
is unmodified, except as may be represented by Landlord in such request and is
in full force and effect; (ii) there are no uncured defaults in Landlord's
performance; and (iii) no rent has been paid in advance.

            14.4 Notices. Any notice required or desired to be given regarding
this Lease shall be in writing and shall be personally served, or in lieu of
personal service, may be given by nationally recognized overnight courier
service or by certified mail addressed to the other party at the following

                                      105 S. Drive, Suite 200

                                      Attn.: Rodney C. Gilmore, Esq.

        If served by mail, such notice shall be deemed to have been given: (i)
on the third (3rd) business day after mailing if such notice was deposited in
the United States mail, certified and postage prepaid, addressed to the party to
be served at its address first above set forth; and (ii) in all other cases when
actually received. Either party may change its address by giving notice of same
in accordance with this Section 14.4.

            14.5 Attorneys' Fees. In the event either party brings any action or
legal proceeding (including arbitration) for an alleged breach of any provision
of this Lease, to recover rent, to terminate this Lease or to otherwise enforce,
protect or establish any term or covenant of this Lease, or right of either
party, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover as a part of such
action or proceedings, or in a separate action brought for that purpose,
reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs as may be fixed by the court or
arbitration. The prevailing party shall be determined by the court or
arbitrator, as the case may be.

            14.6 Prevention of Performance. If either party to this Lease is
prevented in any way from performing its responsibilities under the Lease
because of intervening circumstances substantively beyond its control -- such as
labor relations actions, failures of transmission of supplies or utilities,
physical governmental or military preemptions, civil disturbances, or the like
- -- such performance will be excused for the period during which the interruption
takes place, but must be resumed immediately after the end of the intervening
period. To the extent that such interruption does not physically prevent the
payment of any sums falling due and owing during such period, making of such
payments will not be excused. If any governmental body or agency imposes
structural improvement or other requirements which substantially increase the
cost of maintaining the Building in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, Landlord may terminate this Lease upon sixty (60) days notice to
Tenant, unless Tenant, at its option, elects to pay that portion of the cost
which is in excess of what Landlord would be willing to pay.

            14.7 Tenant's Remedy. If, as a consequence of a default by Landlord
under this Lease, Tenant recovers a money judgment against Landlord, such
judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon
execution of such judgment and levied thereon against the right, title and
interest of Landlord in the Building and out of Rent or other income from the
Building received by Landlord or out of consideration received by Landlord from
the sale of other disposition of all or any part of Landlord's right, title or
interest in the Building, and neither Landlord nor its members, partners,
owners, representatives or agents shall be liable for any deficiency.

            14.8 Mortgagee Protection. If Landlord defaults under this Lease,
Tenant will notify by registered or certified mail to any beneficiary of a deed
or trust or mortgagee covering the Building or the Property, of whom Tenant has
been notified in writing, and offer such beneficiary or mortgagee a reasonable
opportunity to cure the default, including time to obtain possession of the
Building by power of sale or a judicial foreclosure, or control of the Building
via appointment of a receiver if such should prove necessary to effect a cure.

            14.9 Acceptance. Delivery of this Lease, duly executed by Tenant,
constitutes an offer to lease the Leased Premises, and under no circumstances
shall such delivery be deemed to create an option or reservation to lease the
Leased Premises for the benefit of Tenant. This Lease shall only become
effective and binding upon full execution hereof by Landlord and delivery of a
signed copy to Tenant.

            14.10 Recording. Neither party shall record this Lease.

            14.11 Rules of Construction.

                (a) Time is of the essence.

                (b) The liability of multiple tenants or multiple landlords
shall be joint and several.

                (c) The rent payable under this Lease has been determined in
light of all other provisions hereof. The parties have had an equal opportunity
to review and comment upon the terms and provisions of this Lease; accordingly,
neither party shall be deemed the draftsman of this Lease, and there shall be no
presumption that it is to be interpreted for or against either party. Section
headings do not define or limit the operative provisions hereof.

                (d) This Lease, and its Exhibits, constitute the entire
agreement between the parties and there have been no promises or understandings
concerning the Leased Premises or the subject matter of this Lease that are not
set forth herein.

                (e) Acceptance by either party of late performance by the other
shall not constitute a waiver of the right to demand timely performance in the
future and Landlord's acceptance of rent does not waive any default by Tenant,
other than a prior default in the payment of such rent.

                (f) Each of the parties executing this Lease has authority to
execute this Lease.

                (g) This Lease shall be governed by the laws of the State of
California.

            14.12 Addendum. If an Addendum containing additional provisions is
attached to this Lease it is incorporated herein and the provisions thereof
supersede the provisions of this Lease to the extent they are inconsistent
therewith.

            14.13 Brokerage Commissions. Except for Tory Corporate Real Estate
Advisors dba The Staubach Company, Tenant warrants that it has not had any
dealing with any real estate brokers, leasing agents, or salespersons, or
incurred any obligations for the payment of real estate brokerage commissions or
finder's fees which would be earned or due and payable by reason of the
execution of this Lease. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain
agreement between Cornish & Carey Commercial and Landlord, Landlord shall pay
only the commissions specified in such agreement. Tenant shall indemnify and
hold harmless Landlord from any claims for fees or commissions not covered by
such agreement.

            14.14 Financial Statements. Tenant will provide Landlord, within
thirty (30) days after written request from Landlord, if Landlord reasonably
requires such statements for purposes of sale or refinancing of the Property
or similar purposes, but no more often than twice per year, Tenant's most recent
audited 10-K statement and Tenant's most recent unaudited 10-Q statement (which
latter statement will be accompanied by a certificate from Tenant's chief
financial officer certifying that there has been no material change in Tenant's
financials since the date of issuance of


                                       27
<PAGE>   28

the 10-Q. Landlord may disclose such information to its lender or any investor,
prospective purchaser or investor, or any other person with an actual need to
know. Any such financial information which is marked "confidential" will be
confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party except as set forth
in this Section 14.14.

            14.15 Indemnification. Each party and its successors and assigns,
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its members,
officers, employees, agents, representative, successors and assigns
(collectively, "Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all losses
(excluding special or consequential losses) which any one of the Indemnified
Persons may sustain or incur as a result of, in connection with or arising out
of the first party's breach of any covenant, obligation or representation of
such party in this Lease.

            14.16 Backup Generator. Tenant, at its sole cost, shall have the
right to install, at a mutually acceptable location on the Property, a backup
generator; provided that Tenant complies with all applicable laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.4 or any other provision
of this Agreement, Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that Tenant shall
remove the backup generator upon the termination or expiration of the Lease
Term, and shall restore the Property to the complete satisfaction of Landlord,
determined in Landlord's sole discretion. Landlord shall be reasonable in
participating in the determination of a mutually acceptable location.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have executed this Lease as of
the date set forth on Page 1 of this Lease.

        THIS OFFICE LEASE AGREEMENT (this "LEASE"), dated to be effective as of
this 22nd day of February, 2000, is made by and between KCD-TX I INVESTMENT
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Texas limited partnership ("LANDLORD OR KCD"), and
LACERTE SOFTWARE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("TENANT" or "LACERTE").

                              PRELIMINARY RECITALS

        A. Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") is the owner of (i) a
certain tract of unimproved real property containing approximately 10.7 acres

hereinafter provided.


<PAGE>   9


        E. To induce Landlord to execute this Lease, Tenant has caused, and
Intuit Inc. (the "GUARANTOR" or "INTUIT") has agreed to execute, that certain
guaranty agreement (the "INTUIT GUARANTY") attached hereto as Exhibit "D-1." For
purposes of this Lease, the term "Guarantor" shall include any "Substitute
Guarantor" as provided in the Intuit Guaranty, unless expressly stated to the
contrary herein.

        NOW, THEREFORE, for and consideration of the rent herein after reserved
and the mutual covenants hereinafter contained, Landlord and Tenant agree as
follows:

                                ARTICLE 1 - LEASE

        SECTION 1.01 PROPERTY.

        (a) Subject to Landlord's acquisition of the Phase I Property and
completion of the Project in accordance with the terms of this Lease, Landlord
hereby leases and demises the Project to Tenant and Tenant hereby hires, leases
and accepts the Project from Landlord, for the Term (as defined in Section 4.01)
and subject to the agreements, conditions and provisions contained herein.

        (b) Title to the Real Property shall be burdened by certain title
exceptions which exist as of the date hereof and which are required to be
established by the Landlord in connection with the Acquisition Contract and the
development of the Project. Upon receipt thereof by Landlord, Landlord shall
deliver to Tenant (i) a commitment for title insurance covering the Real
Property and legible copies of all exception documents shown therein for
Tenant's review and approval, (ii) an on the ground boundary survey of the Real
Property showing the location of any easements and other encumbrances to title,
and (iii) the final form of Acquisition Contract to be executed-by Landlord and
EDS. Tenant will receive an opportunity to review and approve the Supplemental
Declaration referred to in Section 14.04(b) of the Acquisition Contract, the
Option Supplemental Declaration referred to in Section 14.05, as well as any
other restrictions or instruments that will be recorded pursuant to the terms of
the Acquisition Contract, including the terms and provisions of the Special
Warranty Deed. Within ten (10) business days following receipt by Tenant of all
of the foregoing materials, Tenant shall either approve the Acquisition
Contract, the exceptions to title shown in such title commitment, the additional
title documents referenced above, and the survey (the "PERMITTED EXCEPTIONS"),
or Tenant shall deliver written notice to Landlord terminating this Lease. If
Tenant fails to deliver such notice, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived any
objection to title to the Real Property and shall have accepted the Acquisition
Contract and Permitted Exceptions. Upon approval of the Permitted Exceptions,
Landlord and Tenant agree that same shall be described on Exhibit "I" to the
Lease which shall be incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Upon
approval of the Acquisition Contract, a fully executed copy of same shall be
attached to this Lease as Exhibit "A-2" which shall be incorporated herein by
reference for all purposes. Landlord covenants that it shall not permit any
additional easements and exceptions other than the Permitted Exceptions to title
to be recorded against title to the Real Property except those easements and
exceptions which are necessary in connection with the development of the
Project, and in any event such additional exceptions and easements shall not
impair Tenant's use of the Project. As soon as possible after the


                                       2
<PAGE>   10

Substantial completion of construction of the shell of the Building, Landlord's
architect, HKS, Inc. ("ARCHITECT"), shall compute the Rentable Area (hereafter
defined) contained in the Building. For purposes of calculating rentals due
hereunder, the good faith calculations of Architect made in accordance with
Section 1.02 hereof shall, subject to the review and approval thereof by Tenant
and Landlord, determine the Rentable Area contained in the Building. If Tenant
and Landlord are unable to agree on the Rentable Area contained in the Building,
the President of the Dallas Chapter of the AIA shall be appointed (and
compensated equally by Landlord and Tenant, unless the Architect's determination
of the total square feet of area contained in the Building exceeds the amount of
total square feet of area contained in the Building as determined by the
President of the Dallas Chapter of the AIA by more than 5%, in which case such
compensation shall be paid by Landlord) as the final arbiter of the Rentable
Area in the Building.

        SECTION 1.02 RENTABLE AREA. The measurement for the total square feet of
gross building area contained in the Building (which shall, for purposes of this
Lease, be referred to as "RENTABLE AREA") shall be made in accordance with the
method of measuring gross building area of office space in a single tenant
occupied building as specified in the Standard Method for Measuring Floor Area
in Office Buildings published by the Building Owners and Managers Association
International in ANSI Z 65.1-1996, revised and readopted June 7, 1996.

                    ARTICLE 2 - CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING

        SECTION 2.01 DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE. Attached hereto as Exhibit "B" and
incorporated herein by reference is a development schedule (the "DEVELOPMENT
SCHEDULE") detailing the Project's construction process, responsibilities of
Landlord and Tenant and the time periods within which each party's obligations
are to be performed. Both parties acknowledge that strict adherence to the
Development Schedule is essential for an orderly and timely completion of
construction of the Project, including the Base Building Work (as hereinafter
defined) and all Tenant Improvements (as hereinafter defined); provided,
however, each construction period obligation which is to be performed shall be
extended in the event of a delay in a prior date [whether caused by Landlord,
Tenant, a third party, or Force Majeure (as hereinafter defined)] by the number
of days of such delay. Phase I of the Project shall consist of the construction
and occupancy of approximately 165,000 square feet of Rentable Area and shall
contain a minimum of seven hundred fifty (750) parking spaces or such greater
amount as may be required to satisfy Laws based upon a building which contains
165,000 square feet, as shown on the site plan attached hereto as Exhibit "C-1"
(the "SITE PLAN"). Landlord and Tenant agree that construction of the Project
may occur in multiple phases and such future phases and/or expansions of the
Project (each, a "PROJECT EXPANSION") may consist of the construction and
occupancy of an additional amount of square feet of Rentable Area as described
in Article 25 of this Lease. Any Project Expansion shall be constructed and
occupied, and Base Rent shall commence to accrue thereon, all in accordance with
the provisions of Article 25.

        Section 2.02 BASE BUILDING WORK. Landlord and Tenant agree that the
construction specifications attached hereto as Exhibit "C" (the "BASE BUILDING
OUTLINE SPECIFICATIONS") constitute the outline specifications for the
Landlord's work in the development of the Project. The


                                       3
<PAGE>   11

Base Building Outline Specifications shall be deemed to include such additional
detail as may be necessary to satisfy the intent of the parties that such
specifications are sufficient, as drafted, to permit the Architect to prepare
the Base Building Final Plans and Specifications (as hereinafter defined)
without the addition of substantive design elements not described therein
(hereinafter referred to as "Additional Detail"). The Base Building Outline
Specifications incorporate the Site Plan for the Project which is attached
hereto as Exhibit "C-l," which Site Plan is hereby approved by Landlord and
Tenant. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that the Site Plan is merely
illustrative of the conceptual layout of the Project and is not intended to
provide the scope or detail which is shown in the Base Building Outline
Specifications. Landlord shall provide all utilities and off-site improvements
for the construction of the Building, and shall construct or cause the Project
to be constructed: (i) substantially in accordance with the Base Building Final
Plans and Specifications; (ii) in a good and workmanlike manner; and (iii) in a
timely manner in accordance with the Development Schedule (subject to Force
Majeure, as described in Section 2.15, and Tenant Delays, as described in
Section 2.16) at no cost to Tenant, except for costs related to Tenant Changes
as described in Section 2.14 and Tenant Delays. The scope of the physical
improvements which constitute the Project excluding the Tenant Improvements
shall be limited to the improvements described in the Base Building Outline
Specifications. Landlord's undertakings described in this Section 2.02 shall be
referred to collectively as the "BASE BUILDING WORK." Landlord shall solicit one
(1) or more bids from, or may negotiate directly with one or more, general
contractors unaffiliated with Landlord or Tenant and shall contract with (with
Tenant's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) a general contractor to construct the Base Building Work
(the "CONTRACTOR"), shall cause the Base Building Work to be constructed, and
shall cause the Project to be constructed in accordance with Laws (as defined in
Section 8.01) and Covenants (as defined in Section 13.02). The Tenant may, at
its election, cause the Contractor to solicit bids from subcontractors to
provide any of the work for the Project as required by the Tenant. Any cost
increases attributable to any contractor selected by the Tenant, shall be
considered a Tenant Change pursuant to Section 2.14. Any delay attributable to
materials or finishes not timely installed or delivered by any contractor
selected by the Tenant which is providing services directly to the Tenant or the
Contractor shall be considered a Tenant Delay for purposes of this Lease. All
preliminary plans and specifications for construction of the Base Building Work
shall be prepared by Architect at Landlord's sole cost and expense in accordance
with the budget established for the Project by the Landlord, shall be based upon
the Base Building Outline Specifications and shall be completed in accordance
with the terms of the Development Schedule. Preliminary and final drafts of the
final plans shall be promptly submitted by Landlord to Tenant. If within fifteen
(15) days after receipt by Tenant of any plans and specifications for the
Project, Tenant informs Landlord, in writing, that such plans and specifications
are not substantially in conformance with the Base Building Outline
Specifications and how such plans and specifications deviate from the Base
Building Outline Specifications, then Landlord shall promptly cause the plans
and specifications to be modified so as to conform to the Base Building Outline
Specifications. If Tenant has not so notified Landlord within fifteen (15) days
after receipt by Tenant of any plans and specifications for the Project, such
plans and specifications shall be deemed to be approved. Once the plans and
specifications have been approved by Tenant, or deemed to have been approved by
Tenant due to its non-response to any submission for approval, such set shall
then become the final plans and


                                       4
<PAGE>   12

specifications ("BASE BUILDING FINAL PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS"). It is agreed
that the Base Building Final Plans and Specifications shall be deemed to include
the Additional Detail, whether or not specifically identified therein, as such
Base Building Outline Specifications may have been modified with Tenant's
consent. It is expressly understood and agreed by Landlord and Tenant that the
Base Building Final Plans and Specifications shall, when approved, supersede the
Base Building Outline Specifications for purposes of the completion of the Base
Building Work.

        Section 2.03 TENANT IMPROVEMENTS. Prior to the date specified in the
Development Schedule for preparation of the Tenant Improvements design work, as
such date may be extended in accordance with the terms of this Lease, Landlord,
Tenant's representative and the architect retained by Tenant to design the
Tenant Improvements, who may also be the Architect at Tenant's election (such
architect providing design services in connection with the Tenant Improvements
shall be referred to herein as the "TI ARCHITECT") shall meet to discuss the
design and construction of those improvements to the Building desired by Tenant
other than the Base Building Work (the "TENANT IMPROVEMENTS"). All improvements
not part of the Base Building Work shall be considered Tenant Improvements.
Tenant shall contract directly with the TI Architect to provide architectural
services in connection with the design and installation of the Tenant
Improvements. Such agreement with the TI Architect for the Tenant Improvements
shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Landlord and shall name
Landlord's representative as a party to whom all correspondence shall be copied
under the terms of the such agreement and shall also entitle Landlord's
representative to be present at all design and development meetings coordinating
completion of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant shall deliver to TI Architect
reasonably sufficient information and instructions to enable TI Architect to
prepare preliminary plans and specifications for construction of the Tenant
Improvements desired by Tenant. All fees and expenses charged by the TI
Architect in connection with the Tenant Improvements shall be charged against
the improvement Allowance described in Section 3.02. All preliminary and final
plans and specifications for the Tenant Improvements shall be subject to
Tenant's and Landlord's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Tenant and TI Architect shall develop the
final plans and specifications for the Tenant Improvements (the "TENANT
IMPROVEMENTS FINAL PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS"). Tenant and TI Architect shall use
their best efforts to complete the plan preparation and approval process within
the time periods shown on the Development Schedule. Failure by either Tenant or
TI Architect to comply with the plan preparation and approval process within the
time periods shown on the Development Schedule will constitute a Tenant Delay.
Concurrently with preparation of the Tenant Improvements Final Plans and
Specifications, the TI Contractor (hereinafter defined) shall prepare for
Tenant's review and approval an estimated budget for the Tenant Improvements.
Upon receipt of Tenant's written comments with respect to the estimated budget,
the TI Contractor shall promptly modify the estimated budget and deliver a
revised budget to Tenant for its approval. In addition, TI Architect shall
promptly modify the Tenant Improvements Final Plans and Specifications to
accommodate the requested changes to the estimated budget. From time to time
during the design, bidding and construction stages, upon Tenant's request,
Landlord, TI Architect and the TI Contractor shall make value engineering
recommendations and shall otherwise advise Tenant with regard to methods of
reducing the total cost of construction of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant shall
have the sole option of whether to


                                       5
<PAGE>   13

accept or reject any value engineering recommendations. All costs involved in
approving, drafting and preparing the Tenant Improvements Final Plans and
Specifications shall be charged against the Improvement Allowance described in
Section 3.02 hereof.

        Section 2.04 BIDDING. After final, written approval by Tenant of the
estimated budget for the Tenant Improvements and of the Tenant Improvements
Final Plans and Specifications, the Landlord shall solicit at least three (3)
bids (or as many as reasonably practical) from general contractors unaffiliated
with Landlord or Tenant (some of whom may be recommended by Tenant) and shall
contract (with Tenant's approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) with a general contractor (the "TI
CONTRACTOR"), which shall act as the general contractor for the Tenant
Improvements work. Tenant shall be entitled to supply to Landlord, for use by
the TI Contractor, a list of approved subcontractors to whom the Tenant wishes
to be delivered bid packages in connection with certain components of the Tenant
Improvements. All fees, supervision, costs and charges relating to the Tenant
Improvements including, without limitation, all architectural and engineering
fees and other "soft costs," shall be charged against the Improvement Allowance
described in Section 3.02 hereof. TI Contractor, with the advice and consent of
Landlord and Tenant, shall select the respective subcontractors within seven (7)
days after its receipt of all of the bids for the respective work; however, if
all of the subcontractors' bids received for any portion of the Tenant
Improvements work exceed the estimated budget for such work, or if some or all
of the bids which have been received are within the budget but are otherwise
unsatisfactory to Landlord or Tenant, then Landlord or Tenant may, in writing,
within seven (7) days after the receipt of the respective bids, either request
modification of the plans and specifications for the subject portion of the
Tenant Improvements or request that the TI Contractor solicit additional
subcontractor bids. If such modifications or requests for solicitation of
additional bids are made by Tenant and will result in delays in completion of
construction of the Tenant Improvements, Landlord shall immediately notify
Tenant, in writing, of the amount of anticipated delay, which shall be deemed a
Tenant Delay (as hereinafter defined). If Landlord fails to notify Tenant of any
delay which may result from such modifications or solicitation of additional
bids within seven (7) days of Tenant's request therefor, then any delay
resulting therefrom shall not be deemed a Tenant Delay.

        SECTION 2.05 CONSTRUCTION. The Contractor shall construct the Base
Building Work promptly, and in accordance with the requirements of all Covenants
and Laws and the standards expressed in Section 2.02. The TI Contractor shall
construct the Tenant Improvements promptly, in a good and workmanlike manner and
in substantial accordance with the Tenant Improvements Final Plans and
Specifications. Landlord shall be responsible for causing the Contractor, TI
Contractor and Architect (but not the TI Architect) to perform all of their
respective obligations described in this Lease pursuant to written contracts,
the terns of which shall be in accordance with the terns and provisions hereof
and the requirements of all Covenants and Laws. In addition, an affiliate of
Landlord, Koll Development Company, LLC ("KOLL") shall guarantee the Landlord's
obligations under this Section 2.05 by execution of the Completion Guaranty
attached hereto as Exhibit "D." Landlord shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to work with the City of Plano, Texas to assist Tenant and Tenant's
broker in acquiring the municipal incentives which may reduce the cost of
Tenant's occupancy of the Project. Any municipal incentives which are achieved
through


                                       6
<PAGE>   14

the efforts of Landlord, Tenant or Tenant's broker shall inure to the benefit of
the Tenant, to the extent that the Tenant continues to occupy the Project.

        Section 2.06 SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION. The Base Building Work and Tenant
Improvements shall be deemed substantially completed (hereinafter,
"SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED" or "SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION") upon the completion of
the Base Building Work and the Tenant Improvements, such that only minor or
insubstantial details of construction or mechanical adjustment remain to be
performed, the existence of which do not materially interfere with Tenant's
occupancy and use of the Building for the conduct of Tenant's business, and upon
the issuance of a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy by the
governing local authority for the Building. A certificate furnished by Architect
as to the date of Substantial Completion shall be conclusive and binding upon
both parties. Notwithstanding the delivery of such certificate of Substantial
Completion by the Architect, Substantial Completion shall be deemed not to have
occurred with respect to the Base Building Work and Tenant Improvements until
Landlord has provided Tenant prior written notice and at least sixty (60) days
of reasonably unrestricted physical access to the Building for purposes of
Tenant's installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment. Within ninety (90)
days after the date of Substantial Completion, Tenant shall notify Landlord in
writing of any remaining "punch list" or other corrective work to be completed
by Landlord through the Contractor and TI Contractor. Such "punch list" or other
corrective work shall be commenced by Landlord and completed within sixty (60)
days following receipt of such notification from Tenant, or such longer period
of time as is reasonably necessary to permit Landlord to complete such work in
the event that the completion of same is not possible within such sixty (60) day
period with the exercise of reasonable diligence. Upon completion of such "punch
list" and other corrective work to Tenant's, TI Architect's and Architect's
reasonable satisfaction, and upon Tenant's installation of its furniture,
fixtures and equipment, Landlord shall obtain the issuance of a permanent
certificate of occupancy, unless such certificate has previously been obtained.
Landlord shall have no other obligation to perform other work except with regard
to Landlord's obligations to correct construction defects and deficiencies as
provided in Section 2.12 and to maintain certain structural and other elements
of the Project as set forth in Section 15.02. Tenant shall reasonably cooperate
with Landlord in obtaining the temporary and permanent certificates of
occupancy.

        SECTION 2.07 INSPECTION. Tenant may, at its election, perform on-site
inspections of the Base Building Work and the Tenant Improvements from time to
time, provided that such inspections do not interfere with the completion of the
Project by the Landlord. The Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
Landlord harmless from any loss, cost, liability or damage resulting from any
(i) installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment pursuant to Section 2.06,
and (ii) personal injury resulting from any inspection of the Project by the
Tenant, its employees or agents prior to Substantial Completion, unless arising
out of Landlord's negligence. Landlord shall be responsible for inspecting the
construction work for the Base Building Work and the Tenant Improvements. In
addition, Tenant and its designated agents and representatives shall, upon
Landlord's request (which may occur at regular intervals), inspect a
specifically identified element of the construction work of the Base Building
Work or the Tenant Improvements and Landlord shall cooperate fully with Tenant
and/or its designated agents and representatives during any such inspections. If
Tenant's inspections


                                       7
<PAGE>   15

of a specific element of the Project requested by Landlord result in Tenant
recognizing any occurrence of material deviations from the Base Building Final
Plans and Specifications or from the Tenant Improvements Final Plans and
Specifications approved by Tenant, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing of
such deviations within seven (7) days of such inspection, and Landlord shall,
upon receipt of such written notice, either respond in writing to objections to
the claim or correct such deviations promptly. However, if Tenant fails to
notify Landlord of any such material deviations within seven (7) days after an
inspection specifically requested by Landlord, Tenant shall be deemed to have
accepted all work relating to the item specifically inspected by Tenant which
has been completed to the date of Tenant's inspection. Landlord shall not be
obligated to uncover work already in place, except upon written request by
Tenant in connection with an inspection of the Building by Tenant. If a material
deviation from the plans and specifications is thereby uncovered, Landlord shall
cause such deviation to be corrected and the costs of the tests, uncovering and
correction, as well as delays caused thereby, shall be Landlord's sole
responsibility. If no material deviation is found, all testing, uncovering and
recovering costs, as well as any delays caused thereby, shall be Tenant's sole
responsibility and sums due therefor shall be payable within twenty (20) days
following written demand by Landlord. Tenant's failure to detect a deviation
from plans or specifications shall not relieve Landlord from its obligation to
cause the Project to be constructed free of design (as to the Base Building Work
only) and construction defects (as to the Base Building Work and the Tenant
Improvements) and in accordance with the approved final plans and
specifications, and to correct any unsafe, illegal or latent defective
conditions in accordance with Section 2.12.

        SECTION 2.08 REPORTS. Landlord shall provide to Tenant periodic
construction reports as the construction of the Project progresses, but no less
frequently than once every thirty (30) days.

        SECTION 2.09 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The Building, including, but not
limited to, the Base Building Work and the Tenant Improvements, shall be
constructed in accordance with Laws (as defined in Section 8.01) and the
Covenants (as defined in Section 13.02). After the Term Commencement Date (as
defined in Section 4.01) for Phase I, and the Project Expansion Commencement
Date for any Project Expansion (as such terms are defined in Article 25), Tenant
shall have sole responsibility for ongoing compliance with all Laws and
Covenants, except to the extent Landlord has responsibility for any such
compliance as set forth in Sections 2.12 or 15.02, in which event Tenant shall
have no responsibility therefor.

        SECTION 2.10 INSURANCE AND RESTORATION. At Landlord's sole cost and
expense and as part of the cost of construction Landlord shall procure or cause
to be procured and maintained during the construction of the Project (including,
without limitation, the construction of Tenant Improvements), builder's risk
insurance insuring the Building and all other improvements constructed on the
Real Property against fire, the perils insured under the standard form extended
coverage endorsement, vandalism, and malicious mischief in the full amount of
the cost of construction. In the event the Building or Tenant Improvements shall
be damaged or destroyed by fire or other insured casualty, Landlord shall repair
or restore the damaged Building, upon Tenant's reaffirmation of the Lease or
giving of such other comfort to Landlord and Lender (as defined in Article 20)
as may be reasonably


                                       8

agreed to between Tenant, Landlord and Lender, which shall be subject to the
conditions provided in this Section 2.10. Landlord shall promptly commence such
repairs and this Lease shall be unaffected except that the Term Commencement
Date (as hereinafter defined) and the Project Expansion Commencement Date for
any Project Expansion shall be extended until the Building is Substantially
Completed; provided, however, in the event (a) the damage is such that
restoration and completion is not reasonably possible within nine (9) months
after the date of the casualty in the opinion of the Third-Party Architect (as
defined in Section 16.02), or (b) Landlord has not Substantially Completed the
restoration of the Building in accordance with the terms hereunder, including,
but not limited to, Tenant Improvements, within twelve (12) months after the
date of the casualty (such time period being extended by up to six (6)
additional months by Force Majeure), then Tenant shall have the right to
terminate this Lease within thirty (30) days thereafter by giving written notice
of such termination to Landlord and, upon such termination, the parties shall
have no further obligations hereunder, one to the other, except for obligations
arising under Section 2.11 hereof. In no event shall Landlord be responsible for
any loss or damage to Tenant's personal property or to improvements installed or
stored by Tenant other than as may be contained within the Tenant Improvements.
The insurance coverage required in this Section 2.10 shall terminate on the Term
Commencement Date for Phase I and the Project Expansion Commencement Date for
any Project Expansion.

        SECTION 2.11 INDEMNITY. Prior to the Term Commencement Date for Phase I,
and the Project Expansion Commencement Date for any Project Expansion, Landlord
shall indemnify, defend and hold Tenant, its officers, directors, agents,
employees, contractors, licensees and invitees, harmless from and against any
and all claims, losses, damages, injuries and liabilities (including the costs
of audit or attorney's fees) arising (a) from the death or injury of any person
or persons, including, but not limited to, the employees of Landlord, Architect
or the Contractor or any subcontractor, and/or (b) from damage or destruction of
any property or properties, where such injuries, death or .damage are caused by
Landlord's sole negligence or the joint negligence of Landlord and any other
person or entity (excluding the Tenant). In addition to the Tenant indemnity
provided in Section 2.07, Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord
harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, injuries and
liabilities (including the reasonable costs of suit and attorneys' fees) arising
from (a) replacement of defective work relating to the TI Architect's design
work in connection with the Tenant Improvements, in the event that the TI
Architect fails to correct and/or replace such defective work at TI Architect's
sole cost and expense in accordance with Section 2.12, and (b) any mechanic's
lien or materialmen's lien filed as a result of Tenant's failure to pay sums due
directly by Tenant to the TI Architect with respect to the Tenant Improvements
and to any contractors or subcontractors, if any.

        SECTION 2.12 CORRECTION OF CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS. Landlord, at its sole
cost and expense, shall repair, or cause to be repaired, any deviations, defects
or deficiencies, whether patent or latent, in the Project (as well as any
Project Expansion) and/or Tenant Improvements (including, without limitation,
air conditioning, plumbing, electrical and heating systems) installed by
Landlord or its agents or contractors which are due to faulty design (except
with respect to the design of the Tenant Improvements, for which Tenant shall be
responsible to replace work necessitated by a defective


                                       9
<PAGE>   17

design of any of the Tenant Improvements, in the event that the TI Architect
fails to replace work necessitated by its defective design in accordance with
this provision), defective materials or workmanship in construction thereof for
a period of one (1) year following the Term Commencement Date for Phase I and
for a period of one (1) year following the Project Expansion Commencement Date
for each Project Expansion. Tenant covenants that it shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the TI Architect, in such architect's agreement with
Tenant, to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from any defective design in the
Tenant Improvements which causes any loss, damage, cost or liability to the
Landlord in construction of the Project. The TI Architect's agreement shall
identify the Landlord as a third-party beneficiary of such agreement to the
extent of the indemnity contained therein. Landlord's primary recourse for
design defects in the Tenant improvements shall be against the TI Architect. In
the event that the architect's agreement with the TI Architect fails to contain
the indemnity of Landlord described in this Section 2.12, or, in the event
Landlord is unsuccessful in recovering all of its losses, costs, liability or
damage from the TI Architect after exercising reasonable efforts, Tenant shall
be responsible for the unrecovered costs of correcting any defective work
resulting from errors in the Tenant Improvements Final Plans and Specifications
caused by the TI Architect. Any and all rights of Landlord in and to any
guaranties or warranties in effect on the first anniversary of the Term
Commencement Date for items, the repair, replacement and/or maintenance of which
Tenant has assumed responsibility under Section 15.01 hereof shall be assigned
to Tenant. This Section shall not limit Landlord's repair requirements for
so-called "punch list" items in accordance with Section 2.06 hereof or its
obligation to maintain Structural Elements as provided in Section 15.02 hereof.

        SECTION 2.13 SCHEDULE. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Article 2 to the contrary, the right of Tenant hereunder to any review,
approval, or modification of plans, or additional bidding, shall comply with the
Development Schedule [as may be extended for acts of third parties, Landlord
Delays (as defined in Section 2.16) or by Force Majeure], and any delay in the
Development Schedule resulting from Tenant's exercise of such rights in excess
of any time periods specified in this Lease shall be deemed a Tenant Delay.

        SECTION 2.14 CHANGE ORDERS.

        (a) Net Increased Costs. All Net Increased Costs (hereinafter defined)
associated with Change Orders (hereinafter defined) resulting from Tenant
Changes in the Base Building Work or Tenant Improvements shall be Tenant's sole
expense and any delays caused by such Change Orders shall be deemed to be Tenant
Delays. For purposes of this Lease, the term "NET INCREASED COSTS" shall mean
the aggregate positive difference expressed in dollars resulting from Change
Orders approved by Tenant which result in an increase in the cost of the Base
Building Work or Tenant Improvements. Any Change Orders initiated and approved
by Tenant resulting in cost savings shall be credited against those changes
resulting in cost increases for purposes of determining Net Increased Costs. For
purpose of this Lease, the TERM "CHANGE ORDER" SHALL mean (i) a Tenant requested
and approved modification in scope, quality or materials or a change in the
Development Schedule to either the Base Building Work or the Tenant Improvements
or (ii) corrections to the Base Building Final Plans or the Tenant Improvement
Final Plans and Specifications necessitated


                                       10
<PAGE>   18

because of Tenant's errors, inconsistencies or omissions in its submissions to
Landlord. Change Orders shall not include work due to changes in the Base
Building Final Plans and Specifications resulting from Additional Detail, unless
modifications to the Base Building Outline Specifications were necessitated
because of Tenant's errors, inconsistencies or omissions or because the Base
Building Outline Specifications were modified at Tenant's request. Net cost
savings in the Base Building Work or Tenant Improvements below the final bid
price for the Base Building Work or Tenant Improvements due to Change Orders
shall reduce the amount of Base Rent payable in accordance with Section 5.01(c).
Change Orders to the Base Building Work or Tenant Improvements resulting from
either of the events described in subsections (i) or (ii) above shall be
referred to herein as "TENANT CHANGES."

        (b) Base Building Work Tenant Changes. In the event of Net Increased
Costs in the Base Building Work due to Tenant Changes, the actual costs of
construction associated with Tenant Changes, including, but not limited to, (i)
Landlord's overhead administration costs equal to five percent (5%) of the cost
of Tenant Changes, and (ii) reasonable and actual associated soft costs of
Tenant Changes including, but not limited to, title charges, financing costs and
legal expenses, shall be Tenant's sole expense and payable by Tenant to Landlord
within twenty (20) days after Substantial Completion and Tenant's receipt of an
invoice therefor, and any delays caused by such Tenant Changes shall be deemed
to be Tenant Delays. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may elect to cause
Landlord to fund a certain amount of Net Increased Costs out of the Supplemental
Allowance as set forth in Section 3.04.

        (c) Tenant Improvements Tenant Changes. All Net Increased Costs
associated with Change Orders resulting from Tenant Changes in the Tenant
Improvements in excess of the Improvement Allowance shall be Tenant's sole
expense and any delays caused by such Change Orders shall be Tenant Delays. In
the event of Net Increased Costs in the Tenant Improvements due to Tenant
Changes, the actual costs of such Tenant Changes, including, but not limited to,
(i) Landlord's overhead administration costs equal to five percent (5%) of the
cost of Tenant Changes, and (ii) reasonable and actual associated soft costs of
Tenant Changes including, but not limited to, title charges, financing costs and
legal expenses, shall be Tenant's sole expense and payable by Tenant to Landlord
within twenty (20) days after Substantial Completion and Tenant's receipt of an
invoice therefor, and any delays caused by such Tenant Changes shall be deemed
to be Tenant Delays. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tenant may elect to
either (i) cause Landlord to fund a certain amount of Net Increased Costs in
excess of the Improvement Allowance out of the Supplemental Allowance as set
forth in Section 3.04, or (ii) reallocate any items of costs allocated for
Tenant Improvements in the Improvement Allowance to satisfy any increased costs
for which the Tenant may be obligated to pay to Landlord hereunder.

        (d) Classification. All Change Orders requested by Tenant shall be
delivered to Landlord in writing and Architect and TI Architect shall determine
the portion thereof that constitutes Base Building Work and the portion thereof
that constitutes Tenant Improvements. Upon receipt of any


                                       11
<PAGE>   19

Change Order, Landlord shall, as soon as possible but within fourteen (14) days
following receipt thereof. apprise the Tenant in writing of any Tenant Changes
outlined therein, the cost associated with such Change Order and if and to the
extent such Change Order will result in a Tenant Delay.

        SECTION 2.15 FORCE MAJEURE. Whenever a period of time is herein
prescribed for action to be taken by either party hereto, such party shall not
be responsible for and there shall be excluded from the computation of any such
period of time, any delays due to strikes, riots, act of God. inclement weather
in excess of the days set forth in Exhibit "E." war, governmental laws, or
regulations or restrictions ("FORCE MAJEURE"). Any claim of a "Force Majeure"
must be made in writing, by the party making such claim delivered to the other
party within thirty (30) days after the event causing such Force Majeure delay.
In calculating the amount of Force Majeure delays, the parties agree that the
total amount of Force Majeure delays shall include both the actual number of
days resulting from the event and constituting the Force Majeure delays and the
additional number of days resulting in the contractor being unable to recommence
work on the site following the delay due to the fact that the Real Property is
physically inaccessible. The parties further agree that in calculating delays
due to weather, that they shall rely upon the attached Exhibit "E" to determine
if the weather events in question are beyond the standard weather conditions
expected for the site (herein the "WEATHER STANDARD"), and the weather events
within the Weather Standard shall not constitute a Force Majeure delay
hereunder. Force Majeure shall not apply to the payment of any debt or other sum
of money then due or owing hereunder including Base Rent and Additional Rent.

        SECTION 2.16 LANDLORD AND TENANT DELAY.

        (a) The terms "LANDLORD DELAY," "Delays caused by Landlord," "TENANT
DELAY" or "Delays caused by Tenant" shall mean delay in completion of
construction of the Building, the Tenant Improvements and/or the Base Building
Work caused by:

               (i) Unless and to the extent due to the acts or omissions of
        the other party or such party's agents, employees or contractors, the
        respective party's failure to perform its construction period
        obligations by the dates or within the term periods shown in the
        Development Schedule; subject, however, to Force Majeure;

               (ii) Any subsequent changes, modifications or alterations to the
        final plans and specifications for the Base Building Work and/or Tenant
        Improvements initiated by the respective party after final approval by
        Landlord and Tenant, except to the extent any such changes,
        modifications or alterations are required (a) by Laws enacted after the
        date of approval of the final plans and specifications for the Base
        Building Work and/or Tenant Improvements; or (b) for work resulting from
        Additional Detail.

               (iii) Any other act required to be timely performed in accordance
        with the provisions of this Lease which is not timely performed by the
        respective party; and


                                       12
<PAGE>   20

               (iv) Any other act or omission stated in this Lease to be a
        Landlord or Tenant Delay.

        (b) For purposes of determining delay, the terms Landlord and Tenant
shall include their respective contractors, agents and employees; and any delay
caused by a contractor selected or hired by Landlord shall be considered a
Landlord Delay, and any delay caused by a contractor selected and hired by
Tenant pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be considered a Tenant Delay.

        SECTION 2.17 BUILDING MATERIALS. Tenant shall use reasonable efforts not
to request specially fabricated or exotic materials or equipment ("SPECIAL
ORDER") which will delay Landlord's timely construction of the Base Building
Work and the Tenant Improvements and any delay resulting therefrom shall be
deemed to be a Tenant Delay. Within ten (10) days following receipt from Tenant
of a request for a Special Order, Landlord shall give written notice to Tenant,
prior to acceptance of a Special Order, specifying the approximate time of
delay, and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to seek a mutual agreement
as to whether such Special Order will be accepted.

        SECTION 2.18 SIGNAGE. During the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall have
the exclusive right to Tenant's corporation identification on the Building and
monument signage (to the extent permitted by Laws and Covenants) located on the
Real Property. To the extent installation of Tenant's signage adversely affects
the structural integrity of the Project or any component thereof, such signage
is subject to Landlord's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. All such signage shall comply with Laws and Covenants.

        SECTION 2.19 ACCESS. During the Term of this Lease, Tenant may use the
roof of the Building to install communications equipment, and the roof and
easements located within the Project to connect cabling under the Building for
telecommunication equipment (including satellite disk, antenna, microwave dish
and fiber optics), at Tenant's expense, provided such use complies with Laws and
does not violate Covenants. Tenant shall be permitted to place communications
equipment on the roof, as long as the equipment does not exceed the structural
capacity of the roof, and is approved as to size and location by Landlord, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Upon receipt of Tenant's request to
place communications equipment on the roof of the Building, in the event
Landlord fails to respond within thirty (30) days thereafter, such request of
Tenant shall be deemed approved. Tenant shall be solely responsible for any
damage caused by the placement of communications equipment on the roof. Any
penetrations of the roof membrane necessitated by the installation of such
equipment shall be made by the roofing contractor (including related
maintenance, repair and replacement) who installed the roof system, or such
other roofing contractor authorized by the manufacturer to perform warranty work
on the roof system installed at the Project, and any damage or loss of warranty
resulting therefrom shall be Tenant's responsibility, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 15.02.

        SECTION 3.01 BASE BUILDING WORK. All costs and expenses of construction
of the Base Building Work (excluding costs related to Net Increased Costs of
Tenant Changes and Tenant Delays and the cost of payment and performance bonds
if requested by Tenant) shall be borne by Landlord. All preliminary and final

and/or Landlord shall specifically identify which costs constitute Tenant
Improvements costs which shall be the subject of the Improvement Allowance
provided in Section 3.02.

        SECTION 3.02 TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES. Tenant shall bear the costs

request therefor accompanied by a certified invoice from Landlord accompanied by
applicable bills received. Construction costs on Tenant Improvements in excess
of the Improvement Allowance shall be paid for by Tenant in accordance with
Section 2.14(c) and Section 3.03. Landlord shall provide Tenant with an

expense, and such expense shall be charged against the Improvement Allowance.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the following amounts
shall not be charged against the Improvement Allowance:

        (i)    payment for any work which is a portion of the Base Building
               Work, including all soft costs related to same;

<PAGE>   22

        (iv)   demolition and removal of non-conforming work installed by the TI
               Contractor including but not limited to replacement of defective
               materials and workmanship (unless necessitated by an error or
               omission of the TI Architect, in which event the provisions of
               Section 2.12 shall control payment of the costs incurred in
               replacement of defective materials and workmanship);

        (v)    expediting and overtime costs specifically due to Landlord's or
               TI Contractor's negligence or Landlord Delays;

               Improvement Allowance);

        (vii)  use and reasonable access to vertical transportation;

        (viii) repair or correction to Building equipment systems unless caused
               by Tenant;

        (ix)   removal of debris or stored materials from the Project except in
               connection with Tenant Improvements work;

        (x)    performance and payment bonds if required by Landlord;

        (xi)   builders risk insurance; and

        (xii)  premiums associated with liquidated damage requirements of
               Landlord.

        SECTION 3.03 PAYMENT. Payments of amounts up to but not in excess of the
Improvement Allowance shall be made and disbursed by Landlord to (i) the TI
Contractor in accordance with the provisions of the contract with the TI
Contractor or (ii) to Tenant or to any subcontractor directly contracting with
Tenant which has been approved by Landlord. Prior to the Term Commencement Date
and the Project Expansion Commencement Date for any Project Expansion, if
applicable, Tenant shall not be entitled to draw more than twenty percent (20%)
of the Improvement Allowance for items which are not shown in the Tenant
Improvements Final Plans and Specifications. Disbursements of the Improvement
Allowance to any party, including the TI Contractor or to any subcontractor who
contracts directly with the Tenant, shall be made thirty (30) days following
delivery of a draw request and supporting documentation and must satisfy any
documentation requirements reasonably imposed by the Lender, including, but not
limited to, partial and/or final lien waivers and releases. Landlord shall
provide Tenant the right and opportunity, upon reasonable request, to review
Landlord's records and accounting for disbursements of amounts paid or payable
under the Improvement Allowance and shall report to Tenant, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Tenant, the amounts expended during the course of completion of
the Tenant Improvements. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a certified
invoice therefor from Landlord together with copies of applicable bills, Tenant
shall pay those costs of construction of the Tenant Improvements in excess


                                       15
<PAGE>   23

of the Improvement Allowance, if any. If Tenant fails to pay the invoiced costs
within such thirty (30) day period, then interest shall commence accruing on the
thirty-first (31st) day and shall continue until paid at the lesser of (i) two
percent (2%) per annum in excess of the prime rate of interest of Bank One,
Texas, N.A. or (ii) the maximum rate of nonusurious interest permitted by Texas
law (the "SPECIFIED RATE"). All invoiced costs and accrued interest shall be
deemed Additional Rent (as defined in Section 5.04) for purposes of this Lease.

        SECTION 3.04 SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOWANCE. Upon the election of Tenant (which
may only be exercised with respect to Phase I and must be done prior to the Term
Commencement Date), and written verification from the Guarantor that it consents
to such election by Tenant and Guarantor agrees to be bound thereby, Landlord
shall provide a supplementary improvement allowance (the "SUPPLEMENTAL
ALLOWANCE") of up to Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) to cover
Change Orders or Tenant Changes in the Base Building Work or the Tenant
Improvements. The Tenant may not elect to receive such money directly in cash.
In addition, the Supplemental Allowance may be used for payment of, without
limitation, architectural and engineering fees and other third party payments
for professional services incurred in connection with the completion of the
Project. All fundings of the Supplemental Allowance will include Landlord's
overhead administration costs equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of
Supplemental Allowance expended, and additional reasonable costs actually
incurred by Landlord as a result of Tenant's utilization of the Supplemental
Allowance, such as incremental costs of borrowing (e.g., interest carry incurred
by Landlord from the time of such draw of the applicable portion of the
Supplemental Allowance until the commencement of the payment of increase in the
Base Rent related thereto, additional title premiums, legal expenses and similar
costs relating to additional borrowings). In the event Tenant elects to receive
the Supplemental Allowance, the Base Rent shall increase as provided in Section
5.01(c).

                          ARTICLE 4 - TERM AND RENEWALS

        SECTION 4.01 TERM. The term of this Lease (the "TERM") shall be for a
period often (10) years commencing on the earliest to occur of (a) the date of
Tenant's occupancy of all or any part of the Phase I Building for the conduct of
its business; (b) ten (10) days after the date the Base Building Work and the
Tenant Improvements for Phase I are Substantially Completed; or (c) the date the
Base Building Work and the Tenant Improvements for Phase I would have been
Substantially Completed but for Tenant Delays (the "TERM COMMENCEMENT DATE").
The Term shall be extended by the exercise by the Tenant of its rights under
Sections 4.02 and 25.03(e). Base Rent, Additional Rent, and other costs
described herein for Phase I which are associated with the use of the Building
shall commence on the Term Commencement Date, but in no event earlier than June
1, 2001. Tenant shall have the right for a period of sixty (60) days prior to
Substantial Completion, or earlier if in Landlord's reasonable judgment such
entry and installation would not interfere with the progress of construction, to
enter the Building and install Tenant's furniture, equipment, communications
cabling and fixtures, and may equip completed portions of the Project at an
earlier date if any of such activity


                                       16
<PAGE>   24

Would not unreasonably interfere with remaining construction activities.
Landlord shall use its best efforts to give Tenant twenty (20) days advance
written notice of the date on which Tenant may commence installation of its
furniture and equipment. Once the Term Commencement Date is ascertained,
Landlord and Tenant shall promptly execute a letter specifying such date.

        SECTION 4.02 RENEWAL OPTIONS.

        (a) Tenant, at its option, may, if it has not committed an uncured Event
of Default (as defined in Article 21), either at the time it gives its notice
hereunder to Landlord or at the time of commencement of the respective extended
term, extend the Term of this Lease for the Project for up to two (2) additional
five (5) year terms. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, if
the Term of this Lease, as extended by the provisions of this Section 4.02 or
Section 25.03(e), shall exceed twenty (20) years, Base Rent payable for each
year of this Lease beyond such twenty (20) year period shall increase by two
percent (2%) per annum. A schedule of Base Rent per square foot of Rentable Area
for the maximum permissible Term of this Lease, including periods beyond such
twenty (20) year period, is attached hereto as Exhibit "H." This Lease shall be
extended effective upon (i) the expiration of the previous respective term, and
(ii) Landlord's receipt of written verification that the Guarantor agrees to the
exercise of such renewal options and that the Guarantor shall guarantee the
obligations of the Tenant with respect thereto. Within thirty (30) days after
the receipt by Landlord of Tenant's notice and Guarantor's verification,
Landlord and Tenant covenant that they shall execute an agreement memorializing
the exercise of the First Renewal Term or Second Renewal Term. The first such
extended term (the "FIRST RENEWAL TERM") shall commence upon the expiration date
of the initial term of this Lease, expire upon the fifth (5th) anniversary of
said date, and be upon the same terms, covenants and conditions as provided in
this Lease for the initial term, except that the Base Rent payable during the
First Renewal Term for Phase I and each Project Expansion, if any, shall be
calculated in accordance with Exhibit "H." as modified by Section 5.01 (c) and
Article 25. The second such extended term (the "SECOND RENEWAL TERM"), if
exercised by Tenant and conditioned upon Tenant's exercise of its first option
to extend, shall commence upon the expiration date of the First Renewal Term of
this Lease and expire upon the fifth (5th) anniversary of said date, and be upon
the same terms, covenants and conditions as provided in this Lease for the
initial term, except that the Base Rent payable during the Second Renewal Term
for Phase I and each Project Expansion, if any, shall be calculated in
accordance with Exhibit "H." as modified by Section 5.01(c)and Article 25.

        (b) In order to exercise such renewal options, Tenant shall advise
Landlord in writing at least twelve (12) months prior to the end of the initial
term, or First Renewal Term, as the case may be, that Tenant intends to exercise
its option to renew this Lease.

        (c) Payment of all Additional Rent and other payments required to be
made by Tenant as provided in this Lease for the initial term shall continue to
be made during such extended term. Any termination of this Lease during the
initial term shall terminate all rights of extension hereunder.

<PAGE>   25

        SECTION 4.03 REFURBISHMENT ALLOWANCE. Provided Tenant has not committed
an uncured Event of Default at the time it gives notice hereunder. upon the
election of the Tenant (which may only be exercised with respect to Phase I and
which must be elected simultaneously with the delivery of the renewal notice for
the First Renewal Term with respect to the Project), Landlord shall provide to
Tenant, within thirty (30) days following the execution by Landlord and Tenant
of an agreement memorializing the exercise of the First Renewal Term, and
written verification from the Guarantor that it consents to such election by
Tenant and Guarantor agrees to be bound thereby, a refurbishment allowance (the
"REFURBISHMENT ALLOWANCE") of up to Ten and No/100 Dollars ($10.00) per square
foot of Rentable Area in Phase I, which may be used by Tenant for cleaning,
replacements, renovations, repairs and upgrades to the Project in accordance
with Tenant's discretion. Upon the funding of the Refurbishment Allowance, Base
Rent shall increase as provided in Section 5.01(c). Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Refurbishment Allowance may only be used
by the Tenant to improve, renovate and/or redecorate the Project and Tenant may
not elect to receive such money directly in cash.

                                ARTICLE 5 - RENT

        SECTION 5.01 RENT.

        (a) Tenant covenants and agrees to pay to Landlord at its address for
notice, in lawful money of the United States, without demand, abatement, offset
or deduction, except as expressly permitted by the terms of this Lease, base
annual rentals for Phase I (the "BASE RENT") equal to the product of Fourteen
and 81/100 Dollars ($14.81) times the Rentable Area of the Building for years 1
through 5 ("LEASE PERIOD 1"); and the product of Sixteen and 29/100 Dollars
($16.29) times the Rentable Area for years 6 through 10 ("LEASE PERIOD 2"). Such
Base Rent shall be payable in advance in equal monthly installments during the
initial term of this Lease commencing on the Term Commencement Date. Any partial
month's Base Rent shall be prorated based on the actual number of days in the
partial month Base Rent is payable. Upon final measurement of Phase I, as
provided for in Section 1.01, Landlord and Tenant shall promptly execute
amendments to this Lease specifically setting forth the aggregate amounts of
Base Rent payable hereunder.

        (b) Base Rent for any Project Expansion shall be calculated in
accordance with Article 25 of this Lease.

        (c) (i) In the event that Tenant elects to utilize the Supplemental
Allowance for payment of any of the Change Orders or Tenant Changes associated
with Base Building Work or the Tenant Improvements (as described in Section
3.04), the Base Rent shall increase in Lease Period 1 by the amount of Ten Cents
(10(cent)) per square foot of Rentable Area per year for each One Dollar ($1.00)
per square foot of Supplemental Allowance utilized, Eleven Cents (11(cent)) per
square foot of Rentable Area per year for Lease Period 2, Twelve Cents
(12(cent)) per square foot of Rentable Area per year for the First Renewal Term
and Thirteen Cents (13(cent)) per square foot of Rentable Area


                                       18
<PAGE>   26


per year for the Second Renewal Term. In other words, if Tenant elects to
receive a Supplemental Allowance of Three Dollars and No/100 Dollars ($3.00) per
square foot of Rentable Area. the initial Base Rent shall increase by the amount
of Thirty Cents (30(cent)) per square foot of Rentable Area per year for Lease
Period 1, and shall increase correspondingly for Lease Period 2, the First
Renewal Term and Second Renewal Term.

                (ii) In the event that the Tenant elects to utilize the
Refurbishment Allowance for renovation of any of the Project (as defined in
Section 4.03), the Base Rent shall increase during the First Renewal Term by the
amount of Twelve Cents ($0.12) per square foot of Rentable Area per year for
each One and No/100 Dollars ($1.00) per square foot of Refurbishment Allowance
utilized and Thirteen Cents ($0.13) per square foot of Rentable Area per year
for the Second Renewal Term.

                (iii) In the event that any of the Tenant approved Change Orders
reduce the cost of the Base Building Work below the final bid price approved by
Landlord and Tenant or the final funded amount of the Improvement Allowance is
less than Thirty and No/100 Dollars ($30.00) per square foot of Rentable Area,
the Base Rent shall be reduced during the Term by the amount of Ten Cents
($0.10) per square foot of Rentable Area per year for each One Dollar and No/100
Dollars ($1.00) per square foot that (i) the final bid price for the Base
Building Work is reduced by Tenant approved Change Orders or (ii) the funded
Improvement Allowance is less than Thirty and No/100 Dollars ($30.00) per square
foot of Rentable Area.

        SECTION 5.02 LATE CHARGE. If Tenant fails to pay when due any
installment of Base Rent or Additional Rent within ten (10) days after the date
the payment is due, Tenant shall pay a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of
the delinquent rent payment. For the first occurrence of a late payment of Base
Rent or Additional Rent. in any lease year during the Term of this Lease and
provided Tenant is not otherwise in default of its obligations under this Lease,
Landlord agrees it will waive receipt of such late charge and such late charge
payment will be made by Tenant for the second and any subsequent late payments
of Base Rent or Additional Rent. Such late charge shall be paid with the next
accruing rental installment and shall be deemed rent for purposes of this Lease.
Base Rent that is more than fifteen (15) days past due shall also accrue
interest at the Specified Rate (as defined in Section 3.03).

        SECTION 5.03 NET LEASE. It is the intention of Landlord and Tenant that,
except for the obligations, costs and expenses expressly assumed by Landlord in
this Lease, including but not limited to the requirements of Section 15.02, all
rentals paid to Landlord in accordance with the terms of this Lease shall be
absolutely net; that is, except as specifically provided for herein to the
contrary, all costs, expenses and obligations of every kind relating directly
or indirectly in any way, foreseen or unforeseen, to Tenant's use, occupancy and
possession of the Project, which may arise or become due during the Term shall
be paid by Tenant and Landlord shall be indemnified by Tenant therefrom,
including, without limitation, all taxes, assessments, excises, levies and other
charges by any public authority which are general or special, ordinary or
extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, of any kind and nature whatsoever, except
as expressly set forth to the contrary in Section 9.02, and


                                       19
<PAGE>   27

which shall or may, during or in respect to the Term, be assessed levied,
charged, confirmed or enforced upon, or become due and payable out of, or become
a lien on the Project, or appurtenances or facilities used in connection with
the Project.

        SECTION 5.04 ADDITIONAL RENT. Any and all payments of any kind
(including, without limitation. taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance
obligations and utilities) required to be made by Tenant under this Lease, other
than Base Rent, shall be classified as additional rent due and owing hereunder
("ADDITIONAL RENT"), and failure to pay Additional Rent when due shall
constitute an Event of Default. Landlord shall provide to Tenant written notice
of the requirement of payment of amounts deemed Additional Rent hereunder and
failure of Tenant to pay such amounts within thirty (30} days following receipt
of such notice from Landlord shall constitute an Event of Default.

                            ARTICLE 6 - HOLDING OVER

        SECTION 6.01 HOLDING OVER. Any holding over by Tenant after the
expiration of the Term, or any extension thereof, shall be construed as a
tenancy from month-to-month upon the same terms and conditions as set forth
herein, except that monthly installments of Base Rent shall be equal to one
hundred twenty-five (125%) percent of the monthly installments of Base Rent in
effect during the last calendar month prior to the expiration of the Term or any
extension, as appropriate, for the first six (6) months following expiration of
the Term, with such amount then increasing to one hundred fifty (150%) percent
of the monthly installments of Base Rent in effect during the last calendar
month prior to expiration of the Term or extension, as appropriate. Either
Landlord or Tenant may terminate such month-to-month tenancy upon thirty (30)
days written notice to the other.

                          ARTICLE 7 - QUIET POSSESSION

        SECTION 7.01 QUIET POSSESSION. Provided Tenant is not then in default
beyond applicable cure periods, Landlord covenants and agrees, subject to the
Permitted Exceptions, to keep Tenant in quiet possession and enjoyment of the
Project during the Term and any extensions thereof and warrants that it has full
power and authority to lease the Project to Tenant for the Term and any
extensions thereof.

                           ARTICLE 8 - USE OF BUILDING

        SECTION 8.01 USE. Tenant shall specifically have the right to use the
Building only for any lawful business purposes in accordance with applicable
laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations of all governmental
bodies (state, federal and municipal) (collectively, the "LAWS"), the Permitted
Exceptions and permitted by the Covenants (as defined in Section 13.02)
affecting the Building. Landlord hereby represents as of the date hereof that
the Laws and Covenants would not prohibit the use of the Building for general
office purposes. Landlord represents and covenants that, as of the date hereof
and throughout the Term of this Lease, it shall not file, cause to be filed, or


                                       20
<PAGE>   28

consent to the filing of, any additional Covenants which restrict Tenant's use
of the Building or the Project, or otherwise increase or affect Tenant's rights
hereunder without Tenant's prior written consent, which consent may be withheld
in Tenant's sole discretion.

        SECTION 8.02 MAINTENANCE.

        (a) Tenant shall use the Project in a careful, safe, and proper manner;
and Tenant covenants, except as provided herein to the contrary, to keep,
maintain and be responsible for routine maintenance and repair and replacement
of all elements (except Structural Elements, as defined in Section 15.02) of the
Project and to keep such elements in reasonably good condition and repair,
including, without limitation, HVAC, plumbing, mechanical and electrical; and,
with respect to Tenant's use of the Project, the Building and appurtenances,
Tenant covenants to comply with all applicable Covenants and Laws, including,
without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and any and all
Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 24.01(a)(ii)). After Substantial
Completion, Tenant, at its cost, shall manage all aspects of the Project (it
being understood that Landlord shall have no management responsibility
hereunder) and shall maintain the Project in compliance with all Covenants and
Laws; provided, that alterations to the Project required by Covenants and Laws
which involve Structural Elements shall be Landlord's cost and responsibility,
unless such modification to a Structural Element is necessitated by Tenant's
special or unique use of the Project, or Tenant's change in use of the Project
which requires alterations to the Project or any part thereof. Tenant shall be
liable for and shall promptly cause the repair of any damage to the Project to
the extent caused by Tenant, its employees, contractors, agents or invitees,
unless such damage is specifically required herein to be repaired by Landlord
and, to the extent that Landlord, its employees, contractors, agents or invitees
have caused the damage, Landlord shall cause it to be repaired. Tenant shall not
commit waste or suffer or permit waste to be committed or to allow or permit any
nuisance in the Project. Tenant shall not use the Building or allow or permit
the Building to be used for any purposes which may render the Building
uninsurable at normal rates by responsible insurance carriers authorized to do
business in the State of Texas unless Tenant shall pay the extra cost thereof,
or which may render void or voidable any insurance on the Building. Except as
provided herein, Tenant shall not erect, place, allow to be placed any sign,
advertising matter, stand, booth, or showcase in or upon the doorsteps,
vestibules, doors, exterior walls, windows, or pavement of the Building without
the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, or which may violate any of the Covenants. Tenant covenants and agrees
that it shall not overload the floors or surpass the utility specifications of
the Building, as reasonably determined by Landlord.

        (b) Notwithstanding anything contained above to the contrary, if Tenant
is required to make a capital improvement in satisfaction of its obligations
hereunder to any item that is described in the Base Building Final Plans and
Specifications, and if the useful life of such capital improvement as provided
by the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations cannot be fully amortized over the
remainder of the Term, Tenant shall so notify Landlord. Upon receipt of such
notice, Landlord shall either (i) direct Tenant that Landlord elects not to
cause Tenant to make such capital expenditure and Tenant shall thereby be
relieved of any liability for such replacement obligation,


                                       21
<PAGE>   29

in which event Tenant may repair such item without, except as hereinafter
provided in subsection (ii) hereof, reimbursement from Landlord and satisfy its
obligations under this Lease, or (ii) direct Tenant to make such capital
expenditure, in which event Tenant shall be reimbursed by Landlord (unless
Tenant caused such damage to occur, in which event Tenant shall not be
reimbursed by Landlord) at the end of the Term for that portion of the
replacement cost that is represented by the extent to which the useful life
(determined in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations)
thereof extends beyond the expiration of the Term, which portion shall be
determined by dividing the number of months of useful life of the replacement
that extend beyond the expiration of the Term by the total number months of
useful life of the replacement and multiplying the resultant percentage
calculation against the total cost of the replacement. If the cost of repairing
any item described in the Base Building Final Plans and Specifications by Tenant
as required under this Section 8.02(b) (i) is so extensive that the cost would,
in the opinion of the Third Party Architect (as defined in Section 16.02),
exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost to replace such item, then Tenant
shall replace such item and the provisions of subsection (ii) herein shall apply
with respect to said replacement costs.

                                ARTICLE 9 - TAXES

        SECTION 9.01 PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES. Tenant shall pay before
delinquency all taxes and assessments, special or otherwise, of any nature that
become payable during the Term and/or any extension thereof which are levied or
assessed upon Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures and Tenant's other
personal property installed or located in or on the Project.

        SECTION 9.02 AD VALOREM TAXES. All ad valorem taxes, assessments,
business taxes, impact fees, rental taxes ("RENTAL TAXES") or other similar
rates and taxes levied or imposed upon the Project, or any part thereof, shall
be paid by Tenant, and shall be considered Additional Rent hereunder. Tenant's
sole obligation to pay Rental Taxes shall arise only in the event such taxes are
imposed upon the gross income of the Project and are not denominated as an
"income tax" or other tax imposed on the net income of the Landlord, giving
credit for deduction, depreciation and other reductions to the gross income
attributable to the Project. Nothing contained in this Lease shall require
Tenant to pay any local, county, municipal, state or federal income, franchise,
corporate, estate, inheritance, succession or transfer tax of Landlord. Upon
receipt by Landlord from any association, governmental agency or authority of
statements for ad valorem taxes and assessments against the Project during the
Term and any extension thereof, Landlord shall promptly submit to Tenant an
invoice for such taxes and assessments, together with copies of the original
statements from each taxing authority. Tenant shall pay such invoice to Landlord
no later than twenty (20) days prior to the delinquency date as shown on each
tax statement, but in no event shall it be required to pay the invoice earlier
than thirty (30) days after its receipt; provided, however, Tenant may, in good
faith, contest the assessed valuation of such taxes or assessments, and, receive
a refund from the appropriate governmental authority, if successful, provided
that Tenant shall pay all taxes and amounts due and owing hereunder in
accordance with all applicable laws. Landlord shall reasonably


                                       22
<PAGE>   30

cooperate with Tenant, at no cost to Landlord, in Tenant's appeal. If the Term
Commencement Date or the Project Expansion Commencement Date is on a date other
than January 1, the taxes, assessments, fees or other rates for the first and
last year of the Term shall be prorated. Any and all property tax refunds
accruing to the project shall, during the Term, belong exclusively to Tenant.

        SECTION 9.03 DELINQUENCY OF PAYMENT. If Tenant fails to pay any real or
personal property taxes or assessments in accordance with the terms of this
Article, Landlord shall have the right, after providing thirty (30) days written
notice to Tenant of such failure, to thereafter pay any or all of such taxes and
assessments and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, within thirty (30) days of
receipt of Landlord's invoice for the amount of such real and personal property
taxes and assessments paid by Landlord together with interest on the amount paid
by Landlord from the date advanced until reimbursed at the Specified Rate. Such
sums shall become rent for the purposes hereof and shall be payable with the
next monthly installment of Base Rent.

                             ARTICLE 10 - INSURANCE

        SECTION 10.01 TENANT'S INSURANCE. Tenant covenants and agrees that from
and after the Term Commencement Date for Phase I and the Project Expansion
Commencement Date for any Project Expansion, Tenant will carry and maintain, at
its sole cost and expense, the following types of insurance, in the amounts
specified and in the forms hereinafter provided for:

        (a) Liability insurance in the Commercial General Liability form (or
reasonable equivalent thereto) covering the Project and Tenant's use thereof
against claims for bodily injury or death, third party property damage and
product liability occurring upon, in or about the Project, such insurance to be
written on an occurrence basis (not a claims made basis), to be in combined
single limit amounts not less than $5,000,000 and to have general aggregate
limits of not less than $10,000,000 for each policy year. The insurance coverage
required under this Section 10.01 shall, in addition, extend to any liability of
Tenant arising out of the indemnities provided for in Section 11.01 and, if
necessary, the policy shall contain a contractual endorsement to that effect;
and

        (b) Insurance covering all of the Tenant's items located in the
Building, including, but not limited to, furniture, fixtures and equipment from
time to time in, on or upon the Project, in an amount not less than one hundred
percent (100%) of their full replacement value from time to time during the
Term, providing protection against perils included within the standard form of
"all-risk" property insurance policy, together with insurance against vandalism
and malicious mischief. Any policy proceeds from such insurance relating to the
Building shall be used solely for the repair, construction and restoration or
replacement of such property damaged or destroyed unless this Lease shall cease
and terminate under the provisions of Article 16.

        SECTION 10.02 POLICY REQUIREMENTS. All policies of the insurance
provided for in Section 10.01 shall be issued in form and content reasonably
acceptable to Landlord by insurance companies with a rating of not less than
"A-" and financial size of not less than Class VII, in the most current
available "Best's Insurance Reports," and licensed to do business in Texas.
Tenant shall


                                       23
<PAGE>   31


provide Landlord with a certificate for each such policy of insurance required
by this Lease. Any insurance coverage required of the Tenant hereunder may be
provided by the Guarantor, as long as such coverage otherwise satisfies the
provisions of this Article 10. Each and every such policy (as evidenced by the
certificate):

       (i) shall name Landlord as well as Lender, as defined in Article 20, and
any other party reasonably designated by Landlord, who has an insurable
interest, as an additional insured. In addition, the coverage described in
Section 10.01(b) relating to the Building shall also name Landlord as loss
payee;

       (ii) shall be delivered to Landlord prior to the Term Commencement Date
and the Project Expansion Commencement Date for any Project Expansion and
thereafter within ten (10) days prior to the scheduled expiration date of each
such policy, within, and, as often as any such policy shall expire or terminate.
Renewal or additional policies shall be procured and maintained by Tenant in
like manner and to like extent;

       (iii) shall contain a provision that the insurer will give to Landlord
and such other parties in interest at least thirty (30) days notice in writing
in advance of any material change, cancellation, termination or lapse, or the
effective date of any reduction in the amounts of insurance; and

       (iv) shall be written as a primary policy which does not contribute to
and is not in excess of coverage which Landlord may carry;

       (v) Landlord and Tenant hereby waive any rights each may have against the
other on account of any loss or damage occasioned to Landlord or Tenant, as the
case may be, their respective property, the Project, its contents or to the
other portions of the Building, arising from any risk covered by "all risk"
property coverage insurance and commercial general liability of the type and
amount required to be carried hereunder, provided that such waiver does not
invalidate such policies or prohibit recovery thereunder and is applicable only
to the extent of receipt of the insurance proceeds. The parties hereto each
agree to use reasonable efforts to cause their respective insurance companies
insuring the property of either Landlord or Tenant against any such loss, to
waive any right of subrogation that such insurers may have against Landlord or
Tenant, as the case may be.

       (vi) Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall take any action that will cause
the premiums for insurance coverage to rise.

       (vii) Any insurance coverage enumerated above may be satisfied by a
blanket policy or policies of insurance or under so-called "all risk" or
"Multi-peril" insurance policies provided that the total amounts of insurance
available with respect to the Project and Tenant's liability hereunder shall be
at least the equivalent of separate policies in the amount herein required, and
provided further that in all other respects any such policy or policies shall
comply with the provisions of this Section 10.02. Tenant shall not, unless
expressly set forth herein to the contrary, have the right to, self-insure
against any of the risks recited herein, except for the amount of any
commercially



                                       24
<PAGE>   32

reasonable deductible (for purposes of this Lease, a deductible amount of
$100,000 shall be deemed to be reasonable). An increased coverage or "umbrella"
policy may be provided and utilized by other parties to increase the coverage
provided by individual or blanket policies in lower amounts and the aggregate
coverage provided by all such policies with respect to the limits required
herein shall be satisfactory, provided that such policies shall otherwise comply
with the provisions of this Section 10.02.

       (viii) Upon receipt of the Landlord's and its Lender's consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Tenant
may self-insure against any of the risks or portions thereof set forth in this
Section 10.02, provided that the Tenant or Guarantor has an Investment Grade
Credit Rating (as defined in Section 19.01(a)). Landlord and Lender may not
withhold their consent in the event that the Tenant or Guarantor satisfy the net
worth requirements set forth herein and have provided to Landlord and Lender
evidence of a program of self insurance which has been properly adopted and
implemented by the Tenant or Guarantor and which satisfies prudent risk
underwriting practices.

       SECTION 10.03 LANDLORD'S INSURANCE.

       (a) During the Term, Landlord shall maintain, at its sole expense,
liability insurance in the Commercial General Liability form (or reasonable
equivalent thereto) covering the Project and Landlord's use thereof against
claims for bodily injury or death, third party property damage and product
liability occurring upon, in or about the Project, such insurance to be written
on an occurrence basis (not a claims made basis), to be in combined single limit
amounts not less than $3,000,000 and to have general aggregate limits of not
less than $5,000,000 for each policy year. The insurance coverage required under
this Section 10.03 shall, in addition, extend to any liability of Landlord
arising out of the indemnities provided for in Section 11.01 and, if necessary,
the policy shall contain a contractual endorsement to that effect.

       (b) During the Term Landlord shall keep the Project insured against loss
or damage by fire and the perils covered under standard "all-risk," "special
form" coverage in the amount of the full replacement cost of the Building,
exclusive of excavation, footings and foundation, with a commercially reasonable
deductible for which Tenant shall be fully responsible (for purposes of this
Lease, a deductible amount of $100,000 shall be deemed to be reasonable). Lender
and Tenant shall be named in such policy or policies as additional insureds as
their respective interests may appear. All cost of such insurance and payment of
any deductible under such coverage shall be Tenant's expense and shall be deemed
to be Additional Rent under this Lease. Landlord's insurance coverage required
hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Section 10.02 above.

       (c) Upon prior written notice to Landlord and Lender, Lacerte or Intuit
may provide the casualty coverage required by the provisions of Section
10.03(b), at their sole cost and expense. Landlord and its Lender shall be named
as loss payees under the provisions of such coverage and such coverage must
otherwise satisfy the requirements of this Article 10. Neither Lacerte nor
Intuit may self insure against the risks described in Section 10.03(c).

to Koll, neither Landlord nor any officer, director, shareholder, attorney,
agent, partner or principal of Landlord, whether disclosed or undisclosed, shall

Lease, except for Landlord's failure to apply insurance proceeds or condemnation
awards as herein required in the Lease. In the event Landlord is in breach or
default with respect to Landlord's obligations or otherwise under this Lease,
except for Landlord's failure to apply insurance proceeds or condemnation awards
as herein required in the Lease, Tenant shall look solely to the equity of
Landlord in the Project and all rents, revenues and profits arising from the
Project for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies. Notwithstanding Koll's

       SECTION 13.01 UTILITIES AND SERVICES. From and after the Term
Commencement Date and the Project Expansion Commencement Date for any Project
Expansion, Tenant shall pay the costs and all deposits for all telephone, water,

the Specified Rate. Such sums shall be considered Additional Rent.

       SECTION 13.02 ASSOCIATION FEES. From and after the Term Commencement Date
and the Project Expansion Commencement Date for any Project Expansion, Tenant
shall pay, prior to delinquency, any assessments and fees assessed against the
Project during the Term and any extension thereof pursuant to that certain

records of Collin County, Texas, as well as all additional amendments thereto
and additional covenants which affect the Real Property (collectively, the
"COVENANTS"). If invoices issued by the applicable association are delivered to
Landlord as owner of the Project, Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days
following receipt thereof, promptly deliver same to Tenant.

                            ARTICLE 14 - ALTERATIONS

       SECTION 14.01 ALTERATIONS. From and after the Term Commencement Date and
the Project Expansion Commencement Date for any Project Expansion, Tenant shall
have the right to make non-structural alterations to the interior of any of the
Building, in order to conduct Tenant's business in the Building, provided such
alterations are of a quality which is equal to or greater than the Base Building
Work, and provided further that Tenant shall make no alterations, other than as
provided below, to the electrical, plumbing or HVAC systems, nor shall any such
alterations require drilling through the Building's slab floors or foundation or
penetrating their roofs without Landlord's consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. Tenant's request to make alterations to the Building
shall be made in writing and shall describe in sufficient detail the nature of
such proposed alterations and Tenant shall provide Landlord with a complete set
of plans for any proposed structural



                                       27
<PAGE>   35
alterations for its review and approval. Tenant shall not make or suffer to be
made any structural alterations of any kind, on or to the Project, or any part
thereof, without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days following
Tenant's notice of proposed alterations to the Building, either approve such
alterations to the Building or state the reasons for any disapproval with such
additional modifications, which, if remedied by Tenant, shall result in the
Landlord's approval of such proposed alterations. If the Landlord fails to
respond to such notice delivered by Tenant within thirty (30) days following
receipt thereof, Landlord shall be deemed to have approved Tenant's proposed
alterations to the Building. Tenant shall furnish Landlord with plans and
specifications for all alterations, additions or improvements which require
Landlord's consent. All alterations, additions, or improvements constructed by
Tenant shall be constructed in compliance with all Laws and Covenants. Tenant
shall keep the Project free from any liens arising out of any work performed,
materials furnished or obligations incurred by Tenant in connection with such
alterations and, prior to the commencement of any such structural alterations,
in the event the Intuit Guaranty is not in full force and effect, Tenant must
furnish Landlord with payment and performance bonds for Tenant's contractor(s)
in amounts reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, from sureties reasonably
acceptable to Landlord. Tenant may, in good faith, contest the validity of any
mechanic's or materialman's lien and, pending the conclusion of such contest,
Tenant shall not be deemed in default hereunder unless it fails to either pay
the sums due on the lien as determined by the contest or it fails to provide to
Landlord a bond or other acceptable security such that the lien is, by law,
removed from the Project. Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to post and keep posted on the Project any notice which Landlord may reasonably
deem proper for the protection of Landlord and the Project from such liens.

                       ARTICLE 15 - REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

       SECTION 15.01 TENANT'S OBLIGATIONS. Except as otherwise specifically
contained within this Lease, including, but not limited to, Section 8.02 hereof,
and in addition to the payment of its monthly installments of Base Rent, Tenant,
at its sole cost and expense, shall cause to be performed all repairs (other
than repairs required herein to be made by Landlord), maintenance, replacements
and, except with respect to Structural Elements (as defined in Section 15.02)
for which Landlord has responsibility, required capital improvements of every
kind, nature or description now or hereafter needed in, on or about the Project
and each part thereof (including, but not limited to, repairs, replacements and
maintenance of the major building systems), whether inside or outside, foreseen
or unforeseen, and Tenant shall keep and maintain both the inside and outside of
the Building and the Project in a first class condition, ordinary wear and tear
and insured casualty excepted. There shall be no abatement, diminution or
reduction of the fixed monthly rental because of any inconvenience,
interruption, cessation or loss of business caused directly or indirectly by
Tenant's obligations hereunder unless Tenant's inability to meet such
obligations is caused by the acts, omissions or negligence of Landlord, its
agents, contractors or employees. In addition to the foregoing, the Landlord
shall be obligated to enforce all contractors' warranties and to pursue all
rights and remedies which the Landlord may have against contractors for work
performed by such contractors, even though pursuit of such warranty obligations
may include a maintenance obligation of the Tenant under this Lease.


                                       28
<PAGE>   36

       SECTION 15.02 LANDLORD'S OBLIGATIONS. Landlord, at its sole cost and
expense, shall maintain in good condition the structural elements of the
Building and shall make all structural repairs and replacements to the Building,
including the structural elements of any parking deck constructed by Landlord as
a portion of the Base Building Work, the roof structure (excluding the roof
membrane), structural elements of the building facade, and the foundation and
load bearing walls (as well as any building and utility systems, including,
without limitation, plumbing, electrical and water systems located beneath or
within the foundation or which are imbedded in any load bearing walls)
(collectively referred to herein as the "STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS"), as Landlord's
sole maintenance, repair or replacement obligation under this Lease (except as
expressly set forth in Section 2.12 to the contrary), unless any such
maintenance, repairs or replacements are necessitated by the acts, omissions or
negligence of Tenant or its agents, contractors or invitees, in which case such
obligations shall be satisfied by Tenant. Landlord shall be obligated to satisfy
all Laws and Covenants with respect to the Structural Elements of the Project,
unless compliance with such Laws and Covenants is Tenant's obligation, as
described in Section 8.02. To the extent that the cause of any of the Landlord's
maintenance, repair or replacement obligations set forth in Section 15.02 also
causes any damage to related portions of the Building which would otherwise be
maintained by Tenant (for example, in the event that the failure of a Structural
Element necessitates a building system repair which would otherwise be the
obligation of the Tenant), then such related damage shall be the obligation of
the Landlord.

       SECTION 15.03 REMOVAL OF FIXTURES. So long as Tenant is not in default
beyond applicable grace periods, Tenant shall have the right at its option to
remove any trade fixtures, machinery, equipment and tenant improvements
installed by Tenant, at its cost (and not those charged against the Supplemental
Allowance or the Improvement Allowance), in the Building at any time during the
Term or when vacating the Building. Tenant shall not remove any Tenant
Improvements unless agreed to in writing by both Landlord and Tenant, which
agreement of Landlord shall not be unreasonably withheld. Tenant shall repair
any damage caused to the Building by reason of the removal of such trade
fixtures, machinery, equipment and tenant improvements. Any trade fixtures,
machinery, equipment or tenant improvements not removed by Tenant shall be
deemed the property of Landlord.

                       ARTICLE 16 - DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION

       SECTION 16.01 FIRE AND OTHER CASUALTY. In the event that any Building is
damaged by fire or other casualty, Landlord agrees to promptly restore and
repair the Building, including the Tenant Improvements, at Landlord's expense,
but only to the extent Landlord actually receives sufficient insurance proceeds
therefor, from the insurance required to be carried by Landlord and Tenant
hereunder. Tenant agrees to immediately make available to Landlord all proceeds
of any insurance policies covering the Project, excluding that portion of
insurance proceeds applicable to Tenant's personal property and Tenant shall
also be obligated to pay to any insurer providing coverage the amount of any
deductible, retained risk or self insurance amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that the Building is (i) in the reasonable opinion of
Third-Party Architect (as hereinafter defined), so destroyed that it cannot be
repaired or rebuilt within three hundred sixty-five (365) days

                                       29
<PAGE>   37

after the date of such damage (subject to Force Majeure and Tenant Delays); (ii)
destroyed by a casualty which is not covered by insurance, the proceeds of which
are made available to Landlord in accordance with this Section 16.01, or if such
casualty is covered by insurance but such proceeds are insufficient for
restoration of the Project, and only if the Project is thus rendered
untenantable, as determined in the reasonable discretion of Landlord and Tenant;
or (iii) damaged by a casualty event during the last year of the Term which
destroys more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Rentable Area, and upon
receipt by Landlord of the deductible amount and all insurance proceeds under
the coverages to be provided for casualty damage under Article 10, then Landlord
or Tenant may terminate and cancel this Lease effective as of the date of such
casualty by giving written notice to the other party within thirty (30) days of
the date of such casualty. Upon the giving of such notice, all obligations
hereunder with respect to periods from and after the effective date of
termination shall thereupon cease and terminate except as expressly provided to
the contrary in this Lease. Tenant may obviate Landlord's right to terminate
this Lease in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.01 (iii) in the event
that the Tenant properly exercises a right to renew the Term expressly granted
in accordance with the terms of this Lease. If no such notice is given, Landlord
shall, to the extent of the available insurance proceeds, make such repair or
restoration of the Building to substantially the same condition existing prior
to such casualty, promptly and in such manner as not to unreasonably interfere
with Tenant's use and occupancy of the Project (if Tenant is still occupying the
Project). Base Rent and all Additional Rent and other charges shall abate during
the time that the Building or any part thereof is unusable by reason of any such
damage thereto (and for sixty (60) days following completion of restoration for
the purpose of Tenant refixturing), but only to the extent of any proceeds of
rental loss insurance received by Landlord on account thereof. Tenant shall not
be entitled to any compensation or damages for loss of use of the whole or any
part of the Project and/or any inconvenience or annoyance caused by such damage,
repair or restoration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, proceeds of any rental loss insurance policies shall be paid to
Landlord, and Tenant shall have no claim therefor.

       SECTION 16.02 THIRD-PARTY ARCHITECT. For purposes of this Lease, the term
"THIRD-PARTY ARCHITECT" shall mean an AIA designated architect licensed in the
State of Texas selected reasonably in good faith by Landlord and Tenant solely
for the purpose of determining certain time periods for restoration or costs in
question under this Lease including, but not limited to, the provisions of this
Article 16. The cost of such Third-Party Architect shall be shared equally by
Landlord and Tenant. In the event that the Landlord and Tenant cannot agree upon
the identity of the Third-Party Architect within fifteen (15) days following a
request for determination by the Third-Party Architect issued by either Landlord
or Tenant, then, upon request of either Landlord or Tenant, the president of the
local chapter of the AIA representative board shall appoint the Third-Party
Architect who shall not be affiliated with either Landlord or Tenant and shall
be experienced in commercial construction for purposes of determining the cost
or period of time required for such restoration or replacement, which
appointment shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant. The Third-Party Architect
shall be directed, upon request to determine any period of time or cost
hereunder to make such determination within fifteen (15) days following receipt
of such request for a determination by Landlord or Tenant. Any decision rendered
by the Third-Party Architect requested in accordance with this Lease shall be
binding upon the Landlord and Tenant.

                            ARTICLE 17 - CONDEMNATION

       SECTION 17.01 TAKINGS.

       (a) If all of the Project is taken or condemned for a public or
quasi-public use, or if a material portion (defined as twenty percent (20%) or
more of the Project and/or the parking area) of the Project is taken or
condemned for a public or quasi-public use and the remaining portion thereof is
not usable by Tenant in the reasonable opinion of Landlord and Tenant, this
Lease shall terminate on the sixtieth (60th) day following such taking. In such
event, the Base Rent herein reserved and all additional rent and other sums
payable hereunder shall be apportioned and paid in full by Tenant to Landlord to
that date and all Base Rent, additional rent and other sums payable hereunder
prepaid for periods beyond that date shall forthwith be repaid by Landlord to
Tenant, and neither party shall thereafter have any liability hereunder, except
that any obligation or liability of either party, actual or contingent, under
this Lease which has accrued on or prior to such termination date shall survive.

       (b) If less than twenty percent (20%) of the Project and/or the Parking
is taken or condemned for a public or quasi-public use and this Lease does not
terminate pursuant to Section 17.01 (a) and Tenant can occupy and reasonably use
for its intended purposes the remaining portion of the Project, Landlord, to the
extent of the award it receives, shall restore the Project to a condition and to
a size as nearly comparable as reasonably possible to the condition and size
thereof immediately prior to the taking, and there shall be a proportionate
reduction to the Base Rent according to the size of the Project before and after
the taking.

       (c) Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award in any
proceeding with respect to any taking provided for in this Section 17.01,
without deduction therefrom for any estate vested in Tenant by this Lease, and
Tenant shall receive no part of such award, except any part of the award
specifically designed to compensate Tenant's costs of moving and business
interruption. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit Tenant from
making a separate claim, against the condemnor, to the extent permitted by law,
for Tenant's moveable trade fixtures, machinery and moving expenses, provided
that the making of such claim shall not and does not adversely affect or
diminish Landlord's award.

       (d) Landlord has no actual or constructive knowledge of any pending or
threatened condemnation proceeding.

                         ARTICLE 18 - ENTRY BY LANDLORD

       SECTION 18.01 REASONABLE ACCESS. Subject to Tenant's reasonable security
procedures, Tenant agrees to permit Landlord and the authorized representatives
of Landlord and of Lender to enter upon the Project during normal business hours
(except in the event of emergency) for the purposes of inspecting the Project
and Tenant's compliance with this Lease, and making any necessary repairs
thereto; provided that, except in the case of an emergency, Landlord shall give


                                       31
<PAGE>   39

Tenant twenty-four (24) hours prior written notice of Landlord's intended entry
upon the Project. Nothing herein shall imply any duty upon the part of Landlord
to do any work required of Tenant hereunder, and the performance thereof by
Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant's default in failing to perform
it. Except in the event of negligence by Landlord, its agents, employees or
contractors, Landlord shall not be liable for inconvenience, annoyance,
disturbance or other damage to Tenant by reason of making such repairs or the
performance of such work in the Project or on account of bringing materials,
supplies and equipment into or through the Project during the course thereof,
and the obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall not thereby be affected;
provided, however that Landlord shall use reasonable efforts not to annoy,
disturb or otherwise interfere with Tenant's operations in the Building in
making such repairs or performing such work. Landlord also shall have the right
to enter the Project at all reasonable times to exhibit the Project to any
prospective purchaser or lender thereof, after reasonable prior written notice
to Tenant.

                     ARTICLE 19 - ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING

       SECTION 19.01 ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

       (a) Upon the receipt of Landlord's consent which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, Tenant shall have the right to assign or sublet all or
any part of the Project provided that such assignee assumes in writing the
obligations of Tenant under this Lease, or in the event of a sublease, the
sublessee agrees to subordinate to and be subject to the terms of this Lease.
Tenant shall provide Landlord written notice of any proposed assignment or
subletting, with sufficient detail to apprise Landlord of the material terms of
such assignment of subletting transaction. Within thirty (30) days following
receipt of such written notice, Landlord shall either disapprove or approve such
proposed assignment or subletting transaction, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. In the event that Landlord fails to respond to such
notice delivered by the Tenant within thirty (30) days following receipt of such
written notice, Landlord shall be deemed to have approved the proposed
assignment or subletting transaction proposed by the Tenant. Notwithstanding any
assignment or subletting hereunder, unless expressly set forth in this Article
19 to the contrary, Lacerte and Intuit shall remain liable for the performance
of all of the obligations of Tenant hereunder. Such right of assignment or
subletting by Tenant may also be exercised by any subtenant or assignee of
Tenant which has been previously approved by the Landlord, provided at the time
of exercise of such assignment or subletting Guarantor has an "Investment Grade
Credit Rating." For purpose of this Lease the term "INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT
RATING" shall mean a credit rating, either on corporate credit or issuances of
indebtedness, for the four (4) most recent fiscal year quarters, as issued by
(i) Standard & Poor's Rating Services equal to or greater than BBB or (ii)
Moody's Investors Services, Inc. equal to or greater than Baa.

       (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to assign
this Lease or sublet all or any part of the Project to any entity which
controls, is controlled by, or is in common control of, Lacerte or Intuit
(hereinafter referred to as a "Related Party"). Any assignment or subletting to
such Related Party shall not require consent of the Landlord, but Tenant shall
be obligated to supply Landlord with written notice of such assignment or
subletting, and evidence of the assumption of Tenant's obligations under this
Lease. Such Related Party assignment or


                                       32
<PAGE>   40

subletting shall not relieve Lacerte or Intuit, or their legal successor or
acquiring company, of any liability or obligations under this Lease. If, at any
time during the Term of this Lease, Intuit ceases to exist, Landlord shall have
the right to approve any assignment or subletting transaction entered into
thereafter unless the Guarantor has an Investment Grade Credit Rating, in which
event no approval by Landlord is required. Any purported assignment or
subletting which requires Landlord's consent shall be null and void if made
without such consent.

       SECTION 19.02 ASSIGNMENT BY LANDLORD. Landlord covenants that it shall
not sell or assign its interest in the Project prior to Substantial Completion,
except for any collateral assignment to the Lender. Upon Substantial
Completion, Landlord shall have the right to sell, transfer or assign its
interest hereunder without the prior consent of Tenant, provided that such
purchaser, transferee or assignee assumes, in writing, Landlord's obligations
and liabilities, including any then unfulfilled financial obligation of Landlord
to Tenant hereunder. After such sale, transfer or assignment, Tenant shall
attorn to the new landlord and KCD and Koll shall be released from all
obligations hereunder accruing after the date of such sale, transfer or
assignment.

       SECTION 19.03 NO RIGHT TO RIGHT OF ASSIGNMENT/SUBLEASE INDEPENDENT OF
LEASE. Tenant's (or any subtenant's or assignee's) right to sublease or assign
the Lease shall not be conveyed independently of an assignment or sublease
without the consent of Landlord.

       SECTION 19.04 NO RIGHT TO SEEK EXTENSION UNDER 11 U.S.C. Section 365(d).
Tenant agrees not to seek any extension of time to assume or reject the Lease in
the event of Tenant's (or any subtenant's or assignee's) bankruptcy proceeding
without the consent of Landlord greater than sixty (60) days from the date of
filing any bankruptcy petition.

                ARTICLE 20 - SUBORDINATION AND LENDER AGREEMENTS.

       SECTION 20.01 LENDER AND MORTGAGES.

       (a) For purposes of this Lease:

                  (i) "LENDER" as used herein means the current holder of a
         Mortgage;

                  (ii) "MORTGAGE" as used herein means any or all mortgages,
         deeds to secure debt, deeds of trust or other instruments in the nature
         thereof which may now or hereafter affect or encumber Landlord's title
         to the Project, and any amendments, modifications, extensions or
         renewals thereof.

       (b) This Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder are and shall be
subject and subordinate to the lien and security interest of any Mortgage.
Tenant recognizes and acknowledges the right of Lender to foreclose or exercise
the power of sale against the Project under any Mortgage, provided that Tenant's
right of quiet enjoyment shall not be disturbed unless and until an Event of
Default occurs under this Lease. As a condition of such subordination, Landlord
shall cause Lender (and all



                                       33
<PAGE>   41

future lenders) to execute a subordination and nondisturbance agreement (the
"SNDA") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit "F" (or in such
other form as is mutually acceptable to Lender, Landlord and Tenant), and shall
cause Lender to deliver a fully executed counterpart to Tenant. The SNDA shall
contain provisions acceptable to Lender and Tenant covering rights and
obligations of Lender and Tenant in the event of a foreclosure of Landlord's
interest in the Project.

       (c) Tenant shall, in confirmation of the subordination set forth in
Section 20.01(6) and notwithstanding the fact that such subordination is
self-operative, and no further instrument or subordination shall be necessary,
within a reasonable period from receipt of written notice, at any time or times,
execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord or to Lender reasonable
instruments mutually agreed upon by Landlord, Tenant and Lender to evidence such
subordination.

       (d) Tenant shall, upon reasonable request, at any time or times, execute,
acknowledge, and deliver to Lender and all future lenders, a subordination and
nondisturbance agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
"F." contingent upon Landlord's and Lender's simultaneous execution of same.

       (e) If Lender (or Lender's nominee, or other purchaser at foreclosure)
shall hereafter succeed to the rights of Landlord under this Lease, whether
through possession or foreclosure action or delivery of a new lease, Tenant
shall, if requested by such successor, attorn to and recognize such successor as
Tenant's landlord under this Lease without change in the terms and provisions of
this Lease, provided that such successor shall not be bound by any payment of
Base Rent for more than one month in advance, except prepayments in the nature
of security for the performance by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease,
and then only if such prepayments have been deposited with and are under the
control of such successor. Tenant shall promptly execute and deliver any
reasonable instrument that may be necessary to evidence such attornment.

       SECTION 20.02 ESTOPPEL. Tenant and Landlord agree, at any time, and from
time to time, within twenty (20) days after written request of the other, to
execute, acknowledge and deliver a statement in writing ("ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE")
in recordable form to the other party and/or its designee in form and content
mutually satisfactory to Tenant, Lender and Landlord (or successor owner, if
any), certifying that: (i) if such should be the case, this Lease is unmodified
and in full force and effect (or, if there have been modifications, that the
same is in full force and effect, as modified if such be the case), (ii) the
dates to which Base Rent, and other charges have been paid, (iii) whether or
not, to the best knowledge of the signer of such certificate, there exists any
failure by the requesting party to perform any term, covenant or condition
contained in this Lease, and, if so, specifying each such failure of which the
signer may have knowledge, (iv) (if such be the case) Tenant has accepted the
Project and is conducting its business therein, and (v) as to such additional
matters as may be reasonably requested, and being in fact true, it being
intended that any such statement delivered pursuant hereto may be relied upon by
Landlord, Tenant and Tenant's successors and by any purchaser of title to the
Project or by any mortgagee or any assignee thereof or any party to any
sale-leaseback of the Project, or the landlord under a ground lease affecting
the Project.

                        ARTICLE 21 - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

       SECTION 21.01 DEFAULTS.

       (a) The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall
constitute an "Event of Default" of Tenant under this Lease:

                  (i) if Tenant fails to pay Base Rent, Additional Rent or any
         other sum due hereunder as and when such rent or other sum becomes due
         and such failure shall continue for more than ten (10) days after
         receipt of written notice from Landlord of such failure;

                  (ii) if Tenant permits to be done anything which creates a
         lien upon the Project and fails to discharge such lien, bond such lien
         or post security with Landlord reasonably acceptable to Landlord within
         thirty (30) days after receipt by Tenant of written notice thereof;

                  (iii) if Tenant fails to maintain in force all policies of
         insurance required by this Lease and such failure shall continue for
         more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of
         such failure;

                  (iv) if any petition is filed by or against Tenant or
         Guarantor under any present or future section or chapter of the
         Bankruptcy Code, or under any similar law or statute of the United
         States or any state thereof (which, in the case of an involuntary
         proceeding, is not permanently discharged, dismissed, stayed, or
         vacated, as the case may be, within ninety (90) days of commencement),
         or if any order for relief shall be entered against Tenant or the
         Guarantor in any such proceedings;

                  (v) if Tenant or Guarantor becomes insolvent or makes a
         transfer in fraud of creditors or makes an assignment for the benefit
         of creditors;

                  (vi) if a receiver, custodian, or trustee is appointed for
         Tenant's interest in the Project or for all or substantially all of the
         assets of Tenant or Guarantor, which appointment is not vacated within
         ninety (90) days following the date of such appointment;

                  (vii) if Tenant fails to perform or observe any other term of
         this Lease and such failure shall continue for more than thirty (30)
         days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice of such failure, or, if
         such failure cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, if
         Tenant does not commence to correct such default within said thirty
         (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecute the correction of
         same to completion within a reasonable time;

                                       35
<PAGE>   43


                  (viii) if Guarantor fails to perform or observe any other
         term or provision of this Lease and such failure shall continue for
         more than thirty (30) days after Landlord gives Guarantor written
         notice of such failure, or, if such failure cannot be corrected within
         such thirty (30) day period, if Guarantor does not commence to correct
         such default within said thirty (30) day period and thereafter
         diligently prosecutes the correction of same to completion within a
         reasonable time;

                  (ix) if Tenant notifies Landlord in writing that it does not
         intend to occupy the Project and/or will not commence payment of Base
         Rent; or

                  (x) if Guarantor fails to execute the Intuit Guaranty
         simultaneously with the execution of this Lease, or if the Guarantor
         fails to perform or observe any term or provision of the Intuit
         Guaranty and such failure shall continue for more than thirty (30) days
         after Landlord gives Guarantor written notice of such failure, or, if
         such failure cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, if
         Guarantor does not commence to cure such default within said thirty
         (30) day period and thereafter does not prosecute the correction of
         same to completion within a reasonable amount of time.

Landlord agrees that it shall accept a cure by the Guarantor of any default by
the Tenant hereunder prior to the date such default has become an Event of
Default.

       SECTION 21.02 REMEDIES.

       (a) Upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Default, Landlord
may, at Landlord's option, without any demand or notice whatsoever (except as
expressly required in this Section 21.02):

                  (i) Continue this Lease in full force and effect, and Landlord
         shall have the right to collect Base Rent and other sums when due; or

                  (ii) Terminate Tenant's right to possession of the Project at
         any time by giving written notice to that effect, and relet the Project
         or any part thereof. On the giving of the notice, all of Tenant's
         rights in the Project shall terminate. Upon such termination, Tenant
         shall surrender and vacate the Project in good condition, ordinary wear
         and tear excepted, within sixty (60) days of the date of the notice,
         and Landlord may re-enter and take possession of the Project in
         accordance with applicable law. Any termination under this Section
         21.02 shall not release Tenant from the payment of any sum then due
         Landlord or from any claim for damages or Base Rent or other sum
         previously accrued or then accruing against Tenant. Upon such
         termination Tenant shall be liable immediately to Landlord for all
         reasonable costs Landlord incurs in reletting the Project or any part
         thereof, including, without limitation, broker's commissions, expenses
         of cleaning and reasonable costs and expenses for redecorating the
         Project required by the reletting, reasonable attorneys' fees actually
         incurred and like costs. Such costs shall be due and payable twenty
         (20) days after

                                       36
<PAGE>   44
         written demand for, and verification of, such costs are provided to
         Tenant. Reletting may be for a period shorter or longer than the
         remaining Term of this Lease. In the event such reletting is for a
         period longer than the remaining Term of this Lease, such costs shall
         be allocated based upon the ratio that the remaining Term of this Lease
         bears to the term of the reletting, unless such costs would not have
         been incurred but for Tenant's breach of the Lease. No act by Landlord
         other than giving express written notice of termination to Tenant shall
         terminate this Lease. Acts of maintenance, efforts to relet the Project
         permitted hereunder or the appointment of a receiver on Landlord's
         initiative to protect Landlord's interest under this Lease shall not
         constitute a termination of Tenant's right to possession. On
         termination, Landlord has the right, at Tenant's cost and without
         liability for the loss thereof or damage thereto, if Tenant has left
         any personal property or the Project, to remove all Tenant's personal
         property, which shall be deemed to have been abandoned by Tenant, and
         either store same or otherwise dispose of same in Landlord's sole and
         absolute discretion. Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge that in the
         event of such a termination, actual damages to Landlord may be
         difficult to ascertain and, accordingly, hereby agree that in such
         event, the net present value of the Base Rent due from the date of such
         termination to the expiration date of the Term or any extension, if
         exercised (the "EXPIRATION DATE"), discounted at five percent (5%) per
         annum, shall thereupon be due and payable to Landlord as liquidated
         damages within twenty (20) days after written notice therefor to
         compensate Landlord for Tenant's default and such termination. Such
         liquidated damages and costs shall be reduced (but not below zero) by
         the amount of rentals which Landlord has received at the time of
         payment by Tenant. In addition, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant (but
         not in excess of such liquidated damages and costs) the amount of
         rentals which Landlord receives as a result of its duty to mitigate set
         forth in subsection (f) of this Section 21.02 for the remaining Term of
         the Lease (without consideration of any renewal options), which payment
         by Landlord to Tenant shall be reduced by any reasonable costs, fees
         and expenses including brokerage commissions and refurbishment costs,
         incurred by Landlord in the exercise of its duty to mitigate
         hereunder)]. Rentals received by the Landlord after the aforesaid
         payments by Tenant (but not in excess of Tenant's payment of such
         liquidated damages and payment of Landlord's costs hereunder) for any
         period of time prior to the date that would have been the expiration
         date of this Lease had this Lease not been terminated, shall be
         immediately due and payable by Landlord to Tenant, and costs incurred
         by Landlord for reletting for a period longer than the remaining Term
         of this Lease shall be allocated as provided hereinabove, unless such
         costs would not have been incurred but for Tenant's breach of the
         Lease. Tenant waives redemption or relief from forfeiture under any
         other present or future law, in the event Tenant is evicted or Landlord
         takes possession of the Project by reason of any default of Tenant
         hereunder; or

                  (iii) Without terminating this Lease, and without terminating
         Tenant's obligation to pay all sums due and owing hereunder, including,
         without limitation, Base Rent and other sums due hereunder, in its own
         name but as agent for Tenant enter into and upon and take possession of
         the Project or any part thereof. Any property remaining in the Project
         may be removed and stored in a warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of,
         and for the account of Tenant

                                       37
<PAGE>   45
         without Landlord being deemed guilty of trespass or becoming liable for
         any loss or damage which may be occasioned thereby unless caused by
         Landlord's negligence. Thereafter, Landlord shall exercise commercially
         reasonable efforts to, in accordance with Section 21.02(f), lease to a
         third party the Project or any portion thereof as the agent of Tenant
         upon such terms and conditions as Landlord may deem necessary or
         desirable in order to relet the Project. The remainder of any rentals
         actually received by Landlord from such reletting, after the payment of
         any indebtedness due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord, and the payment
         of any costs and expenses of such reletting, shall be held by Landlord
         to the extent of and for application in payment of future rent owed by
         Tenant, if any, as the same may become due and payable hereunder. If
         such rentals received from such reletting shall at any time or from
         time to time be less than sufficient to pay to Landlord the entire sums
         then due from Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall pay any such deficiency to
         Landlord. Notwithstanding any such reletting without termination,
         Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for
         any such previous default provided same has not been cured; or

                  (iv) Without terminating this Lease, and with or without
         notice to Tenant, enter into and upon the Project and without being
         liable for prosecution or any claim for damages therefor, maintain the
         Project and repair or replace any damage thereto or do anything or make
         any payment for which Tenant is responsible hereunder. Tenant shall
         reimburse Landlord immediately upon demand for any expenses which
         Landlord incurs in thus effecting Tenant's compliance under this Lease
         and Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any damages with respect
         thereto.

                  (v) Without liability to Tenant or any other party and without
         constituting a constructive or actual eviction, suspend or discontinue
         furnishing or rendering to Tenant any property, material, labor,
         utilities or other service, wherever Landlord is obligated to furnish
         or render the same so long as Tenant is in default under this Lease; or

                  (vi) Without terminating this Lease, immediately cease all
         construction work required to be performed by Landlord pursuant to the
         terms of this Lease and/or allow the Project to remain unoccupied and
         /or incomplete until the Event of Default is cured to the reasonable
         satisfaction of Landlord (which right to cure such Event of Default is
         subject to the consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be
         unreasonably withheld), and collect rent from Tenant as it comes due
         (for purposes of this provision, Base Rent shall commence on the date
         which Tenant commits an Event of Default); or

                  (vii) Fulfill any obligation of Tenant under this Lease,
         including, without limitation, the payment of insurance premiums or
         obtaining insurance policies required under this Lease, and Tenant
         shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for all costs, expenses and/or
         premiums paid by Landlord; or

                  (viii) Pursue such other remedies as are available at law or
         in equity.

                                       38

<PAGE>   46

       (b) If this Lease shall terminate as a result of or while there exists an
Event of Default hereunder, any funds of Tenant held by Landlord may be applied
by Landlord to any damages payable by Tenant (whether provided for herein or by
law) as a result of such termination or default.

       (c) Neither the commencement of any action or proceeding, nor the
settlement thereof, nor entry of judgment thereon shall bar Landlord from
bringing subsequent actions or proceedings from time to time, nor shall the
failure to include in any action or proceeding any sum or sums then due be a bar
to the maintenance of any subsequent actions or proceedings for the recovery of
such sum or sums so omitted.

       (d) No agreement to accept a surrender of the Project and no act or
omission by Landlord or Landlord's agents during the Term shall constitute an
acceptance or surrender of the Project unless made in writing and signed by
Landlord. No re-entry or taking possession of the Project by Landlord pursuant
to this Section 21.02 shall constitute an election by Landlord to terminate this
Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given to Tenant. Landlord's
acceptance of Base Rent or other sums in full or in part following an Event of
Default hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of such Event of Default.
No custom or practice which may come to exist between the parties in connection
with the terms of this Lease shall be construed to waive or lessen either
party's right to insist upon strict performance of the terms of this Lease,
without a written notice thereof to the other party.

       (e) If an Event of Default shall occur, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on
demand, all expenses incurred by Landlord as a result thereof, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and expenses actually incurred.

       (f) Landlord's and Tenant's rights pursuant to this Section 21.02,
including, without limitation, Landlord's rights to collect Base Rent and other
charges due under this Lease, shall survive any termination of this Lease.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Landlord and Tenant
hereby agree that Landlord shall have a duty to reasonably mitigate or attempt
to offset any damages which are or may be suffered by Landlord as a result of
any default of Tenant under this Lease in accordance with and to the extent
required by Texas law. Any payment by Tenant of a sum of money less than the
entire amount due Landlord at the time of such payment shall be applied to the
obligations that are then furthest in arrears. No endorsement or statement on
any check or accompanying any payment shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction
and any payment accepted by Landlord shall be without prejudice to Landlord's
right to obtain the balance due or pursue any other remedy available to Landlord
both in law and in equity.

        (g) Upon occurrence of an uncured Event of Default, Tenant's rights to
 sublease or assign under Section 19.01 of this Lease shall immediately
 terminate.
                                       39
<PAGE>   47


       (h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, Landlord shall not have the right to
dispossess Tenant from the Project without judicial process and Landlord shall
specifically have no right of commercial lock-out without the benefit of
judicial review.

       SECTION 21.03 LANDLORD'S DEFAULT.

                  (a) (i) If prior to Substantial Completion, and as an
         alternative to recourse under the Completion Guaranty, Landlord
         defaults in the performance or observance of any provision of this
         Lease or the Covenants (including, but not limited to, the failure to
         deliver to Tenant an executed original of the Completion Guaranty),
         Tenant may, at its option, give Landlord and Lender written notice
         specifying in what manner Landlord has defaulted, provided that
         Tenant's failure, if any, to give such notice shall not be deemed to be
         a waiver by Tenant of such default. If such default shall not have been
         cured by Landlord or its Lender within thirty (30) days after the
         receipt of such notice (except that if such default cannot be cured
         within said thirty (30) day period, this period shall be extended for a
         reasonable additional time provided that Landlord or its Lender
         commences to cure such default within the thirty (30) day period and
         diligently proceeds to effect such cure), Tenant may cure such default
         and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant within twenty (20) days after
         receipt of a certified invoice from Tenant accompanied by applicable
         bills for any reasonable amount paid and any reasonable expense or
         contractual liability incurred with interest at the Specified Rate
         accruing from the date of payment by Tenant to the date of
         reimbursement by Landlord; provided, however, Tenant hereby expressly
         waives any right to claim or collect consequential or punitive damages
         therefor and waives all other remedies except for those specifically
         made available in this Section 21.03 to Tenant for the respective
         default by Landlord. If Landlord fails to reimburse Tenant within the
         time period specified herein, Tenant may offset the amounts required to
         be reimbursed against the next following payments of Base Rent and/or
         Additional Rent, plus interest at the Specified Rate accrued to the
         date of offset, against subsequent payments of Base Rent and/or
         Additional Rent until such amounts have been reimbursed in full;
         provided, however, such offset shall be limited to 25% of the Base Rent
         and/or Additional Rent due and payable each month throughout the then
         existing Term of this Lease, but in the event such percentage
         limitation will not enable Tenant to be fully reimbursed prior to the
         expiration of the then existing Term of this Lease, then the amount
         required to be reimbursed shall be divided by the number of months
         remaining in the then existing Term of this Lease, and the quotient
         thereof, plus accrued interest at the Specified Rate shall be offset
         against the monthly payments of Base Rent and/or Additional Rent over
         the remainder of the then existing Term of this Lease.

                  (ii) The foregoing provisions to the contrary notwithstanding,
         in the event that subsequent to Substantial Completion, Landlord
         defaults in the performance or observance of any provision of this
         lease, beyond any applicable cure period, tenant may cure such default
         and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant within thirty (30) days after
         receipt of a certified invoice from Tenant accompanied by applicable
         bills for any reasonable amount paid and any reasonable expense or
         contractual liability incurred, with interest at the Specified Rate
         accruing from the date of payment by Tenant to the date of
         reimbursement by Landlord and if Landlord fails to reimburse


                                       40


<PAGE>   48
         Tenant within such time period, Tenant may offset the amounts required
         to be reimbursed, plus interest at the Specified Rate accrued to the
         date of offset, against subsequent payments of Base Rent and/or
         Additional Rent until such amounts have been reimbursed in full;
         provided, however, such offset shall be limited to 25% of the Base Rent
         and/or Additional Rent due and payable each month throughout the then
         existing Term of this Lease, but in the event such percentage
         limitation will not enable Tenant to be fully reimbursed prior to the
         expiration of the then existing Term of this Lease as of the date the
         reimbursement is due and payable, then the amount required to be
         reimbursed shall be divided by the number of months remaining in the
         then existing Term of this Lease, and the quotient thereof, plus
         accrued interest at the Specified Rate shall be offset against the
         monthly payments of Base Rent and/or Additional Rent over the remainder
         of the then existing Term of this Lease. In the event that Tenant
         determines, in the exercise of its good faith reasonable judgment, that
         the remedy of self help and offset is either unavailable or inadequate,
         then Tenant may institute a proceeding for specific performance against
         Landlord and/or for a declaratory judgment with the appropriate legal
         or equitable remedies, and in the event that Tenant determines, again
         in the exercise of its good faith reasonable judgment, that the remedy
         of specific performance and/or declaratory judgment is either
         unavailable or inadequate, Tenant may plead in the alternative for
         actual damages (and Tenant hereby expressly waives any right to claim
         or collect consequential or punitive damages), which damages shall be
         limited to the lesser of Landlord's equity in the Project or the sum of
         $5,000,000.00.

        (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 21.03(c) and (d), and in
addition to recourse under the Completion Guaranty, in the event of Landlord's
failure to achieve Substantial Completion by the date set forth in the
Development Schedule, as may be extended by Force Majeure and Tenant Delays,
Landlord shall be obligated, as liquidated damages and Tenant's sole and
exclusive remedy for such delay, to pay to Tenant the sum of Eight Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($8,000.00) for each day that the Landlord fails to achieve
Substantial Completion, until the date Landlord achieves Substantial Completion.
At Landlord's election, such liquidated damage sum may be paid to Tenant in the
form of a rental credit upon the commencement of payment of Base Rent. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the damages that the Tenant will incur in
such event are difficult to determine or ascertain with certainty as of the time
of the signing of this Lease and that the amount of liquidated damages provided
for herein is not intended as a penalty but, instead, represents their best
reasonable estimate, based on the information available to them, of the damages
that would be incurred and which shall be payable by Landlord in that event to
compensate Tenant as damages resulting from such event.

        (c) In lieu of the remedies set forth in Section 21.03(a)(i) and (b), as
an alternative to recourse under the Completion Guaranty, in the event that the
Landlord fails to complete the following elements of the Project in accordance
with the dates set forth below, subject to Force Majeure and Tenant Delays, the
Tenant may, at Tenant's sole discretion and upon thirty (30) days prior written
notice to Landlord and as its sole and exclusive remedy (except as provided in
subsection (v) below), terminate this Lease in which event neither Tenant nor
Landlord shall have any further obligation hereunder, one to the other:


                                       41
<PAGE>   49


                  (i) Landlord fails to deliver to Tenant an executed original
         of the Completion Guaranty within fifteen (15) days of the date of this
         Lease;

                  (ii) Landlord's failure to acquire title to the Phase I
         Property (subject only to the Permitted Exceptions and such other
         exceptions permitted by Section 1.01(b)) on or before the date which is
         ninety (90) days following the date set forth for such event in the
         Development Schedule;

                  (iii) Landlord fails to commence the site work for the Project
         on or before the date which is one hundred fifty (150) days following
         the date set forth for such event in the Development Schedule;

                  (iv) Landlord fails to complete the "dry-in" of the Building
         on or before the date which is one hundred fifty (150) days following
         the date set forth for such event in the Development Schedule; or

                  (v) Landlord fails to achieve Substantial Completion within
         one hundred fifty (150) days following the date set forth for such
         event in the Development Schedule, in which event Tenant shall also be
         entitled to exercise the remedy in Section 21.03(d) below.

        (d) In the event that the Landlord fails to achieve Substantial
Completion within one hundred fifty (150) days following the date set forth for
such event in the Development Schedule, subject to Force Majeure and Tenant
Delays, provided the Lease has then been terminated pursuant to subsection (c)
above, Landlord shall pay to Tenant as liquidated damages the amount of Five
Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) to compensate Tenant for
damages it will incur due to Landlord's failure to timely complete the Project.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the damages that the Tenant will incur in
such event are difficult to determine or ascertain with certainty as of the time
of the signing of this Lease and that the amount of liquidated damages provided
for herein is not intended as a penalty but, instead, represents their best
reasonable estimate, based on the information available to them, of the damages
that would be incurred and which shall be payable by Landlord in that event to
compensate Tenant as damages resulting from such event.

        SECTION 21.04 WAIVER. The waiver by either party of any default of the
failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision hereof, shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default under the same, or under any
other term, covenant or condition of this Lease. The subsequent acceptance of
any rent by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding default
by Tenant under any term, covenant or condition of this Lease, other than the
failure of Tenant to pay the particular rent so accepted, regardless of
Landlord's knowledge of such preceding default at the time of acceptance of such
Rent.

has not dealt with any real estate broker or agent in connection with the
negotiation of this Lease or the leasing of the Building except for The Staubach
Company (the "BROKER"), who shall be compensated by Landlord for the
transactions contemplated by this Lease (including, but not limited to, any
renewals hereof and/or any Project Expansions) pursuant to a written Commission
Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "G," and that no
commissions are due any party other than Broker in connection with the

                       ARTICLE 24 - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         SECTION 24.01 HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES CONTAMINATION.

        (a) For purposes of this Lease:

                  (i) "CONTAMINATION" as used herein means the uncontained or
         uncontrolled presence of or release of Hazardous Substances (as
         hereinafter defined) into any environmental media from, upon, within,
         below, into or on any portion of the Project or the Building, so as to
         require remediation, cleanup or investigation under any applicable
         Environmental Law (as hereinafter defined).

                  (ii) "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" as used herein means all federal,
         state, and local laws, regulations, orders, permits, ordinances or
         other requirements, concerning protection of human health, safety and
         the environment, all as may be amended from time to time.

                  (iii) "HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES" as used herein means any
         hazardous or toxic substance, material, chemical, pollutant,
         contaminant or waste as those terms are defined by any applicable
         Environmental Laws [including, without limitation, the Comprehensive
         Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601
         et seq. ("CERCLA") and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42
         U.S.C. 6901 et seq. ("RCRA")] and any solid wastes, polychlorinated
         biphenyls, urea formaldehyde, asbestos, radioactive materials, radon,
         explosives, petroleum products and oil.

        (b) Landlord represents and covenants that Landlord has not treated,
stored or disposed of any Hazardous Substances upon or within the Project, nor
shall Hazardous Substances be used in connection with the construction of the
Building (except as normally utilized in construction of similar projects), nor,
to Landlord's current, actual knowledge, has any predecessor owner of the
Project stored, treated or disposed of Hazardous Substances upon or within the
Project. Landlord's


                                       44

investigation and knowledge with respect to the environmental condition of the
Real Property shall be limited to the content of that certain Phase I
Environmental Report No. 94007041 A dated January 27, 2000 and prepared by HBC
Engineering, Inc.

        (c) Tenant represents and covenants that all its activities on the
Project and the Building, during the course of this Lease will be conducted in
compliance with Environmental Laws. Tenant warrants to the best of Tenant's
actual knowledge that it is currently in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws and that there are no pending or threatened notices of
deficiency, notices of violation, orders, or judicial or administrative actions
involving alleged violations by Tenant of any Environmental Laws. Tenant, at
Tenant's sole cost and expense, shall be responsible for obtaining all permits
or licenses or approvals under Environmental Laws necessary for Tenant's
operation of its business on the Project and shall make all notifications and
registrations required by any applicable Environmental Laws. Tenant, at Tenant's
sole cost and expense, shall at all times comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, licenses, approvals, notifications and registrations and
with any other applicable Environmental Laws. Tenant covenants that it will
obtain all such permits, licenses or approvals and make all such notifications
and registrations required by any applicable Environmental Laws necessary for
Tenant's operation of its business on the Project. Tenant shall not, however, be
required to obtain any permits, licenses, approvals, notifications or
registrations related to the construction of the Building.

        (d) Tenant shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Substances to be
brought upon, kept or used in or about the Project or the Building, without the
prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that the consent of Landlord shall not be required
for the use at the Project of cleaning supplies, toner for photocopying machines
and other similar materials, as well as other substances typically used in
Tenant's business that might otherwise be considered Hazardous Substances, in
containers and quantities reasonably necessary for and consistent with normal
and ordinary use by Tenant, at the Project, in the routine operation of Tenant's
business or maintenance of Tenant's office or in the routine janitorial service,
cleaning and maintenance for the Project. For purposes of this Section 24.01,
Landlord shall be deemed to have reasonably withheld consent if Landlord
determines that the presence of such Hazardous Substance within the Project
could result in a risk of harm to person or property or otherwise negatively
affect the value or marketability of the Building or the Project.

        (e) Tenant shall not cause or permit the release of any Hazardous
Substances by Tenant or its agents, contractors, employees or invitees into any
environmental media such as air, water or land, or into or on the Project or the
Building in any manner that violates any Environmental Laws. If such release
shall occur, Tenant shall (i) take all steps reasonably necessary to contain and
control such release and any associated Contamination, (ii) clean up or
otherwise remedy such release and any associated Contamination to the extent
required by, and take any and all other actions required under, applicable
Environmental Laws and (iii) notify and keep Landlord reasonably informed in
writing of such release and response.

                                       45
<PAGE>   53

        (f) Regardless of any consents granted by Landlord pursuant to Section
24.01 (d) allowing Hazardous Substances upon the Project, Tenant shall under no
circumstances whatsoever (i) cause or permit any activity on the Project which
would cause the Project to become subject to regulation as a hazardous waste
treatment, storage or disposal facility under RCRA or the regulations
promulgated thereunder; (ii) discharge Hazardous Substances into the storm sewer
system serving the Project; or (iii) install any underground storage tank or
underground piping under the Project.

        (g) Tenant shall and hereby does indemnify, defend and hold Landlord
harmless from and against any and all expense, loss and liability suffered by
Landlord (with the exception of those expenses, losses, and liabilities arising
from Landlord's own negligence or willful act), by reason of Tenant's improper
storage, generation, handling, treatment, transportation, disposal, or
arrangement for transportation or disposal, of any Hazardous Substances caused
or permitted by Tenant to be brought upon the Project (whether accidental,
intentional, or negligent) or by reason of Tenant's breach of any of the
provisions of this Section 24.01. Such expenses, losses and liabilities shall
include, without limitation, (i) any and all expenses that Landlord may incur to
comply with any Environmental Laws as a result of Tenant's failure to comply
therewith; (ii) any and all costs that Landlord may incur in studying or
remedying any Contamination at or arising from the Project or the Building;
(iii) any and all costs that Landlord may incur in studying, removing, disposing
or otherwise addressing any Hazardous Substances; (iv) any and all fines,
penalties or other sanctions assessed upon Landlord by reason of Tenant's
failure to comply with Environmental Laws; and (v) any and all legal and
professional fees and costs incurred by Landlord in connection with the
foregoing. The indemnity contained herein shall survive the termination or
expiration of this Lease.

        (h) Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, upon
twenty-four (24) hours prior written notice and during normal business hours,
except for emergencies, to enter the Project accompanied by Tenant's
representative throughout the Term to audit and inspect the Project for Tenant's
compliance with this Section 24.01.

        (i) Landlord shall and hereby does indemnify, defend and hold Tenant
harmless from and against any and all expenses, loss and liability suffered by
Tenant (with the exception of those expenses, losses and liabilities arising
from Tenant's own negligence or willful act or the negligence or willful act of
Tenant's officers, contractors, licensees, agents, servants, guests, invitees or
visitors) by reason of the presence of any Hazardous Substances in the Building
or on or under the Project at any time prior to the Term Commencement Date, or
placed or caused to be placed by Landlord, its agents or employees in, on or
under the Project thereafter.

                         ARTICLE 25 - PROJECT EXPANSIONS

        SECTION 25.01 EXPANSION NOTICE. The Tenant shall have the right to cause
the development of one or more Project Expansions by satisfying the provisions
of this Article 25. Likewise, the Tenant reserves the right to cause Landlord to
acquire one or more portions of the Future Development Property and to construct
Project Expansions in the event that the Tenant provides written notices (an
"EXPANSION NOTICE") TO THE Landlord on or before September 30, 2005 (or such


                                       46
<PAGE>   54

earlier date which is two hundred seventy (270) days prior to the outside option
closing date set forth in the Acquisition Contract), which notices shall contain
substantially the same specificity of detail for the Project Expansion as is
described for Phase I of the Project in the Base Building Outline Specifications
attached hereto as Exhibit "C" (including, but not limited to, any surface
parking or parking structures required by Tenant), modified to reflect the
features and square footage of the Project Expansion. An Expansion Notice shall
also contain a proposed development timeline (the "EXPANSION DEVELOPMENT
TIMELINE") requested by Tenant in connection with the development of the Project
Expansion, which Expansion Development Timeline shall consist of dates for the
development of plans and specifications, acquisition of the portion of the Real
Property applicable to the Project Expansion, commencement of the construction
of the Project Expansion and the date for Substantial Completion of the Project
Expansion. In addition, the Expansion Notice shall identify with specificity the
portion of the Real Property upon which the Project Expansion shall be
developed, subject to the provisions of the Acquisition Contract. Subject to the
provisions of this Article 25, Landlord shall acquire the portion of the Future
Development Property outlined in the Expansion Notice on or before the date set
forth in the Expansion Development Schedule (as approved by Landlord and Tenant
as provided in Section 25.02) for the acquisition of the Future Development
Property and in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Contract.

        SECTION 25.02 SPECIFICATION NOTICE. Within sixty (60) days following
receipt of an Expansion Notice, Landlord shall submit to Tenant a notice (the
"SPECIFICATION NOTICE"), which notice shall contain preliminary conceptual plans
and specifications for the Project Expansion (the "Outline Specifications"), as
well as (i) Landlord's best good faith estimate of total costs (hard and soft)
of constructing the Project Expansion, (ii) the projected Base Rent, based on
the prevailing interest rates at the date of the Specification Notice, and (iii)
a development schedule consisting of dates for the development of plans and
specifications, acquisition of the portion of the Real Property applicable to
the Project Expansion, commencement of the construction of the Project Expansion
and the date for Substantial Completion of the Project Expansion (the "EXPANSION
DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE"), all of which shall be mutually reviewed and approved by
Landlord and Tenant within thirty (30) days following receipt of the
Specification Notice. During such thirty (30) days, Landlord and Tenant agree to
act reasonably and in good faith to reconcile any differences between the
Expansion Notice and the Specification Notice in order to avoid any delay in the
commencement of the Project Expansion.

        SECTION 25.03 GOVERNING PROVISIONS. In the event that the Tenant timely
exercises its rights to cause the development of a Project Expansion, the
following provisions shall control the development thereof:

        (a) Tenant acknowledges that each Project Expansion must satisfy the
provisions of the Acquisition Contract with respect to the notices required to
be given and timing of any closings to occur thereunder and the configuration of
the portion of the Future Development Property to be acquired by Landlord in
connection with the Project Expansion described in the Expansion Notice.

                                       47
<PAGE>   55

The Landlord shall not be bound to develop the Project Expansion described in
the Expansion Notice unless the provisions of such Expansion Notice expressly
satisfy the terms, provisions and conditions of the Acquisition Contract related
thereto.

        (b) The building and other improvements to be constructed pursuant to
each Project Expansion shall be of a design, nature and type substantially
similar to the Building, unless at the request of Tenant, Landlord, in its sole,
reasonable discretion, shall agree to construct a Project Expansion of a
different design, nature and type. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Tenant Improvements may be of a different design, nature and type
but if the cost of such Tenant Improvements exceeds $30.00 per square foot,
Tenant shall pay such excess cost.

        (c) Base Rent for each Project Expansion calculated as provided herein
below, shall commence upon the date that each Project Expansion is Substantially
Completed, subject only to "punch list" items and other items of incomplete work
that do not materially adversely interfere with the use and occupancy of the
Project Expansion (as certified to Landlord and Tenant by the Architect) and
delivered to Tenant for Tenant's occupancy (the "PROJECT EXPANSION COMMENCEMENT
DATE"). Each Project Expansion Base Rent shall be included in the definition of
"Base Rent" for purposes of this Lease, and shall be payable concurrently with
payments of Base Rent hereunder as set forth in Section 5.01 of this Lease. Upon
the acquisition of any portion of the Future Development Property, each Project
Expansion shall be deemed to be a part of the Project hereunder, and, upon the
Project Expansion Commencement Date, in addition to Base Rent, Tenant shall pay
all Additional Rent for each Project Expansion as set forth in the Lease.

        (d) Annual Base Rent for each Project Expansion shall be equal to the
amount obtained by multiplying (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the costs
(including both so-called "hard costs" and "soft costs" and land acquisition
costs) incurred by Landlord to construct the Project Expansion (which costs
shall be subject to Tenant's reasonable right of audit and review) by (ii) an
interest rate equal to four hundred (400) basis points in excess of the interest
rate payable for the most recently issued 10-year treasury obligations of the
United States government as of each Project Expansion Commencement Date (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or its successor publication). Base Rent for
each Project Expansion shall increase over the Term in an amount corresponding
to the percentage increase of Base Rent for the Project Expansion for each Lease
Period, as described in Section 5.01 and in the expansion phases of Exhibit "H,"
or for each Renewal Term, as described in Section 4.02 and the expansion phases
of Exhibit "H."

        (e) This Lease shall be modified such that the Term of the Lease for the
Project (including each prior Project Expansion, if any) shall expire ten (10)
years from the last of any Project Expansion Commencement Dates.

        (f) Anything in this Article 25 to the contrary notwithstanding,
Landlord shall be obligated to construct any Project Expansion and lease the
Project Expansion to Tenant only if the following conditions shall be satisfied:

                                       48
<PAGE>   56

                  (i) No uncured Event of Default shall exist:

                  (ii) This Lease shall not have been terminated and shall be in
         full force and effect; and

                  (iii) Either (1) Guarantor consents to such Project Expansion
         and agrees that the Guarantor shall guarantee the obligations of the
         Tenant with respect to the Project Expansion, or (2) Lacerte (if
         Lacerte is not then the Tenant under this Lease) or Tenant shall have a
         tangible net worth calculated in accordance with generally accepted
         accounting principles at the time of delivery of such Expansion Notice
         equal to or greater than One Hundred Million and No/100 Dollars U.S.
         ($100,000,000.00 U.S.), and Tenant agrees that the Base Rent payable
         with respect to such Project Expansion shall equal the calculation
         provided for Base Rent in Section 25.03(d), except that the reference
         therein to four hundred (400) basis points shall become five hundred
         fifty (550) basis points. Failure of Guarantor to consent to any
         Project Expansion shall not relieve Guarantor of any other liability
         under the Intuit Guaranty.

         (g) Except as provided otherwise in this Article 25, each and every
right, duty, obligation, agreement and remedy of the Landlord and of the Tenant
respectively, under this Lease Agreement with respect to the development and
construction of Phase I of the Project shall be equally applicable and binding
on the respective parties with respect to the development and construction of
each Project Expansion, it being understood that the Base Building Outline
Specifications and Site Plans for the Project Expansion and the Expansion
Development Schedule for each Project Expansion shall be attached hereto as
additional and consecutively lettered exhibits and dated and signed by the
Landlord and Tenant promptly after approval thereof by Landlord and Tenant. Each
such set of exhibits shall further identify each Project Expansion numerically
in the order in which they occurred. In addition, all the terms, provisions and
conditions of this Lease shall govern the rights and liabilities of Landlord and
of Tenant with respect to any Project Expansion, including, but not limited to,
the provisions relating to the commencement and payment of Base Rent and
Additional Rent, the providing of the Improvement Allowance at Thirty and No/100
Dollars ($30.00) per square foot of Rentable Area of the Project Expansion as
provided in Section 3.02 hereof, Landlord and Tenant repair and replacement
obligations, remedies upon an Event of Default and payments owed to Brokers.
When the portion of the Future Development Property for each Project Expansion
is acquired in accordance with terms hereof, then such Project Expansion shall
be deemed to be part of the Project for purposes of this Lease.

         (h) In the event that Landlord has sold the Project and it is no longer
the Landlord hereunder, the Tenant may cause a Project Expansion to be developed
by the successor landlord (the "SUCCESSOR LANDLORD"). If the Successor Landlord
elects not to be the developer of the Project Expansion, the Successor Landlord
shall identify in the Specification Notice the proposed developer for the
Project Expansion, the use of which proposed developer shall be subject to the
Tenant's

                                       49
<PAGE>   57

reasonable prior right of approval, which reasonable approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Each and every obligation of the Landlord with respect to
the development and construction of a Project Expansion shall be applicable to
and binding upon the Successor Landlord.

         (i) Any reference in any part of this Article 25 to specific sections
or terms of this Lease Agreement is not intended to imply or infer that the
other sections or terms of this Lease Agreement are inapplicable to any Project
Expansion, it being agreed instead that all sections and terms of this Lease
Agreement shall apply equally to any Project Expansion, except as modified in
this Article 25. Landlord and Tenant agree that the terms of Section 2.05
regarding the guarantee of the construction obligations by Koll, the terms of
Section 3.04 regarding "Supplemental Allowance" and the terms of Section 4.03
regarding "Refurbishment Allowance" shall not apply to any Project Expansion.
Landlord and Tenant further agree that the following defined terms in the Lease
Agreement shall have the following meanings in the context of an Article 25
Project Expansion for which an Expansion Notice has been given by Tenant:

                  (i) The term "Phase I" shall, whenever the context so requires
         to give meaning to the term as it relates to a Project Expansion, mean

         retained by Tenant for the Tenant Improvements for the Project
         Expansion to perform the TI Architect's duties as identified in the
         Lease;

                  (iii) The term "Development Schedule" shall mean the Expansion
         Development Schedule provided for in Section 25.02 hereof for the
         development and construction of the Project Expansion;

                  (iv) The term "Building" shall mean the structure and related
         improvements being constructed by the Landlord or Successor Landlord
         for the Project Expansion;

                  (v) The term "Parking" shall mean the number and types of
         parking spaces to be provided for the Project Expansion, to be
         configured and of the type and amount to accommodate the capacity of

<PAGE>   58


                  (viii) The term "Contractor" shall mean the contractor
         proposed and/or used by Landlord or Successor Landlord for the
         construction of the Base Building Work for the Project Expansion, and
         the term "TI Contractor" shall mean the contractor proposed and/or used
         by Tenant for construction of the Tenant Improvements for the Project
         Expansion;

                  (ix) The term "Base Building Work" shall mean the scope of the
         work and responsibilities of the Landlord or Successor Landlord,

                  (x) The term "Tenant Improvements" shall mean all improvements
         not part of the Base Building Work for the Project Expansion.

         (j) For purposes of a Project Expansion, Section 21.03(a)(i), (b), (c),
and (d) shall be inapplicable and the following provisions shall apply:

                  (i) In the event that the Landlord or Successor Landlord fails
         to complete the following elements of any Project Expansion in
         accordance with the dates set forth below, subject to Force Majeure and
         Tenant Delays, (aa) the Tenant may at Tenant's sole discretion and upon
         thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord either terminate
         this Lease as to the Project Expansion only, in which event neither
         Tenant nor Landlord shall have any further obligation hereunder as to
         the Project Expansion only, one to the other, or (bb) the Tenant may
         seek the remedies provided in Section 21.03(a)(ii) (notwithstanding
         that such remedies as to Phase I are applicable only after Substantial
         Completion);

                           (1) Landlord or Successor Landlord fails to acquire
                  title to the Future Development Property (subject only to the
                  Permitted Exceptions and such other exceptions permitted by
                  Section 1.01(b)) on or before the date which is ninety (90)
                  days following the date set forth for such event in the
                  Expansion Development Schedule;

                           (2) Landlord or Successor Landlord fails to commence
                  the site work for the Project Expansion on or before the date
                  which is one hundred fifty (150) days following the date set
                  forth for such event in the Expansion Development Schedule;

                           (3) Landlord or Successor Landlord fails to complete
                  the "dry-in" of the Project Expansion improvements on or
                  before the date which is one hundred fifty (150) days
                  following the date set forth for such event in the Expansion
                  Development Schedule; or

                           (4) Landlord or Successor Landlord fails to achieve
                  Substantial Completion within one hundred fifty (150) days
                  following the date set forth for such event in the Expansion
                  Development Schedule.


                                       51
<PAGE>   59


                  (ii) As an alternative remedy to subsection (j)(i) above, in
         the event of Landlord's or Successor Landlord's failure to achieve
         Substantial Completion by the date set forth in the Expansion
         Development Schedule, as that date may be extended by Force Majeure and
         Tenant Delays, Landlord shall be obligated, as liquidated damages for
         such delay, to pay to Tenant the sum of Eight Thousand and No/100
         Dollars ($8,000.00) for each day that the Landlord fails to achieve
         Substantial Completion, until the date Landlord achieves Substantial
         Completion. At Landlord's election, such liquidated damage sum may be
         paid to Tenant in the form of a rental credit upon the commencement of
         payment of Base Rent for the Project Expansion. The parties acknowledge
         and agree that the damages that the Tenant will incur in such event are
         difficult to determine or ascertain with certainty as of the time of
         the signing of this Lease and that the amount of liquidated damages
         provided for herein is not intended as a penalty but, instead,
         represents their best reasonable estimate, based on the information
         available to them, of the damages that would be incurred and which
         shall be payable by Landlord in that event to compensate Tenant as
         damages resulting from such event.

                  (iii) As an additional remedy in the event of a termination
         under subsection (j)(i)(aa) above, in the event that the Landlord or
         Successor. Landlord fails to achieve Substantial Completion within one
         hundred fifty (150) days following the date set forth for such event in
         the Expansion Development Schedule, subject to Force Majeure and Tenant
         Delays, in the event Tenant has exercised its right to terminate the
         Lease as to Project Expansion only as described in subsection (j)(i)
         (aa) above, Landlord shall pay Tenant as liquidated damages the amount
         of Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) to compensate
         Tenant for damages it will incur due to Landlord's or Successor
         Landlord's failure to timely complete the Project Expansion. The
         parties acknowledge and agree that the damages that the Tenant will
         incur in such event are difficult to determine or ascertain with
         certainty as of the time of the signing of this Lease and that the
         amount of liquidated damages provided for herein is not intended as a
         penalty but, instead, represents their best reasonable estimate, based
         on the information available to them, of the damages that would be
         incurred and which shall be payable by Landlord in that event to
         compensate Tenant as damages resulting from such event.

                  (iv) In the event there are recorded against the Future
         Development Property any easements or exceptions which arise or exist
         as a result of the acts, omissions or participation, directly or
         indirectly, of Landlord (other than the Permitted Exceptions and other
         than those easements and exceptions which are necessary in connection
         with the development of the Project, provided such additional easements
         and exceptions do not impair Tenant's use of the Project, in which
         event the remedies provided in this subsection (iv) shall not apply),
         (1) the Tenant may, prior to the commencement of construction of the
         Project Expansion and upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to
         Landlord either terminate this Lease as to the Project Expansion only,
         in which event neither Tenant nor Landlord shall

         have any further obligation hereunder as to the Project Expansion only,
         one to the other, or (2) the Tenant may seek the remedies provided in
         Section 21.03(a)(ii) (notwithstanding that such remedies as to Phase I
         are applicable only after Substantial Completion).

                  (v) In the event there are recorded against the Future
         Development Property any easements or exceptions which do not arise or
         exist as a result of the acts, omissions or participation, directly or
         indirectly, of Landlord (other than the Permitted Exceptions and other
         than those easements and exceptions which are necessary in connection
         with the development of the Project, provided such additional easements
         and exceptions do not impair Tenant's use of the Project, in which
         event the remedies provided in this subsection (v) shall not apply),
         (1) the Tenant may, prior to the commencement of construction of the
         Project Expansion and upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to
         Landlord either terminate this Lease as to the Project Expansion only,
         in which event neither Tenant nor Landlord shall have any further
         obligation hereunder as to the Project Expansion only, one to the
         other, and/or (2) Tenant may request Landlord to, and Landlord shall,
         use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such easements or
         exceptions, and/or (3) Tenant may request Landlord to, and Landlord
         shall, assign to Tenant those contractual rights and claims held by
         Landlord pertaining to such easements or exceptions, and Tenant may
         contest the same at its sole cost and expense.

affects the Project. If any such action by Tenant pursuant to this Section 26.04
shall be barred by reason of lack of privity, non-assignability or otherwise,
Landlord shall permit Tenant to take such action in Landlord's name. In any of
these events, Tenant shall, indemnify and hold Landlord harmless against all
liability, loss, cost (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) or

the contrary contained herein, no memorandum of lease or other similar document
shall be filed until such time as any Mortgage affecting the Project has been
recorded.

                                LACERTE SOFTWARE

             CLARIFICATIONS TO BASE BUILDING OUTLINE SPECIFICATIONS

The following clarifications apply to the Request for Proposal issued by The
Staubach Company for the Lacerte Software project. In the event of conflict
between Exhibit A of the Request for Proposal and these clarifications, the
information included in the clarifications below shall apply.

1)  The requirement for parking lighting levels is clarified to be 2 fc average,
    on a maintained basis, and shall include "Medium Activity Level" lighting
    for parking structures, per IES standards.

2)  Dual feed electrical service is not included at this time. Koll will assist
    Lacerte in securing this requirement, based on the final site selection.
    Lacerte will evaluate the cost impact for acceptance at that time.

3)  Offsite turn lanes, median cuts, or utilities extensions are included for
    the site located at the Northeast corner of Parkwood and Headquarters in
    Legacy Business Park, Plano, Texas.

4)  Main Lobby finishes are included in the shell building, based on one Main
    Lobby area of approximately 2,000 - 2,500 s.f. and assuming that Main Lobby
    floor coverings are approximately 50% hard surface and 50% carpet. All
    carpeting, including Main Lobby, shall be included as part of the T.I.
    allowance.

5)  Full wet pipe fire protection system is included in the shell building,
    including the installation of heads on a floor with no partitions in place
    other than core partitions. Installation of heads will be coordinated with
    final TI plans to minimize cost. However, increased headcount due to TI
    plans, or relocations due to changes during TI buildout, will be a cost of
    the TI allowance.

6)  Tenant Power and Lighting Distribution: Koll has included dual 84 pole
    electrical panels (one clean and one dirty) at each electrical room for
    power distribution. It is anticipated that the building layout will include
    one electrical room for each floor of each "Pod" serving approx. 25,000 to
    30,000 sf. Therefore, a total of twelve (12) panels for tenant power
    distribution, located in the electrical room serving each floor, have been
    included. Additional panels, if required, to distribute the service of 6
    watts per s.f. reserved for tenant power, will be included as a part of the
    TI allowance. Koll has included one (1) 84 pole electrical panel, located in
    each electrical room, for distribution of Tenant's 277 v. lighting.
    Additional lighting panels, if required, for distribution of the 1.5 watts
    per s.f. reserved for tenant lighting, will be included as a part of the TI
    allowance.

7)  One 250 kw emergency generator has been included and it is assumed that life
    safety requirements may be served off of this system. All distribution
    required for life safety is included in the shell building. All distribution
    of emergency power for Tenant use is included in the TI allowance.

             CLARIFICATIONS TO BASE BUILDING OUTLINE SPECIFICATIONS


8)  Total gross / rentable area shall be approximately 165,000 s.f. and may be
    comprised of two or three story buildings connected by a common atrium or
    lobby.

9)  Parking shall be provided as noted in the Preliminary Recitals of the Lease
    Agreement, in lieu of one per 200 s.f. Approximately 400 spaces, of the
    total required by the lease, shall be covered in a precast or cast-in-place
    parking structure of finish complimentary to the building design. The
    balance shall be a combination of parking on the top deck of the parking
    structure or surface parked adjacent to the building(s).

actions or lien enforcement proceedings against, Obligor, its property, or its
estate in bankruptcy resulting from the operation of any present or future
provision of the Federal Bankruptcy Code (hereinafter called the "Bankruptcy
Code") or other similar federal or state statute, or from the decision of any
court.

         Creditor shall not be required to pursue any other remedies before
invoking the benefits of the guaranties contained herein. Creditor may maintain
an action on this Guaranty without joining Obligor therein and without bringing
a separate action against Obligor.

         If for any reason whatsoever (including but not limited to ultra vires,
lack of authority, illegality, force majeure, act of God or impossibility) the
Obligations cannot be enforced against Obligor, such unenforceability shall in
no manner affect the liability of Guarantor hereunder and Guarantor shall be
liable hereunder notwithstanding that Obligor may not be liable for such
Obligations and to the same extent as Guarantor would have been liable if such
Obligations had been enforceable against Obligor.

         Guarantor absolutely and unconditionally covenants and agrees that in
the event that Obligor does not or is unable so to perform the Obligations for
any reason, including, without limitation, liquidation, dissolution,
receivership, conservatorship, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the
benefit of creditors, sale of all or substantially all assets, reorganization,
arrangement, composition, or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings
affecting the status, composition, identity, existence, assets or obligations of
Obligor, or the disaffirmance or termination of any of the Obligations in or as
a result of any such proceeding, Guarantor shall perform the Obligations and no
such occurrence shall in any way affect Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

         Notwithstanding anything to the apparent contrary contained herein,
Guarantor does not herein expressly or impliedly waive or release any rights of
subrogation that Guarantor may have against Obligor (except as same are
expressly subordinated as provided herein), rights of contribution that
Guarantor may have against any other guarantor of, or other person secondarily
liable for, the performance of the Obligations or rights of reimbursement that
Guarantor may have as against Obligor (except as same may be limited herein).

         The rights of Creditor are cumulative and shall not be exhausted by its
exercise of any of its rights hereunder or otherwise against Guarantor or by any
number of successive actions until and unless all Obligations have been
performed and each of the obligations of Guarantor hereunder has been performed.
The existence of this Guaranty shall not in any way diminish or discharge the
rights of Creditor under any prior or future guaranty agreement executed by
Guarantor.

         Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be
given in writing, sent by (a) personal delivery, (b) expedited delivery service
with proof of delivery, or (c) United States mail, postage prepaid, registered
or certified mail, sent to the intended addressee at the address shown below, or
to such other address or to the attention of such other person as hereafter
shall be designated in writing by the applicable party sent in accordance
herewith. Any such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been given
and received either at the time of personal delivery or, in the case of delivery
service or mail, as of the date of first attempted delivery at the address and
in the manner provided herein.

         THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF GUARANTOR HEREUNDER
SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO TEXAS' PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAW) AND THE LAW OF THE UNITED STATES APPLICABLE TO TRANSACTIONS
IN SUCH STATE. GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF ANY TEXAS OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN DALLAS, TEXAS OVER ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY, AND
GUARANTOR HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT IN ADDITION TO ANY

METHODS OF SERVICE OF PROCESS PROVIDED FOR UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SERVICE OF
PROCESS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY TEXAS OR FEDERAL COURT
SITTING IN DALLAS. TEXAS MAY BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN
RECEIPT REQUESTED, DIRECTED TO GUARANTOR AT THE ADDRESS OF GUARANTOR FOR THE
GIVING OF NOTICES HEREUNDER.

         Guarantor hereby expressly and unconditionally waives, in connection
with any suit, action or proceeding brought by Creditor in connection with this
Guaranty, any and every right it may have to (i) injunctive relief, (ii) a trial
by jury, (iii) interpose any counterclaim therein (other than a compulsory
counterclaim) and (iv) have the same consolidated with any other or separate
suit, action or proceeding. Nothing herein contained shall prevent or prohibit
Guarantor from instituting or maintaining a separate action against Creditor
with respect to any asserted claim.

         This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts with the
same effect as if all parties hereto had signed the same document. All such
counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument,
but in making proof hereof it shall only be necessary to produce one such
counterpart.

         This Guaranty may only be modified, waived, altered or amended by a
written instrument or instruments executed by the party against which
enforcement of said action is asserted. Any alleged modification, waiver,
alteration or amendment which is not so documented shall not be effective as to
any party. This Guaranty shall lapse and become void and unenforceable upon
Obligor's satisfaction of its obligations under Section 2.05 of the Lease
Agreement.

         The terms, provisions, covenants and conditions hereof shall be binding
upon Guarantor and the successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall inure to
the benefit of Creditor and all transferees, successors and/or assignees of
Creditor. Within this Guaranty, words of any gender shall be held and construed
to include any other gender and words in the singular number shall be held and
construed to include the plural, unless the context otherwise requires. A
determination that any provision of this Guaranty is unenforceable or invalid
shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision and any
determination that the application of any provision of this Guaranty to any
person or circumstance is illegal or unenforceable shall not affect the
enforceability or validity of such provision as it may apply to any other
persons or circumstances.

                                  EXHIBIT "D-1"

                                 Intuit Guaranty

         THIS LEASE GUARANTY ("GUARANTY") is made as of the 22 day of February,
2000, by INTUIT INC., a corporation formed under the laws of Delaware
("GUARANTOR") in favor of KCDTX I INVESTMENT LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Texas
limited partnership ("LANDLORD").

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Guarantor hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and
absolutely guarantees to Landlord without demand or notice (except for the
notice of default which is delivered to Guarantor under the Lease) the prompt
and full payment and performance, when due, of all obligations and covenants of
LACERTE SOFTWARE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("TENANT"), fixed or
contingent, under the terms of the Office Lease Agreement dated effective
February 22, 2000, executed by and between Tenant and Landlord and any and all,
subject to Paragraph 4 below, renewals, extensions, amendments, expansions and
modifications thereof (collectively, the "LEASE"), or which Tenant, or its
successors or assigns, may in any other manner now or at any time hereafter owe
Landlord under the terms of the Lease, including, but not limited to, rent,
taxes, insurance, operating expenses, maintenance costs, damages and expenses
resulting from Tenant's default under the Lease, (collectively, the
"OBLIGATIONS").

1.       CONTINUING GUARANTY. This is a continuing Guaranty and shall apply to
         any renewals, extensions, and modifications of the Lease.

2.       OTHER REMEDIES. Landlord shall not be required to pursue any other
         remedies before invoking the benefits of this Guaranty; specifically,
         Landlord shall not be required to take any action against Tenant or any
         other person, to exhaust its remedies against any other guarantor of
         the Obligations, any collateral or other security, or to resort to any
         balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of Landlord in
         favor of Tenant or any other person.

3.       OBLIGATIONS NOT IMPAIRED. Prior to performance and satisfaction in
         full of the Obligations, the liability of Guarantor under this
         Guaranty shall not be released or impaired without the prior written
         consent of Landlord. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
         the liability of Guarantor shall not be released or impaired on account
         of any of the following events:

         (a)      the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, sale or other
                  disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
                  Tenant, or any receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy,
                  reorganization or other similar proceedings affecting Tenant
                  or any of its assets;

         (b)      the addition of a new guarantor or guarantors;

         (c)      any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against or by Tenant,
                  its property, or its estate or any modification, discharge or
                  extension of the Obligations resulting from the operation of
                  any present or future provision of the United States
                  Bankruptcy Code or any other similar federal or state statute,
                  or from the decision of ay court, it being


<PAGE>   93
                  the intention hereof that Guarantor shall remain liable on the
                  Obligations notwithstanding any act, omission, order, judgment
                  or event which might, but for the provisions hereof, otherwise
                  operate as a legal or equitable discharge of Guarantor;

         (d)      Landlord's failure to use diligence in preserving the
                  liability of any person on the Obligations, or in bringing
                  suit to enforce collection of the Obligations;

         (e)      the substitution or withdrawal of collateral, or release of
                  collateral, or the exercise or failure to exercise by Landlord
                  of any right conferred upon it herein or in any collateral
                  agreement;

         (f)      if Tenant is not liable for any of the Obligations because the
                  act of creating the Obligations is ultra vires, or the
                  officers or person creating the Obligations acted in excess of
                  their authority, or for any reason the Obligations cannot be
                  enforced against Tenant;

         (g)      any payment by Tenant to Landlord if such payment is held to
                  constitute a preference under the bankruptcy laws, or if for
                  any other reason Landlord is required to refund such payment
                  to Tenant or pay the amount thereof to any other party; or

         (h)      any assignment of the Lease or subletting of all or any
                  portion of the Project (as defined in the Lease).

4.       AMENDMENTS AND PROJECT EXPANSIONS. Notwithstanding anything in this
         Guaranty to the contrary, Guarantor shall have no liability for any
         obligations of Tenant incurred as a result of any amendment, extension,
         renewal or modification of the Lease (collectively, an "Amendment"), or
         any Project Expansion (as such term is defined in the Lease), unless
         Guarantor shall have expressly agreed to the same in writing; provided,
         however, that any such Amendment or Project Expansion may be effected
         as between Landlord and Tenant as provided in the Lease without
         Guarantor's consent, but shall not be binding on Guarantor in any way.
         In the event of such an Amendment or Project Expansion effected by
         Landlord and Tenant without Guarantor's consent, Guarantor shall remain
         liable only for those obligations under the Lease which existed prior
         to such Amendment or Project Expansion.

5.       BENEFIT TO GUARANTOR. Guarantor represents and warrants that it derives
         or expects to derive substantial financial and other advantage and
         benefit, directly or indirectly, from the Lease and the Obligations.
         Guarantor acknowledges that, in entering into the Lease, Landlord is
         relying on Guarantor's agreements contained in this Guaranty and on
         Guarantor's creditworthiness. Guarantor acknowledges that Landlord
         would not have entered into the Lease without Guarantor's guarantee of
         the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof.

6.       DISSOLUTION OF GUARANTOR. Upon the dissolution or bankruptcy of
         Guarantor, the liability of Guarantor shall continue against its assets
         as to all Obligations which shall have been incurred by Tenant.


<PAGE>   94


7.       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Guarantor warrants and represents to Landlord
         that all financial statements heretofore delivered by Guarantor to
         Landlord are true and correct in all material respects, if any.

8.       WAIVER OF NOTICE. Guarantor waives diligence on the part of Landlord in
         the collection and enforcement of the Obligations, notice, demand,
         protest, and waives the right to notice of all extensions, amendments,
         modifications and/or expansions that may be granted to Tenant with
         respect thereto.

9.       MODIFICATION OR CONSENT. No modification, consent or waiver of any
         provision of this Guaranty, nor consent to any departure by Guarantor
         therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and
         signed by Landlord, and then shall be effective only in the specific
         instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on
         Guarantor in any case shall, of itself, entitle Guarantor to any other
         or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No delay
         or omission by Landlord in exercising any power or right hereunder
         shall impair any such right or power or be construed as a waiver
         thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial
         exercise of any such power preclude other or further exercise thereof
         or the exercise of any other right or power hereunder. All rights and
         remedies of Landlord hereunder are cumulative of each other and of
         every other right or remedy which Landlord may otherwise have at law or
         in equity or under any other contract or document, and the exercise of
         one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the
         concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies.

10.      INDUCEMENT TO LANDLORD. Guarantor acknowledges that this Guaranty is
         given to induce Landlord to enter into the Lease and to extend credit
         to Tenant which would not be extended except in reliance upon this
         Guaranty.

11.      ATTORNEY'S FEES. If a lawsuit is instituted in connection with this
         Guaranty, then the non-prevailing party in such lawsuit agrees to pay
         to the prevailing party all expenses incurred by the prevailing patty
         in connection with such lawsuit (including, but not limited to,
         reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of court).

12.      SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Guaranty is for the benefit of Landlord,
         and its successors and/or assigns. Landlord may assign its rights
         hereunder in connection with assignment of the Lease or collaterally or
         absolutely to the Lender (as defined in the Lease); and, upon any such
         assignment, all the terms and provisions of this Guaranty shall inure
         to the benefit of such assignee, to the extent so assigned. The
         liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be binding upon all
         administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns of
         Guarantor.

13.      HEADINGS. The section headings hereof are inserted for convenience of
         reference only and shall not alter, define or be used in construing the
         text of this instrument.

14.      DEFENSES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Guarantor
         shall have available to it all of Tenant's defenses to enforcement of
         the Lease resulting from the acts or omissions


<PAGE>   95

         of Landlord under the Lease, but Guarantor shall not be entitled to
         raise any of Tenant's personal defenses to enforcement of Lease
         obligations, including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, insolvency,
         waiver, laches, ultra vires or lack of authority.

15.      CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Guarantor hereby consents to the jurisdiction
         of any state or federal court located within the County of Dallas,
         State of Texas and irrevocably agrees that, subject to Landlord's
         election, all actions or proceedings arising out or relating to this
         Guaranty or the Lease shall be litigated in such courts. Guarantor
         accepts for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and
         unconditionally, exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
         waives any defense of forum non conveniens.

16.      TERM. This Guaranty shall terminate only when all of the Obligations
         have been fully performed and satisfied.

17.      GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE. This is an unconditional,
         irrevocable and absolute guaranty of payment and performance and not a
         guaranty of collection.

18.      PAST DUE AMOUNTS. All past due payments of the Obligations shall bear
         interest at the Specified Rate (as defined in the Lease).

19.      REPRESENTATIONS. Guarantor represents and warrants to Landlord that (i)
         Guarantor has executed this Guaranty of its free will and accord, (ii)
         Guarantor has read and understands the term of this Guaranty and the
         Lease, (iii) Guarantor has had the opportunity to have this Guaranty
         and the Lease reviewed by an attorney of Guarantor's choice, and (iv)
         the execution of this Guaranty will benefit, directly or indirectly,
         the Guarantor.

20.      AUTHORITY. This Guaranty has been duly authorized by all appropriate
         corporate action, and the undersigned is an authorized signatory of
         Guarantor, fully empowered to execute this Guaranty.

21.      GOVERNING LAW. This Guaranty shall be governed under the laws of the
         State of Texas, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

22.      EFFECTIVENESS. This instrument shall be effective and binding upon
         Guarantor upon Guarantor's execution hereof and delivery hereof to
         Landlord (which delivery may only be by original execution copy), and
         shall remain in full force and effect, and shall survive the exercise
         by Landlord of any remedy under the Lease.

23.      SUBSTITUTION. In the event that Tenant is not a Related Party to
         Intuit, Intuit may substitute a guarantor in its place hereunder
         ("Substitute Guarantor"), provided: (i) such Substitute Guarantor
         assumes Intuit's obligations hereunder in a form reasonably
         satisfactory to Landlord and Lender; (ii) Landlord's rights to enforce
         the Guaranty will not be impaired thereby; (iii) such Substitute
         Guarantor represents and warrants to Landlord that the Substitute
         Guarantor derives or expects to derive substantial financial and other
         advantage and benefit, directly or indirectly, from the Lease and the
         Obligations, and (iv) such Substitute



<PAGE>   96

         Guarantor has (1) an Investment Grade Credit Rating, or (2) at the time
         the request is made by Intuit to substitute a guarantor, the proposed
         Substitute Guarantor has a minimum tangible net worth calculated in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of not less
         than Five Hundred Million and No/100 Dollars U.S. ($500,000,000.00
         U.S.) and further provided that for each of the proposed Substitute
         Guarantor's most recent three fiscal year end reporting periods, the
         proposed Substitute Guarantor has both positive earnings and a minimum
         tangible net worth of not less than Five Hundred Million and No/100
         Dollars U.S. ($500,000,000.00 U.S.) as calculated in accordance with
         generally accepted accounting principles. Upon such approval by
         Landlord and Lender, Intuit shall thereafter be relieved of any and all
         liability under the Lease or this Guaranty from and after the date of
         such substitution. As used in the Lease and this Guaranty, unless
         expressly set forth to the contrary, the use of the tern "Guarantor"
         shall be applicable to, and mean the same as, the term "Substitute
         Guarantor."

24.      NOTICES. Any notice sent by Landlord to Guarantor shall be delivered as
         specified in the Lease to the address given below.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Guarantor has executed this Guaranty as of the day

                              ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS AGREEMENT made effective as of the day of______________, 2000,
between _______________, a __________ (hereinafter called "Lender") and LACERTE
SOFTWARE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called "Tenant"),

                                WITNESSETH THAT:

         WHEREAS, Lender will be the owner and holder of a Deed of Trust,
Mortgage and Security Agreement (hereinafter called the "Security Instrument"),
to be recorded in Collin County, Texas, covering the real property described in
Exhibit A and the building and improvements thereon (hereinafter collectively
called the "Mortgaged Premises") securing the payment of a promissory note in
the stated principal amount of $______ payable to the order of Lender;

         WHEREAS, Tenant is the tenant under Lease Agreement (hereinafter called
the "Lease") dated February 22, 2000 made by KCD-TX I INVESTMENT LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP, a Texas limited partnership, as landlord (said landlord and its
successors and assigns occupying the position of landlord under the Lease
hereinafter called "Landlord"), covering certain property (hereinafter called
the "Demised Premises") consisting of all of the Mortgaged Premises; and

         WHEREAS, Tenant and Lender desire to confirm their understanding with
respect to the Lease and the Security Instrument;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
herein contained, Lender and Tenant hereby agree and covenant as follows:

         1. Subordination. The Lease now is, and shall at all times and for all
purposes continue to be, subject and subordinate, in each and every respect, to
the Security Instrument, with the provisions of the Security Instrument
controlling in all respects over the provisions of the Lease, it being
understood and agreed that the foregoing subordination shall apply to any and
all increases, renewals, modifications, extensions, substitutions, replacements
and/or consolidations of the Security Instrument, provided that any and all such
increases, renewals, modifications, extensions, substitutions, replacements
and/or consolidations shall nevertheless be subject to the terms of this
Agreement.

         2. Non-Disturbance. So long as (i) Tenant is not in default (beyond any
period given Tenant to cure such default) in the payment of rent or additional
rent or in the performance of any of the other terms, covenants or conditions of
the Lease on Tenant's part to be performed, (ii) the Lease is in full force
and effect according to its original terms, or with such amendments or


                                       1
<PAGE>   99


modifications as Lender shall have approved, and (iii) Tenant attorns to Lender
or a purchaser of the Mortgaged Premises as provided in Paragraph 3, then (a)
Tenant's possession, occupancy, use and quiet enjoyment of the Demised Premises
under the Lease, or any extensions or renewals thereof or acquisition of
additional space or all or any portion of the fee interest in the Mortgaged
Premises which may be effected in accordance with any option therefor in the
Lease, shall not be terminated, disturbed, diminished or interfered with by
Lender in the exercise of any of its rights under the Security Instrument, and
(b) Lender will not join Tenant as a party defendant in any action or
proceeding for the purpose of terminating Tenant's interest and estate under the
Lease because of any default under the Security Instrument.

         3. Attornment. If Lender shall become the owner of the Mortgaged
Premises or the Mortgaged Premises shall be sold by reason of non-judicial or
judicial foreclosure or other proceedings brought to enforce the Security
Instrument or the Mortgaged Premises shall be conveyed by deed in lieu of
foreclosure, the Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct Lease
between Lender, or other purchaser of the Mortgaged Premises who shall succeed
to the rights and duties and obligations of Landlord, and Tenant, and Tenant
shall attorn to Lender or such purchaser, as the case may be, upon any such
occurrence and shall recognize Lender or such purchaser, as the case may be, as
the Landlord under the Lease. Such attornment shall be effective and
self-operative without the execution of any further instrument on the part of
any of the parties hereto. Tenant agrees, however, to execute and deliver at any
time and from time to time, upon the request of Landlord or of any holders) of
any of the indebtedness or other obligations secured by the Security Instrument
or any such purchaser, any instrument or certificate which, in the sole
reasonable judgment of the requesting party, is necessary or appropriate, in
connection with any such foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure or
otherwise, to evidence such attornment.

         4. Obligations and Remedies. If Lender shall become the owner of the
Mortgaged Premises or the Mortgaged Premises shall be sold by reason of non-
judicial or judicial foreclosure or other proceedings brought to enforce the
Security Instrument or the Mortgaged Premises shall be conveyed by deed in lieu
of foreclosure, Lender or other purchaser of the Mortgaged Premises, as the case
may be, shall have the same remedies by entry, action or otherwise in the event
of any default by Tenant (beyond any period given Tenant to cure such default)
in the payment of rent or additional rent or in the performance of any of the
other terms, covenants and conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be
performed that Landlord had or would have had if Lender or such purchaser had
not succeeded to the interest of Landlord. Upon attornment by Tenant as provided
herein, Lender or such purchaser shall be bound to Tenant under all the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Lease and Tenant shall have the same remedies
against Lender or such purchaser for the breach of an agreement contained in the
Lease that Tenant might have had under the Lease against Landlord if Lender or
such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest of Landlord; provided, however,
that Lender or such purchaser shall not be liable or bound to Tenant:


                                       2
<PAGE>   100


         (a) for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including Landlord)
which constitutes a default or breach of this Agreement; provided, however,
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of Tenant's rights or
remedies against Lender or such purchaser in the event such default is not cured
by Lender or such purchaser after Lender or such purchaser acquires the
Mortgaged Premises; or

         (b) for any offsets or defenses except those based upon or related to
defects or deficiencies in the construction of the Project, which the Tenant
might be entitled to assert against Landlord arising prior to the date Lender
takes possession of Landlord's interest in the Lease or becomes a mortgagee in
possession, subject to Tenant's continued rights of offset and termination for
any default by Landlord which remains uncured; provided that notice of such
default is provided to Lender within a reasonable time after Lender acquires the
Mortgaged Premises;

         (c) for or by any rent or additional rent which Tenant might have paid
for more than thirty (30) days in advance to any prior landlord (including
Landlord) unless such rent is actually received by Lender; or

         (d) by any amendment or modification of the Lease made without Lender's
consent, except for any amendment or modification of a de minimis or
non-material nature; or

         (e) for any security deposit, rental deposit or similar deposit given
by Tenant to a prior landlord (including Landlord) unless such deposit is
actually paid over to Lender or such purchaser by the prior landlord; or

         (f) for any repairs or replacements to or required by the Demised
Premises or the Mortgaged Premises arising prior to the date Lender or such
purchaser takes possession of the Mortgaged Premises provided, however, nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of Tenant's rights or remedies
against Lender or such purchaser in the event such default is not cured by
Lender or such purchaser after Lender or such purchaser acquires the Mortgaged
Premises; or

         (g) for the payment of any leasing commissions or other expenses for
which any prior landlord (including Landlord) incurred the obligation to pay; or

         (h) by any notice given by Tenant to a prior landlord (including
Landlord) unless a copy thereof was also then given to Lender; or

         (i) beyond Lender's or such purchaser's interest in the Mortgaged
Premises, notwithstanding any provision contained in the lease to the contrary,
it being agreed that Lender or such purchaser shall not be liable or responsible
whatsoever under the terns of the Lease after it ceases to own an interest in
the Mortgaged Premises.

         5. No Abridgment. Nothing herein contained is intended, nor shall it be
construed, to abridge or adversely affect any right or remedy of Landlord under
the Lease in the event of any default by Tenant (beyond any period given Tenant
to cure such default) in the payment of rent or additional rent or in the
performance of any of the other terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease on
Tenant's part to be performed.

         6. Notices of Default to Lender. Tenant agrees to give Lender a copy of
any default notice sent by Tenant to Landlord.

         7. Representations by Tenant. Tenant represents and warrants to Lender
that Tenant has validly executed the Lease; the Lease is valid, binding and
enforceable and is in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; the
Lease has not been amended except as stated herein; no rent under the Lease has
been or will be paid more than thirty (30) days in advance of its due date;
there are no defaults existing under the Lease; and, as of this date, no charge,
lien, counterclaim or claim of offset under the Lease, or otherwise, has accrued
against the rents or other charges due or to become due under the Lease.

         8. Rent Payment. If Lender shall become the owner of the Mortgaged
Premises or the Mortgaged Premises shall be sold by reason of non-judicial or
judicial foreclosure or other proceedings brought to enforce the Security
Instrument or the Mortgaged Premises shall be conveyed by deed in lieu of
foreclosure, Tenant agrees to pay all rents directly to Lender or other
purchaser of the Mortgaged Premises, as the case may be, in accordance with the
Lease immediately upon notice of Lender or such purchaser, as the case may be,
succeeding to Landlord's interest under the Lease. Tenant further agrees to pay
all rents directly to Lender immediately upon notice that Lender is exercising
its rights to such rents under the Security Instrument or any other loan
documents (including but not limited to any Assignment of Leases and Rents)
following a default by Landlord or other applicable party. Tenant shall be under
no obligation to ascertain whether a default by Landlord has occurred under the
Security Instrument or any other loan documents. Landlord waives any right,
claim or demand it may now or hereafter have against Tenant by reason of such
direct payment to Lender and agrees that such direct payment to Lender shall
discharge all obligations of Tenant to make such payment to Landlord.

         9. Notice of Security Instrument. To the extent that the Lease shall
entitle Tenant to notice of any deed of trust or security agreement, this
Agreement shall constitute such notice to the Tenant with respect to the
Security Instrument and to any and all other deeds of trust and security
agreements which may hereafter be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

         10. Landlord Defaults. Tenant agrees with Lender that effective as of
the date of this Agreement: (i) except as permitted by the terms of the Lease
for failure to construct the Project in a timely manner, Tenant shall not take
any steps to terminate the Lease for any default by Landlord or any succeeding
owner of the Mortgaged Premises until after giving Lender written notice of such
default, stating the nature of the default and giving Lender thirty (30) days
from receipt of such notice to effect cure of the same, or if cure cannot be
effected within said thirty (30) days due to the


                                       4
<PAGE>   102


nature of the default, Lender shall have a reasonable time to cure provided that
it commences cure within said thirty (30) day period of time and diligently
carries such cure to completion; and (ii) notice to Landlord under the Lease
(oral or written) shall not constitute notice to Lender.

         11. Notice. Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder
shall be given in writing, sent by (a) personal delivery, or (b) expedited
delivery service with proof of delivery, or (c) United States mail, postage
prepaid, registered or certified mail, or (d) telegram addressed as follows:

provided herein. in the event the Tenant executes any expansion and/or renewal
that is not substantially provided for within the initial lease document, a
commission fee shall be due to Broker unless another Broker is appointed to

                          CONSENT TO SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

        This Consent to Sublease Agreement (this "AGREEMENT") is made as of
March 31, 2000 by and among Spieker Properties, L.P., a California limited
partnership ("MASTER LANDLORD"), Franklin Templeton Corporate Services, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("SUBLANDLORD"), and Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation
("SUBTENANT").

                                    RECITALS

        This Agreement is made with regard to the following facts;

        A. Master Landlord is the owner of approximately 29 acres and up to
approximately 591,000 square feet (existing, under construction or planned) in 9
buildings known as Bridge Pointe Corporate Centre within the Eastgate Technology
Park in San Diego, California (the "PROJECT"). Phase A of the Project consists
of 4 existing buildings known as "Building 1" (also referred to as the "PHASE
A-1 PREMISES") located at 4770 Eastgate Mall, "Building 2" (also referred to as
the "ADC TELECOMMUNICATIONS PREMISES") located at 4790 Eastgate Mall, "Building
3" (also referred to as the "PHASE A-2 PREMISES") located at 4760 Eastgate Mall
and "Building 4" (also referred to as the "PHASE A-3 PREMISES") located at 4780
Eastgate Mall. Phase B of the Project consists of 2 buildings under construction
known as "Building 5" (also referred to as the "PHASE B-2 PREMISES") located at
4810 Eastgate Mall and "Building 6" (also referred to as the "PHASE B-1
PREMISES") located at 4820 Eastgate Mall. Phase C of the Project consists of 3
planned buildings known as "Buildings 7 through 9".

        B. Master Landlord and Sublandlord entered into a lease dated September
2, 1998, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Lease dated March 15,
1999 and assigned by that certain Assignment, Assumption and Consent agreement
dated January 1, 2000 (collectively, the "PHASE A LEASE") whereby Master
Landlord leased to Sublandlord the Phase A-2 Premises and the Phase A-3
Premises, upon the terms and conditions contained therein.

        C. Under the terms of Paragraph 21 of the Phase A Lease, Sublandlord has
requested Master Landlord's consent to the Sublease Agreement dated .March 31,
2000 between Sublandlord and Subtenant (the "SUBLEASE"), pursuant to which
Sublandlord will sublease to Subtenant the Phase A-2 Premises, as more
particularly described in the Sublease (the "SUBLEASED PREMISES"). A copy of the
Sublease is attached to this Agreement as EXHIBIT A.

        D. Master Landlord is willing to consent to the Sublease on the terms
and conditions contained in this Agreement.

        NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in
this Agreement, and for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are acknowledged by the parties, the parties agree as follows.

             1. MASTER LANDLORD'S CONSENT. Master Landlord consents to the
Sublease. This consent is granted only on the terms and conditions stated in
this Agreement. Master


<PAGE>   2

Landlord is not bound by any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of the
Sublease, except as set forth in Section 2.2 below. The Sublease is subject and
subordinate to the Master Lease.

             2. LIMITS OF CONSENT.

                    2.1 NONRELEASE OF SUBLANDLORD; FURTHER TRANSFERS. Neither
the Sublease nor this Agreement will:

                         (a) release Sublandlord from any liability, whether
past, present or future, under the Master Lease;

                         (b) alter the primary liability of Sublandlord to pay
the Rent and perform all of Tenant's obligations under the Master Lease
(including the payment of all bills rendered by Master Landlord for charges
incurred by Subtenant for services and materials supplied to the Subleased
Premises); or

                         (c) be construed as a waiver of Master Landlord's right
to consent to any proposed transfer after the date hereof by Sublandlord under
the Master Lease or Subtenant under the Sublease, or as a consent to any portion
of the Subleased Premises being used or occupied by any other party.

                    2.2 MASTER LANDLORD ACKNOWLEDGMENT. Master Landlord
specifically acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the following Paragraphs of
the Sublease: 4, "Signage"; 20, "Permitted Use;" and 21, "Mutual Waiver of
Subrogation"; and all of the modifications to the Master Lease set forth in
Paragraph 8(a) of the Sublease.

                    Master Landlord may consent to the subsequent sublease and
assignment of the Sublease or any amendments or modifications to the Sublease
without notifying Sublandlord or anyone else liable under the Master Lease,
including any guarantor of the Master Lease, and without obtaining their
consent. No such action by Master Landlord will relieve those persons from any
liability to Master Landlord or otherwise with regard to the Subleased Premises.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall diminish any
obligation of Subtenant to obtain Sublandlord's approval prior to taking any
such actions.

             3. RELATIONSHIP WITH MASTER LANDLORD

                    3.1 EFFECT OF SUBLANDLORD DEFAULT UNDER MASTER LEASE. If
after the expiration of any applicable cure period Sublandlord defaults in the
performance of its obligations under the Master Lease and the Master Lease
terminates, Master Landlord shall notify Subtenant and, without limiting its
other rights and remedies, by notice to Sublandlord and Subtenant, elect to
receive and collect, directly from Subtenant, all rent and any other sums owing
and to be owed under the Sublease, as further set forth in Section 3.2 below.

                    3.2 MASTER LANDLORD'S ELECTION TO RECEIVE RENTS. Master
Landlord will not, as a result of the Sublease, or as a result of the collection
of rents or any other sums



                                       2
<PAGE>   3

from Subtenant under Section 3.1 above, be liable to Subtenant for any failure
of Sublandlord to perform any obligation of Sublandlord under the Sublease.

                    Sublandlord irrevocably authorizes and directs Subtenant, on
receipt of any written notice from Master Landlord stating that a default exists
in the performance of Sublandlord's obligations under the Master Lease, to pay
to Master Landlord the rents and any other sums due and to become due under the
Sublease. Sublandlord agrees that Subtenant has the right to rely on any such
statement from Master Landlord, and that Subtenant will pay those rents and
other sums to Master Landlord without any obligation or right to inquire as to
whether a default exists and despite any notice or claim from Sublandlord to the
contrary. Sublandlord will not have any right or claim against Subtenant for
those rents or other sums paid by Subtenant to Master Landlord. Master Landlord
will credit Sublandlord with any rent received by Master Landlord under this
assignment, but the acceptance of any payment on account of rent from Subtenant
as the result of a default by Sublandlord will not: (a) except as set forth in
Section 3.3 below, be an attornment by Master Landlord to Subtenant or by
Subtenant to Master Landlord; (b) be a waiver by Master Landlord of any
provision of the Master Lease; or (c) release Sublandlord from any liability
under the terms, agreements, or conditions of the Master Lease. Except as set
forth in Section 3.3 below, no payment of rent by Subtenant directly to Master
Landlord, regardless of the circumstances or reasons for that payment, will be
deemed an attornment by Subtenant to Master Landlord in the absence of a
specific written agreement signed by Master Landlord to that effect.

                    3.3 TENANT'S ATTORNMENT. In the event the Master Lease is
terminated prior to the expiration of the term of the Sublease for any reason,
Master Landlord shall automatically be deemed to have succeeded to Sublandlord's
interest in the Sublease, whereupon Subtenant shall attorn to Master Landlord.
Furthermore, Master Landlord shall recognize Subtenant's right to possession of
the Premises as provided for in the Sublease and shall not disturb Subtenant's
right to possession of the Premises so long as an event of default does not
exist in the performance of Subtenant's obligations under the Sublease beyond
any applicable notice and cure period. Master Landlord will assume the
obligation of Sublandlord under the Sublease as described above provided that
Master Landlord will not be:

                         (a) liable for any rent paid by Subtenant to
Sublandlord more than one month in advance, or any security deposit paid by
Subtenant to Sublandlord;

                         (b) liable for any act or omission of Sublandlord under
the Master Lease or for any default of Sublandlord under the Sublease which
occurred prior to Master Landlord's assumption;

                         (c) subject to any defenses or offsets that Subtenant
may have against Sublandlord which arose prior to Master Landlord's assumption;
or

                         (d) bound by any changes or modifications made to the
Sublease without the written consent of Master Landlord.



                                       3
<PAGE>   4

             Master Landlord shall promptly notify Subtenant of the termination
of the Master Lease and of Master Landlord's recognition of Subtenant's right to
continued possession of the Subleased Premises. Upon receipt of the notice from
Master Landlord, Subtenant shall attorn to Master Landlord and perform all of
the Subtenant's obligations under the Sublease directly to Master Landlord, just
as if Master Landlord were the "Sublessor" under the Sublease. If and so long as
Subtenant is not in substantial and material default (beyond any notice and
cure periods) under the Sublease, Master Landlord shall continue to recognize
the interest of Subtenant created under the Sublease and the Sublease shall
continue with the same force and effect as if Master Landlord and Subtenant had
entered into a Sublease on the same terms and conditions as those contained in
the Sublease.

             Sublandlord and Subtenant shall not enter into any agreement which
amends the Sublease without Master Landlord's prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any amendment of the Sublease in
violation of this provision shall have no force or effect on Master Landlord.

             4. CONSIDERATION FOR SUBLEASE. Sublandlord and Subtenant represent
and warrant that there are no additional payments of rent or any other
consideration of any type which has been paid or is payable by Subtenant to
Sublandlord in connection with the Sublease, other than as disclosed in the
Sublease.

             5. GENERAL PROVISIONS

                    5.1 BROKERAGE COMMISSION. Sublandlord and Subtenant agree
that Master Landlord will not be liable for any brokerage commission or finder's
fee in connection with the consummation of the Sublease or this Agreement.
Sublandlord and Subtenant will protect, defend, indemnify, and hold Master
Landlord harmless from any brokerage commission or finder's fee in connection
with the consummation of the Sublease or this Agreement, and from any cost or
expense (including attorney's fees) incurred by Master Landlord in resisting any
claim for any such brokerage commission or finder's fee. The provisions of this
Section 5.1 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Sublease
and this Agreement.

                    5.2 NOTICE. Any notice that may or must be given by any
party under this Agreement will be delivered (i) personally, (ii) by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or (iii) by a nationally recognized overnight
courier, addressed to the party to whom it is intended. Any notice given to the
Master Landlord, Sublandlord or Subtenant shall be sent to the respective
address set forth on the signature page below, or to such other address as that
party may designate for service of notice by a notice given in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 5.2. Master Landlord and Sublandlord agree to
send to Subtenant copies of all notices of default and other formal notices that
may require action by Sublandlord or Subtenant under the Master Lease.

                    5.3 CONTROLLING LAW. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement will be construed in accordance with, and will be governed by, the
laws of the State of California.

                    5.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; WAIVER. This Agreement constitutes the
final, complete and exclusive statement between the parties to this Agreement
pertaining to the terms of Master Landlord's consent to the Sublease, supersedes
all prior and contemporaneous understandings or agreements of the parties, and
is binding on and inures to the benefit of their respective heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns.

                    5.5 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; ATTORNEY'S FEES. If any party

                               SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

        This SUBLEASE AGREEMENT ("SUBLEASE") is made and entered into as of the
31st day of March, 2000 by and between FRANKLIN TEMPLETON CORPORATE SERVICES,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("SUBLANDLORD"), and INTUIT INC., a Delaware
corporation ("SUBTENANT"), with respect to the following facts and
circumstances:

                                    RECITALS

        A. Spieker Properties, L.P., a California limited partnership
("LANDLORD") is the owner of approximately 29 acres and up to approximately
591,000 square feet (existing, under construction or planned) in 9 buildings
known as Bridge Pointe Corporate Centre within the Eastgate Technology Park in
San Diego, California (the "PROJECT"). A depiction of the Project is attached
hereto as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein by this reference. Phase A of the
Project consists of 4 existing buildings known as "Building 1" (also referred to
as the "PHASE A-1 PREMISES") located at 4770 Eastgate Mall, "Building 2" (also
referred to as the "ADC TELECOMMUNICATIONS PREMISES") located at 4790 Eastgate
Mall, "Building 3" (also referred to as the "PHASE A-2 PREMISES") located at
4760 Eastgate Mall and "Building 4" (also referred to as the "PHASE A-3

referred to as the "PHASE B-1 PREMISES") located at 4820 Eastgate Mall. Phase C
of the Project consists of 3 planned buildings known as "Buildings 7 through 9".

        B. Landlord and Sublandlord entered into an Industrial Net Lease dated
September 2, 1998, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Lease dated
March 15, 1999 and assigned by that certain Assignment, Assumption and Consent
agreement dated January 1, 2000 (collectively, the "PHASE A LEASE") whereby
Landlord leased to Sublandlord the Phase A-2 Premises and the Phase A-3
Premises, upon the terms and conditions contained therein. A true, correct and
complete copy of the Phase A Lease is attached hereto as Exhibit "B" and made a
part hereof. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Phase A Lease.

        C. Sublandlord and Subtenant are desirous of entering into a sublease of
the Phase A-2 Premises ("SUBLEASE PREMISES") on the terms and conditions
hereafter set forth.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto mutually
covenant and agree as follows:

             1. Sublease. Sublandlord hereby subleases and demises to Subtenant
and Subtenant hereby hires and subleases from Sublandlord the Sublease Premises
which contain 47,000 rentable square feet upon and subject to the terms,
covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth.



<PAGE>   10

             2. Term.

             (a) The term of this Sublease ("SUBLEASE TERM") shall commence on
the earlier of the date of Substantial Completion (as defined in Paragraph 4.4
of Exhibit "D") of the Sublease Premises or August 1, 2000 regardless of the
status of the Tenant Improvements as of that date ("SUBLEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE")
and shall terminate on August 31, 2007 ("SUBLEASE EXPIRATION DATE").

             (b) Sublandlord shall deliver possession of the Sublease Premises
to Subtenant upon full execution of this Sublease and receipt of Landlord's
consent pursuant to Paragraph 15 hereof, with the roof and all plumbing,
lighting, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems within the Sublease
Premises in good working order, at which time Subtenant shall have the right to
commence the Tenant Improvements pursuant to the Work Letter executed among
Landlord, Sublandlord and Subtenant of even date herewith and attached hereto as
Exhibit "D" ("WORK LETTER").

             (c) Subtenant acknowledges that Subtenant has inspected and accepts
the Sublease Premises in its present condition, broom clean, "as is" and is
suitable for Subtenant's intended operations in the Sublease Premises, subject
to punch list items and latent defects not visually discoverable by Subtenant
upon a reasonably diligent inspection and which are identified in writing by
Subtenant within six (6) months of Subtenant's occupancy of the Premises in
accordance with the Work Letter. Subtenant further acknowledges that except as
set forth in the Work Letter or expressly set forth in this Sublease, no
representations as to the condition or repair of the Sublease Premises and no
promises to alter, remodel or improve the Sublease Premises have been made by
Landlord, Sublandlord or any agents of either party.

             (d) After the Sublease Commencement Date, Subtenant shall promptly
execute and return to Sublandlord a "Start-Up Letter" in which Subtenant shall
agree, among other things, to acceptance of the Sublease Premises (subject to
punchlist items and latent defects as set forth in Paragraph 2(c) above) and to
the confirmation of the Sublease Commencement Date, in accordance with the terms
of this Sublease, but Subtenant's failure or refusal to do so shall not negate
Subtenant's acceptance of the Sublease Premises or affect determination of the
Sublease Commencement Date.

             3. Subrental.

             (a) Base Rental. Beginning with the Sublease Commencement Date and
thereafter during the Sublease Term and ending on the Sublease Expiration Date,
Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord monthly installments of base rent ("BASE
RENTAL") as set forth below. The first monthly installment of Base Rental shall
be paid by Subtenant upon the execution of this Sublease. Base Rental and
additional rent shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as "RENT." Base
Rental shall be increased by four percent (4%) per annum on each anniversary
date of each year of the Sublease Term as follows:

             (b) Operating Expenses. Beginning with the Sublease Commencement
Date and thereafter during the Sublease Term, Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord
as additional rent under this Sublease, Subtenant's Proportionate Share of the
amounts that Sublandlord, as Tenant, has to pay Landlord, pursuant to Paragraph
7 of the Phase A Lease. For the purposes of this Sublease, "Subtenant's
Proportionate Share" shall mean the following: 100% of the Operating Expenses
for the Building in which the Phase A-2 Premises are located and 21.78% of the
Operating Expenses for the Phase A of the Project.

             (c) Payment of Rent. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Sublease, Rent shall be payable in lawful money without notice or demand,
and without offset, counterclaim, or setoff in monthly installments, in advance,
on the first day of each and every month during the Sublease Term. All of said
Rent is to be paid to Sublandlord at its office at the address set forth in
Paragraph 13 herein, or at such other place or to such agent and at such place
as Sublandlord may designate by notice to Subtenant. Any additional rent payable
on account of items which are not payable monthly by Sublandlord to Landlord
under the Phase A Lease is to be paid directly to Sublandlord as and when such
items are payable by Sublandlord to Landlord under the Phase A Lease unless a
different time for payment is elsewhere stated herein. Sublandlord shall request
that copies of all notices sent by Landlord pursuant to the Phase A Lease also
be sent to Subtenant at the address set forth in Paragraph 13 below. In
addition, Sublandlord agrees to provide Subtenant with copies of any notices,
statements or invoices received by Sublandlord from Landlord pursuant to the
terms of the Phase A Lease.

             4. Signage. Subtenant shall have the right to install at
Subtenant's sole cost and expense up to two (2) business identification signs
identifying Subtenant (including Subtenant's logo) on the upper exterior of the
building and adjacent to the building entrance doors of the building in which
the Sublease Premises are located, subject to Landlord's prior written approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Except for the foregoing, Subtenant shall have no right to install or keep
Subtenant identification signs in any other location outside the Sublease
Premises. The size, design, color and other



                                       3
<PAGE>   12

physical aspects of all such permitted signs shall also be subject to Landlord's
prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned and shall also be subject to any covenants, conditions or
restrictions encumbering the Sublease Premises and any applicable municipal or
other governmental permits and approvals. The cost of all such signs, including
the installation, maintenance and removal thereof, shall be at Subtenant's sole
cost and expense. If Subtenant fails to maintain its signs, or if Subtenant
fails to remove same upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease
and repair any damage caused by such removal, Sublandlord may do so at
Subtenant's expense and Subtenant shall reimburse Sublandlord for all actual
costs incurred by Sublandlord to effect such removal.

             5. Parking Density. 3.6 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of the
rentable area of the Sublease Premises, or 170 parking spaces, all unreserved
surface parking, at no additional cost to Subtenant.

             6. Holding Over. If by written notice to Sublandlord delivered not
later than twelve (12) months prior to the Sublease Expiration Date (the
"Hold-Over Notice"), Subtenant advises Sublandlord of its intent to hold-over
specifying the period of such hold-over (which period shall not extend beyond
March 31, 2009) (the "Hold-Over Term"), then Subtenant may, as a matter of
right, remain in possession following the Sublease Expiration Date for the
Hold-Over Term set forth in the Hold-Over Notice; provided, that the Base Rent
for the Hold-Over Term shall be equal to the Base Rent for the last month of the
Sublease Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subtenant shall not have the right
to hold-over beyond March 31, 2009.

             7. Bonus Rent. Any Rent or other consideration realized by
Subtenant under any sublease or assignment, in excess of the Rent payable
hereunder, after amortization of all transaction costs reasonably incurred in
connection therewith, including but not limited to reasonable brokerage
commission incurred by Subtenant, legal fees, costs of improvements, shall be
divided and paid, twenty-five percent (25%) to Subtenant, and seventy-five
percent (75%) to Sublandlord ("Bonus Rent"). In any subletting or assignment
undertaken by Subtenant, Subtenant shall diligently seek to obtain the maximum
rental amount available in the marketplace for comparable space available for
primary leasing.

             8. Incorporation of Terms of Phase A Lease. This Sublease is
subject and subordinate to the Phase A Lease. Subject to the modifications set
forth in this Sublease, the terms of the Phase A Lease are incorporated herein
by reference, and shall, as between Sublandlord and Subtenant (as if they were
Landlord and Tenant, respectively, under the Phase A Lease) constitute the terms
of this Sublease except to the extent that they are inapplicable to,
inconsistent with, or modified by, the terms of this Sublease. In the event of
any inconsistencies between the terms and provisions of the Phase A Lease and
the terms and provisions of this Sublease, the terms and provisions of this
Sublease shall govern. Subtenant acknowledges that it has reviewed the Phase A
Lease and is familiar with the terms and conditions thereof.

             (a) For the purposes of incorporation herein, the terms of the
Phase A Lease are subject to the following additional modifications:

                    (i) In all provisions of the Phase A Lease (under the terms
             thereof and without regard to modifications thereof for purposes of

<PAGE>   13

             Sublease) requiring the approval or consent of Landlord, Subtenant
             shall be required to obtain the approval or consent of both
             Landlord and Sublandlord.

                    (ii) In all provisions of the Phase A Lease requiring Tenant
             to submit, exhibit to, supply or provide Landlord with evidence,
             certificates, or any other matter or thing, Subtenant shall be
             required to submit, exhibit to, supply or provide, as the case may
             be, the same to both Landlord and Sublandlord.

                    (iii) Sublandlord shall have no obligation to restore or
             rebuild any portion of the Sublease Premises after any destruction
             or taking by eminent domain.

                    (iv) In Paragraph 8(B)(5) of the Phase A Lease, the

             $50,000.00 per occurrence.

                    (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph 8
             of the Phase A Lease, Subtenant shall be permitted to carry any of
             the required insurance coverages under blanket insurance policies.

                    (vi) In Paragraph 21(C) of the Phase A Lease, the rights
             specifically granted to Franklin Resources, Inc., as tenant shall
             expressly apply to, and benefit, Subtenant.

                    (vii) In Paragraph 38 (G) of the Phase A Lease, the
             reference to the "Designated Building" shall be deemed to reference
             the building constituting the Sublease Premises. All such roof
             rights shall be exclusive to Subtenant.

                    (viii) Paragraph 26(A)(2) of the Phase A Lease shall be
             modified to provide that Subtenant shall not be deemed in default
             under the Sublease the first time in any twelve month period that
             Subtenant fails to pay Rent when due unless such failure has not
             been cured within three (3) business days of Subtenant's receipt of
             written notice identifying the installment of Rent which was not
             timely paid.

                    (ix) In Paragraph 8(B)(1) of the Phase A Lease, the term
             "All Risk" insurance shall not be deemed to require Subtenant to

                    (x) In Paragraph 8(B)(2) of the Phase A Lease, the term
             "Amendment of the Pollution Exclusion Endorsement" shall be deemed
             to reference the Hostile Fire endorsement.

                    (xi) In Paragraph 16 of the Phase A Lease, the ten (10) day
             time period for response to Landlord's request shall be changed to

             9. Subtenant's Obligations. Subtenant covenants and agrees that all
obligations of Sublandlord under the Phase A Lease with respect to the Sublease
Premises shall be done or performed by Subtenant, except as otherwise provided
by this Sublease, and Subtenant's obligations shall run to Sublandlord and
Landlord as Sublandlord may determine to be appropriate or be required by the
respective interests of Sublandlord and Landlord. Subtenant agrees to indemnify
Sublandlord, and hold it harmless, from and against any and all claims, damages,
losses, expenses and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred
as a result of the non-performance, non-observance or non-payment of any of
Sublandlord's obligations under the Phase A Lease applicable to the Sublease
Premises which, as a result of this Sublease, became an obligation of Subtenant.
Subtenant shall not do, nor permit to be done, any act or thing which is, or
with notice or the passage of time would be, a default under this Sublease or
the Phase A Lease (to the extent applicable to the Sublease Premises).
Sublandlord agrees to indemnify Subtenant, and hold it harmless, from and
against any and all claims, damages, losses, expenses and liabilities (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred as a result of the non-performance,
non-observance or non-payment of any of Sublandlord's obligations under the
Phase A Lease which under the terms of this Sublease have remained Sublandlord's
responsibility.

             10. Sublandlord's Obligations. Sublandlord agrees that Subtenant
shall be entitled to receive all services and repairs to be provided by Landlord
to Sublandlord under the Phase A Lease. Subtenant shall look solely to Landlord
for all such services and shall not, under any circumstances, seek nor require
Sublandlord to perform any of such services, nor shall Subtenant make any claim
upon Sublandlord for any damages which may arise by reason of Landlord's default
under the Phase A Lease. Any condition resulting from a default by Landlord
shall not constitute as between Sublandlord and Subtenant an eviction, actual or
constructive, of Subtenant and no such default shall excuse Subtenant from the
performance or observance of any of its obligations to be performed or observed
under this Sublease, or, except as otherwise provided in this Sublease, entitle
Subtenant to receive any reduction in or abatement of the Rent provided for in
this Sublease. In furtherance of the foregoing, and subject to Paragraph 14
hereof, Subtenant does hereby waive any cause of action and any right to bring
any action against Sublandlord by reason of any act or omission of Landlord
under the Phase A Lease. Sublandlord covenants and agrees with Subtenant that
Sublandlord will pay all fixed rent and additional rent payable by Sublandlord
pursuant to the Phase A Lease to the extent that failure to perform the same
would adversely affect Subtenant's use or occupancy of the Sublease Premises. In
the event of a breach by Landlord of any term of the Phase A Lease, then
Sublandlord's sole obligation in regard to its obligation under this Sublease
shall be to diligently pursue the correction or cure by Landlord of Landlord's
breach. Such efforts shall include, without limitation, upon Subtenant's
request, (a) immediately notifying Landlord of its non-performance under the
Phase A Lease and demanding that Landlord perform its obligations under the
Phase A Lease and/or (b) assigning Sublandlord's rights under the Phase A Lease
to Subtenant to the



                                       6

extent necessary to permit Subtenant to institute legal proceedings against
Landlord to obtain the performance of Landlord's obligations under the Phase A
Lease; provided, however, that if Subtenant commences a lawsuit or other action,
Subtenant shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by Subtenant in connection
therewith, and Subtenant shall indemnify Sublandlord against, and hold
Sublandlord harmless from, all costs and expenses incurred by Sublandlord in
connection therewith; provided, however, that Subtenant's indemnity and hold
harmless obligation shall not apply (i) to any legal fees or costs incurred by
Sublandlord's counsel for work which unreasonably duplicates work performed by
Subtenant's counsel and (ii) to any legal fees or costs incurred by Sublandlord
in any legal action initiated by Sublandlord for its own benefit.

        11. Default by Subtenant. In the event Subtenant shall be in default of
any covenant of, or shall fail to honor any obligation under, this Sublease,
Sublandlord shall have available to it against Subtenant all of the remedies
available (a) to Landlord under the Phase A Lease in the event of a similar
default on the part of Sublandlord thereunder or (b) at law, subject in all
events to any notice and cure rights which would otherwise be available under
the terms of the Phase A Lease.

        12. Quiet Enjoyment. So long as Subtenant pays all of the Rent due
hereunder and performs all of Subtenant's other obligations hereunder,
Sublandlord shall do nothing to affect Subtenant's right to peaceably and
quietly have, hold and enjoy the Sublease Premises, and all of the rights,
entitlements, and options granted to Subtenant hereunder. In the event, however,
that Sublandlord defaults in the performance or observance of any of
Sublandlord's obligations under this Sublease or receives a notice of default
from Landlord under the Phase A Lease of which Subtenant is aware, then
Subtenant shall give written notice to Sublandlord specifying in what manner
Sublandlord has defaulted. If any such default by Sublandlord shall not be cured
within a reasonable time, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
Sublandlord's receipt of such written notice from Subtenant (except that if such
default cannot be cured within said thirty (30) day period, this period shall be
extended for an additional reasonable time, provided that Sublandlord commences
to cure such default within such thirty (30) day period and proceeds diligently
thereafter to effect such cure as quickly as possible), then Subtenant shall be
entitled, at Subtenant's option, to cure such default and promptly collect from
Sublandlord Subtenant's reasonable expenses in so doing (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) unless such default by
Sublandlord is caused by a default of Subtenant hereunder (in which case
Sublandlord shall not be liable for Subtenant's costs to cure the default).
Subtenant shall not be required to wait the entire cure period provided for
herein if earlier action is required to prevent a termination by Landlord of the
Phase A Lease or the imposition of a penalty on Subtenant and Sublandlord has
failed to take such earlier action. Sublandlord shall not amend or modify the
Phase A Lease in such a manner as to adversely affect Subtenant's use of the
Sublease Premises or increase the obligations or decrease the rights of
Subtenant hereunder, without the prior written consent of Subtenant, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Anything contained in any provision
of this Sublease to the contrary notwithstanding, Subtenant agrees, with respect
to the Sublease Premises, to comply with and remedy any default in this Sublease
or the Phase A Lease which is Subtenant's obligation to cure, within the period
allowed to Sublandlord under the Phase A Lease, even if such time period is
shorter than the period otherwise allowed therein due to the fact that notice of
default from Sublandlord to

Subtenant is given after the corresponding notice of default from Landlord to
Sublandlord. Sublandlord agrees to forward to Subtenant both by facsimile and
otherwise in accordance with Paragraph 13 below, promptly upon receipt thereof
by Sublandlord, a copy of each notice of default received by Sublandlord in its
capacity as Tenant under the Phase A Lease. Subtenant agrees to forward to
Sublandlord, promptly upon receipt thereof, copies of any notices received by
Subtenant from Landlord or from any governmental authorities.

        13. Notices. All notices, demands and requests shall be in writing and
shall be sent either by hand delivery or by a nationally recognized overnight
courier service (e.g., Federal Express, in either case return receipt requested,
to the address of the appropriate party. Notices, demands and requests so sent
shall be deemed given when the same are received. Notices and remittance of Rent

        14. Condition of Premises. Except as provided in the Work Letter,
Subtenant acknowledges that it is subleasing the Sublease Premises "as-is" and
that Sublandlord is not making any representation or warranty concerning the
condition of the Sublease Premises and that Sublandlord is not obligated to
perform any work to prepare the Sublease Premises for Subtenant's occupancy.
Subtenant acknowledges that it is not authorized to make or do any alterations
or improvements in or to the Sublease Premises except as permitted by the
provisions of this Sublease and the Phase A Lease and that it must deliver the
Sublease Premises to Sublandlord on the Sublease Expiration Date in the
condition required by the Phase A Lease.

        15. Consent of Landlord. Paragraph 21.A. of the Phase A Lease requires
Sublandlord to obtain the written consent of Landlord to this Sublease.
Sublandlord shall diligently pursue Landlord's consent to this Sublease promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Sublease by Sublandlord and
Subtenant.

        16. Termination of the Phase A Lease. If for any reason the term of the
Phase A Lease shall terminate prior to the Sublease Expiration Date, this
Sublease shall automatically be terminated and Sublandlord shall not be liable
to Subtenant by reason thereof unless said termination shall have been caused by
the default of Sublandlord under the Phase A Lease, and said Sublandlord default
was not as a result of a Subtenant default hereunder. To the extent that the
Phase A Lease grants Sublandlord any discretionary right to terminate the Phase
A Lease, whether due to casualty, condemnation, or otherwise, Sublandlord shall
not exercise such right without the prior written consent of the Subtenant which
may be withheld by Subtenant in its sole and absolute discretion. If Landlord
seeks to terminate the Phase A Lease because of a default or alleged default by
Sublandlord under the Phase A Lease (other than a default or alleged default
caused by the default by Subtenant under this Sublease), Sublandlord shall take
all action required to reinstate the Phase A Lease. Further, if Rent is abated
under the Phase A Lease, Rent hereunder shall also be abated in the same
proportion.

        17. Limitation of Estate. Subtenant's estate shall in all respects be
limited to, and be construed in a fashion consistent with, the estate granted to
Sublandlord by Landlord.

        18. Confidentiality. The covenants, obligations and conditions contained
in this Sublease and the Phase A Lease shall remain strictly confidential.
Subtenant agrees to keep such terms, covenants, obligations and conditions
strictly confidential and not to disclose such matters to any other landlord,
tenant, prospective tenant except prospective subtenants of Subtenant or
assignees of Subtenant, or broker. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subtenant
shall be allowed to disclose the Sublease and all covenants, obligations and
conditions contained therein and the Phase A Lease, for business purposes only,
to its shareholders, lenders, attorneys and accountants, to prospective
subtenants of Subtenant or assignees of Subtenant, and in any filing made by
Subtenant with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other governmental
authorities in accordance with applicable law.

Sublandlord harmless from and against all actions, claims, demands, costs,
liabilities, losses, reasonable attorneys' fees, damages, penalties, and
expenses (collectively "Claims") which may be brought or made against
Sublandlord or which Sublandlord may pay or incur to the extent resulting from

Sublease by Subtenant, (iii) any violation of law by Subtenant or its employees,
agents, contractors or invitees ("Agents") relating to the use or occupancy of
the Sublease Premises, or (iiv) the negligence or willful misconduct of
Subtenant or its Agents. Sublandlord shall indemnify, defend, protect, and hold

against Subtenant or which Subtenant may pay or incur to the extent caused by

on or about the Project or Sublease Premises; (ii) the failure by Sublandlord to
comply with or perform its obligations under the Phase A Lease and/or this
Sublease, and (iii) a breach by Sublandlord of any of its representations or
warranties to Subtenant under this Sublease.

        20. Permitted Use. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
the Phase A Lease, the Sublease Premises shall be used for general office space,
engineering and research and development purposes, and for any other legal
permitted uses compatible with the City of San Diego's MLI zone and the MCAS
Miramar Comprehensive Land Use Plan and otherwise compatible with comparable
office projects. The Occupancy Density shall not exceed 4.5 persons per 1,000
square feet. Subtenant shall have access to and use of the Sublease Premises
24-hours per day, 365-days per year.

        21. Mutual Waiver of Subrogation. The waiver of subrogation provision
set forth in Paragraph 9 of the Phase A Lease shall be deemed a three party
agreement binding among and inuring to the benefit of Sublandlord, Subtenant and
Landlord (by reason of its consent to hereto).

        22. Representations. Sublandlord represents to Subtenant that (A) the
Phase A Lease is in full force and effect, (B) the copy of the Phase A Lease
which is attached to this Sublease as EXHIBIT A is a true, correct and complete
copy of the Phase A Lease, (C) to Sublandlord's best knowledge, no default

months of the Tenant's occupancy of each Building), whether or not substantial
completion of other portions of the Building or Project shall have occurred. If
for any reason beyond Landlord's reasonable control Landlord cannot deliver
possession of the subject portion of the Premises to Tenant on the scheduled
Term Commencement Date, Landlord shall not be subject to any liability therefor,
nor shall Landlord by in default hereunder nor shall such failure affect the
validity of this Lease, and Tenant agrees to accept possession of other portions
of the Premises at such time as such improvements have been substantially
completed, which date shall then be deemed the Term Commencement Date; provided,
however, that if Landlord fails to tender possession of any portion of the
Premises, subject to Paragraph 35 of this Lease, within ninety (90) days of the
scheduled Term Commencement Date with respect to each Building, then Tenant,
upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Landlord shall have
the right to terminate this Lease with respect to each Building, unless within
such thirty (30) day period Landlord tenders possession of each Building in the
condition required by this Lease. Tenant shall not be liable for any Rent for
any period prior to the Term Commencement Date (but without affecting any
obligation of Tenant under any improvement agreement appended to this Lease). In
the event of any dispute as to substantial completion of work performed or
required to be performed by Landlord, the certificate of Landlord's architect or
general shall be conclusive. Substantial completion shall have occurred
notwithstanding Tenant's submission of a punchlist to Landlord, which Tenant
shall submit, if at all, within seven (7) business days after the Term
Commencement Date or otherwise in accordance with any improvement agreement
appended to this Lease. Upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall promptly execute
and return to Landlord a "Start-Up Letter" in which Tenant shall agree, among
other things, to acceptance of the Premises (subject to any punchlist exceptions
according to Paragraph 6.C of Exhibit C) and to the determination of the Term
Commencement Date, in accordance with the terms of this Lease, but Tenant's
failure or refusal to do so shall not negate Tenant's acceptance of the Premises
or affect determination of the Term Commencement Date.

                                  3.      TERM

        The term of this Lease (the "TERM") shall commence on the Term
Commencement Date and continue in full force and effect for the number of months
specified as the Length of Term in the Basic Lease Information or until this
Lease is terminated as otherwise provided herein. If the Term Commencement Date
is a date other than the first day of the calendar month, the Term shall be the
number of months of the Length of Term in addition to the remainder of the
calendar month following the Term Commencement Date.

                                  4.      USE

A.      GENERAL. Tenant shall use the Premises for the permitted use specified
in the Basic Lease ("PERMITTED USE") and for no other use or purpose, without
Landlord's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Tenant shall control Tenant's employees, agents, customers,
visitors, invitees, licensees, contractors, assignees and subtenants
(collectively, "TENANT'S PARTIES") in such a manner that Tenant and Tenant's
Parties cumulatively do not exceed the occupancy density (the "OCCUPANCY
DENSITY" ) or the parking density specified in the Basic Lease Information (the
"PARKING DENSITY") at any time. So long as Tenant is occupying the Premises,
Tenant and Tenant's Parties shall have the nonexclusive right to use, without
paying any fee or



                                       4
<PAGE>   32


charge therefor, in common with other parties occupying the Project, the parking
areas, driveways and other common areas of the Building and Project, subject to
the terms of this Lease and such rules and regulations as Landlord may from time
to time reasonably prescribe upon written notice to Tenant. Further, Landlord
and Tenant acknowledge that Tenant's actual Occupancy Density may exceed
Tenant's Parking Density, however, Landlord shall not be obligated to Tenant to
provide additional parking in the event the Occupancy Density causes the Parking
Density to be exceeded. In the event Tenant's Parking Density is exceeded,
Tenant shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to immediately cure this
condition. Landlord reserves the right to the extent it is commercially
reasonable to do so, upon reasonable prior written notice to Tenant, without
liability to Tenant, and without the same constituting an actual or constructive
eviction, to alter or modify the common areas from time to time, including the
location and configuration thereof, and the amenities and facilities which
Landlord may determine to provide from time to time, provided that no such
changes shall unreasonably affect access to or visibility of the Premises and
all such changes shall be consistent with the operation of comparable
first-class business parks in San Diego County, California.

B.   LIMITATIONS. Tenant shall not permit any odors, smoke, dust, gas,
substances, noise or vibrations to emanate from the Premises or from any portion
of the common areas as a result of Tenant's or any Tenant's Party's use thereof,
nor take any action which would constitute a nuisance or would unreasonably
disturb, obstruct or endanger any other tenants or occupants of the Project or
elsewhere, or interfere with their use of their respective premises or common
areas. Storage outside the Premises of materials, vehicles or any other items is
prohibited. Tenant shall not use or allow the Premises to be used for any
unlawful purpose, nor shall Tenant cause or maintain or permit any nuisance in,
on, or about the Premises. Tenant shall not commit or suffer the commission of
any waste in, on or about the Premises. Tenant shall not allow any sale by
auction upon the Premises, or place any loads upon the floors, walls or ceilings
which could endanger the structure, or place any harmful substances in the
drainage system of the Building or Project. No waste, materials or refuse shall
be dumped upon or permitted to remain outside the Premises except in trash
containers placed inside exterior enclosures designated for that purpose by
Landlord. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant for the non-compliance by
any other tenant or occupant of the Project with any of the above-referenced
rules or any other terms or provisions of such tenant's or occupant's lease or
other contract, provided Landlord shall administer compliance with such rules
and regulations in a nondiscriminatory manner.

C.   COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS. By entering the Premises for purposes of the
commencement of the conduct of Tenant's business, Tenant accepts the Premises in
the condition existing as of the date of such entry subject to the completion by
Landlord of any punchlist items and any latent defects as described in Paragraph
2.B. of this Lease. Tenant shall at its sole cost and expense strictly comply
with all existing or future applicable municipal, state and federal and other
governmental statutes, rules, requirements, regulations, laws and ordinances,
including zoning ordinances and regulations, including the MCAS Miramar
Comprehensive Land Use Plan ("CLUP") attached hereto as Exhibit E of this Lease,
and covenants, easements and restrictions of record governing and relating to
the specific manner of Tenant's use, occupancy or possession of the Premises, to
Tenant's use of the common areas, or to the use, storage, generation or disposal
of Hazardous Materials (hereinafter defined) (collectively "REGULATIONS").
Tenant shall at its sole cost and expense obtain any and all licenses or permits
necessary for Tenant's use of the Premises. Tenant shall at its sole cost and
expense promptly comply with the requirements of any board of fire underwriters
or other similar body now or hereafter constituted. Tenant shall not do or
permit anything to be done in, on, under or about the Project or bring or keep
anything which will in any way increase the rate of any insurance upon the
Premises, Building or Project or upon any contents therein or cause a
cancellation of said insurance or otherwise affect said insurance in any manner.
Tenant shall indemnify, defend (by counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord),
protect and hold Landlord harmless from and against any loss, cost, expense,
damage, attorneys' fees or liability arising out of the failure of Tenant to
comply with any Regulation. Tenant's obligations pursuant to the foregoing
indemnity shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

D.   HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. As used in this Lease, "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS" shall
include, but not be limited to, hazardous, toxic and radioactive materials and
those substances defined as "hazardous substances," "hazardous materials,"
"hazardous wastes," "toxic substances," or other similar designations in any
Regulation. Tenant's Hazardous Materials Declaration is attached hereto as
EXHIBIT D. Tenant shall not cause, or allow any of Tenant's Parties to cause,
any Hazardous Materials to be handled, used, generated, stored, released or
disposed of in, on, under or about the Premises, the Building or the Project or
surrounding land or environment in violation of any Regulations. Tenant must
obtain Landlord's written consent prior to the introduction of any Hazardous
Materials onto the Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may handle,
store, use and dispose of products containing small quantities of Hazardous
Materials for "general office purposes" (such as toner for copiers) to the
extent customary and necessary for the Permitted Use of the Premises; provided
that Tenant shall always handle, store, use, and dispose of any such Hazardous
Materials in a safe and lawful manner and never allow such Hazardous Materials
to contaminate the Premises, Building, or Project or surrounding land or
environment. Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord in writing of any
Hazardous Materials' contamination of any portion of the Project of which Tenant
becomes aware, whether or not caused by Tenant. If, but only if, Landlord has a
reasonable basis to believe the Tenant has introduced any Hazardous Materials
onto the Premises, then Landlord shall have the right at all reasonable times to
inspect the Premises and to conduct tests and investigations to determine
whether Tenant is in compliance with the foregoing provisions, the reasonable
and actual costs of all such inspections, tests and investigations to be borne
by Tenant. Tenant shall indemnify, defend (by counsel reasonably acceptable to
Landlord), protect and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all
claims, liabilities, losses, costs, loss of rents, liens, damages, injuries or
expenses (including attorneys' and consultants' fees and court costs), demands,
causes of action, or judgments directly or indirectly arising out of or related
to the use, generation, storage, release, or disposal of Hazardous Materials by
Tenant or any of Tenant's Parties in, on, under or about the Premises, the
Building or the Project or surrounding land or environment, which indemnity
shall include, without limitation, damages for personal or bodily injury,
property damage, damage to the environment or natural resources occurring on or
off the Premises, losses attributable to diminution in value or adverse effects
on marketability, the cost of any investigation, monitoring, government
oversight, repair, removal, remediation, restoration, abatement, and disposal,
and the preparation of any closure or other required plans, whether such action
is required or necessary prior to or following the expiration or earlier
termination of this Lease. Neither the consent by Landlord to the use,
generation, storage, release or disposal of Hazardous Materials nor the strict
compliance by Tenant with all laws pertaining to Hazardous Materials shall
excuse Tenant from Tenant's obligation of indemnification pursuant to this
Paragraph 4.D. Tenant's obligations pursuant to the foregoing indemnity shall
survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

                            5. RULES AND REGULATIONS

     Tenant shall faithfully observe and comply with the building rules and
regulations attached hereto as EXHIBIT A and any other rules and regulations and
any modifications or additions thereto which Landlord may from time to time
reasonably prescribe in writing for the purpose of maintaining the proper care,
cleanliness, safety, traffic flow and general order of the Premises or the
Building or Project. Tenant shall cause Tenant's Parties to comply with such
rules and regulations. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant for the
non-compliance by any other tenant or occupant of the Building or Project with
any of such rules and regulations, any other tenant's or occupant's lease or any
Regulations, provided Landlord shall administer compliance with such rules in a
nondiscriminatory manner.

                                    6. RENT

A.   BASE RENT. Tenant shall pay to Landlord and Landlord shall receive,
without notice or demand throughout the Term, Base Rent as specified in the
Basic Lease Information, payable in monthly installments in advance on or
before the first day of each calendar month, in lawful money of the United
States, without deduction or offset whatsoever (except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this Lease), at the


                                       5
<PAGE>   33
Remittance Address specified in the Basic Lease Information or to such other
place in the Continental United States as Landlord may from time to time
designate in writing. Base Rent for the first full two (2) months of the Term
shall be paid by Tenant upon Tenant's execution of this Lease in accordance
with Paragraph 38.D. of this Lease. If the obligation for payment of Base Rent
commences on a day other than the first day of a month, then Base Rent shall be
prorated and the prorated installment shall be paid on the first day of the
calendar month next succeeding the Term Commencement Date. The Base Rent
payable by Tenant hereunder is subject to adjustment as provided elsewhere in
this Lease, as applicable. As used herein, the term "Base Rent" shall mean the
Base Rent specified in the Basic Lease Information as it may be so adjusted
from time to time.

B.    ADDITIONAL RENT. All monies other than Base Rent required to be paid by
Tenant hereunder, including, but not limited to, Tenant's Proportionate Share of
Operating Expenses, as specified in Paragraph 7 of this Lease, charges to be
paid by Tenant under Paragraph 15, the interest and late charge described in
Paragraphs 26.C. and D., and any monies spent by Landlord pursuant to Paragraph
30, shall be considered additional rent ("ADDITIONAL RENT"). "RENT" shall mean
Base Rent and Additional Rent.

                            7.    OPERATING EXPENSES

A.    OPERATING EXPENSES. In addition to the Base Rent required to be paid
hereunder, Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent, Tenant's Proportionate Share of
the Building and/or Project (as applicable), as defined in the Basic Lease
Information, of Operating Expenses (defined below) in the manner set forth
below. Tenant shall pay the applicable Tenant's Proportionate Share of each
such Operating Expenses. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that if the number of
buildings which constitute the Project increases or decreases, or if physical
changes are made to the Building or Project or the configuration of any
thereof, Landlord may at its discretion reasonably adjust Tenant's
Proportionate Share of the Building or Project to reflect the change.
Landlord's determination of Tenant's Proportionate Share of the Project shall
be conclusive so long as it is reasonably and consistently applied. "OPERATING
EXPENSES" shall mean all expenses and costs of every kind and nature which
Landlord shall reasonably pay or become obligated to pay, because of or in
connection with the management, maintenance, repair, preservation, replacement
and operation of the Building or Project and its supporting facilities and such
additional facilities now and in subsequent years as may be determined by
Landlord to be necessary or desirable to the Building and/or Project (as
determined in a reasonable manner) other than those expenses and costs which
are specifically attributable to Tenant or which are expressly made the
financial responsibility of Landlord or specific tenants of the Building or
Project pursuant to this lease. Operating Expenses shall include, but are not
limited to, the following:

      (1)   TAXES. All real property taxes and general assessments, possessory
      interest taxes, sales taxes, personal property taxes, business or license
      taxes or fees, gross receipts taxes, service payments in lieu of such
      taxes or fees, annual or periodic license or use fees, excises, transit
      charges imposed generally and not in connection with the initial
      development of the Project, and other impositions, general and special,
      ordinary and extraordinary, unforeseen as well as foreseen, of any kind
      (including fees "in-lieu" of any such tax or assessment) which are now or
      hereafter assessed, levied, charged, confirmed, or imposed by any public
      authority upon the Building or Project, its operations or the Rent (or any
      portion or component thereof), or any tax, assessment or fee imposed in
      substitution, partially or totally, of any of the above. Operating
      Expenses shall also include any taxes, assessments, reassessments, or
      other fees or impositions with respect to the development, leasing,
      management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of
      the Premises, Building or Project or any portion thereof, including,
      without limitation, by or for Tenant, and all increases therein or
      reassessments thereof whether the increases or reassessments result from
      increased rate and/or valuation (whether upon a transfer of the Building
      or Project or any portion thereof or any interest therein or for any other
      reason). Operating Expenses shall not include inheritance or estate taxes
      imposed upon or assessed against the interest of any person in the
      Project, or taxes computed upon the basis of the net income of any owners
      of any interest in the Project. If it shall not be lawful for Tenant to
      reimburse Landlord for all or any part of such taxes, the monthly rental
      payable to Landlord under this Lease shall be revised to net Landlord the
      same net rental after imposition of any such taxes by Landlord as would
      have been payable to Landlord prior to the payment of any such taxes.
      Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Lease to the contrary, in no
      event shall "Taxes" include any fees, costs or exactions incurred by
      Landlord in connection with obtaining the right to develop the Project
      (exclusive of Tenant Improvements), including, but not limited to, any
      fees for schools, parks, traffic, sewer and fire protection, or any
      special assessments used to finance any portion of the Project, including
      any off-site roadway or utility facilities.

      (2)   INSURANCE. All insurance premiums and costs, including, but not
      limited to, any deductible amounts, premiums and other costs of insurance
      reasonably and actually incurred by Landlord, including for the insurance
      coverage set forth in Paragraph 8.A. herein. In an event wherein a
      deductible may be greater than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) said
      deductible amount shall be amortized over the greater of (i) the
      remaining Term of this Lease or (ii) three (3) years.

      (3)   COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE.

            (a)   Repairs, replacements, and general maintenance of and for the
            Building and Project and public and common areas and facilities of
            and comprising the Building and Project, including, but not limited
            to, the roof and roof membrane, elevators, mechanical rooms, alarm
            systems, pest extermination, landscaped areas, parking and service
            areas, driveways, sidewalks, truck staging areas, rail spur areas,
            fire sprinkler systems, sanitary and storm sewer lines, utility
            services, heating/ventilation/air conditioning systems, electrical,
            mechanical or other systems, telephone equipment and wiring
            servicing, plumbing, lighting, and any other items or areas which
            affect the operation or appearance of the Building or Project,
            which determination shall be at Landlord's discretion, except for:
            those items expressly made the financial responsibility of Landlord
            pursuant to Paragraph 10 hereof; those items to the extent paid for
            by the proceeds of insurance or which are covered under warranties
            of the contractor, manufacturer or supplier thereof; and those
            items attributable solely or jointly to specific tenants of the
            Building or Project.

            (b)   Repairs, replacements, and general maintenance shall include
            the cost of any capital improvements made to or capital assets
            acquired for the Project or Building that are reasonably intended
            to reduce any other Operating Expenses, including future repair
            work not covered by applicable warranties, are reasonably necessary
            for the health and safety of the occupants of the Building or
            Project, or are required to comply with any change in Regulation
            not applicable to the Building as of the Term Commencement Date,
            such costs or allocable portions thereof to be amortized over such
            reasonable period as Landlord shall determine, together with
            interest on the unamortized balance at the publicly announced
            "prime rate" charged by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (San Francisco) or
            its successor at the time such improvements or capital assets are
            constructed or acquired, plus two (2) percentage points, or in the
            absence of such prime rate, then at the U.S. Treasury six-month
            market note (or bond, if so designated) rate as published by any
            national financial publication selected by Landlord, plus four (4)
            percentage points, but in no event more than the maximum rate
            permitted by law, plus reasonable financing charges. Landlord shall
            be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for performing all
            work to each Building (exclusive of Tenant Improvements) or the
            common areas necessary to cause the Project to conform to
            Regulations applicable as of the Term Commencement Date.

               (c)  Payment under or for any easement, license, permit,
               operating agreement, declaration, restrictive covenant or
               instrument relating to the Building or Project.

               (d)  All expenses and rental related to services and costs of
               supplies, materials and equipment used in operating, managing
               and maintaining the Premises, Building and Project, the
               equipment therein and the adjacent sidewalks, driveways, parking
               and service areas, including, without limitation, expenses
               related to service agreements regarding security, fire and other
               alarm systems, janitorial services to the extent not addressed
               in Paragraph 11 hereof, window cleaning, elevator maintenance,

               to the administration, and operation of the Project, including
               without limitation salaries, wages and benefits.

               (e)  The cost of supplying any services and utilities which
               benefit all or a portion of the Premises, Building or Project to
               the extent not addressed in Paragraph 15 hereof.

               (f)  Reasonable legal expenses and the cost of audits by
               certified public accountants; provided, however, that legal
               expenses chargeable as Operating Expenses shall not include the
               cost of negotiating leases, collecting rents, evicting tenants
               nor shall it include costs incurred in legal proceedings with or
               against any tenant or to enforce the provisions of any lease.

               (g)  An administrative and accounting cost recovery fee equal to
               twenty percent (20%) of the sum of the Project's Operating
               Expenses.

If the rentable area of the Building and/or Project is not fully occupied during
any fiscal year of the Term as determined by Landlord, an adjustment may be
made in Landlord's discretion in computing the Operating Expenses for such year
so that Tenant pays an equitable portion of all variable items (e.g.,
utilities, janitorial services and other component expenses that are affected
by variations in occupancy levels) of Operating Expenses, as reasonably
determined by Landlord; provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord be
entitled to collect in excess of one hundred percent (100%) of the total
Operating Expenses from all of the tenants in the Building or Project, as the
case may be.

Operating Expenses shall not include the following:

     (i)    costs incurred in connection with the original construction of the

            or by anyone else;

     (vii)  any bad debt loss, rent loss, or reserves for bad debts or rent
            loss;

     (ix)   costs associated with the operation of the business of the
            partnership which constitutes Landlord, as the same are

            the issue), costs of selling, syndicating, financing, mortgaging or

            and/or the Project and/or the site upon which the Project is
            situated;

     (x)    the wages and benefits of any employee who hoes not devote
            substantially all of his or her time to the Project unless such
            wages and benefits are prorated to reflect time spent on operating
            and managing the Project vis-a-vis time spent on matters unrelated
            to operating and managing the Project;

     (xi)   fines, penalties and interest;

     (xii)  amounts paid as ground rental by Landlord;

              accounting principles, consistently applied, except as expressly
              allowed for in Paragraph 7.A.(3)(b) of this lease;

     (xviii)  expenses in connection with services or other benefits which are
              not provided to Tenant or for which Tenant is charged directly but
              which are provided to another tenant or occupant of the Project
              without a separate charge;

     (xix)    costs paid to Landlord or to affiliates of Landlord for services
              in the Project to the extent the same exceed or would exceed the
              costs for such services if rendered by unaffiliated third parties
              on a competitive basis;

     (xx)     rentals and other related expenses incurred in leasing air
              conditioning systems, elevators or other equipment ordinarily
              considered to be of a capital nature if purchased, except
              equipment not affixed to the Project which is used in providing
              janitorial or similar services;

     (xxi)    all items and services for which Tenant or any other tenant in the
              Project reimburses Landlord or which Landlord provides selectively
              to one or more tenants (other than Tenant) without reimbursement;

     (xxii)   electric power costs for which any tenant directly contracts with
              the local public service company;

     (xxiii)  costs arising from Landlord's political or charitable
              contributions;

     (xxiv)   costs arising from latent defects in the Project or improvements
              installed by Landlord;

     (xxv)    costs, other than those incurred in ordinary maintenance, for
              sculpture, painting or other objects of art;

     (xxvi)   costs for which Landlord has been compensated by an administrative

     (xxvii)  costs arising from the gross negligence of Landlord or its agents,
              or any vendors, contractors or providers of materials or services
              selected, hired or engaged by Landlord or its agents, including
              without limitation, the selection of building materials;

     (xxviii) Landlord's general corporate overhead and general and
              administrative expenses; and

     (xxix)   costs incurred by Landlord due to the violation by Landlord or any
              tenant of the terms and conditions of any lease of space in the
              Project.

     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in any instance wherein
Landlord, in Landlord's reasonable discretion, deems Tenant to be responsible
for any amounts greater than Tenant's Proportionate Share, Landlord shall have
the right to reasonably allocate costs in any manner Landlord reasonably deems
appropriate.

     The above enumeration of services and facilities shall not be deemed to
impose an obligation on Landlord to make available or provide such services or
facilities except to the extent if any that Landlord has specifically agreed
elsewhere in this Lease to make the same available or provide the same; provided
that Landlord shall operate and maintain the Project in a manner reasonably
comparable to other comparable first-class business park projects in San Diego
County. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant acknowledges
and agrees that it shall be responsible for providing adequate security for its
use of the Premises, the Building and the Project and that Landlord shall have
no obligation or liability with respect thereto, except to the extent if any
that Landlord has specifically agreed elsewhere in this Lease to provide the
same.

B.   PAYMENT OF ESTIMATED OPERATING EXPENSES. "ESTIMATED OPERATING EXPENSES"
for any particular year shall mean Landlord's reasonable estimate of the
Operating Expenses for such fiscal year made with respect to such fiscal year
as hereinafter provided. Landlord shall have the right from time to time to
revise its fiscal year and interim accounting periods so long as the periods as
so revised are reconciled with prior periods in a reasonable manner. During the
last month of each fiscal year during the Term, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, but in any event by April 30 of the following year, Landlord shall
give Tenant written notice of the Estimated Operating Expenses for the ensuing
fiscal year. Tenant shall pay Tenant's Proportionate Share of the Estimated
Operating Expenses with installments of Base Rent for the fiscal year to which
the Estimated Operating Expenses applies in monthly installments on the first
day of each calendar month during such year, in advance. Such payment shall be
construed to be Additional Rent for all purposes hereunder. If at any time
during the course of the fiscal year, Landlord determines that Operating
Expenses are projected to vary from the then Estimated Operating Expenses by
more than five percent (5%), Landlord may, by written notice to Tenant stating
with specificity the basis for such readjustment, revise the Estimated
Operating Expenses for the balance of such fiscal year, and Tenant's monthly
installments for the remainder of such year shall be adjusted so that by the end
of such fiscal year Tenant has paid to Landlord Tenant's Proportionate Share of
the revised Estimated Operating Expenses for such year, such revised
installment amounts to be Additional Rent for all purposes hereunder.

C.   COMPUTATION OF OPERATING EXPENSE ADJUSTMENT. "OPERATING EXPENSE ADJUSTMENT"
shall mean the difference between Estimated Operating Expenses and actual
Operating Expenses for any fiscal year determined as hereinafter provided.
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year, or as
soon thereafter as practicable but in any event by June 30 of such year,
Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement of actual Operating Expenses for
the fiscal year just ended, accompanied by a computation of Operating Expense
Adjustment. If such statement shows that Tenant's payment based upon Estimated
Operating Expenses is less than Tenant's Proportionate Share of Operating
Expenses, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord the difference within thirty (30)
days after receipt of such statement, such payment to constitute Additional Rent
for all purposes hereunder. If such statement shows that Tenant's payments of
Estimated Operating Expenses exceed Tenant's Proportionate Share of Operating
Expenses, then (provided that Tenant is not in default under this Lease)
Landlord shall pay to Tenant the difference within thirty (30) days after
delivery of such statement to Tenant. If this Lease has been terminated or the
Term hereof has expired prior to the date of such statement, then the Operating
Expense Adjustment shall be paid by the appropriate party within thirty (30)
days after the date of delivery of the statement. Should this Lease commence or
terminate at any time other than the first day of the fiscal year, Tenant's
Proportionate Share of the Operating Expense Adjustment shall be prorated based
on a month of 30 days and the number of calendar months during such fiscal year
that this Lease is in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Paragraph 7.A or 7.B, Landlord's failure to provide any notices or statements
within the time periods specified in those paragraphs shall in no way excuse
Tenant from its obligation to pay Tenant's Proportionate Share of Operating
Expenses.

D.   NET LEASE. This shall be a triple net Lease and Base Rent shall be paid to
Landlord absolutely net of all costs and expenses, except as specifically
provided to the contrary in this Lease. The provisions for payment of Operating
Expenses and the Operating Expense Adjustment are intended to pass on to Tenant
and reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses of the nature described in
Paragraph 7.A. incurred in connection with the management, maintenance, repair,
preservation, replacement and operation of


                                       8
<PAGE>   36
the Building and/or Project and its supporting facilities and such additional
facilities now and in subsequent years as may be determined by Landlord to be
necessary or desirable to the Building and/or Project.

E.   TENANT AUDIT. If Tenant shall dispute the amount set forth in any statement
     provided by Landlord under Paragraph 7.B. or 7.C. above, Tenant shall have
     the right, not later than six (6) months following receipt of such
     statement and upon the condition that Tenant shall first deposit with
     Landlord the full amount in dispute, to cause Landlord's books and records
     with respect to Operating Expenses for such fiscal year to be audited by
     certified public accountants selected by Tenant and subject to Landlord's
     reasonably right of approval. The Operating Expense Adjustment shall be
     appropriately adjusted on the basis of such audit. If such audit discloses
     a liability for a refund in excess of five percent (5%) of Tenant's
     Proportionate Share of the Operating Expenses previously reported, the cost
     of such audit shall be borne by Landlord; otherwise the cost of such audit
     shall be paid by Tenant. If Tenant shall not request an audit in accordance
     with the provisions of this Paragraph 7.E. within six (6) months after
     receipt of Landlord's statement provided pursuant to Paragraph 7.B. or
     7.C., such statement shall be final and binding for all purposes hereof,
     absent manifest error.

F.   CALCULATION OF OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating Expenses shall be calculated
     and determined in accordance with the following general principles:

          (1)  RECOVERY LIMITED TO ACTUAL COSTS. Landlord shall not recover the
               cost of any item more than once.

          (2)  ARM's LENGTH. All services rendered to and materials supplied to
               the Project shall be rendered or supplied at a cost comparable to
               those charged in arm's length transactions for similar services
               or materials rendered or supplied for similar purposes to
               comparable buildings in San Diego County.

          (3)  REIMBURSEMENTS. All discounts, reimbursements, rebates, refunds
               or credits (collectively, "Reimbursements") attributable to
               Operating Expenses received by Landlord in a particular year
               shall be deducted from Operating Expenses in the year the same
               are received; provided, however, if a particular Reimbursement
               exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) and applies to a
               prior year, such Reimbursement shall be applied to such prior
               year (and Tenant's Proportionate Share thereof shall be promptly
               refunded).

          (4)  NON-PROJECT EXCLUSIVE EXPENSES. Whenever expenses are paid or
               incurred by Landlord as a result of activities that are not
               exclusively rendered to the Project, only that portion that can
               be reasonably allocated to the Project shall be included within
               Operating Expenses.

          (5)  INSTALLMENTS. All assessments and premiums of Operating Expenses
               which can be paid or incurred by Landlord in annual installments
               shall be paid by Landlord in the maximum number of annual
               installments permitted by law and shall not be included as
               Operating Expenses except in the calculation year in which the
               installments are actually paid; provided, however, that if the
               then-prevailing practice in other comparable buildings is to pay
               such assessments or premiums on an earlier basis and Landlord
               shall pay the same on such basis, such assessments or premiums
               shall be included in Operating Expenses as paid by Landlord.

          (6)  REASONABLENESS. Landlord shall use its reasonable efforts to
               operate and maintain the Project in an economically reasonable
               manner.

                       8.   INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION

A.        LANDLORD'S INSURANCE. All insurance maintained by Landlord shall be
for the sole benefit of Landlord and under Landlord's sole control.

          (1)  PROPERTY INSURANCE. Landlord agrees to maintain property
          insurance insuring the Building against damage or destruction due to
          risk including fire, vandalism, and malicious mischief in an amount
          not less than the replacement cost thereof, in the form and with
          deductibles and endorsements as selected by Landlord. At its election,
          Landlord may instead (but shall have no obligation to) obtain "All
          Risk" coverage, and may also obtain earthquake, pollution, and/or
          flood insurance in amounts selected by Landlord.

          (2)  OPTIONAL INSURANCE. Landlord, at Landlord's option, may also (but
          shall have no obligation to) carry insurance against loss of rent, in
          an amount equal to the amount of Base Rent and Additional Rent that
          Landlord could be required to abate to all Building tenants in the
          event of condemnation or casualty damage for a period of twelve (12)
          months. Landlord may also (but shall have no obligation to) carry such
          other insurance as Landlord may reasonably deem prudent or advisable,
          including, without limitation, liability insurance in such amounts and
          on such terms as Landlord shall determine. If and when Spieker
          Properties, L.P. or its successor by merger or acquisition, is not
          longer the "Landlord" under this Lease, then at all times Landlord
          shall carry a policy of Commercial General Liability Insurance with
          limits of liability of no less than Three Million Dollars
          ($3,000,000.00). Landlord shall not be obligated to insure, and shall
          have no responsibility whatsoever for any damage to, any furniture,
          machinery, goods, inventory or supplies, or other personal property or
          fixtures which Tenant may keep or maintain in the Premises, or any
          leasehold improvements, additions or alterations within the Premises
          except where such damage arises from the active negligence or willful
          misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents, or contractors.

B.        TENANT'S INSURANCE.

          So long as Franklin Resources, Inc. is "Tenant" under this Lease, the
          coverages Tenant is required to maintain under this Lease may be
          maintained under a program of Tenant's self-insurance or under
          policies that include self-insured retentions of deductibles that are
          typically carried by similarly situated tenants. Prior to any
          implementation of Tenant's self-insurance program, Tenant shall in
          writing advise Landlord of the self-insured retentions, or
          deductibles.

          (1)  PROPERTY INSURANCE. Tenant shall procure at Tenant's sole cost
          and expense and keep in effect from the date of this Lease and at all
          times until the end of the Term, insurance on all personal property
          and fixtures of Tenant and all improvements, additions or alterations
          made by or for Tenant to the Premises on an "All Risk" basis, insuring
          such property for the full replacement value of such property.

          (2)  LIABILITY INSURANCE. Tenant shall procure at Tenant's sole cost
          and expense and keep in effect from the date of this Lease and at all
          times until the end of the Term Commercial General Liability insurance
          covering bodily injury and property damage liability occurring in or
          about the Premises or arising out of the use and occupancy of the
          Premises and the Project, and any part of either, and any areas
          adjacent thereto, and the business operated by Tenant or by any other
          occupant of the Premises. Such insurance shall include contractual
          liability coverage insuring all of Tenant's indemnity obligations
          under this Lease. Such coverage shall have a minimum combined single
          limit of liability of at least Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00),
          and a


                                       9
<PAGE>   37
     minimum general aggregate limit of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000),
     with an "Additional Insured -- Managers or Lessors of Premises Endorsement"
     and the "Amendment of the Pollution Exclusion Endorsement." All such
     policies shall be written to apply to all bodily injury (including death),
     property damage or loss, personal and advertising injury and other
     covered loss, however occasioned, occurring during the policy term, shall
     be endorsed to add Landlord and any party holding an interest to which this
     Lease may be subordinated as an additional insured, and shall provide that
     such coverage shall be "PRIMARY" and non-contributing with any insurance
     maintained by Landlord, which shall be excess insurance only. Such
     coverage shall also contain endorsements including employees as additional
     insureds if not covered by Tenant's Commercial General Liability
     Insurance. All such insurance shall provide for the severability of
     interests of insureds; and shall be written on an "OCCURRENCE" basis,
     which shall afford coverage for all claims based on acts, omissions,
     injury and damage, which occurred or arose (or the onset of which occurred
     or arose) in whole or in part during the policy period.

     (3)  WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY INSURANCE. Tenant shall
     carry Workers' Compensation Insurance as required by any Regulation,
     throughout the Term at Tenant's sole cost and expense. To the extent
     required by any Regulation, Tenant shall also carry Employers' Liability
     Insurance in amounts not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) each
     accident for bodily injury by accident; One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)
     policy limit for bodily injury by disease; and One Million Dollars
     ($1,000,000) each employee for bodily injury by disease, throughout the
     Term at Tenant's sole cost and expense.

     (4)  COMMERCIAL AUTO LIABILITY INSURANCE. Tenant shall procure at Tenant's
     sole cost and expense and keep in effect from the date of this Lease and
     at all times until the end of the Term commercial auto liability insurance
     with a combined limit of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)
     for bodily injury and property damage for each accident. Such insurance
     shall cover liability relating to any auto (including owned, hired and
     non-owned autos).

     (5)  GENERAL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. All coverages described in this
     Paragraph 8.B. shall be endorsed to (i) provide Landlord with thirty (30)
     days' notice of cancellation or material change in terms; and (ii) waive
     all rights of subrogation by the insurance carrier against Landlord. If at
     any time during the Term the amount or coverage of insurance which Tenant
     is required to carry under this Paragraph 8.B. is, in Landlord's reasonable
     judgment, materially less than the amount or type of insurance coverage
     typically carried by owners or tenants of properties located in the
     general area in which the Premises are located which are similar to and
     operated for similar purposes as the Premises or if Tenant's use of the
     Premises should change with or without Landlord's consent, Landlord shall
     have the right to require Tenant to increase the amount or change the
     types of insurance coverage required under this Paragraph 8.B. All
     insurance policies required to be carried by Tenant under this Lease shall
     be written by companies rated A VII or better in "Best's Insurance Guide"
     and authorized to do business in the State of California. Should Franklin
     Resources, Inc. or its successor by merger or acquisition, no longer be
     "Tenant" under this Lease, then deductible amounts under all insurance
     policies required to be carried by Tenant under this Lease shall not
     exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per occurrence. Tenant shall
     deliver to Landlord on or before the Term Commencement Date, and thereafter
     at least thirty (30) days before the expiration dates of the expired
     policies, or a certificate evidencing the same issued by the insurer
     thereunder; and, if Tenant shall fail to procure such insurance, or to
     deliver such certificates, Landlord may, at Landlord's option and in
     addition to Landlord's other remedies in the event of a default by Tenant
     hereunder, procure the same for the account of Tenant, and the cost
     thereof shall be paid to Landlord as Additional Rent.

C.   INDEMNIFICATION. Tenant shall indemnify, defend by counsel reasonably
acceptable to Landlord, protect and hold Landlord harmless from and against any
and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, loss of rents, liens, damages,
injuries or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and
court costs, demands, causes of action, or judgements, directly or indirectly
arising out of or related to: (1) claims of injury to or death of persons or
damage to property occurring or resulting directly or indirectly from the use
or occupancy of the Premises, Building or Project by Tenant or Tenant's
Parties, or from activities or failures to act of Tenant or Tenant's Parties;
(2) claims arising from work or labor performed, or for materials or supplies
furnished to or at the request of Tenant in connection with performance of any
work done for the account of Tenant within the Premises or Project; (3) claims
arising from any breach or default on the part of Tenant in the performance of
any covenant contained in this Lease; and (4) claims arising from the
negligence or intentional acts or omissions of Tenant or Tenant's Parties. The
foregoing indemnity by Tenant shall not be applicable to claims to the extent
arising from the active negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord. Landlord
shall not be liable to Tenant and Tenant hereby waives all claims against
Landlord for any injury or damage to any person or property in or about the
Premises, Building or Project by or from any cause whatsoever (other than
Landlord's active negligence or willful misconduct) and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, whether caused by water leakage of any character
from the roof, walls, basement or other portion of the Premises, Building or
Project, or caused by gas, fire, oil or electricity in, on or about the
Premises, Building or Project. Landlord shall indemnify, defend by counsel
reasonably acceptable to Tenant, protect and hold Tenant harmless form and
against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, liens, damages,
injuries or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and consultants'
fees and court costs, demands, causes of action or judgements directly or
indirectly arising from the active negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord
or its employees, agents or contractors. The provisions of this Paragraph shall
survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

                           9.   WAIVER OF SUBROGATION

     To the extent permitted by law and without affecting the coverage provided
by insurance to be maintained hereunder or any other rights or remedies,
Landlord and Tenant each waive any right to recover against the other for: (a)
damages for injury to or death of persons; (b) damages to property, including
personal property; (c) damages to the Premises or any part thereof; and (d)
claims arising by reason of the foregoing due to hazards covered by insurance
maintained or required to be maintained pursuant to this Lease to the extent of
proceeds recovered therefrom, or proceeds which would have been recoverable
therefrom in the case of the failure of any party to maintain any insurance
coverage required to be maintained by such party pursuant to this Lease. This
provision is intended to waive fully, any rights and/or claims arising by
reason of the foregoing, but only to the extent that any of the foregoing
damages and/or claims referred to above are covered or would be covered, and
only to the extent of such coverage, by insurance actually carried or required
to be maintained pursuant to this Lease by either Landlord or Tenant. This
provision is also intended to waive fully, and for the benefit of each party,
any rights and/or claims which might give rise to a right of subrogation on any
insurance carrier. Subject to all qualifications of this Paragraph 9, Landlord
waives its rights as specified in this Paragraph 9 with respect to any subtenant
that it has approved pursuant to Paragraph 21 but only in exchange for the
written waiver of such rights to be given by such subtenant to Landlord upon
such subtenant taking possession of the Premises or a portion thereof. Each
party shall cause each insurance policy obtained by it to provide that the
insurance company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against
either party in connection with any damage covered by any policy.

                    10.  LANDLORD'S REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE

     Landlord shall at Landlord's expense maintain in first-class condition
and repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted, the structural soundness of the
roof, foundations, and exterior walls of the Building. The term "exterior
walls" as used herein shall not include windows, glass or plate glass, doors,
dock bumpers or dock plates, special store fronts or office entries. Landlord
shall perform on behalf of Tenant and other tenants of the Project the
maintenance of the public and common areas of the Project including, but not
limited to, the

Version 10.2                           10
<PAGE>   38
landscaped areas, parking areas, driveways, sanitary and storm sewer lines,
utilities services, HVAC systems, electric equipment (excluding Tenant's
emergency electric generator(s) described in Paragraph 38 H. hereof) servicing
the Building, exterior lighting, Project trash removal services, and anything
which affects the operation and exterior appearance of the Project, which
determination shall be at Landlord's reasonably discretion. Any damage caused by
or repairs necessitated by any negligence or act of Tenant or Tenant's Parties
may be repaired by Landlord at Landlord's option and Tenant's expense. Tenant
shall immediately give Landlord written notice of any defect or need of repairs
in such components of the Building for which Landlord is responsible, after
which Landlord shall have a reasonably opportunity and the right to enter the
Premises at all reasonably times to repair same. Tenant's liability with respect
to any defects, repairs, or maintenance for which Landlord is responsible under
any of the provisions of the Lease shall be limited to the cost of such repairs
or maintenance, and there shall be no abatement of rent and no liability of
Landlord by reason of any injury to or interference with Tenant's business
arising from the making of repairs, alterations or improvements in or to any
portion of the Premises, the Building or the Project or to fixtures,
appurtenances or equipment in the Building, except as provided in Paragraph 24
or anywhere else in this Lease. By taking possession of the Premises, Landlord,
subject to Paragraph 2.B of this Lease, accepts them "as is," as being in good
order, condition and repair and the condition in which Landlord if obligated to
deliver them and suitable for the Permitted Use and Tenant's intended operations
in the Premises, whether or not any notice of acceptance is give.

                    11.     TENANT'S REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE

        Tenant shall at all times during the Term at Tenant's expense maintain
all interior non-structural parts of the Premises and such portions of the
Building as are within the exclusive control of Tenant in a first-class, good,
clean and secure condition and promptly make all necessary repairs and
replacements, as reasonably determined by Landlord, including but not limited
to, all windows, glass, doors, walls, including demising walls, and wall
finishes, floors and floor coverings, ceiling insulation, truck doors, hardware,
plumbing work and fixtures, downspouts, entries, skylights, smoke hatches, roof
vents, electrical and lighting systems, and fire sprinklers, and the emergency
generator(s) described in Paragraph 38.H. of this Lease, with materials and
workmanship of the same character, kind and quality as the original. Tenant
shall at Tenant's expense also perform regular removal of trash and debris.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant shall, at its
expense, promptly repair any damage to the Premises or the Building or Project
resulting from or caused by any negligence or act of Tenant or Tenant's Parties.
Nothing herein shall expressly or by implication render Tenant Landlord's agent
or contractor to effect any repairs or maintenance required of Landlord under
this Paragraph 11, as to all of which Tenant shall be solely responsible.

                              12.     ALTERATIONS

A.      Except for interior, nonstructural alterations costing less than
Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) to perform, Tenant shall not make, or
allow to be made, any alterations, physical additions, improvements or
partitions, in, about or to the Premises ("ALTERATIONS") without obtaining the
prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned with respect to proposed Alterations which: (a)
comply with all applicable Regulations; (b) are, in Landlord's opinion,
compatible with the Building or the Project and its mechanical, plumbing,
electrical, heating/ventilation/air conditioning systems, and will not cause the
Building or Project or such systems to be required to be modified to comply with
any Regulations (including, without limitation, the Americans With Disabilities
Act) unless Tenant agrees to perform the same at its sole cost and expense; and
(c) will not interfere with the use and occupancy of any other portion of the
Project by any other tenant or its invitees. Specifically, but without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right of written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) for all plans and specifications for the proposed Alterations,
construction means and methods, all appropriate permits and licenses, any
contractor or subcontractor to be employed on the work of Alterations, and the
time for performance of such work, and may impose reasonably rules and
regulations for contractors and subcontractors performing such work. Tenant
shall also supply to Landlord any documents and information reasonably requested
by Landlord in connection with Landlord's considerations of a request for
approval hereunder. Tenant shall cause all Alterations to be accomplished in a
first-class, good and workmanlike manner, and to comply with all applicable
Regulations and Paragraph 27 hereof. If Landlord does not respond in writing
within ten (10) days of Tenant's plan, stating with specificity its reasons
therefor, Tenant shall deliver a second notice to Landlord, stating in bold type
on the first page thereof "URGENT -- DELAY NOTICE," which notice may be
delivered by facsimile to Landlord at Landlord's Notice Address and as otherwise
set forth in Paragraph 32, and if Landlord fails to respond within five (5) days
thereafter, Landlord's consent shall be deemed given. Tenant shall at Tenant's
sole expense, perform any additional work required under applicable Regulations
due to the Alterations hereunder. No review or consent by Landlord of or to any
proposed Alteration or additional work shall constitute a waiver of Tenant's
obligations under this Paragraph 12. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all
third-party costs which Landlord may reasonably and actually incur in connection
with granting approval to Landlord for any such Alterations, including any costs
or expenses which Landlord may incur in electing to have outside architects and
engineers review said plans and specifications to the extent it is reasonably
necessary to do so. All such Alterations shall remain the property of Tenant
until the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, at which time they
shall be and become the property of Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord
may, at Landlord's option, require that Tenant, at Tenant's expense, remove any
or all Alterations made by Tenant which Landlord indicated at the time consent
thereto was granted would have to be removed and restore the Premises by the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, to their condition existing
prior to the construction of any such Alterations. All such removals and
restoration shall be accomplished in a first-class and good and workmanlike
manner so as not to cause any damage to the Premises or Project whatsoever. If
Tenant fails to remove such Alterations or Tenant's trade fixtures or furniture
or other personal property, Landlord may keep and use them or remove any of them
and cause them to be stored or sold in accordance with applicable law, at
Tenant's sole expense. In addition to and wholly apart from Tenant's obligation
to pay Tenant's Proportionate Share of Operating Expense, Tenant shall be
responsible for and shall pay prior to delinquency any taxes or governmental
service fees, possessory interest taxes, fees or charges in lieu of any such
taxes, capital levies, or other charges imposed upon, levied with respect to or
assessed against its fixtures or personal property, on the value of Alterations
within the Premises, and on Tenant's interest pursuant to this Lease, or any
increase in any of the foregoing based on such Alterations. To the extent that
any such taxes are not separately assessed or billed to Tenant, Tenant shall pay
the amount thereof as invoiced to Tenant by Landlord.

        The work necessary to make such Alterations shall be performed by
employees, contractors or space planners employed by Landlord or, with
Landlord's prior written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, by space planners and/or contractors licensed
in California which are employed by Tenant. In addition, if Landlord


                                       11
<PAGE>   39
elected at the time consent to any such Alterations was granted to require that
any such Alterations be removed by Tenant upon the expiration or earlier
termination of the Term, and the Landlord elects to be responsible for
performing such removal, then notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding
paragraph, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the cost of removing any such
Alterations and restoring the Premises in their original condition such cost to
include a reasonable charge for Landlord's overhead and profit as provided
above, and such amount may be deducted from the Security Deposit or any other
sums or amounts held by Landlord under this Lease.

B.   In compliance with Paragraph 27 hereof, at least ten (10) business days
before beginning construction of any Alteration, Tenant shall give Landlord
written notice of the expected commencement date of that construction to permit
Landlord to post and record a notice of non-responsibility. Upon substantial
completion of construction, if the law so provides, Tenant shall cause a timely
notice of completion to be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county
in which the Building is located.

                                   13.  SIGNS

Tenant shall not place, install, affix, paint or maintain any signs, notices,
graphics or banners whatsoever or any window decor which is visible in or from
public view or corridors, the common areas or the exterior of the Premises or
the Building, in or on any exterior window or window fronting upon any common
areas or service area or upon any truck doors or man doors without Landlord's
prior written approval which Landlord shall have the right to withhold in its
absolute and sole discretion; provided that Tenant's name shall be included in
any Building-standard door and directory signage, if any, and Tenant shall have
the right to install at Tenant's sole cost, expense and responsibility,
identifying signage on the existing monument sign at the entranceway to the
Project, in accordance with Landlord's Building signage, criteria attached as
EXHIBIT F hereto, including without limitation, payment by Tenant of any fee
charged by Landlord for maintaining such signage, which fee shall constitute
Additional Rent hereunder. Any installation of signs, notices, graphics or
banners on or about the Premises or Project approved by Landlord shall be
subject to any Regulations and to any other requirements imposed by Landlord.
Tenant shall remove all such signs or graphics by the expiration or any earlier
termination of this Lease. Such installations and removals shall be made in such
manner as to avoid injury to or defacement of the Premises, Building or Project
and any other improvements contained therein, and Tenant shall repair any injury
or defacement including without limitation discoloration caused by such
installation or removal.

                        14.  INSPECTION/POSTING NOTICES

After reasonable notice and subject to such security requirements as Tenant may
reasonably impose, except in emergencies where no such notice or compliance with
any such security requirements shall be required, Landlord and Landlord's agents
and representatives, shall have the right to enter the Premises to inspect the
same, to clean, to perform such work as may be permitted or required hereunder,
to make repairs, improvements or alterations to the Premises, Building or
Project or to other tenant spaces therein, to deal with emergencies, to post
such notices as may be permitted or required by law to prevent the perfection of
liens against Landlord's interest in the Project or to exhibit the Premises to
prospective tenants (during the last twelve (12) months of the Term or extended
Term), purchasers, encumbrancers or to others, or for any other purpose as
Landlord may deem necessary or desirable; provided however, that Landlord shall
use reasonable efforts not to unreasonably interfere with Tenant's business
operations. Tenant shall have the right to require a representative of Tenant to
accompany Landlord during any such entry or inspection. Tenant shall not be
entitled to any abatement of Rent by reason of the exercise of any such right or
entry. Tenant waives any claim for damages for any injury or inconvenience to or
interference with Tenant's business, any loss of occupancy or quiet enjoyment of
the Premises, and any other loss occasioned thereby except for any damage to
persons as properly caused by the active negligence or willful misconduct of
Landlord or its employees, agents or contractors. Landlord shall at all times
have and retain a key with which to unlock all of the doors in, upon and about
the Premises, excluding Tenant's vaults and safes or special security areas
(designated in advance), and Landlord shall have the right to use any and all
means which Landlord may deem necessary or proper to open said doors in an
emergency, in order to obtain entry to any portion of the Premises, and any
entry to the Premises or portions thereof obtained by Landlord by any of said
means, or otherwise, shall not be construed to be a forcible or unlawful entry
into, or a detainer of, the Premises, or an eviction, actual or constructive, of
Tenant from the Premises or any portions thereof. At any time within six (6)
months prior to the expiration of the Term or following any earlier termination
of this Lease or agreement to terminate this Lease, Landlord shall have the
right to erect on the Premises, Building and/or Project a suitable sign
indicating that the Premises are available for lease.

                          15.  SERVICES AND UTILITIES

A.   Tenant shall pay directly for all water, gas, heat, air conditioning,
light, power, telephone, sewer, sprinkler charges and other utilities and
services used on or from the Premises, together with any taxes, penalties,
surcharges or the like pertaining thereto, and maintenance charges for utilities
and shall furnish all electric light bulbs, ballasts and tubes. Tenant shall
have the right to conduct its business operations within the Premises, and to
receive reasonable quantities of water, electricity and HVAC in connection
therewith, seven (7) days per week, twenty-four (24) hours per day. If any such
services are not separately billed or metered to Tenant, Tenant shall pay a
proportion, as determined by Landlord, of all charges jointly serving other
premises. All sums payable under this Paragraph 15 shall constitute Additional
Rent hereunder. Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to reasonably capture any
material benefit available through deregulation of electricity supply or of the
supply of other utilities.

B.   Tenant acknowledges that Tenant has inspected and accepts the water,
electricity, heat and air conditioning and other utilities and services being
supplied or furnished to the Premises as of the date Tenant takes possession of
the Premises, if any, as being sufficient in their present condition, "as is,"
for the Permitted Use, and for Tenant's intended operations in the Premises.

C.   Tenant shall not without written consent of Landlord (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) use any apparatus,
equipment or device in the Premises, including without limitation, computers,
electronic data processing machines, copying machines, and other machines, using
excess lighting or using electric current, water, or any other resource in
excess of or which will in any way increase the amount of electricity, water, or
any other resource being furnished or supplied for the use of the Premises for
reasonable and normal office use, in each case as of the date Tenant takes
possession of the Premises as reasonably determined by Landlord, or which will
require additions or alterations to or interfere with the Building power
distribution systems; nor connect with electric current, except through existing
electrical outlets in the Premises or water pipes, any apparatus, equipment or
device for the purpose of using electrical current, water, or any other
resource. If Tenant shall require water or electric current or any other
resource in excess of that being furnished or supplied for the use of the
Premises as of the date Tenant takes possession of the Premises, if any, as
reasonably determined by Landlord, Tenant shall first procure the written
consent of Landlord (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), to the use thereof, and Landlord may cause a special meter to
be installed in the Premises


                                       12

<PAGE>   40
so as to measure the amount of water, electric current or other resource
consumed for any such other use. Tenant shall pay directly to Landlord as an
addition to and separate from payment of Operating Expenses the cost of all
such additional resources, energy, utility service and meters (and of
installation, maintenance and repair thereof and of any additional circuits or
other equipment necessary to furnish such additional resources, energy, utility
or service). Landlord may add to the separate or metered charge a recovery of
additional expense incurred in keeping account of the excess water, electric
current or other resource so consumed. Landlord shall not be liable for any
damages directly or indirectly resulting from nor shall the Rent or any monies
owed Landlord under this Lease herein reserved be abated by reasons of: (a) the
installation, use or interruption of use of any equipment used in connection
with the furnishing of any such utilities or services, or any change in the
character or means of supplying or providing any such utilities or services or
any supplier thereof; (b) the failure to furnish or delay in furnishing any such
utilities or services when such failure or delay is caused by acts of God or the
elements, labor disturbances of any character, or any other accidents or other
conditions beyond the reasonable control of Landlord or because of any
interruption of service due to Tenant's use of water, electric current or other
resource in excess of that being supplied or furnished for the use of the
Premises as of the date Tenant takes possession of the Premises; or (c) the
inadequacy, limitation, curtailment, rationing or restriction on use of water,
electricity, gas or any other form of energy or any other service or utility
whatsoever serving the Premises or Project otherwise; or (d) the partial or
total unavailability of any such utilities or services to the Premises or the
Building, whether by Regulation or otherwise; nor shall any such occurrence
constitute an actual or constructive eviction of Tenant. Landlord shall further
have no obligation to protect or preserve any apparatus, equipment or device
installed by Tenant in the Premises. In addition, Landlord reserves the right to
change the supplier or provider of any such utility or service from time to
time. Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, upon notice to Tenant,
contract with or otherwise obtain any electrical or other such service for or
with respect to the Premises or Tenant's operations therein from any supplier or
provider of any such service. Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord and any
supplier or provider of such services designated by Landlord from time to time
to facilitate the delivery of such services to Tenant at the Premises and to the
Building and Project, including without limitation allowing Landlord and
Landlord's suppliers or providers, and their respective agents and contractors,
reasonable access to the Premises for the purpose of installing, maintaining,
repairing, replacing or upgrading such service or any equipment or machinery
associated therewith.

Subject to Paragraph 35 of this Lease, for service or utilities that Landlord is
required to supply to the Premises hereunder, but is actively negligent in
adequately providing or altogether fails to provide, Tenant's Rent shall be
abated or reduced for such period of time that the Premises or portion thereof
is not supplied with such services or utilities, in proportion to the rentable
square feet of the Premises that is so affected bears to the total rental square
feet of the Premises.

D.   Landlord acknowledges and agrees to Tenant's exclusive use, operation,
maintenance, repair and security protection of those certain underground
conduit, vault and equipment facilities within the Project for Tenant's
telecommunication cabling and equipment. Furthermore, Tenant agrees to and
accepts complete and full responsibility and control of the facilities described
in the preceding sentence.

                               16.  SUBORDINATION

Without the necessity of any additional document being executed by Tenant for
the purpose of effecting a subordination, the Lease shall be and is hereby
declared to be subject and subordinate at all times to: (a) all ground leases or
underlying leases which may hereafter be executed affecting the Premises and/or
the land upon which the Premises and Project are situated, or both; and (b) any
mortgage or deed of trust which may be placed upon the Building, the Project
and/or the land upon which the Premises or the Project are situated, or said
ground leases or underlying leases, or Landlord's interest or estate in any of
said items which is specified as security. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Landlord shall have the right to subordinate or cause to be subordinated any
such ground leases or underlying leases or any such liens to this Lease. If any
ground lease or underlying lease terminates for any reason or any mortgage or
deed of trust is foreclosed or a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure is made for
any reason, Tenant shall, notwithstanding any subordination, attorn to and
become the Tenant of the successor in interest to Landlord provided that Tenant
shall not be disturbed in its possession under this Lease by such successor in
interest so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease beyond the
expiration of all applicable grace, notice and cure periods. Within ten (10)
days after request by Landlord, Tenant shall execute and deliver any
commercially reasonable additional documents evidencing Tenant's attornment or
the subordination of this Lease with respect to any such ground leases or
underlying leases or any such mortgage or deed of trust, in the form reasonably
requested by Landlord or by any ground landlord, mortgagee, or beneficiary under
a deed of trust, subject to such nondisturbance requirement.

                           17.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At the request of Landlord from time to time, Tenant shall provide to Landlord
Tenant's and any guarantor's current financial statements or other information
discussing financial worth of Tenant and any guarantor, which Landlord shall use
solely for purposes of this Lease and in connection with the ownership,
management, financing and disposition of the Project.

                           18.  ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE

Tenant agrees from time to time, but not more than twice in any calendar year,
within ten (10) business days after request of Landlord, to deliver to Landlord,
or Landlord's designee, an estoppel certificate stating that this Lease is in
full force and effect, that this Lease has not been modified (or stating all
modifications, written or oral, to this Lease), the date to which Rent has been
paid, the unexpired portion of this Lease, that there are no current defaults by
Landlord or Tenant under this Lease (or specifying any such defaults), that the
leasehold estate granted by this Lease is the sole interest of Tenant in the
Premises and/or the land at which the Premises are situated (subject to such
rights of first refusal and/or options to purchase as may be set forth herein),
and such other matters pertaining to this Lease as may be reasonably requested
by Landlord or any mortgage, beneficiary, purchaser or prospective purchaser of
the Building or Project or any interest therein. If Tenant fails to execute such
certificate within such ten (10) business day period, and such failure continues
for more than five (5) days following delivery of a second request therefor,
which second notice shall be labeled at the top in bold letters "URGENT - DELAY
NOTICE," then the failure by Tenant to execute and deliver such certificate
shall constitute a default under this Lease. Landlord and Tenant intend that any
statement delivered pursuant to this Paragraph may be relied upon by any
mortgagee, beneficiary, purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Building or
Project or any interest therein. The parties agree that Tenant's obligation to
furnish such estoppel certificates in a timely fashion is a material inducement
for Landlord's execution of the Lease, and shall be an event of default (without
any cure period that might be provided under Paragraph 26.A(3) of this Lease) if
Tenant fails to fully comply or makes any material misstatement in any such
certificate.


                                       13
<PAGE>   41
                             19.  SECURITY DEPOSIT

In the event Tenant does not exercise its first and/or second option to extend
the Term pursuant to Paragraph 38.B. of this Lease, Tenant agrees to deposit
with Landlord no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the
Term, or the extended Term, a security deposit as stated in the Basic Lease
Information (the "SECURITY DEPOSIT"), which sum shall be held and owned by
Landlord, without obligation to pay interest, as security for the performance
of Tenant's covenants and obligations under this Lease. The Security Deposit is
not an advance rental deposit or a measure of damages incurred by Landlord in
case of Tenant's default. Upon the occurrence of any event of default by
Tenant, Landlord may from time to time, without prejudice to any other remedy
provided herein or by law, use such fund as a credit to the extent necessary to
credit against any arrears of Rent or other payments due to Landlord hereunder,
and any other damage, injury, expense or liability caused by such event of
default, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on demand, the amount so applied in
order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. Although the
Security Deposit shall be deemed the property of Landlord, any remaining
balance of such deposit shall be returned by Landlord to Tenant at such time
after termination of this Lease that all of Tenant's obligations under this
Lease have been fulfilled, reduced by such amounts as may be required by
Landlord to remedy defaults on the part of Tenant in the payment of Rent or
other obligations of Tenant under this Lease, to repair damage to the Premises,
Building or Project caused by Tenant or any Tenant's Parties and to clean the
Premises. Landlord may use and commingle the Security Deposit with other funds
of Landlord.

                      20.  LIMITATION OF TENANT'S REMEDIES

The obligations and liability of Landlord to Tenant for any default by Landlord
under the terms of this Lease are not personal obligations of Landlord or of
the individual or other partners of Landlord or its or their partners,
directors, officers, or shareholders, and Tenant agrees to look solely to
Landlord's interest in the Project (including the rents, issues and proceeds
therefrom) for the recovery of any amount from Landlord, and shall not look to
other assets of Landlord nor seek recourse against the assets of the individual
or other partners of Landlord or its or their partners, directors, officers or
shareholders. Any lien obtained to enforce any such judgment and any levy of
execution thereon shall be subject and subordinate to any lien, mortgage or
deed of trust on the Project. Under no circumstances shall Tenant have the
right to offset against or recoup Rent or other payments due and to become due
to Landlord hereunder except as expressly provided in Paragraph 23.B. below or
elsewhere in this Lease, which Rent and other payments shall be absolutely due
and payable hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof.

                         21.  ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING

A.   (1)  GENERAL.  Tenant shall not assign or pledge this Lease or sublet the
     Premises or any part thereof, whether voluntarily or by operation of law,
     or permit the use or occupancy of the Premises or any part thereof by
     anyone other than Tenant, or suffer or permit any such assignment, pledge,
     subleasing or occupancy, without Landlord's prior written consent except
     as provided herein which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
     delayed or conditioned. If Tenant desires to assign this Lease or sublet
     any or all of the Premises, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice (the
     "TRANSFER NOTICE") at least thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated
     effective date of the proposed assignment or sublease, which shall contain
     all of the information reasonably requested by Landlord to address
     Landlord's decision criteria specified hereinafter. Landlord shall then
     have a period of (15) business days following receipt of the Transfer
     Notice to notify Tenant in writing whether Landlord consents to the
     proposed assignment or sublease, subject, however, to Landlord's prior
     written consent of the proposed assignee or subtenant and of any related
     documents or agreements associated with the assignment or sublease and if
     Landlord withholds such consent, stating with specificity the reasons
     therefor. Consent to any assignment or subletting shall not constitute
     consent to any subsequent transaction to which this Paragraph 21 applies.

(2)  CONDITIONS OF LANDLORD'S CONSENT.  Without limiting the other instances in
     which it may be reasonable for Landlord to withhold Landlord's consent to
     an assignment or subletting, Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that it shall
     be reasonable for Landlord to withhold Landlord's consent in the following
     instances: if the proposed assignee does not agree to be bound by and
     assume the obligations of Tenant under this Lease in form and substance
     reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; the use of the Premises by such
     proposed assignee or subtenant would not be a Permitted Use or would
     violate any exclusivity or other arrangement which Landlord has with any
     other tenant or other occupant or any Regulation or would increase the
     Occupancy  Density or Parking Density of the Building or Project, as
     reasonably determined by Landlord; the proposed assignee or subtenant is
     not of sound financial condition as determined by Landlord in Landlord's
     reasonable discretion; the proposed assignee or subtenant is a
     governmental agency that occupies more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
     the Premises; the proposed assignee or subtenant does not have a good
     reputation as a tenant of property or a good business reputation; the
     proposed assignee or subtenant is a person with whom Landlord is
     negotiating to lease space in the Project or is a present tenant of the
     Project; the assignment or subletting would entail any Alterations which
     would lessen the value of the leasehold improvements in the Premises or
     use of any Hazardous Materials or other noxious use or use which may
     disturb other tenants of the Project; or Tenant is in default of any
     obligation of Tenant under this Lease, or Tenant has defaulted under this
     Lease on three (3) or more occasions during any twelve (12) months
     preceding the date that Tenant shall request consent. Failure by or
     refusal of Landlord to consent to a proposed assignee or subtenant shall
     not cause a termination of this Lease. At the option of Landlord, a
     surrender and termination of this Lease shall operate as an assignment to
     Landlord of some or all subleases or subtenancies. Landlord shall exercise
     this option by giving notice of that assignment to such subtenants on or
     before the effective date of the surrender and termination. In connection
     with each request for assignment or subletting, Tenant shall pay to
     Landlord Landlord's standard fee for approving such requests, as well as
     all costs incurred by Landlord or any mortgage or ground lessor in
     approving each such request and effecting any such transfer, including,
     without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees in an amount not to exceed
     Twenty-five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00).

B.   BONUS RENT.  For any subletting or assignment that is in the aggregate less
than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Premises, any Rent or other consideration
realized by Tenant under any such sublease or assignment, in excess of the Rent
payable hereunder, after amortization of all transaction costs reasonably
incurred in connection therewith, including but not limited to reasonable
brokerage commission incurred by Tenant, legal fees, costs of improvements shall
be divided and paid, fifty percent (50%) to Tenant, fifty percent (50%) to
Landlord ("BONUS RENT"). However, for any subleasing or assignment that is in
the aggregate twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Premises, then the Bonus
Rent shall be divided and paid twenty-five percent (25%) to Tenant

                                       14
<PAGE>   42
and seventy-five (75%) to Landlord. In any subletting or assignment undertaken
by Tenant, Tenant shall diligently seek to obtain the maximum rental amount
available in the marketplace for comparable space available for primary leasing.

C.   CORPORATION. If Tenant is a corporation, a transfer of corporate shares by
sale, assignment, bequest, inheritance, operation of law or other disposition
(including such a transfer to or by a receiver or trustee in federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceedings) resulting in a change in the
present control of such corporation or any of its parents corporations by the
person or persons owning a majority of said corporate shares, shall constitute
an assignment for purposes of this Lease. So long as Franklin Resources, Inc.,
is the "Tenant" in possession of the Premises, and Tenant is not in default of
this Lease after the expiration of all applicable grace, notice and cure
periods, Tenant shall have the right subject to the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, without the consent of Landlord, to (a) assign its
interest in this Lease (i) to any corporation which is a successor to Tenant
either by merger or consolidation, or (ii) to a purchaser of all or
substantially all of Tenant's assets (provided such purchaser shall have also
assumed substantially all of Tenant's liabilities), or to a corporation or other
entity which shall control, be under the control of, or be under common control
with, Franklin Resources, Inc., (the term "control" as used herein shall be
deemed to mean ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding
voting stock of a corporation, or other majority equity and controlling interest
if Tenant is not a corporation) (any such entity being a "Related Entity"), or
(b) sublease all or any portion of the Premises to a Related Entity; upon the
condition that (i) the principal purpose of such assignment or sublease is not
the acquisition of Tenant's interest in this Lease (except if such assignment or
sublease is made to a Related Entity and is made for a valid intra-corporate
business purpose and is not made to circumvent the provisions of this Paragraph
21), and (ii) any such assignee shall have a net worth and annual income and
cash flow, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, consistently applied, after giving effect to such assignment, in
amounts necessary to perform its duties, obligations and liabilities hereunder,
as reasonably determined by Landlord. Tenant shall within ten (10) business days
after execution thereof, deliver to Landlord (a) a duplicate original instrument
of assignment, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, duly
executed by Tenant, (b) an instrument in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord, duly executed by the assignee, in which such assignee
shall assume observance and performance of, and agree to be personally bound by
all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be
observed and performed, or (c) a duplicate original sublease in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, duly executed by Tenant and
subtenant, in which such assignee shall assume observance and performance of,
and agree to be personally bound by all of the terms, covenants and conditions
of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed and performed.

D.   UNINCORPORATED ENTITY. If Tenant is a partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated limited liability company or other unincorporated business form,
a transfer of the interest of persons, firms or entities responsible for
managerial control of Tenant by sale, assignment, bequest, inheritance,
operation of law or other disposition, so as to result in a change in the
present control of said entity and/or of the underlying beneficial interests of
said entity and/or a change in the identity of the persons responsible for the
general credit obligations of said entity shall constitute an assignment for
all purposes of this Lease.

E.   LIABILITY. No assignment or subletting by Tenant, permitted or otherwise,
shall relieve Tenant of any obligation under this Lease or alter the primary
liability of the Tenant named herein for the payment of Rent or for the
performance of any other obligations to be performed by Tenant, including
obligations contained in Paragraph 25 with respect to any assignee or subtenant.
Landlord may collect rent or other amounts or any portion thereof from any
assignee, subtenant, or other occupant of the Premises, permitted or otherwise,
and apply the net rent collected to the Rent payable hereunder, but no such
collection shall be deemed to be a waiver of this Paragraph 21, or the
acceptance of the assignee, subtenant or occupant as tenant, or a release of
Tenant from the further performance by Tenant of the obligations of Tenant
under this Lease. Any assignment or subletting which conflicts with the
provisions hereof shall be void.

                                 22. AUTHORITY

Landlord represents and warrants that it has full right and authority to enter
into this Lease and to perform all of Landlord's obligations hereunder and that
all persons signing this Lease on its behalf are authorized to do. Tenant and
the person or persons, if any, signing on behalf of Tenant, jointly and
severally represent and warrant that Tenant has full right and authority to
enter into this Lease, and to perform all of Tenant's obligations hereunder, and
that all persons signing this Lease on its behalf are authorized to do so.

                                23. CONDEMNATION

A.   CONDEMNATION RESULTING IN TERMINATION. If the whole or any substantial
part of the Premises should be taken or condemned for any public use under any
Regulation, or by right of eminent domain, or by private purchase in lieu
thereof, and the taking would prevent or materially interfere with the
Permitted Use of the Premises, either party shall have the right to terminate
this Lease at its option. If any material portion of the Building or Project is
taken or condemned for any public use under any Regulation, or by right of
eminent domain, or by private purchase in lieu thereof, Landlord may terminate
this Lease at its option. In either of such events, the Rent shall be abated
during the unexpired portion of this Lease, effective when the physical taking
of said Premises shall have occurred.

B.   CONDEMNATION NOT RESULTING IN TERMINATION. If a portion of the Project of
which the Premises are a part should be taken or condemned for any public use
under any Regulation, or by right of eminent domain, or by private purchase in
lieu thereof, and the taking prevents or materially interferes with the
Permitted Use of the Premises, and this Lease is not terminated as provided in
Paragraph 23.A. above, the Rent payable hereunder during the unexpired portion
of the Lease shall be reduced, beginning on the date when the physical taking
shall have occurred, to such amount as may be fair and reasonable under all of
the circumstances, but only after giving Landlord credit for all sums received
or to be received by Tenant by the condemning authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph, if the temporary use or
occupancy of any part of the Premises shall be taken or appropriated under
power of eminent domain during the Term, this Lease shall be and remain
unaffected by such taking or appropriation and Tenant shall continue to pay in
full all Rent payable hereunder by Tenant during the Term; in the event of any
such temporary appropriation or taking, Tenant shall be entitled to receive
that portion of any award which represents compensation for the use of or
occupancy of the Premises during the Term, and Landlord shall be entitled to
receive that portion of any award which represents the cost of restoration of
the Premises and the use and occupancy of the Premises.

C.   AWARD. Landlord shall be entitled to (and Tenant shall assign to Landlord)
any and all payment, income, rent, award or any interest therein whatsoever
which may be paid or made in connection with such taking or conveyance and
Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord or otherwise for any sums paid by
virtue of such proceedings, whether or not attributable to the value of any
unexpired portion of this Lease, except as expressly provided in this Lease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any compensation specifically and separately
awarded Tenant for Tenant's personal property and moving costs, shall be and
remain in property of Tenant and the unamortized value of improvements to the
Premises paid for by Tenant.

D.   WAIVER OF CCP SECTION 1265.130. Each party waives the provisions of
California Civil Code Procedure Section 1265.130 allowing either party to
petition the superior court to terminate this Lease as a result of a partial
taking.

                              24. CASUALTY DAMAGE

A.   GENERAL. If the Premises or Building should be damaged or destroyed by
fire, tornado, or other casualty (collectively, "CASUALTY"), Tenant shall give
immediate written notice thereof to Landlord. Within thirty (30) days after
Landlord's receipt of such

                                       15
<PAGE>   43


notice, Landlord shall notify Tenant whether in Landlord's estimation (based
upon the certificate of a general contractor reasonably acceptable to Tenant)
material restoration of the Premises can reasonably be made within one hundred
eighty (180) days from the date of such notice and receipt of required permits
for such restoration. Landlord's determination shall be binding on Tenant.

B. WITHIN 180 DAYS. If the Premises or Building should be damaged by Casualty to
such extent that material restoration can in Landlord's estimation be reasonably
completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice and
receipt of required permits for such restoration, this Lease shall not
terminate. Provided that insurance proceeds are received by Landlord to fully
repair the damage (less the amount of any deductible), Landlord shall proceed to
rebuild and repair the Premises in the manner reasonably determined by Landlord,
except that Landlord shall not be required to rebuild, repair or replace any
part of the Alterations which may have been placed on or about the Premises by
Tenant. If the Premises are untenantable in whole or in part following such
damage, the Rent payable hereunder during the period in which they are
untenantable shall be abated proportionately.

C. GREATER THAN 180 DAYS. If the Premises or Building should be damaged by
Casualty to such extent that rebuilding or repairs cannot in Landlord's
estimation be reasonably completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after
the date of such notice and receipt of required permits for such rebuilding or
repair, then either party shall have the option, to be exercised within thirty
(30) days following receipt of Landlord's estimate, of terminating this Lease
effective upon the date of the occurrence of such damage, in which event the
Rent shall be abated during the unexpired portion of this Lease. If neither
party elects to so terminate, Landlord shall commence to rebuild or repair the
Premises diligently and in the manner reasonably determined by Landlord.
Notwithstanding the above, Landlord shall commence to rebuild, repair or replace
any part of any Alterations which may have been placed, on or about the Premises
by Tenant. If the Premises are untenantable in whole or in part following such
damage, the Rent payable hereunder during the period in which they are
untenantable shall be abated proportionately.

D. TENANT'S FAULT. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the
Premises or any other portion of the Building are damaged by Casualty resulting
from the fault, negligence, or breach of this Lease by Tenant or any of Tenant's
Parties, Base Rent and Additional Rent shall not be diminished during the repair
of such damage (to the extent Tenant is responsible for the loss and Landlord is
not being covered by any other insurance proceeds) and Tenant shall be liable to
Landlord for the cost and expense of the repair and restoration of the Building
caused thereby to the extent such cost and expense is not covered by insurance
proceeds.

E. INSURANCE PROCEEDS. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the
Premises or Building are damaged or destroyed and are not fully covered by the
insurance proceeds received by Landlord or if the holder of any indebtedness
secured by a mortgage or deed of trust covering the Premises requires, despite
Landlord's commercially reasonable effort to obtain such proceeds, that the
insurance proceeds be applied to such indebtedness, then in either case Landlord
shall have the right to terminate this Lease by delivering written notice of
termination to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the date of notice to
Landlord that said damage or destruction is not fully covered by insurance or
such requirement is made by any such holder, as the case may be, whereupon this
Lease shall terminate.

F. WAIVER. This Paragraph 24 shall be Tenant's sole and exclusive remedy in the
event of damage or destruction to the Premises or the Building. As a material
inducement to Landlord entering into this Lease, Tenant hereby waives any rights
it may have under Sections 1932, 1933(4), 1941 or 1942 of the Civil Code of
California with respect to any destruction of the Premises, Landlord's
obligation for tenantability of the Premises and Tenant's right to make repairs
and deduct the expenses of such repairs, or under any similar law, statute or
ordinance now or hereafter in effect.

G. TENANT'S PERSONAL PROPERTY. In the event of any damage or destruction of the
Premises or the Building, under no circumstances shall Landlord be required to
repair any injury or damage to, or make any repairs to or replacements of,
Tenant's personal property.

                                25. HOLDING OVER

Unless Landlord expressly consents in writing to Tenant's holding over, Tenant
shall be unlawfully and illegally in possession of the Premises, whether or not
Landlord accepts any rent from Tenant or any other person while Tenant remains
in possession of the Premises without Landlord's written consent. If Tenant
shall retain possession of the Premises or any portion thereof without
Landlord's consent following the expiration of this Lease or sooner termination
for any reason, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord for each day of such retention
two hundred percent (200%) the amount of daily rental as of the last month prior
to the date of expiration or earlier termination. Tenant shall also indemnify,
defend, protect and hold Landlord harmless from any loss, liability or cost,
including consequential and incidental damages and reasonable attorneys' fees,
incurred by Landlord resulting from delay by Tenant in surrendering the Premises
within thirty (30) days following the expiration or earlier termination of the
Term or extended Term of this Lease, including, without limitation, any claims
made by the succeeding tenant founded on such delay. Acceptance of Rent by
Landlord following expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, or following
demand by Landlord for possession of the Premises, shall not constitute a
renewal of this Lease, and nothing contained in this Paragraph 25 shall waive
Landlord's right of reentry of any other right. Additionally, if upon expiration
or earlier termination of this Lease, or following demand by Landlord for
possession of the Premises, Tenant has not fulfilled its obligation with respect
to repairs and cleanup of the Premises or any other Tenant obligations as set
forth in this Lease, then Landlord shall have the right to perform any such
obligations as it deems necessary at Tenant's sole cost and expense, and any
time required by Landlord to complete such obligations shall be considered a
period of holding over and the terms of this Paragraph 25 shall apply. The
provisions of this Paragraph 25 shall survive any expiration or earlier
termination of this Lease. If by written notice to Landlord delivered not later
than twelve (12) months prior to the Term Expiration Date, or the expiration of
the extended Term (the "Hold-Over Notice"), Tenant advises Landlord of its
intent to hold-over specifying the period of such hold-over (which period must
be for a period of no longer than six (6) months)(the "Hold-Over Term") then
Tenant may, as a matter of right, remain in possession following the Term
Expiration Date or the expiration of the extended Term, as the case may be, for
the Hold-Over Term set forth in the Hold-Over Notice; provided, that the Base
Rent for the Hold-Over Term shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the sum
of the Base Rent and other charges payable for the last month of the Term or
extended Term. In no event under the preceding sentence shall Tenant have the
right to hold-over in the Premises for more than one (1) six (6) month or
shorter period beyond the Term Expiration Date or the expiration of the extended
Term.

                                  26. DEFAULT

A. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an
event of default on the part of Tenant:

(1) ABANDONMENT.
<PAGE>   44
        2.      NONPAYMENT OF RENT. Failure to pay any installment of Rent or
        any other amount due and payable hereunder upon the date when said
        payment is due, as to which time is of the essence.

        3.      OTHER OBLIGATIONS. Failure to perform any obligation, agreement
        or covenant under this Lease other than those matters specified in
        subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this Paragraph 26.A., such failure
        continuing for twenty (20) days after written notice of such failure
        unless such default cannot reasonably be cured within such twenty (20)
        day period and Tenant shall within such period commence with due
        diligence and dispatch the curing of such default, and having so
        commenced, shall thereafter, with periodic written reports submitted to
        Landlord, prosecute or complete with due diligence and dispatch the
        curing of such default, as to which time is of the essence.

        (4)     GENERAL ASSIGNMENT. A general assignment by Tenant for the
        benefit of creditors.

        (5)     BANKRUPTCY. The filing of any voluntary petition in bankruptcy
        by Tenant, or the filing of an involuntary petition by Tenant's
        creditors, which involuntary petition remains undercharged for a period
        of thirty (30) days. If under applicable law, the trustee in bankruptcy
        or Tenant has the right to affirm this Lease and continue to perform the
        obligations of Tenant hereunder, such trustee or Tenant shall, in such
        time period as may be permitted by the bankruptcy court having
        jurisdiction, cure all defaults of Tenant hereunder outstanding as of
        the date of the affirmance of this Lease and provide to Landlord such
        adequate assurances as may be necessary to ensure Landlord of the
        continued performance of Tenant's obligations under this Lease.

        (6)     RECEIVERSHIP. The employment of a receiver to take possession of
        substantially all of Tenant's assets or the Premises, if such
        appointment remains undismissed or undischarged for a period of fifteen
        (15) days after the order therefor.

        (7)     ATTACHMENT. The attachment, execution or other judicial seizure
        of all or substantially all of Tenant's assets or Tenant's leasehold of
        the Premises, if such attachment or other seizure remains undismissed or
        undischarged for a period of fifteen (15) days after the levy thereof.

        (8)     INSOLVENCY. The admission by Tenant in writing of its inability
        to pay its debts as they become due.

B.      REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT.

        (1)     TERMINATION. In the event of the occurrence of any event of
        default, Landlord shall have the right to give a written termination
        notice to Tenant, and on the date specified in such notice, Tenant's
        right to possession shall terminate, and this Lease shall terminate
        unless on or before such date all Rent in arrears and all costs and
        expenses incurred by or on behalf of Landlord hereunder shall have been
        paid by Tenant and all other events of default of this Lease by Tenant
        at the time existing shall have been fully remedied to the satisfaction
        of Landlord. At any time after such termination, Landlord may recover
        possession of the Premises or any part thereof and expel and remove
        therefrom Tenant and any other person occupying the same, including any
        subtenant or subtenants notwithstanding Landlord's consent to any
        sublease, by any lawful means, and again repossess and enjoy the
        Premises without prejudice to any of the remedies that Landlord may have
        under this Lease, or at law or equity by any reason of Tenant's default
        or of such termination. Landlord hereby reserves the right, but shall
        not have the obligation, to recognize the continued possession of any
        subtenant. The delivery or surrender to Landlord by or on behalf of
        Tenant of keys, entry codes, or other means to bypass security at the
        Premises shall not terminate this Lease.

        (2)     CONTINUATION AFTER DEFAULT. Even though an event of default may
        have occurred, this Lease shall continue in effect for so long as
        Landlord does not terminate Tenant's right to possession under Paragraph
        26.B.(1) hereof, and Landlord may enforce all of Landlord's rights and
        remedies under this Lease and at law or in equity, including without
        limitation, the right to recover Rent as it becomes due, and Landlord,
        without terminating this Lease, may exercise all of the rights and
        remedies of a landlord under Section 1951.4 of the Civil Code of the
        State of California or any successor code section. Acts of maintenance,
        preservation or efforts to lease the Premises or the appointment of a
        receiver under application of Landlord to protect Landlord's interest
        under this Lease or other entry by Landlord upon the Premises shall not
        constitute an election to terminate Tenant's right to possession.

        (3)     INCREASED SECURITY DEPOSIT. If Tenant is in default under
        Paragraph 26.A.(2) hereof and such default remains uncured for ten (10)
        days after such occurrence or such default occurs more than three times
        in any twelve (12) month period, Landlord may require that Tenant
        increase the Security Deposit to the amount of three times the current
        month's Rent at the time of the most recent default.

C.      DAMAGES AFTER DEFAULT. Should Landlord terminate this Lease pursuant to
the provisions of Paragraph 26.B.(1) hereof, Landlord shall have the rights and
remedies of a Landlord provided by Section 1951.2 of the Civil Code of the State
of California, or any successor code sections. Upon such termination, in
addition to any other rights and remedies to which Landlord may be entitled
under applicable law or at equity, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from
Tenant: (1) the worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rent and other amounts
which has been earned at the time of termination, (2) the worth at the time of
award of the amount  by which the unpaid Rent and other amounts that would have
been earned after the date of termination until the time of award exceeds the
amount of such Rent loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided;
(3) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent and
other amounts for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the
amount of such Rent loss that the Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and
(4) any other amount and court costs necessary to compensate Landlord for all
detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform Tenant's obligations
under this Lease or which, in the ordinary course of things, would be likely to
result therefrom. The "worth at the time of award" as used in (1) and (2) above
shall be computed at the Applicable Interest Rate (defined below). The "worth at
the time of award" as used in (3) above shall be computed by discounting such
amount at the Federal Discount Rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
at the time of award plus one percent (1%).

D.      LATE CHARGE. In addition to its other remedies, Landlord shall have the
right without notice or demand to add to the amount of any payment required to
be made by Tenant hereunder, and which is not paid and received by Landlord on
or before the fifth business day of each calendar month, an amount equal to (i)
two and one-half percent (2.5%) for the first late payment during any calendar
year, and (ii) five percent (5%) for the second and subsequent late payment
during any calendar year of the delinquency for each month or portion thereof
that the delinquency remains outstanding to compensate Landlord for the loss of
the use of the amount not paid and the administrative costs caused by the
delinquency, the parties agreeing that Tenant's damage by virtue of such
delinquencies would be extremely difficult and impracticable to compute and the
amount stated herein represents a reasonably estimate thereof, provided,
however, that on one (1) occasion during any calendar year of the Term, Landlord
shall give Tenant written notice of such late payment and Tenant shall have a
period of five (5) calendar days thereafter in which to make such payment before
any late charge shall be assessed. Any waiver by Landlord of any late charges or
failure to claim the same shall not constitute a waiver of other late charges or
any other remedies available to Landlord.



                                       17



<PAGE>   45
E.        INTEREST. Interest shall accrue on all sums not paid when due
hereunder at the lesser of fourteen percent (14%) per annum or the maximum
interest rate allowed by law ("Applicable Interest Rate") from the due date
until paid.

F.        REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights, privileges and elections or remedies
of the parties are cumulative and not alternative, to the extent permitted by
law and except as otherwise provided herein.

G.        LANDLORD'S DEFAULT. Landlord shall not be in default hereunder unless
Landlord fails to perform any material obligation required of Landlord under the
terms of this Lease within a reasonable time, but in no event later than sixty
(60) days after written notice by Tenant to Landlord, subject to Paragraph 35 of
this Lease, specifying the nature of Landlord's failure to perform. If, however,
the nature of Landlord's obligation is such that more than sixty (60) days are
reasonably required for performance, then Landlord shall not be in default
hereunder if Landlord commences performance within such sixty (60) day period,
subject to Paragraph 35 of this Lease, and thereafter diligently prosecutes such
cure to completion. If Landlord at the expiration of such notice and cure
periods has failed to cure such default, then, subject to the exculpatory
provisions of this Paragraph 26, Tenant may pursue any of its legal or equitable
remedies, but Tenant shall have no right to otherwise terminate this Lease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Paragraph 26.G. shall
be deemed to expand Tenant's remedies under circumstances where particular
provisions of this Lease expressly provide for an available remedy and where
such available remedies are so set forth they shall be deemed Tenant's exclusive
remedy.

                                27.     LIENS

Tenant shall at all times keep the Premises and the Project free from liens
arising out of or related to work or services performed, materials or supplies
furnished or obligations incurred by or on behalf of Tenant or in connection
with work made, suffered or done by or on behalf of Tenant in or on the Premises
or Project. If Tenant shall not, within ten (10) days following the imposition
of any such lien, cause the same to be released of record by payment or posting
of a proper bond, Landlord shall have, in addition to all other remedies
provided herein and by law, the right, but not the obligation, to cause the same
to be released by such means as Landlord shall deem proper, including payment of
the claim giving rise to such lien. All sums paid by Landlord on behalf of
Tenant and all expenses incurred by Landlord in connection therefor shall be
payable to Landlord by Tenant on demand with interest at the Applicable Interest
Rate as Additional Rent. Landlord shall have the right at all times to post and
keep posted on the Premises any notices permitted or required by law, or which
Landlord shall deem proper, for the protection of Landlord, the Premises, the
Project and any other party having an interest therein, from mechanics' and
materialmen's liens, and Tenant shall give Landlord not less than ten (10)
business days prior written notice of the commencement of any work in the
Premises or Project which could lawfully give rise to a claim for mechanics' or
materialmen's liens to permit Landlord to post and record a timely notice of
non-responsibility, as Landlord may elect to proceed or as the law may from time
to time provide, for which purpose, if Landlord shall so determine, Landlord may
enter the Premises. Tenant shall not remove any such notice posted by Landlord
without Landlord's consent, and in any event not before completion of the work
which could lawfully give rise to a claim for mechanics' or materialmen's liens.

                              28.     SUBSTITUTION

A.





                         29.     TRANSFERS BY LANDLORD

In the event of a sale or conveyance by Landlord of the Building or a
foreclosure by any creditor of Landlord, the same shall operate to release
Landlord from any liability upon any of the covenants or conditions, express or
implied, herein contained in favor of Tenant, to the extent required to be
performed after the passing of title to Landlord's successor-in-interest. In
such event, Tenant agrees to look solely to the responsibility of the
successor-in-interest of Landlord under this Lease with respect to the
performance of the covenants and duties of "Landlord" to be performed after the
passing of title to Landlord's successor-in-interest provided such
successor-in-interest assumes in writing Landlord's duties, obligations or
liabilities hereunder. This Lease shall not be affected by any such sale and
Tenant agrees to attorn to the purchaser or assignee. Landlord's
successor(s)-in-interest shall not have liability to Tenant with respect to the
failure to perform any of the obligations of "Landlord," to the extent required
to be performed prior to the date such successor(s)-in-interest became the owner
of the Building.

            30.     RIGHT OF LANDLORD TO PERFORM TENANT'S COVENANTS

All covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant under any of the terms of
this Lease shall be performed by Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense and
without any abatement of Rent, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein.
If Tenant shall fail to pay any sum of money, other than Base Rent, required to
be paid by Tenant hereunder or shall fail to perform any other act on Tenant's
part to be performed hereunder, including Tenant's obligations under Paragraph
11 hereof, and such failure shall continue for fifteen (15) days after notice
thereof by Landlord, in addition to the other rights and remedies of Landlord,
Landlord may make any such payment and perform any such act on Tenant's part. In
the case of an emergency, no prior notification by Landlord shall be required.
Landlord may take such actions without any obligation and without releasing
Tenant from any of Tenant's obligations. All sums so paid by Landlord and all
incidental costs incurred by Landlord and interest thereon at the Applicable
Interest Rate, from the date of payment by Landlord, shall be paid to Landlord
on demand as Additional Rent.

                                 31.     WAIVER

If either Landlord or Tenant waives the performance of any term, covenant or
condition contained in this Lease, such waiver shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term, covenant or
condition contained herein, or constitute a course of dealing contrary to the
expressed terms of this Lease. The acceptance of Rent by Landlord shall not
constitute a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any term, covenant or
condition of this Lease, regardless of Landlord's knowledge of such preceding
breach at the time Landlord accepted such Rent. Failure by Landlord to enforce
any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease for any length of time
shall not be deemed to waive or decrease the right of Landlord to insist
thereafter upon strict performance by Tenant. Waiver by Landlord of any term,
covenant or condition contained in this Lease may only be made by a written
document signed by Landlord, based upon full knowledge of the circumstances.


                                       18
<PAGE>   46
                                  32. NOTICES

Each provision of this Lease or of any applicable governmental laws, ordinances,
regulations and other requirements with reference to sending, mailing, or
delivery of any notice or the making of any payment by Landlord or Tenant to the
other shall be deemed to be complied with when and if the following steps are
taken:

A.  RENT.  All Rent and other payments required to be made by Tenant to Landlord
hereunder shall be payable to Landlord at Landlord's Remittance Address set
forth in the Basic Lease Information, or at such other address as Landlord may
specify from time to time by written notice delivered in accordance herewith.
Tenant's obligation to pay Rent and any other amounts to Landlord under the
terms of this Lease shall not be deemed satisfied until such Rent and other
amounts have been actually received by Landlord.

B.  OTHER.  All notices, demands, consents and approvals which may or are
required to be given by either party to the other hereunder shall be in writing
and either personally delivered, sent by commercial overnight courier, mailed,
certified or registered, postage prepaid or sent by facsimile with confirmed
receipt (and with an original sent by commercial overnight courier), and in each
case addressed to the party to be notified at the Notice Address for such party
as specified in the Basic Lease Information or to such other place as the party
to be notified may from time to time designate by at least fifteen (15) days
notice to the notifying party. Notices shall be deemed served upon receipt or
refusal to accept delivery.

C.  REQUIRED NOTICES.  Tenant shall immediately notify Landlord in writing of
any notice of a violation or a potential or alleged violation of any Regulation
that relates to the Premises or the Project, or of any inquiry, investigation,
enforcement or other action that is instituted or threatened by any governmental
or regulatory agency against Tenant or any other occupant of the Premises, or
any claim that is instituted or threatened by any third party that relates to
the Premises or the Project.

                              33. ATTORNEYS' FEES

If Landlord places the enforcement of this Lease, or any part thereof, or the
collection of any Rent due, or to become due hereunder, or recovery of
possession of the Premises in the hands of an attorney, Tenant shall pay to
Landlord, upon demand, Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs,
whether incurred at trial, appeal or review. In any action which Landlord or
Tenant brings to enforce its respective rights hereunder, the unsuccessful party
shall pay all costs incurred by the prevailing party including reasonable
attorneys' fees, to be fixed by the court, and said costs and attorneys' fees
shall be a part of the judgment in said action.

                           34. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

This Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Landlord, its
successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
Tenant, its successors, and to the extent assignment is approved by Landlord as
provided hereunder, Tenant's assigns.

                               35.  FORCE MAJEURE

If performance by a party of any portion of this Lease is made impossible by any
prevention, delay, or stoppage caused by strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, acts
of God, inability to obtain services, labor, or materials or reasonable
substitutes for those items, government actions, civil commotions, fire or other
casualty, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the party obligated
to perform, performance by that party for a period equal to the period of that
prevention, delay, or stoppage is excused. Tenant's obligation to pay Rent,
however, is not excused by this Paragraph 35.

                           36. SURRENDER OF PREMISES

Tenant shall, upon expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, surrender the
Premises to Landlord in the same condition as existed on the date Tenant
originally took possession thereof (reasonable wear and tear, casualty damage
and acts of God excepted), including, but not limited to, all holes in walls
repaired, all HVAC equipment in operating order and in good repair, and all
floors cleaned, waxed, and free of any Tenant-introduced marking or painting,
all to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord. Tenant shall remove all of its
debris from the Project. At or before the time of surrender, Tenant shall comply
with the terms of Paragraph 12.A. hereof with respect to Alterations to the
Premises and all other matters addressed in such Paragraph. If the Premises are
not so surrendered at the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, the
provisions of Paragraph 25 hereof shall apply. All keys to the Premises or any
part thereof shall be surrendered to Landlord upon expiration or sooner
termination of the Term. Tenant shall meet with Landlord for a joint inspection
of the Premises fifteen (15) days prior to vacating, but nothing contained
herein shall be construed as an extension of the Term or as a consent by
Landlord to any holding over by Tenant. In the event of Tenant's failure to give
such notice or participate in such joint inspection, Landlord's inspection at or
after Tenant's vacating the Premises shall conclusively be deemed correct for
purposes of determining Tenant's responsibility for repairs and restoration. Any
delay caused by Tenant's failure to carry out its obligations under this
Paragraph 36 beyond the term hereof, shall constitute unlawful and illegal
possession of Premises under Paragraph 25 hereof.

                               37. MISCELLANEOUS

A.  GENERAL.  The term "Tenant" or any pronoun used in place thereof shall
indicate and include the masculine or feminine, the singular or plural number,
individuals, firms or corporations, and their respective successors, executors,
administrators and permitted assigns, according to the context hereof.

B.  TIME.  Time is of the essence regarding this Lease and all of its
provisions.

representations made by the Landlord or understandings made between the parties
other than those set forth in this Lease and its Exhibits, addenda and
attachments and the Basic Lease Information.

E.  MODIFICATION. This Lease may not be modified except by a written instrument

for all purposes under this Lease, and acknowledges and agrees that no other
definition of the area (rentable, usable or otherwise) of the Premises shall
apply. Tenant shall in no event be entitled to a recalculation of the square
footage of the Premises, rentable, usable or otherwise, and no recalculation, if
made,

                                       19

irrespective of its purpose, shall reduce Tenant's obligations under this Lease
in any manner, including without limitation the amount of Base Rent payable by
Tenant or Tenant's Proportionate Share of the Building and of the Project.

F.   SEVERABILITY. If, for any reason whatsoever, any of the provisions hereof
shall be unenforceable or ineffective, all of the other provisions shall be and
remain in full force and effect.

short form memorandum hereof, provided that Tenant agrees upon the expiration or
earlier termination of this Lease to execute and deliver to Landlord a quitclaim
deed terminating said short form memorandum.

H.   EXAMINATION OF LEASE. Submission of this Lease to Tenant does not
constitute an option or offer to lease and this Lease is not effective otherwise
until execution and delivery by both Landlord and Tenant.

I.   ACCORD AND SATISFACTION. No payment by Tenant of a lesser amount than the
total Rent due nor any endorsement on any check or letter accompanying any check
or payment of Rent shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction of full payment of
Rent, and Landlord may accept such payment without prejudice to Landlord's right
to recover the balance of such Rent or to pursue other remedies. All offers by
or on behalf of Tenant of accord and satisfaction are hereby rejected in
advance.

J.   EASEMENTS. Landlord may grant easements on the Project and dedicate for
public use portions of the Project without Tenant's consent; provided that no
such grant or dedication shall materially interfere with Tenant's Permitted Use
of the Premises. Upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver to Landlord documents, instruments, maps and plats reasonably necessary
to effectuate Tenant's covenants hereunder.

K.   DRAFTING AND DETERMINATION PRESUMPTION. The parties acknowledge that this
Lease has been agreed to by both the parties, that both Landlord and Tenant have
consulted with attorneys with respect to the terms of this Lease and that no
presumption shall be created against Landlord because Landlord drafted this
Lease. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Lease, with respect to
any consent, determination or estimation of Landlord required or allowed in this
Lease or requested of Landlord, Landlord's consent, determination or estimation
shall be given or made solely by Landlord in Landlord's good faith and
reasonable opinion.

L.   EXHIBITS. The Basic Lease Information, and the Exhibits, addenda and

Tenant and nothing herein is intended to create any third party benefit.

O.   QUIET ENJOYMENT. Upon payment by Tenant of the Rent, and upon the
observance and performance of all of the other covenants, terms and conditions
on Tenant's part to be observed and performed, Tenant shall peaceably and
quietly hold and enjoy the Premises for the term hereby demised without
hindrance or interruption by Landlord or any other person or persons lawfully or
equitably claiming by, through or under Landlord, subject, nevertheless, to all
of the other terms and conditions of this Lease. Landlord shall not be liable
for any hindrance, interruption, interference or disturbance by other tenants or
third persons, nor shall Tenant be released from any obligations under this
Lease because of such hindrance, interruption, interference or disturbance.

P.   COUNTERPARTS. This Lease may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original.

Q.   MULTIPLE PARTIES. If more than one person or entity is named herein as
Tenant, such multiple parties shall have joint and several responsibility to
comply with the terms of this Lease.

R.   PRORATIONS. Any Rent or other amounts payable to Landlord by Tenant
hereunder for any fractional month shall be prorated based on a month of 30
days. As used herein, the term "fiscal year" shall mean the calendar year or
such other fiscal year as Landlord may deem appropriate.

S.   OPERATING POLICIES. During the Term of this Lease, Landlord shall operate
and maintain the Building in a manner generally consistent with other comparable
first-class business park projects in San Diego County.

T.   LANDLORD'S COVENANT. In connection with the exercise by Landlord of the
rights and reservations granted or afforded by this Lease, Landlord hereby
covenants and agrees to:

     (1)  use its reasonable good faith efforts to avoid taking any actions
          (excepting any actions to comply with Regulations) which may
          materially adversely affect Tenant's use of or normal business
          operations within the Premises;

     (2)  use its reasonable good faith efforts to provide Tenant with prior
          written notice of any such actions by Landlord (excepting any actions
          to comply with Regulations) which may materially adversely affect
          Tenant's use of or normal business operations within the Premises and
          at least forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice of any scheduled
          work to be performed by Landlord which may materially adversely
          interfere with Tenant's normal business operations; it being
          understood, however, that the giving of such prior written notice may
          be impossible or impractical under emergency circumstances;

     (3)  in a manner consistent with the prudent and efficient operation of the
          Project, to reasonably coordinate and reasonably cooperate with Tenant
          to reasonably minimize any cessation or degradation of Tenant's use of
          or normal business operations within the Premises; and

     (4)  use its reasonable good faith efforts to perform all work in an
          expeditious and workmanlike manner and to restore access to the
          Premises and the availability of Building services as soon as
          reasonably practicable.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Paragraph 37.T. to the contrary, in
no event shall Landlord be liable or responsible for any consequential or
exemplary damages.

U.   CONSENT/DUTY TO ACT REASONABLY. Except for the provisions of this Lease
which expressly grant a party the right to act in its sole discretion, whereupon
in each such case, Landlord's and Tenant's duty is to act in good faith (but
shall not otherwise be subject to a

                                       20
<PAGE>   48
"reasonableness" standard) (i) any time the consent of Landlord or Tenant is
required, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, and (ii) whenever this Lease grants Landlord or Tenant the right
to take action, exercise discretion, establish rules and regulations or make
allocations or other determinations, Landlord and Tenant shall act reasonably
and in good faith and take no action which might result in the frustration of
the other party's reasonable expectations concerning the benefits to be enjoyed
under this Lease.

V.   YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE. Landlord hereby represents, warrants and covenants
to the best of its knowledge to Tenant that all of the Project's mechanical,
electrical, elevator, fire and life safety systems (the "Building Systems")
will operate on and after January 1, 2000 without normal operations being
impaired by dates in and after the year 2000. At Tenant's request, Landlord
shall provide Tenant with reasonably satisfactory evidence of the Building
Systems' compliance with the foregoing.

                           38.  ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

A.   BASE RENT. The monthly Base Rent during the initial Term shall be as
follows:

B.   RENEWAL OPTION. Provided Tenant is not, and has not been, in material
default of any of its obligations under this Lease or any other lease Tenant may
have in the Project, after expiration of all applicable grace, notice and cure
periods, it shall have an option to renew this Lease for the Premises in "as is"
condition for two (2) five (5) year periods on the same terms and conditions as
set forth in this Lease except that the Base Rent of each option period shall be
the then prevailing fair market rental rate for comparable space of at least one
hundred thousand (100,000) square feet at comparable buildings within the
Eastgate Technology Park and University Towne Centre areas, as defined and
determined by Subparagraph 38B.(1) and/or 38B.(2) below. In no event will the
Base Rent for each option period be less than that of the previous period.
Tenant shall give Landlord written notice to exercise option no earlier than
eighteen (18) months but not less than fifteen (15) months prior to the
expiration of the Term, or extended Term.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, Tenant's right
to extend the Term by exercise of the foregoing option shall be conditioned
upon the following: (a) at the time of the exercise of the option, and at the
time of the commencement of the extended Term, Tenant shall be in possession of
and occupying at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Premises and at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of all other premises under any other lease Tenant
may have in the Project, for the conduct of its business therein and the same
shall not be occupied by any assignee, subtenant, or licensee; and (b) the
notice of exercise shall constitute a representation, by commencement of the
extended Term, that Tenant does not intend to seek to assign or sublet more
than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Premises, or assign or sublet more than
twenty-five percent (25%) of any other premises under any other leases Tenant
may have in the Project.

(1)  "Fair Market Rental" shall mean the rate being charged to tenants recently
renewing existing leases for comparable space in buildings within the Eastgate
Technology Park and University Towne Centre areas, taking into consideration all
relevant factors, including but not limited to, the following: size, location,
floor level, proposed term of the lease, expense stops, extent of building
services to be provided, and the time the rental rate under consideration is to
become effective. Fair Market Rental as of the commencement of each option
period shall be determined by Landlord with written notice (the "Notice") given
to Tenant not later than thirty (30) days after the receipt of the option
notice, subject to Tenant's right to arbitration as provided in Subparagraph
38.B(2) below. Failure on the part of Tenant to demand arbitration within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Notice from Landlord shall bind Tenant to the
Fair Market Rental as determined by Landlord. Notwithstanding anything to
contrary herein, Tenant's right to arbitrate shall conclude no later than ninety
(90) days after the date of the Notice.

(2)  If Tenant disputes the amount claimed by Landlord as Fair Market Rental,
Tenant may require that Landlord submit the dispute to arbitration. The
arbitration shall be conducted and determined in San Diego, California, in
accordance with the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration
Association or its successor for arbitration of commercial disputes, except
that the procedures mandated by such rules shall be modified as follows:

(a)  Tenant shall make demand for arbitration in writing within thirty (30)
days after service of the Notice, specifying therein the name and address of
the person to act as the arbitrator on Tenant's behalf. The arbitrator shall be
M.A.I. designated and independent real estate appraiser with at least ten (10)
years full-time commercial appraisal experience who is familiar with the Fair
Market Rental of first-class business park space in San Diego County. (In the
event M.A.I. appraisers are no longer available, a comparable designation with
at least ten (10) years experience with commercial property appraisal in San
Diego County will be acceptable.) Failure on the part of Tenant to make the
timely and proper demand for such arbitration shall constitute a waiver of the
right thereto. Within ten (10) business days after the service of the demand
for arbitration, Landlord shall give notice to Tenant specifying the name and
address of the person designated by Landlord to act as arbitrator on its
behalf, which arbitrator shall be

                                       21

<PAGE>   49


     similarly qualified. If Landlord fails to notify Tenant of the appointment
     of its arbitrator, within or by the time specified, then the arbitrator
     appointed by Tenant shall be the arbitrator to determine the Fair Market
     Rental for the Premises.

     (b)  If two arbitrators are chosen pursuant to Subparagraph 38.B.(2)(a)
     above, the arbitrators so chosen shall meet within ten (10) business days
     after the second arbitrator is appointed and shall appoint a third
     arbitrator, who shall be a competent and impartial person with
     qualifications similar to those required of the first two arbitrators
     pursuant to Subparagraph 38.B(2)(a) above. If they are unable to agree
     upon such appointment within five (5) business days after expiration of
     such ten (10) day period, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the
     parties themselves. If the parties do not agree on the third arbitrator
     within five (5) business days after expiration of the foregoing five (5)
     business day period, then either party, on behalf of both, may request
     appointment of such a qualified arbitrator by (i) the majority of board
     members of the San Diego County Chapter of M.A.I. appraisers, or (ii) the
     chief arbitrator of the San Diego County Chapter of the American
     Arbitration Association. The three arbitrators shall decide the dispute,
     if it has not been previously resolved, by following the procedures set
     forth in Subparagraph 38.B(2)(c) below. Each party shall pay the fees and
     expenses of its respective arbitrator and both shall share the fees and
     expenses of the third arbitrator. Attorney's fees and expenses of counsel
     and of witnesses or other experts for the respective parties shall be paid
     by the respective party engaging such counsel or calling such witnesses or
     other experts.

     (c)  The Fair Market Rental shall be fixed by the three arbitrators in
     accordance with the following procedures. Each of the arbitrators
     selected by the parties shall state in writing, his or her determination
     of the Fair Market Rental supported by the reasons therefor and shall make
     counterpart copies for each of the other arbitrators. The arbitrators
     shall arrange for a simultaneous exchange of such proposed resolutions
     within ten (10) business days after appointment of the third arbitrator.
     If either arbitrator fails to deliver to the other arbitrators his or her
     determination within such ten (10) business day period, then the
     determination of the other arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the
     parties. The role of the third arbitrator shall be to select which of the
     two proposed resolutions most closely approximates his or her
     determination of Fair Market Rental. The third arbitrator shall have no
     right to propose a middle ground or any modification of either of the two
     proposed resolutions. The resolution he or she chooses as the most closely
     approximating his or her determination of the Fair Market Rental shall
     constitute the decision of the arbitrators and shall be final and binding
     upon the parties. If either party fails to pay it share of the fees of the
     third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice, or
     fails to execute and deliver any documents reasonably required by the
     third arbitrator within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, then the
     Fair Market Rental shall be determined solely by the arbitrator selected
     by the other party.

     (d)  In the event of a failure, refusal or inability of any arbitrator to
     act, his or her successor shall be appointed by him or her, but in the
     case of the third arbitrator, his or her successor shall be appointed in
     the same manner as that set forth herein with respect to the appointment
     of the original third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to decide
     the issue within ten (10) business days after the appointment of the third
     arbitrator. Any decision in which the arbitrator appointed by Landlord and
     the arbitrator appointed by Tenant concur shall be binding and conclusive
     upon the parties, except that such arbitrators shall not attempt by
     themselves to mutually ascertain the Fair Market Rental and any such
     determination, in a manner other than that provided for in Subparagraph
     38.B(2)(c) hereof, shall not be binding on the parties.

C.   ALTERNATIVE TERM EXPIRATION DATE.  Subject to a certain lease dated
     September 2, 1998 for approximately 150,000 square feet within Phase B of
     the Project which adjoins the Premises ("Phase B Premises") and Tenant
     taking full occupancy and commencing the payment of Rent, Tenant shall
     have the right to alter the Term Expiration Date upon written notice to
     Landlord no earlier than twenty-four (24) months and not less than
     eighteen (18) months prior to the scheduled Term Expiration Date. This
     alteration of the Premises' Term Expiration Date shall consist of
     exchanging the term expiration date of the Phase B Premises with the Term
     Expiration Date for the Premises. In this event, monthly Base Rent for the
     period beyond the scheduled Term Expiration Date and through the new Term
     Expiration Date, as modified by the immediately preceding sentence, shall
     be the then prevailing fair market rental rate for comparable space of at
     least one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet at comparable buildings
     within the Eastgate Technology Park and University Towne Centre areas as
     reasonably determined by Landlord. In no event will the Base Rent be less
     than that of the previous period. Landlord shall submit to Tenant the then
     prevailing market rate by a written notice given to Tenant not later than
     thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Tenant's notice to alter the
     Term Expiration Date. Tenant shall have fifteen (15) days to accept said
     rental rate or Tenant's right to alter the Term Expiration Date hereunder
     shall terminate.

D.   PREPAID RENT.  Upon execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay the first
     and second month's Base Rent for the entire Premises, totaling Three
     Hundred Seventy-one Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty Dollars $371,760.00
     ("Pre-paid Rent"). Landlord shall apply the Pre-paid Rent to the Base Rent
     for the Premises as they become due during the initial months of the Term.

E.   FIRST RIGHT OF OFFER TO LEASE.  Tenant is granted a first right of offer
     to lease Building 2 of Phase A of the Project located at 4790 Eastgate
     Mall, which is approximately sixty thousand nine hundred 60,900 rentable
     square feet, ("Building 2") when it comes available (termination of the
     Building 2 tenant's lease obligation, right and interest to Building 2) at
     the end of the initial term of such lease, or at the end of any option
     period for Building 2, if the existing tenant thereof elects to extend the
     term of such lease, on the following terms: Before Landlord enters into a
     lease for Building 2, and provided Tenant is not then in default under
     this Lease, or any other lease Tenant may have in the Project, after any
     applicable grace, notice and cure periods, and has not been in material
     default of any terms or conditions of this Lease, or any other lease
     Tenant may have in the Project, and provided Tenant has not assigned or
     sublet more than twenty-five percent (25%) of its Premises, or any other
     premises under any other leases Tenant may have in the Project. Landlord
     will so notify Tenant in writing and propose a rent and other lease terms
     and conditions ("Landlord's Notice"). Tenant shall have five (5) days
     after notification to notify Landlord in writing of its intent to pursue
     negotiations. Thereafter, Landlord and Tenant shall negotiate in good
     faith in an attempt to reach an agreement on the terms of the lease for
     Building 2. If Tenant exercises this first right of offer in the manner
     prescribed, Tenant shall immediately deliver to Landlord payment for the
     first month's rent for Building 2 (in the same manner as provided for in
     this Lease), and the lease for Building 2 will be consummated without
     delay in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Landlord's
     Notice. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree in writing within ten
     (10) days after Landlord's notice to Tenant, Landlord may lease Building 2
     to another tenant. Thereafter, Tenant's first right of offer to lease
     Building 2 shall terminate, and Landlord shall be relieved from any
     further obligations to lease Building 2 to Tenant.

F.   TERMINATION RIGHTS.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
     this Lease, if Tenant is notified by Landlord, or Tenant becomes aware and
     notifies Landlord of the occurrence of a Trigger Event (defined below), and
     such Trigger Event materially adversely affects the operation of Tenant's
     normal business in, use of, prevents Tenant's reasonable access to the
     Premises, and such Trigger Event continues for such a time greater than
     twelve (12) months (the "Maximum Restoration Period"), then Tenant may
     elect to exercise an ongoing right to terminate this Lease, upon thirty
     (30) days' prior written notice sent to Landlord within a period of sixty
     (60) days following the later of the occurrence of the Trigger Event or
     Tenant's receipt (or giving) of notice thereof (such notice, in the case
     of a Trigger Event described in subparagraphs (1) and (2) below, to
     contain a reasonably detailed description of the scope of the Trigger
     Event). Notwithstanding the forgoing, Tenant shall not have a right to so
     terminate this Lease if Landlord takes action within said sixty (60) day
     period (but no later than the expiration of the thirty (30) day period)
     which will result in the restoration of the Tenant's normal

                                       22
<PAGE>   50
business operations in, Tenant's reasonable access to, and Tenant's use of the
Premises in a condition suitable for the efficient conduct of Tenant's normal
business (including, without limitation, utilities required or necessary for
the operation of Tenant's normal business in the Premises) prior to the end of
the Maximum Restoration Period.

As used herein, the term "TRIGGER EVENT" shall mean and refer to:

          (1)  continuous interruption of electrical, water, telecommunication,
     telephone, gas, sewer or other essential utility services used or required
     in connection with Tenant's occupancy of the Premises or interruption of
     Tenant's access to the Premises;

          (2)  discovery of Hazardous Materials or any other material
     environmental condition in, on or around the land, Building, Project,
     common areas or Premises, which, taking into account applicable
     environmental laws, either is unlawful or represents a significant health
     risk to occupants of the Premises, excepting those Hazardous Materials
     either:

          (a)  used by Tenant's contractor in the construction of Alterations
               in the Premises; or

          (b)  generated by Tenant or brought onto or into the Project,
               Building, Premises or common areas, by Tenant as more
               particularly described in Paragraph 4.D. of this Lease.


G.   ROOFTOP COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. During the Term of this Lease (and any
renewal or extensions thereof), Tenant shall have the right, without payment of
any fee or charge therefor, to install and operate, for Tenant's personal use
only, one (1) microwave transmitter-receiver or satellite dish (the "Satellite
Dish") on one Building rooftop (the "Designated Building") of a weight, height,
and width reasonably acceptable to Landlord. Landlord shall not withhold consent
to the installation of a Satellite Dish reasonably comparable to those
installed within the Project. Tenant's rights pursuant to this Paragraph 38.G
are subject to the following:

     (1)  All costs for the installation of the Satellite Dish including, but
     not limited to, electrical equipment and connections, mounting fixtures,
     engineering studies, inspections, permits, etc. will be at the Tenant's
     sole cost, expense and responsibility.

     (2)  Prior to installing the Satellite Dish, Tenant must notify Landlord
     in writing, specifying the type, character, size, location, amount of
     space required, installation details and electrical requirements. Landlord
     in its reasonable discretion shall approve of said specifications of the
     Satellite Dish within ten (10) days following receipt of Tenant's written
     request to install a  Satellite Dish on the roof of the Designated
     Building.

     (3)  Tenant shall pay any federal, state and local taxes applicable to the
     installation and use of the Satellite Dish and Tenant shall procure,

1. Proposed buildings will be noise attenuated to the level shown on the matrix
   based on an acoustical study submitted along with building plans.

2. In the case of discretionary actions, such as approval of subdivisions,
   zoning changes, or conditional use permits, an aviation easement for noise
   shall be required to be recorded with the County Recorder as a condition of
   approval of the project. A copy shall also be filed with the affected airport
   operator. For all property transactions, appropriate legal notice shall be
   given to all purchasers, lessees and renters of property in "conditionally
   compatible" areas which clearly describes the potential for impacts from
   airplane noise associated with airport operations. Notice will also be
   provided as required on the State Real Estate Disclosure form.

Identified uses proposed in noisier areas than the level indicated on the matrix
are considered "incompatible."

The directives below relate to the specific "conditionally compatible" land use
categories identified by number on the matrix.

3. New schools, preschools and libraries located within the CNEL 60-65 contours
   must be subjected to an acoustical study to assure that interior levels will
   not exceed CNEL 45.

4. New residential and related uses located within the CNEL 60-65 contours must
   be subjected to an acoustical study to assure that the interior levels will
   not exceed CNEL 45. Appropriate legal notice shall be provided to purchasers,
   lessees, and renters of properties in this conditionally compatible zone in
   the manner previously described.

   "Residential hotels" are defined as those that have 75% or more of
   accommodations occupied by permanent guests (staying more than 30 days) or
   those hotels which have at least 50 percent of their accommodations
   containing kitchens.

5. Transient Lodging is defined as hotels and motels, membership lodgings (Y's
   etc.), suite or apartment hotels, hotels, or other temporary residence units,
   not defined as residential hotels, above. Within the CNEL 60-70 contours,
   buildings must be subjected to an acoustical study to assure that interior
   levels do not exceed CNEL 45. Appropriate legal notice shall be provided to
   purchasers, lessees, and renters of properties in this conditionally
   compatible zone in the manner previously described.

6. Office buildings include many types of office and service uses: business and
   business services, finance, insurance, real estate; personal services;
   professional (medical, legal and educational); and government, research and
   development and others. Within the CNEL 65-70 contours, buildings must be
   subjected to an acoustical study to assure that interior levels do not exceed
   CNEL 50. Appropriate legal notice shall be provided to purchasers, lessees,
   and renters of properties in this conditionally compatible zone in the manner
   previously described.

8. For new commercial retail uses located within the CNEL 65-75 contours,
   buildings must be subjected to an acoustical study to assure that interior
   levels do not exceed CNEL 50. Appropriate legal notice shall be provided to
   purchasers, lessees, and renters of properties in this conditionally
   compatible zone in the manner previously described.

What is the CLUP?

The Naval Air Station (NAS) Miramar Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP)
represents Navy and community recommendations for achieving compatible
development near the air station. The CLUP was prepared by the San Diego
Association of Governments (SANDAG) under authority of Article 3.5 of the
California Public Utilities Code. The CLUP also incorporates recommendations of
the Navy's Air Installation Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) program, part of a
nation-wide planning effort by the Department of Defense to look at accident
potential and noise impacts around each military air installation in the United
States. The goals of the CLUP are to:

   o Protect NAS Miramar from incompatible land uses;

   o Provide criteria for the orderly growth of the area surrounding the air
     station;

   o Safeguard the general welfare of those inhabitants within the vicinity of
     the air station by protecting them from the adverse effects of aircraft
     noise and accident potential; and

   o Ensure that no obstructions or other hazards affect navigable airspace.

Why is there a Problem?

Many military and civilian airfields were originally constructed in the open
countryside. Over the years pressures to house a growing population meant people
tended to move onto land near airfields. This nearby land normally has
established access routes, and in many cases offers the advantages of living or
working close to a major employment base. Meanwhile the level of air traffic has
increased. These counteracting trends can cause problems for the air facility as
well as local residents. Specifically, problems arise when use of the land is
not controlled for compatibility with air operations.

Although noise impact areas no longer grow at rates experienced in the 1970's
(and have actually decreased at NAS Miramar), the land near all airfields will
continue to have high noise levels and potential for aircraft accidents. Land
near airfields is suitable for certain types of development, such as agriculture
or industrial uses, but may not be suitable for other types of development. Land
near NAS Miramar consists of a mix of residential, commercial and industrial
uses. For the most part, these developments are considered compatible with the
current land use plan.

Community Participation

Land use compatibility is a shared concern of the Navy, the public, and the
local government agencies who have planning and zoning authority. The decision
makers for the local government have the key responsibility for taking actions
that preserve land use compatibility. The cooperative action of all parties
helps to resolve land use compatibility problems.

Navy Role in the Economy

More than 11,000 military and 2,500 civilian personnel work at NAS Miramar.
Nearly 2,500 bachelor and 615 married military personnel (with 1,000 dependents)
live at the air facility. An additional 1,800 military, with 5,500 dependents
live in military housing off station with the rest living in the surrounding
communities. All totalled -- military, civilians and dependents -- NAS Miramar
has an extended family of nearly 30,000.

NAS Miramar is part of the naval complex in San Diego County. Over 175,000
Department of Defense personnel work in San Diego with a total economic impact
to the community of $9.5 billion annually. NAS Miramar accounts for over $700
million of this total. Overall, one in five dollars in the San Diego economy is
a Navy dollar.

Installation Mission

NAS Miramar is the home of the jet fighter and early warning aircraft of the
Pacific Fleet. The mission of the station is to maintain and operate facilities
and provide services and materials to support operations of aviation activities
and units of the operating forces of the Navy.

What is NAS Miramar doing?

The people stationed at NAS Miramar are aware of their responsibility to
minimize noise levels and hazards for the residents of nearby communities. Since
1974, noise complaints at NAS Miramar have decreased from a high of over 2,000
to 210 in 1991. This decrease resulted from the installation of hush houses to
suppress ground engine runups, noise abatement procedures, and changes in
aircraft mix.

CLUP COMPOSITE MAP
CLUP AREA

The NAS Miramar CLUP Composite Map shows a combination of noise and Accident
Potential Zones (APZs). The noise descriptor used in this study is CNEL, which
stands for Community Noise Equivalent Level. CNEL is the weighted average sound
level for a 24-hour day. It is calculated by weighing evening and night
operations five and ten times more than day operations, respectively, to adjust
for the increased irritation caused by noise during evening and night hours. The
depicted noise footprint ranges from 60 dB CNEL to 75 dB CNEL. The Accident
Potential Zones represent areas that are overflown by aircraft and, therefore,
more susceptible to accidents. The three APZs are APZ II, APZ I, and the Clear
Zone; each progressively closer to the runway and potentially of more concern.
The Land Use Compatibility Guidelines for noise and APZs promote compatible
development near the air station. The guidelines recommend restricting noise
sensitive development in the high noise zones, and restricting population
density within the APZs. Zones of highest noise and accident potential have the
smallest range of compatible land uses.

HEIGHTS AND OBSTRUCTIONS

In addition to noise and APZ considerations, height restrictions are necessary
to insure that no object will interfere with safe operation of aircraft or deny
operational capability of the air station. Any development proposal that
includes an object over 200 feet above ground level (AGL) or which penetrates
the 100:1 slope extending 20,000 feet from the nearest point of the nearest
runway must be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for an
obstruction evaluation. SANDAG and NAS Miramar must also be notified of these
proposals by the applicant. The following should also be examined for
compatibility:

          * Uses that release into the air any substance that would impair
            visibility or otherwise interfere with the operation of aircraft
            (e.g., dust, smoke, or steam).

          * Uses which emit or reflect light that would interfere with aircrew
            vision.

          * Uses that produce emissions which would interfere with aircraft
            communications systems, navigation systems or other electrical
            systems.

          * Uses which attract birds, such as (but not limited to) sanitary
            landfills, maintenance of feed stations, growing certain types of
            vegetation, etc.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.   Signs shall be designed in a manner that is compatible with and
     complementary to the overall project and adjacent facades.

2.   Only those sign types provided for in the Sign Criteria & Guidelines
     and/or specifically approved in writing by the Owner will be allowed.

3.   Signage that incorporates logos, business identity, and/or images denoting
     the type of business shall be encouraged. Logo design and colors to be
     approved by the Owner.

4.   Logo, letter heights and sign square footages, where specified, shall be
     determined by measuring the normal capital letter of type exclusive of
     typographic swashes, ascenders, descenders or exaggerated initial capitals.

     For purposes of calculating copy area, wall signage shall be considered to
     be composed of two elements:

           A.  Lettering and Logos

               Includes the letters and characters that form the sign copy,
               exclusive of any figures, symbols and decorative elements. Where
               extended spacing between letters is used, copy area may be
               measured by calculating the area of each individual letter
               exclusive of space between letters.

               Logos and/or images that are in use on similar buildings
               operated by the tenant in California may be used, provided that
               said images are architecturally compatible and approved by the
               Owner and shall be counted in overall allowable square footage
               for tenant signs.

     Where lettering and logos are placed on architectural background, the
     height of the lettering and logos shall not exceed 80% of the height of the
     architectural background. Logo height may be greater than letter height but
     shall conform to sign are guidelines.

     Maximum copy areas shall be calculated exclusive of display surfaces,
     backings, architectural elements, and mounting devices.

5.   Notwithstanding the maximum square footages specified for copy area
     allowances, signs and typography in all cases shall appear balanced and in
     scale within the context of the sign spaces - monuments and building walls
     - as a whole. Thickness, height, and color of sign lettering shall be
     visually balanced and in proportion to other signs on the building.

6.   Wall signs shall be affixed without visible means of attachment, unless
     attachments make an intentional statement. Wall signs need not be attached
     directly to the lease space to which they refer.

7.   Ground signs or monument signs may be located within landscaped zones
     between property lines and building setback lines, allowing for adequate
     site-lines for approaching vehicular traffic at street intersections and
     project entries, but may not be located in the public right-of-way.

8.   All sign fabrication work shall be of excellent quality. All logo images
     and typestyles shall be accurately reproduced. Lettering that approximates
     typestyles shall not be acceptable. The Owner reserves the right to reject
     any fabrication work deemed to below standard.

9.   Sign contractor shall be approved in writing by Owner. Contractor shall be
     licensed and carry insurance in accordance with Owner's requirements.

<PAGE>   80


         5.4 All work to be performed on the Sublease Premises by Subtenant or
Subtenant's contractor or agents shall be subject to the following conditions:

                           (a) Such work shall proceed upon Landlord's written
                  approval of Subtenant's contractor, and public liability and
                  property damage insurance carried by Subtenant's contractor,
                  and shall further be subject to the provisions of Paragraphs
                  12 and 27 of the Master Lease.

                           (b) All work shall be done in conformity with a valid
                  building permit when required, a copy of which shall be
                  furnished to Sublandlord and Landlord before such work is
                  commenced, and in any case, all such work shall be performed
                  in a good and workmanlike and first-class manner, and in
                  accordance with all applicable Regulations and the
                  requirements and standards of any insurance underwriting
                  board, inspection bureau or insurance carrier insuring the
                  Sublease Premises pursuant to the Sublease. Notwithstanding
                  any failure by Sublandlord or Landlord to object to any such
                  work, neither Sublandlord nor Landlord shall have any
                  responsibility for Subtenant's failure to comply with all
                  applicable Regulations. Subtenant shall be responsible for
                  ensuring that construction and installation of the Tenant
                  Improvements will not affect the structural integrity of the
                  Building.

                           (c) Landlord or Landlord's agents shall have the
                  right to inspect the construction of the Tenant Improvements
                  by Subtenant during the progress thereof. If Landlord shall
                  give notice of faulty construction or any other deviation from
                  the approved Space Plan or Plans, Subtenant shall cause its
                  contractor to make corrections promptly. However, neither the
                  privilege herein granted to Landlord to make such inspections,
                  nor the making of such inspections by Landlord, shall operate
                  as a waiver of any right of Landlord to require good and
                  workmanlike construction and improvements erected in
                  accordance with the approved Space Plan or Plans.

                           (d) Subtenant shall cause its contractor to complete
                  the Tenant Improvements as soon as reasonably possible.

                  Improvements shall comply with the following: (i) the Tenant
                  Improvements shall be constructed in strict accordance with
                  the approved Space Plan or Plans; (ii) Subtenant and its
                  contractor shall submit schedules of all work relating to the
                  Tenant Improvements to Landlord for Landlord's approval within

                  selection of the contractor and the approval of the Plans.
                  Landlord shall within three (3) business days after receipt
                  thereof inform Subtenant of any changes which are necessary
                  and Subtenant's contractor shall adhere to such corrected
                  schedule; and (iii) Subtenant shall abide by


                                      D-4.

                           (f) Subtenant or Subtenant's contractor or agents
                  shall arrange for necessary utility, hoisting and elevator
                  service with Landlord's contractor and shall pay such
                  reasonable charges for such services as may be charged by

                           (i) Subtenant hereby indemnifies and holds
                  Sublandlord and Landlord harmless with respect to any and all
                  costs, losses, damages, injuries and liabilities relating in

                  non-payment of any amount arising out of the Tenant
                  Improvements. Such indemnity by Subtenant, as set forth above,
                  shall also apply with respect to any and all costs, losses,
                  damages, injuries, and liabilities related in any way to
                  Sublandlord's and Landlord's performance of any ministerial

                           (j) Subtenant's contractor and the subcontractors
                  utilized by Subtenant's contractor shall guarantee to
                  Subtenant and for the benefit of Sublandlord and Landlord that
                  the portion of the Tenant Improvements for which it is
                  responsible shall be free from any defects in workmanship and
                  materials for a period of not less than one (1) year from the
                  date of completion thereof. Each of Subtenant's contractor and
                  the subcontractors utilized by Subtenant's contractor shall be
                  responsible for the replacement or repair, without additional
                  charge, of all work done or furnished in accordance with its
                  contract that shall become defective within one (1) year after
                  the later to occur of (i) completion of the work performed by
                  such contractor of subcontractors and (ii) the Sublease
                  Commencement Date. The correction of such work shall include,
                  without additional charge, all additional expenses and damages
                  incurred in connection with such removal or replacement of all
                  or any part of the Tenant Improvements, and/or the Building
                  and/or common areas that may be damaged or disturbed thereby.
                  All such warranties or guarantees as to materials or
                  workmanship of or with respect to the Tenant Improvements
                  shall be contained in the construction contract or subcontract
                  and shall be written such that such guarantees or warranties
                  shall inure to the benefit of Sublandlord, Landlord and
                  Subtenant, as their respective interests may appear, and can
                  be directly enforced by any of the parties. Subtenant
                  covenants to give to Landlord and Sublandlord any assignment
                  or other assurances which may be reasonably necessary to
                  effect such rights of direct enforcement.

                           (k) Commencing upon the execution of the Sublease,
                  Subtenant shall hold weekly meetings at a reasonable time with
                  the Space Planner and the contractor regarding the progress of
                  the preparation of the Plans and the construction of the
                  Tenant Improvements, which meetings shall be held at a
                  location designated by Subtenant, and Landlord and/or its
                  agents shall receive prior notice of, and shall have the right
                  to attend, all such meetings, and upon Landlord's advance
                  request, certain of Subtenant's contractors shall attend such
                  meetings.

6.       Insurance Requirements.

         6.1 All of Subtenant's contractors shall carry worker's compensation
insurance covering all of their respective employees, and shall also carry
public liability insurance, including property damage, all with limits, in form
and with companies as are required to be carried by Subtenant as set forth in
the Sublease.

         6.2 Subtenant shall carry "Builder's All Risk" insurance in an amount
approved by Landlord covering the construction of the Tenant Improvements, and
such other insurance as Landlord may reasonably require, it being understood and
agreed that the Tenant Improvements shall be insured by Subtenant pursuant to
the Sublease immediately upon completion thereof. Such insurance shall be in
amounts and shall include such extended coverage endorsements as

                                      D-6.



<PAGE>   83


may be reasonably required by Landlord including, but not limited to, the
requirement that all of Subtenant's contractors shall carry excess liability and
Products and Completed Operation coverage insurance, each in amounts not less
than $500,000 per incident, $1,400,000 in aggregate, and in form and with
companies as are required to be carried by Subtenant as set forth in the
Sublease.

         6.3 Certificates for all insurance carried pursuant to this Work Letter
must comply with the requirements of the Sublease and shall be delivered to
Landlord before the commencement of construction of the Tenant Improvements and
before the contractor's equipment is moved onto the site. In the event the
Tenant Improvements are damaged by any cause during the course of the
construction thereof, Subtenant shall immediately repair the same at Subtenant's
sole cost and expense. Subtenant's contractors shall maintain all of the
foregoing insurance coverage in force until the Tenant Improvements are fully
completed and accepted by Landlord, except for any Product and Completed
Operation Coverage insurance required by Landlord, which is to be issued on an
"occurrence" (as opposed to a "claims made") basis and be maintained for five
(5) years following completion of the work and acceptance by Landlord and
Subtenant. All policies carried under this Paragraph 6 shall insure Landlord and
Subtenant, as their interests may appear, as well as the contractors. All
insurance maintained by Subtenant's contractors shall preclude subrogation
claims by the insurer against anyone insured thereunder. Such insurance shall
provide that it is primary insurance as respects the owner and that any other
insurance maintained by owner is excess and noncontributing with the insurance
required hereunder.

         6.4 Any insurance required to be carried by Subtenant under this Work
Letter may be carried under blanket insurance policies.

7. Notice of Completion. Within ten (10) days after completion of construction
of the Tenant Improvements, Subtenant shall cause a Notice of Completion to be
recorded in the office of the Recorder of the county in which the Building is
located in accordance with Section 3093 of the Civil Code of the State of
California or any successor statute, and shall furnish a copy thereof to
Landlord upon such recordation. If Subtenant fails to do so, Landlord may
execute and file the same on behalf of Subtenant as Subtenant's agent for such
purpose, at Subtenant's sole cost and expense. At the conclusion of
construction, (i) Subtenant shall cause the Space Planner and the contractor (i)
to update the approved working drawings as necessary to reflect all changes made
to the approved working drawings during the course of construction, (ii) to
certify to the best of their knowledge that the "record-set" of as-built
drawings are true and correct, which certification shall survive the expiration
or termination of the Lease, and (c) to deliver to Landlord two (2) sets of
copies of such record set of drawings within ninety (90) days following issuance
of a certificate of occupancy for the Sublease Premises, and (iii) Subtenant
shall deliver to Sublandlord and Landlord a copy of all warranties, guarantees,
and operating manuals and information relating to the improvements, equipment,
and systems in the Sublease Premises installed on behalf of Subtenant.

8. Work Letter Default. A default under this Work Letter shall constitute a
default under the Sublease, and the parties shall be entitled to all rights and
remedies under the Sublease in the


                                      D-7.

event of a default hereunder by the other party (notwithstanding that the
Sublease Term thereof has not commenced).

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have entered into this Work Letter
which is of even date with the Sublease of which this is a part.

1.       RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO LEASE BUILDING 8.

         (a) Provided Tenant satisfies the conditions set forth in Section 3
below, Tenant shall have the ongoing option to lease Building 8 from Landlord
(the "Building 8 Option") as follows:

                 (i) Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing ("Landlord's
Building 8 Notice") at the time Landlord intends to accept a bona fide written
letter of intent from a third party to lease Building 8 (the "Building 8
Offer"). Landlord's Building 8 Notice shall include the terms of the Building 8
Offer including the square footage, whether it be for a portion of Building 8,
the entire building or several buildings within the Project ("Building 8
Designated Space").

                 (ii) Within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt of
Landlord's Building 8 Notice, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing as to
Tenant's election to either (A) decline to lease the entire Building 8
Designated Space; or (B) commit to lease the entire Building 8 Designated Space
on the same economic terms as the Building 8 Offer ("Tenant's Building 8
Acceptance Notice").

         (b) In the event Tenant commits to lease the entire Building 8
Designated Space, Landlord and Tenant shall enter into a new lease for the
entire Building 8 Designated Space, substantially in the form of the Phase A
Lease (as expressly modified by the Sublease), provided, that the economic teens
and conditions shall be the same as those in the Building 8 Offer, and provided
(i) Tenant's parking ratio is not less than that granted under the Phase A Lease
and (ii) the roof rights granted under Paragraph 38 (G) shall also apply to
Building 8, subject to any charges for such uses as agreed to in the Building 8
Offer.

         (c) If Landlord has not executed a lease on the terms set forth in the
Building 8 Offer for the Building 8 Designated Space within six (6) months of
Landlord's Building 8 Notice to Tenant, the Building 8 Option shall be
reinstated.

2.       OPTION TO RENEW THE LEASE OF THE PHASE A-2 PREMISES. Provided Tenant
satisfies the conditions set forth in Section 3 below, Tenant shall have the
option to enter into a new lease directly with Landlord, for one (1) additional
teen of five (5) years, commencing April 1, 2009 and expiring on March 31, 2014
(the "Renewal Option") pursuant to the procedure set forth below.

         (a) If Tenant elects to exercise such option, then Tenant shall provide
Landlord with written notice no earlier then October 1, 2007, but no later than
January 1, 2008 ("Tenant's Intent to Renew Notice"). If Tenant fails to provide
such notice, Tenant shall have no further or additional right to the Renewal
Option.

         (b) The Base Rent in effect at the expiration of the Sublease shall be
adjusted to reflect the current fair market rental for comparable space in the
Project and in other similar buildings in the Eastgate Technology Park area as
of April 1, 2009, taking into account the specific provisions of the Sublease
which will remain constant, and the Building amenities,

                                        2




<PAGE>   88


location, identity, quality, age, conditions, term of lease, tenant
improvements, services provided, and other pertinent items, including tenant
concessions then offered in the market place.

         (c) Landlord shall advise Tenant ("Landlord's Notice") of the new Base
Rent for the Phase A-2 Premises for the renewal term which will be based on
Landlord's good faith determination of fair market rental value ("Fair Market
Rate"), as well as additional terms and conditions for the renewal term, no
later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of Tenant's Intent to Renew Notice.

         (d) Tenant shall notify Landlord of its election to exercise (the
"Exercise Notice") the Renewal Option within ten (10) days of Tenant's receipt
of Landlord's Notice.

         (e) If Tenant disputes the amount claimed by Landlord as the Fair
Market Rate, Tenant may require that Landlord submit the dispute to arbitration.
The arbitration shall be conducted and determined in San Diego, California, in
accordance with the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration
Association or its successor for arbitration of commercial disputes, except that
the procedures mandated by such rules shall be modified as follows:

                 (i) Tenant shall make demand for arbitration in writing on or
before it sends Tenant's Exercise Notice to Landlord hereunder, specifying
therein the name and address of the person to act as the arbitrator on Tenant's
behalf. The arbitrator shall be an independent real estate broker with at least
ten (10) years full-time commercial real estate experience in San Diego office
properties, prior to the date of Tenant's Intent to Renew Notice, who is
familiar with the Fair Market Rate of first-class business park space in San
Diego County. Failure on the part of Tenant to make the timely and proper demand
for such arbitration shall constitute a waiver of the right thereto. Within ten
(10) business days after the service of the demand for arbitration, Landlord
shall give notice to Tenant specifying the name and address of the person
designated by Landlord to act as arbitrator on its behalf, which arbitrator
shall be similarly qualified. If Landlord fails to notify Tenant of the
appointment of its arbitrator, within or by the time specified, then the
arbitrator appointed by Tenant shall be the arbitrator to determine the Fair
Market Rate for the subject premises. The arbitration shall be concluded within
sixty (60) days after the date of Tenant's Exercise Notice.

                 (ii) If two arbitrators are chosen as set forth above, the
arbitrators so chosen shall meet within ten (10) business days after the second
arbitrator is appointed and shall determine the Fair Market Rate. If the two
arbitrators shall be unable to agree upon a determination of Fair Market Rent
within such ten (10) business day period, they, themselves, shall appoint a
third arbitrator, who shall be a competent and impartial person with
qualifications similar to those required of the first two arbitrators pursuant
to this paragraph. In the event the arbitrators are unable to agree upon such
appointment within seven (7) days after expiration of such ten (10) day period,
the third arbitrator shall be selected by the parties themselves, if they can
agree thereon, within a further period of fifteen (15) business days. If the
parties do not agree on the third arbitrator within fifteen (15) business days
after expiration of the foregoing seven (7) day period, then either party, on
behalf of both, may request appointment of such a qualified arbitrator by (i)
the President of the San Diego Board of Realtors, or (ii) the chief arbitrator
of the San Diego County Chapter of the American Arbitration Association. The
three arbitrators shall decide the dispute, if it has not been previously
resolved, by following the procedures set


                                       3

<PAGE>   89


forth in Subparagraph (iii) below. Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of
its respective arbitrator and both shall share the fees and expenses of the
third arbitrator. Attorneys' fees and expenses of counsel and of witnesses or
other experts for the respective parties shall be paid by the respective party
engaging such counsel or calling such witnesses or other experts.

                 (iii) The Fair Market Rate shall be fixed by the three
arbitrators in accordance with the following procedures. Each of the two (2)
arbitrators selected by the parties shall state, in writing, his or her
determination of the Fair Market Rate supported by the reasons therefor and
shall make counterpart copies for each of the other arbitrators. The arbitrators
shall arrange for a simultaneous exchange of such proposed resolutions within
ten (10) business days after appointment of the third arbitrator. If either
arbitrator fails to deliver to the other arbitrators his or her determination
within such ten (10) business day period, then the determination of the other
arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. The role of the third
arbitrator shall be to select which of the two proposed resolutions most closely
approximates his or her determination of Fair Market Rate. The third arbitrator
shall have no right to propose a middle ground or any modification of either of
the two proposed resolutions. The resolution he or she chooses as the most
closely approximating his or her determination of the Fair Market Rate shall
constitute the decision of the arbitrators and shall be final and binding upon
the parties. If either party fails to pay its share of the fees of the third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice, or fails to
execute and deliver any documents reasonably required by the third arbitrator
within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof, then the Fair Market Rate shall
be determined solely by the arbitrator selected by the other party.

                 (iv) In the event of a failure, refusal or inability of any
arbitrator to act, his or her successor shall be appointed by him or her, but in
the case of the third arbitrator, his or her successor shall be appointed in the
same manner as that set forth herein with respect to the appointment of the
original third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall attempt to decide the issue
within ten (10) business days after the appointment of the third arbitrator.

         (f) Any exercise by Tenant of any option to renew under this Paragraph
shall be irrevocable. Tenant agrees to execute a new lease agreement
substantially in the form of the Phase A Lease, as expressly modified by the
Sublease, reflecting the foregoing terms and conditions, prior to the
commencement of the renewal term. The option to renew granted under this
Paragraph is not transferable; the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
they intend that the option to renew the Sublease under this Paragraph shall be
"personal" to the specific Tenant named in this Lease and that in no event will
any assignee or sublessee have any rights to exercise such option to renew
(except for affiliates, subsidiaries or successors of Tenant). Furthermore,
Subtenant's parking ratio provided in the Basic Lease Information of the Master
Lease and the roof rights pursuant to Paragraph 38(G) of the Master Lease shall
be reflected in the renewal lease, except that Landlord shall have the right to
charge Tenant for such uses to the extent any such charges would not be
inconsistent with parking and roof right charges then imposed at similarly
situated office buildings in San Diego.

3.       CONDITIONS TO EXERCISE OF RIGHTS TO LEASE AND OPTIONS TO RENEW.
Tenant's exercise of its right to lease Building 8 and Tenant's exercise of its
options to renew pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement, is subject to Tenant's
satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

                                       4

applicable notice and cure periods set forth in the Sublease) during the
Sublease Term (as defined in the Sublease); and

         (b) as to the Renewal Option, Tenant does not intend to assign or
sublet more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Subleased Premises (excluding
its affiliates, subsidiaries or successors); or as to Tenant's right to lease
Building 8, Tenant (or its affiliates, subsidiaries or successors) is in
