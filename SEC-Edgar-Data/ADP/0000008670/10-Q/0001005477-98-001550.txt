                         =====    =====      =====   =====

Consolidated revenue for the quarter grew 16% from last year to $1,309 million.
Revenue growth in the Company's three largest businesses, Employer, Brokerage
and Dealer Services, was strong at 19%, 24%, and 10%, respectively.

The primary components of "Other revenue" are claims services, services for
wholesalers, interest income, foreign exchange differences and miscellaneous
processing services. In addition, "Other revenue" has been reduced to adjust for
the difference between actual interest income earned on invested tax filing
funds and income credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 6%.

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 18% to $279 million. Systems
development and programming investments increased to accelerate automation,
migrate to new computing technologies, and develop new products.
<PAGE>

Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher effective tax rate, increased 16%
to $191 million. The effective tax rate of 31.7% increased from 30.3% in the
comparable quarter last year, primarily as a result of the greater proportion of
taxable earnings versus non-taxable interest earnings.

Basic earnings per share grew 14% to $.64 from $.56 last year.

For the full year, the Company expects over 15% growth in revenue and pretax
earnings and basic earnings per share growth in the area of 13-14% above 1997's
$1.80 per share (which is prior to non-recurring items).

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong,
and operations continue to generate a strong cash flow. At March 31, 1998, the
Company had cash and marketable securities of approximately $1.7 billion.
Shareholders' equity was approximately $3.2 billion and the ratio of long-term
debt to equity was 7%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 1998 are expected to be approximately $200 to
$225 million depending on the completion of certain projects, compared to $175
million in fiscal 1997.

During the first nine months of fiscal 1998, ADP purchased 896,000 shares of
common stock for treasury at an average price of approximately $46. The Company
has remaining Board authorization to purchase up to 8.5 million additional
shares to fund equity related employee benefit plans.

During the first nine months of fiscal 1998, 392,000 of the Company's zero
coupon convertible subordinate notes were converted to over 5 million shares of
common stock.

The Company's investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade fixed income
investments, such as AA or better rated fixed income municipal instruments,
maturing in less than 7 years, and such portfolio does not subject the Company
to material market risk exposures.
