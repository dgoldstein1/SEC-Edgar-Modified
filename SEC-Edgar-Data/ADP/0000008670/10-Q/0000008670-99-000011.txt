Note D - Interim financial data by segment:


         ADP evaluates performance of its business units
         based on recurring operating results before
         interest, income taxes and foreign currency gains
         and losses. Certain revenues and expenses are
         charged to business units at a standard rate for
         management and motivation reasons.  Other costs
         are recorded based on management responsibility.
         As a result, various income and expense items,
         including non-recurring gains and losses, are
         recorded at the corporate level and certain shared
         costs are not allocated. Goodwill amortization is
         charged to business units at an accelerated rate
         to act as a surrogate for the cost of capital for
         acquisitions. Revenues on invested client funds
         are credited to Employer Services at a standard
         rate of 6%. Prior year's business unit results
         have been restated to reflect the current year's
         foreign exchange standard rates.

         Results of the Company's three largest business
         units, Employer Services, Brokerage Services and
         Dealer Services are shown below.

the quarter ended September 30, 1999.

                        ======     ======         ====      ====

Consolidated revenues for the quarter of approximately
$1.4 billion were up 9% from last year.  Revenue growth
in the Company's three largest businesses, Employer,
Brokerage and Dealer Services, was 12%, 3%, and 4%,
respectively.  Brokerage Services' growth was 24%
excluding the impact of last year's sale of the
Front Office business.

The primary components of "Other" revenues are claims
services, interest income, foreign exchange differences,
and miscellaneous processing services. In addition,
"Other" revenues has been reduced to adjust for the
difference between actual interest income earned on
invested client funds and income credited to Employer
Services at a standard rate of 6%. The prior year's
business unit results have been restated to reflect
the current year's foreign exchange standard rates.

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 20% to
approximately $222 million. Consolidated pre-tax
margins increased primarily from the impact of
prior year dispositions in Employer Services and
Brokerage Services and increased productivity
in core businesses.  Systems development and
programming investments increased to accelerate
automation, migrate to new computing technologies,
and develop new products.  Excluding prior year
dispositions, systems development and programming
investments increased over 10% from the last year.

Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher
effective tax rate, increased 17% to approximately
$146 million.  The effective tax rate of 34.2%
increased from 32.5% in the comparable quarter
last year, primarily as a result of the greater
weighting of taxable versus non-taxable earnings.

Diluted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.23
from $0.20 last year.

For the full year, we expect revenue growth of about
10% and diluted earnings per share growth of about
15% above the $1.13 reported prior to non-recurring
items in fiscal 1999.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet
remain exceptionally strong, and operations continue
to generate a strong cash flow.  At September 30,
1999, the Company had cash and marketable securities
of $2.3 billion.  Shareholders' equity was $4.1
billion and the ratio of long-term debt to equity
was 3%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2000 are expected to
approximate $215 million, compared to $178 million in
fiscal 1999.

The Company's investment portfolio for corporate and
client funds consists primarily of fixed income
securities subject to interest rate risk, including
reinvestment risk.  The Company has historically
had the ability to hold these investments until
maturity, and therefore interest rate risk has not
had an adverse impact on income or cash flows.

OTHER MATTERS

The majority of the Company's services involve
computer processing and, as such, the Year 2000
could have a significant impact on the Company's
products and services.  As a result, the Company
has worked for several years addressing both
internal and third-party Year 2000 compliance
issues.

The majority of the Company's mission-critical
systems are Year 2000 compliant and the few
remaining systems, primarily from recent
acquisitions, are expected to be compliant
before the end of the calendar year.  In
addition, the Company has been actively working
with external agencies and partners, including
government agencies, to determine and conform to
their Year 2000 compliance plans.  Third-party
interface testing and resolution of Year 2000
issues with external agencies and partners are
dependent upon those third parties completing
their own Year 2000 remediation efforts.

The cost of Year 2000 remediation is not expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
overall results, as these costs are not expected to
be substantially different from normal recurring
costs that are incurred for systems development and
implementation.

This report contains "forward-looking
statements" based on management's expectations
and assumptions and are subject to risks
and uncertainties that may cause actual results
to differ from those expressed.  Factors that
could cause differences include: ADP's success
in obtaining, retaining and selling additional
services to clients; the pricing of products
and services; overall economic trends,
including interest rate and foreign
currency trends; impact of Year 2000; stock
market activity; auto sales and related
industry changes; employment levels; changes
in technology; availability of skilled technical
associates and the impact of new acquisitions.
