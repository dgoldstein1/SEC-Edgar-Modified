Note D - Interim financial data by segment:

         ADP evaluates performance of its business
         units based on recurring operating results
         before interest, income taxes and foreign
         currency gains and losses. Certain revenues
         and expenses are charged to business units at
         a standard rate for management and motivation
         reasons.  Other costs are recorded based on
         management responsibility.  As a result,
         various income and expense items, including
         non-recurring gains and losses, are recorded
         at the corporate level and certain shared costs
         are not allocated. Goodwill amortization is
         charged to business units at an accelerated
         rate to act as a surrogate for the cost of
         capital for acquisitions. Revenues on invested
         client funds are credited to Employer Services
         at a standard rate of 6%. Prior year's business
         unit results have been restated to reflect the
         current year's foreign exchange standard rates.

         Results of the Company's three largest business
         units, Employer Services, Brokerage Services
         and Dealer Services are shown below.

Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 14%
from last year to $1.5 billion aided by a single
large company mailing in our Brokerage Investor
Communications business.  Without the $35
million of revenue from the distribution, revenue
growth would have been 11%. Revenue growth in
Brokerage Services was 43%. Without the large
mailing in the Investor Communications business,
Brokerage Services grew 27%. Employer Services
revenue growth, impacted by prior year dispositions,
was 10%. Revenue growth in Dealer Services was
4%.  Margins in the quarter increased primarily
from the impact of prior year dispositions and
increased operating efficiencies in each of our
core businesses.  Margins also benefited from
increasing interest rates.

The primary components of "Other" revenues are
claims services, interest income, foreign exchange
differences, and miscellaneous processing services.
In addition, "Other" revenues have been reduced to
adjust for differences between actual interest income
and income credited to Employer Services at a standard
rate of 6%.  The prior year's business unit results
have been restated to reflect the current year's
budgeted foreign exchange rates.

The quarter ended December 31, 1998 includes a
pretax gain of approximately $22 million included
in selling, general and administrative expenses,
a provision for income taxes of approximately
$25 million, and a net loss of approximately
$3 million resulting from the sale of the
Brokerage Services "front office" market data
business.  The quarter ended December 31, 1998
also includes approximately $21 million of
transaction costs and other non-recurring
adjustments, included in selling, general
and administrative expenses ($14 million
after tax) recorded by Vincam prior to the
March 1999 pooling transaction.

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased
19% from last year.  Excluding the impact
of several prior year, non-recurring
transactions pretax earnings increased 20%.

Net earnings for the quarter increased 30%
to $200 million. Excluding the impact of
several prior year, non-recurring transactions,
net earnings increased 17% on a higher
effective tax rate.  The effective tax rate
of 34.2% increased from 32.5% in the
comparable quarter last year, adjusted for
the prior year non-recurring transactions.
The increase in the effective tax rate is
primarily a result of the greater weighting
of taxable versus non-taxable earnings.

Diluted earnings per share grew 29% to $0.31
from $0.24 last year. Excluding the prior year
non-recurring transactions, diluted earnings
per share increased 15% from $0.27 last year.

For the full year, we expect revenue growth
of about 10% and diluted earnings per share
growth of about 15% above the $1.13 reported
prior to non-recurring items in fiscal 1999.
We have accelerated $25 million of investments
to benefit future years that were not
originally planned in fiscal 2000.  The
investments, primarily new business and
Internet related, will be expensed in the
current fiscal year.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance
sheet remain exceptionally strong, and
operations continue to generate a strong cash
flow.  At December 31, 1999, the Company had
cash and marketable securities of $2.5 billion.
Shareholders' equity was $4.3 billion and the
ratio of long-term debt to equity was 3%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2000 are
expected to approximate $200 million,
compared to $178 million in fiscal 1999.

The Company's investment portfolio for
corporate and client funds consists primarily
of fixed income securities subject to
interest rate risk, including reinvestment
risk.  The Company has historically had the
ability to hold these investments until maturity
and, therefore, interest rate risk has not
had an adverse impact on income or cash flows.

OTHER MATTERS

The majority of the Company's services involve
computer processing and, as a result,
the Company has worked for several years
addressing both internal and third-party
Year 2000 compliance issues.

As of the date of this report, the
Company is not aware of any material issues
that have arisen as a result of Year 2000.

This report contains "forward-looking
statements" based on management's expectations
and assumptions and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results
to differ from those expressed.  Factors that
could cause differences include: ADP's success
in obtaining, retaining and selling additional
services to clients; the pricing of products
and services; overall economic trends, including
interest rate and foreign currency trends;
impact of Year 2000; stock market activity;
auto sales and related industry changes;
employment levels; changes in technology;
availability of skilled technical associates
and the impact of new acquisitions.
