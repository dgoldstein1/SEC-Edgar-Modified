Note E - In November 1998 the Company sold its "front-office" market data
         business to Bridge Information Systems, Inc. The transaction gave rise 
         to a pretax gain of $22 million and a $25 million provision for income 
         taxes, resulting in a net loss of $3 million.

Note F - In December 1998 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire The
         Vincam Group for approximately 7.4 million shares of ADP common stock 
         in a pooling of interests transaction. Vincam, with net revenues of 
         approximately $125 million, is a leading Professional Employer 
         Organization providing a suite of human resource functions to small and
         medium sized employers on an outsourced basis. The transaction is 
         subject to Vincam shareholder and various regulatory approvals and is 
         expected to close during the quarter ending March 31, 1999.

Note G - In February 1999 the Company reached a definitive agreement to sell its
         Peachtree Software business to The Sage Group plc, for $145 million. 
         The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to 
         close during the quarter ending March 31, 1999.

</TABLE>

Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 11% from last year to $1,275 
million. Revenue growth in Employer and Dealer Services was 15% and 8%, 
respectively. Brokerage Services revenue, down 5%, was impacted by the sale 
of the "front office" market data business in the quarter. Excluding the sale 
of the front office business, Brokerage Services revenue grew 14%.

The primary components of "Other" revenues are claims services, interest 
income, foreign exchange differences and miscellaneous processing services. 
In addition, "Other" revenues have been reduced to adjust for the difference 
between actual interest income earned on invested tax filing funds and income 
credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 6%.

The sale of the front office business resulted in a $22 million pretax gain, 
a $25 million provision for taxes and a $3 million net loss.

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 29% from last year, helped by the 
gain on the "front office" sale. Prior to the one-time impact of the front 
office sale, pretax earnings increased 18%. Systems development and 
programming investments increased to accelerate automation, migrate to new 
computing technologies, and develop new products.

                                                                        Form 10Q


Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher effective tax rate, increased 
14% to $168 million. Excluding the impact of the front office sale, net 
earnings increased 16%. The effective tax rate of 39.0% increased from 31.3% 
in the comparable quarter last year. Excluding the impact of the front office 
sale, the effective tax rate increased to 32.6% this quarter, primarily as a 
result of the greater weighting of taxable versus non-taxable earnings.

Diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $0.27 from $0.24 last year. Excluding 
the front office sale, diluted earnings per share increased 17%.

The Company expects double digit revenue growth for the full year and diluted 
earnings per share growth of 13-16%.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet remain exceptionally 
strong, and operations continue to generate a strong cash flow. At December 
31, 1998, the Company had cash and marketable securities of $1.7 billion. 
Shareholders' equity was $3.7 billion and the ratio of long-term debt to 
equity was 4%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 1999 are expected to approximate $200 
million, compared to $199 million in fiscal 1998.

During the first half of fiscal 1999, ADP purchased 2.6 million shares of 
common stock for treasury at an average price of approximately $33. The 
Company has remaining Board authorization to purchase up to 14.5 million 
additional shares to fund equity related employee benefit plans.

During the first half of fiscal 1999,the Company's zero coupon convertible 
subordinated notes were converted to 1.6 million shares of common stock.

The Company's investment portfolio for corporate and client funds consists 
primarily of fixed income securities subject to interest rate risk, including 
reinvestment risk. The Company has historically had the ability to hold these 
investments until maturity and, therefore, this has not had an adverse impact 
on income or cash flows.

OTHER MATTERS

The majority of the Company's services involve computer processing and, as 
such, the Year 2000 could have a significant impact on the Company's products 
and services. As a result, the Company has worked for several years 
addressing both internal and third-party Year 2000 compliance issues. The 
majority of the Company's mission-critical systems are Year 2000 compliant 
and the few remaining systems, primarily from recent acquisitions, are 
expected to be compliant by March 31, 1999. In addition, the Company has been 
actively working with external agencies and partners, including government 
agencies, to determine and conform to their Year 2000 compliance plans. Third 
party interface testing and resolution of Year 200 issues with external 
agencies and partners is dependent upon those third parties completing their 
own Year 2000 remediation efforts.

                                                                        Form 10Q


The Year 2000 remediation is not expected to have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's overall results, as these costs are not expected to be 
substantially different from normal recurring costs that are incurred for 
systems development and implementation.

This report contains "forward-looking statements" based on management's 
expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that 
may cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Factors that could 
cause differences include: ADP's success in obtaining, retaining and selling 
additional services to clients; the pricing of products and services; overall 
economic trends, including interest rate and foreign currency trends; impact 
of Year 2000; stock market activity; auto sales and related industry changes; 
employment levels; changes in technology; availability of skilled technical 
associates and the impact of new acquisitions.

Stock"), and One Billion (1,000,000,000) shares of Common Stock, of the par
value of Ten Cents ($.10) per share (hereinafter called "Common Stock").

      The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to issue the shares of the
Preferred Stock in one or more series, to fix by resolution, to the extent now
or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, the designation
such series, the dividend rate of such series and the date or dates and other
provisions respecting the payment of dividends, the provisions, if any, for a
sinking fund for the shares of 


<PAGE>

such series, the preferences of such series with respect to dividends and in the
event of the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation, the provisions, if
any, respecting the redemption of the shares of such series, the voting rights,
if any, of the shares of such series, the terms, if any, upon which the shares
of such series shall be convertible into or exchangeable for any other shares of

      Subject to the payment or setting apart for payment of any preferential
dividends which the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive such dividends as may be declared thereon from time to time by the Board
of Directors, in its discretion, from any assets legally available for the
payment of dividends.

      In the event of the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation, whether

holders of Common Stock of the full preferential amounts to which they are
entitled, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to share ratably in the
distribution of the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to shareholders.

      Except as otherwise expressly provided in any resolution adopted by the
Board of Directors granting voting rights to the holders of shares of any series

power of the Corporation shall be vested in the Common Stock, and each share of
Common Stock shall have one vote for each share thereof held.

      FIFTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and it is expressly
provided that the same are intended to be in furtherance and not in limitation
or exclusion of the powers conferred by law:

           1. Members of the Board of Directors may be elected either by
       written ballot or by voice-vote.

           2. The Board of Directors may from time to time make, alter, or

       Corporation.

           3. The Corporation shall indemnify all directors and officers of the
       Corporation to the full extent permitted by the General Corporation Law

       from time to time amended, and may purchase and maintain insurance on
       behalf of such directors and officers. In addition, the Corporation
       shall, in the manner and to the extent as the By-laws of the Corporation
       shall provide, indemnify to the full extent permitted by the General
       Corporation law of the State of Delaware (and in particular Paragraph 145
       thereof), as from time to time amended, such other persons as the By-laws
       shall provide, and may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of such
       other persons.

           4. A director of the Corporation shall not be held personally liable

       for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of law (iii) under Section 174 of the
       General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (iv) for any


<PAGE>

       transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
       Any repeal or modification of this paragraph by the stockholders of the
       Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any
       director of the Corporation existing at the time of; or for or with
       respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to, such repeal or
       modification.

       SIXTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may; on the application in a summary
way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof; or on the
application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under
the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed
for this Corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8 of the
Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of
the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may
be, to be summoned in such a manner as the said Court directs. If a majority in
number representing three-fourths (3/4) in value of the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or
arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the Court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be,
and also on this Corporation.
