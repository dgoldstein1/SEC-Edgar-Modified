Note D - Interim financial data by segment:


         ADP evaluates performance of its business units based on recurring
         operating results before interest on corporate funds, income taxes
         and foreign currency gains and losses. Certain revenues and expenses
         are charged to business units at a standard rate for management and
         motivation reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management
         responsibility. As a result, various income and expense items,
         including certain non-recurring gains and losses, are recorded at
         the corporate level and certain shared costs are not allocated.
         Goodwill amortization is charged to business units at an accelerated
         rate to act as a surrogate for the cost of capital for acquisitions.
         Interest on invested funds held for clients are recorded in Employer
         Services' revenues at a standard rate of 6%, with the adjustment to
         actual revenues included in "other". Prior year's business unit
         revenues and pre-tax earnings have been restated to reflect the
         current year's budgeted foreign exchange rates.

         Results of the Company's three largest business units, Employer
         Services, Brokerage Services and Dealer Services are shown below.

Note E - In October 2000, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving
         credit agreement with certain financial institutions, which provides
         for borrowings up to $2.5 billion. Borrowings under the agreement
         bear interest tied to LIBOR or prime rate depending on the number of
         days the borrowings are outstanding. The agreement, which expires in
         October 2001, had no borrowings to date.

Note F - In fiscal 1999, the Company divested its Brokerage front-office
         business to Bridge Information Systems, Inc.  As part of the proceeds
         the Company received $90 million of convertible preferred stock.
         Currently Bridge is operating at a loss and has required additional
         financing. The preferred stock continues to be carried at cost based on
         the facts available at this time, but the ultimate realization of this
         investment cannot be determined with certainty.  As additional
         information concerning this investment becomes known, the Company will
         continue to reassess its position with respect to possible impairment.

Note G - Restatements of prior financial statements:

         Certain reclassifications and restatements, including the inclusion
         of funds held for clients and client funds obligations on the
         Consolidated Balance Sheets, have been made to prior period's
         financial statements to conform to current presentation.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                      ------------------------------------

OPERATING RESULTS

Revenues and earnings again reached record levels during the quarter ended
September 30, 2000.

Revenues and revenue growth by ADP's major business units for the three months
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 are shown below:

     Brokerage Services       362         257          41          2

     Other                    146         110          33          4
                           ------      ------       -----      ------
                           $1,587      $1,351          17%         9%
                           ======      ======       =====      =====

Consolidated revenues for the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion were up 17%
from last year. Revenue growth in Employer Services was 14%, reflecting very
good client retention and internal revenue growth. Brokerage revenue growth was
41%, aided by the recent Cunningham Graphics acquisition and strong trade volume
comparisons. Dealer Services revenue decreased 9% as a result of prior year
dispositions and stronger Year 2000 influenced results last year.

The primary components of "Other" revenues are Claims Services, foreign exchange
differences, and miscellaneous processing services. "Other" also includes
interest on corporate investments of $42 million and $25 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2000 and September 30, 1999, respectively. In
addition, "Other" revenues have been adjusted for the difference between actual
interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited
to Employer Services at a standard rate of 6%. The prior year's business unit
revenues and pre-tax earnings have been restated to reflect the current year's
budgeted foreign exchange rates.

Pre-tax earnings for the quarter increased 29% to approximately $287 million.
Consolidated pre-tax margins increased primarily from the transition of a
portion of corporate and client fund investments from tax-exempt to taxable
investments in order to increase liquidity of the overall portfolio. Systems
development and programming investments increased to accelerate automation,
migrate to new computing technologies, and develop new products.

Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher effective tax rate, increased 19%
to approximately $173 million. The effective tax rate of 39.5% increased from
34.2% in the comparable quarter last year, impacted by the previously discussed
change in the investment mix from tax-exempt to taxable investments.

Diluted earnings per share, on increased shares outstanding, increased 17% to
$0.27 from $0.23 last year.

                                                                        Form 10Q

For the full year, we expect revenue growth of about 13% to 15% and diluted
earnings per share growth of about 16% to 18%.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong,
and operations continue to generate a strong cash flow. At September 30, 2000,
the Company had cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. Shareholders'
equity was $4.7 billion and the ratio of long-term debt to equity was 3%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2001 are expected to approximate $225 million,
compared to $166 million in fiscal 2000.

Approximately half of the Company's overall investment portfolio is invested in
overnight interest-bearing instruments, which are therefore impacted immediately
by changes in interest rates. The other half of the Company's investment
portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities, with maturities up to five and
a half years, which are also subject to interest rate risk, including
reinvestment risk. The Company has historically had the ability to hold these
investments until maturity, and therefore this has not had an adverse impact on
income or cash flows.

OTHER MATTERS

Certain member countries of the European Union have agreed to transition to the
Euro as a new common legal currency. The costs of this transition are not
expected to have a material effect on ADP.

In October 2000, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit
agreement with certain financial institutions, which provides for borrowings up
to $2.5 billion. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest tied to LIBOR or
prime rate depending on the number of days the borrowings are outstanding. The
agreement, which expires in October 2001, had no borrowings to date.

In fiscal 1999, the Company divested its Brokerage front-office business to
Bridge Information Systems, Inc. As part of the proceeds the Company received
$90 million of convertible preferred stock. Currently Bridge is operating at a
loss and has required additional financing. The preferred stock continues to be
carried at cost based on the facts available at this time, but the ultimate
realization of this investment cannot be determined with certainty. As
additional information concerning this investment becomes known, the Company
will continue to reassess its position with respect to possible impairment.

This report contains "forward-looking statements" based on management's

Factors that could cause differences include: ADP's success in obtaining,
retaining and selling additional services to clients; the pricing of products
and services; changes in laws regulating payroll taxes and employee benefits;
overall economic trends, including interest rate and foreign currency trends;
stock market activity; auto sales and related industry changes; employment
levels; changes in technology; availability of skilled technical associates, the
impact of new acquisitions, and the ultimate realization of the Company's
investment in Bridge Information Systems, Inc. ADP disclaims any obligation to
update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.
