                        Notes to Consolidated Statements

      The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments which are, in
the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for
the interim periods. Adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These
statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements
and related notes of the Company for the year ended June 30, 1998.

Note A -    The results of operations for the nine months ended March 31,
            1999 may not be indicative of the results to be expected for the
            year ending June 30, 1999.

Note B -    All prior period results have been restated for the March 1999
            pooling of The Vincam Group, a leading Professional Employer
            Organization (PEO) providing a suite of human resource functions to
            small and medium sized employers on an outsourced basis. PEO
            revenues are net of pass-through costs, which include wages and
            taxes.

            certain other non-recurring charges resulted in approximately $15
            million of pretax income and a $15 million provision for income
            taxes in the quarter.

Note G -    The quarter ended December 31, 1998 includes a pretax gain of
            approximately $22 million, a provision for income taxes of
            approximately $25 million, and a net loss of approximately $3
            million resulting from the sale of the Brokerage Services "front
            office" market data business. The quarter ended December 31, 1998
            also includes approximately $21 million of transaction costs and
            other non-recurring adjustments, ($14 million after tax) recorded by
            Vincam prior to the March 1999 pooling transaction.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OPERATING RESULTS

Revenues and earnings again reached record levels during the quarter ended March
31, 1999.

All prior period results have been restated for the March 1999 pooling of The
Vincam Group, a leading Professional Employer Organization providing a suite of
human resource functions to small and medium sized employers on an outsourced
basis.

Revenues and revenue growth by ADP's major business units are shown below:

Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 13% from last year to $1.5 billion.
Revenue growth in Employer Services was 17%, reflecting strong new business
sales and internal revenue growth. Brokerage revenue growth was 2%, impacted by
the sale of the front office business. Excluding this sale, Brokerage revenue
growth was 23%, helped by strong trading volume. Dealer Services revenue growth
of 3% was affected by slower activity in consulting and several small non-core
Dealer businesses.

The primary components of "Other" revenues are claims services, interest income,
foreign exchange differences and miscellaneous processing services. In addition,
"Other" revenues has been reduced to adjust for the difference between actual
interest income earned on invested tax filing funds and income credited to
Employer Services at a standard rate of 6%.

In the quarter ended March 31, 1999 the Company sold its Peachtree Software
business and decided to exit several other businesses and contracts. The
combination of these transactions and certain other non-recurring charges
resulted in approximately $15 million of pretax income, included in selling,
general and administrative expenses, and a $15 million provision for income
taxes in the quarter.

The quarter ended December 31, 1998 includes a pretax gain of approximately $22
million, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, a provision
for income taxes of approximately $25 million, and a net loss of approximately
$3 million resulting from the sale of the Brokerage Services "front office"
market data business. The quarter ended December 31, 1998 also includes
approximately $21 million of transaction costs and other non-recurring
adjustments, included in selling, general and administrative expenses ($14
million after tax) recorded by Vincam prior to the March 1999 pooling
transaction.

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 25% from last year, helped by the
impact of the Peachtree sale and the non-recurring charges. Excluding these
items, pretax earnings increased 20%. Systems development and programming
investments increased to accelerate automation, migrate to new computing
technologies, and develop new products.

Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher effective tax rate, increased 18%
to $226 million. The effective tax rate of 35.8% increased from 31.8% in the
comparable quarter last year. Excluding the impact of the Peachtree sale and the
non-recurring charges, the effective tax rate increased to 33.0% this quarter,
primarily as a result of the greater weighting of taxable versus non-taxable
earnings.

Diluted earnings per share grew 16% to $.36 from $.31 last year.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong,
and operations continue to generate a strong cash flow. At March 31, 1999, the
Company had cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.0 billion.
Shareholders' equity was approximately $3.9 billion and the ratio of long-term
debt to equity was 4%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 1999 are expected to be slightly more than $200
million, compared to about $200 million in fiscal 1998.

During the first nine months of fiscal 1999, ADP purchased 2.6 million shares of
common stock for treasury at an average price per share of approximately $33.
The Company has remaining Board authorization to purchase up to 14.5 million
additional shares to fund equity related employee benefit plans.

During the first nine months of fiscal 1999, zero coupon convertible
subordinated notes were converted to 2.5 million shares of common stock.

The Company's investment portfolio for corporate and client funds consists
primarily of fixed income securities subject to interest rate risk, including
reinvestment risk. The Company has historically had the ability to hold these
investments until maturity and, therefore, this has not had an adverse impact on
income or cash flows.

                                                                        Form 10Q

OTHER MATTERS

The majority of the Company's services involve computer processing and, as such,
the Year 2000 could have a significant impact on the Company's products and
services. As a result, the Company has worked for several years addressing both
internal and third-party Year 2000 compliance issues. The majority of the
Company's mission-critical systems are Year 2000 compliant and the few remaining
systems, primarily from recent acquisitions, are expected to be compliant by
June 30, 1999. In addition, the Company has been actively working with external
agencies and partners, including government agencies, to determine and conform
to their Year 2000 compliance plans. Third party interface testing and
resolution of Year 2000 issues with external agencies and partners is dependent
upon those third parties completing their own Year 2000 remediation efforts.

The Year 2000 remediation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company's overall results, as these costs are not expected to be
substantially different from normal recurring costs that are incurred for
systems development and implementation.

This report contains "forward-looking statements" based on management's
expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Factors that could cause
differences include: ADP's success in obtaining, retaining and selling
additional services to clients; the pricing of products and services; overall
economic trends, including interest rate and foreign currency trends; impact of
Year 2000; stock market activity; auto sales and related industry changes;
employment levels; changes in technology; availability of skilled technical
associates and the impact of new acquisitions.
