Note D - Interim financial data by segment:

         The Company evaluates performance of its business
         units based on recurring operating results before
         interest, income taxes and foreign currency gains
         and losses. Certain revenues and expenses are charged
         to business units at a standard rate for management
         and motivation reasons.  Other costs are recorded
         based on management responsibility.  As a result,
         various income and expense items, including non-
         recurring gains and losses, are recorded at the
         corporate level and certain shared costs are not
         allocated. Goodwill amortization is charged to business
         units at an accelerated rate to act as a surrogate for
         the cost of capital for acquisitions. Revenues on
         invested client funds are credited to Employer Services
         at a standard rate of 6%. Prior year's business unit
         results have been restated to reflect the current year's
         foreign exchange standard rates.

         Results of the Company's three largest business units,
         Employer Services, Brokerage Services and Dealer
         Services are shown below.

Consolidated revenues for the quarter grew 14% from
last year to $1.7 billion. Revenue growth in Employer
Services was 9%, impacted by prior year dispositions
and slower new business sales in November and December
resulting from Year 2000 related decision deferrals.
Employer Services sales rebounded during the third
quarter. Brokerage revenue growth was 40%, supported
by strong trading volume. Dealer Services revenue
growth of 1% was affected by the impact of prior year
dispositions, slower international installations and
lower consulting activity.

The primary components of "Other" revenues are claims
services, interest income, foreign exchange differences
and miscellaneous processing services.  In addition,
"Other" revenues has been reduced to adjust for the
difference between actual interest income earned on
invested client funds and income credited to Employer
Services at a standard rate of 6%.  The prior year's
business unit results have been restated to reflect
the current year's budgeted foreign exchange rates.

In the quarter ended March 31, 1999 the Company
sold its Peachtree Software business and decided
to exit several other businesses and contracts.
The combination of these transactions and certain
other non-recurring charges resulted in approximately
$15 million of pretax income, included in selling,
general and administrative expenses, and a $15
million provision for income taxes in the quarter.

The quarter ended December 31, 1998 includes a
pretax gain of approximately $22 million, included
in selling, general and administrative expenses, a
provision for income taxes of approximately $25
million, and a net loss of approximately $3 million
resulting from the sale of the Brokerage Services
"front office" market data business. The quarter
ended December 31, 1998 also includes approximately
$21 million of transaction costs and other non-recurring
adjustments, included in selling, general and
administrative expenses ($14 million after tax)
recorded by Vincam prior to the March 1999 pooling
transaction.

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 18% from
last year. Excluding the impact of several prior
year, non-recurring transactions pretax earnings
increased 23%.

Net earnings for the quarter, after a lower effective
tax rate, increased 20% to $271 million. The
effective tax rate of 34.7% increased from 33.0% in
the comparable quarter last year, adjusted for the
prior year non-recurring transactions. The increase
in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of a
change in the investment mix to a greater weighting
of taxable versus non-taxable investments.

Diluted earnings per share grew 17% to $.42 from $.36
last year.

For the full year, the Company expects revenue growth
to exceed 10% and expects to meet or exceed diluted
earnings per share growth of about 15% above the $1.13
reported prior to non-recurring items in fiscal 1999.
The Company has accelerated $45 million of investments
to benefit future years that were not originally planned
in fiscal 2000 expenses.  These investments are primarily
new business and Internet related.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet
remain exceptionally strong, and operations continue
to generate a strong cash flow.  At March 31, 2000,
the Company had cash and marketable securities of
approximately $2.5 billion.  Shareholders' equity was
approximately $4.3 billion and the ratio of long-term
debt to equity was 3%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2000 are expected
to be approximately $200 million, compared to $178
million in fiscal 1999.

During the first nine months of fiscal 2000,
the Company purchased 4.6 million shares of common
stock for treasury at an average price per share
of approximately $43.  The Company has remaining
Board authorization to purchase up to 19.9 million
additional shares to fund equity related employee
benefit plans.

The Company's investment portfolio for corporate
and client funds consists primarily of fixed income
securities subject to interest rate risk, including

reinvestment risk.  The Company has historically
had the ability to hold these investments until
maturity and, therefore, interest rate risk has
not had an adverse impact on income or cash flows.
