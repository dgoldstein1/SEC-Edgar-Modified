                                  ======      ====      ===        == 

Consolidated revenue for the quarter of $1,038 million was up 14% from last
year.  Revenue growth in the Company's three largest businesses, Employer,
Brokerage and Dealer Services, was strong at 20%, 19%, and 9%, respectively. 
Each includes some acquisitions.

The primary components of "Other revenue" are claims services, services for
wholesalers, interest income, foreign exchange differences, and miscellaneous
processing services. In addition, "Other revenue" has been reduced to adjust for
the difference between actual interest income earned on invested tax filing
funds and income credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 6.0%. 

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 16% from last year. Consolidated
margins increased slightly in the quarter, due primarily to the impact of higher
trading volume on the Brokerage Services group.  Systems development and
programming investments increased to accelerate automation, migrate to new
computing technologies, and develop new products.  

Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher effective tax rate, increased 13%
to $105 million.  The effective tax rate was 31.3%,increased from 29.4% in the
comparable quarter last year, primarily as a result of the greater weighting of
taxable versus non-taxable earnings.

Earnings per share grew 13% to $.36 from $.32 last year.

For the full year, we expect close to 15% growth in revenue and pretax earnings
and earnings per share growth of 12 to 14% above 1997's $1.80 per share (which
is prior to non-recurring items in 1997).
