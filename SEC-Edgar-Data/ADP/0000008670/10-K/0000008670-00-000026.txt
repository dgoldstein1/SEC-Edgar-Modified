                                     Part I

Item 1.  Business

         Automatic  Data  Processing,  Inc.,  incorporated  in  Delaware in 1961
(together  with  its  subsidiaries  "ADP"  or the  "Registrant"),  is one of the
largest providers of computerized  transaction  processing,  data communication,
and information services in the world. For financial  information by segment and
by  geographic  area,  see  Note  11 of the  "Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements"  contained  in ADP's  2000  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,  which
information is incorporated herein by reference. The following summary describes
ADP's activities.

Employer Services

         ADP Employer  Services offers a comprehensive  range of payroll,  human
resources,  benefits  administration,   time  and  attendance,  tax  filing  and
reporting,  professional  employer  organization ("PEO"), compliance  management
(e.g., new hire reporting and wage  garnishment  processing) and retirement plan
services to 450,000  employers in the United  States,  Canada,  Europe and Latin
America. These services are marketed through ADP's direct marketing sales forces
and through other indirect sales channels such as marketing  relationships  with
banks,  accountants,  and  increasingly,  online  companies  through which ADP's
services  are  marketed  to their  customers.  In  fiscal  2000,  North  America
accounted for 88% of Employer Services' revenues,  with Europe generating 11% of
Employer Services' revenues and Latin America  (principally Brazil) contributing
the remaining 1%.  Further,  with the acquisition of PayConnect in July of 2000,
ADP  entered  into the  payroll  services  market of  Australia,  and  currently
provides payroll and HR solutions to over 7,500 clients in Australia.

         In North  America,  ADP  provides  payroll  services  that  include the
preparation of client employee  paychecks and electronic direct deposits,  along
with supporting  journals,  summaries and management reports.  ADP also supplies
the quarterly and annual social security, Medicare, and federal, state and local
income tax withholding  reports required to be filed by employers and employees.
ADP's tax filing  services  process  federal,  state and local  payroll taxes on
behalf of ADP clients and remit such taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities
when due. Through service  offerings such as new hire reporting,  ADP check/full
service  direct  deposit  (in  conjunction  with major bank  partners)  and wage
garnishment  payment,  the  ADP  Tax  and  Financial  Services  Center  is  also
responsible  for the  efficient  movement  of  funds  and  information  to third
parties.  In Europe and Latin  America,  ADP  Employer  Services  provides  full
departmental outsourcing of payroll services.

         ADP  Employer  Services'  approach to the market is to match a client's
needs  with the  product  that will best meet  expectations.  In North  America,
approximately 30% of Employer  Services' revenue during the past fiscal year was
attributable to its Emerging  Business  Services  (companies with fewer than 100
employees); approximately 34% of such revenue was attributable to Major Accounts
(companies with between 100 and 999 employees);  and  approximately  25% of such
revenue was  attributable  to National  Accounts  (companies  with 1,000 or more
employees).

         ADP's human resource ("HR") services, operating in conjunction  with a
client's  payroll  database,  provide  comprehensive  recordkeeping HR services,
including benefits administration and outsourcing,  applicant tracking, employee
history and position control.

         ADP is in the process of Internet-enabling  existing product offerings,
while  at the  same  time  creating  new  products  expressly  designed  for the
Internet.  This year ADP launched its eBusiness

                                       2
<PAGE>

Services  unit to provide  online  payroll,  HR,  401(k) and other  services  to
smaller companies that use the Internet to staff,  manage,  pay and retain their
employees.  ADP also introduced ADP Enterprise Payroll, an Internet-based system
with  self-service  features  for  large  businesses.  Clients  can  now use ADP
Connection(TM)  to  interface  ADP's  payroll  and  tax  filing  solutions  with
enterprise resource planning applications from Oracle(R), SAP and PeopleSoft(R).
ADP is also  developing an  Internet-based  payroll,  benefits and HR management
system with self-service features for the middle market.

         Emerging Business Services ("EBS") processes payroll for over 370,000
clients.  EBS provides these smaller companies of usually 1-99  employees  with
leading solutions, including a range of value-added services that are
specifically designed for small business clients. Major Accounts
(100-999 employees) offers a full suite of best-of-breed  employer services
solutions for mid-sized companies, including full database and other functional
integration between payroll and HR. Many of the world's largest  corporations
(1000 or more employees) are National Accounts Services clients.  In many cases,
ADP provides system solutions for its clients' entire human resource,  payroll
and benefits needs. For those companies who choose to process these applications
in-house, ADP also delivers stand-alone services  such as payroll tax  filing,
check  printing  and  distribution,  and year-end statements (i.e., W-2's).
Other large clients rely on ADP to design and deliver their own  customized
human resource  information  systems and benefits outsourcing  solutions.
Further, as part of ADP's initiatives to develop online products and services,
this year ADP acquired Business Management Software, LTD, a United Kingdom-based
software  developer  and  long-term  partner  of  ADP, specializing in the
development of payroll and HR applications.

         The ADP Tax and Financial Services Center supports large, mid-sized and
small clients. It provides an electronic interface between approximately 350,000
ADP clients in the United  States and Canada and about 2000  federal,  state and
local tax agencies, from the Internal Revenue Service to local town governments.
In fiscal 2000,  the ADP Tax and  Financial  Service  Center  processed  over 17
million federal and other employer payroll tax returns.

         In 1999,  ADP became the second  largest PEO in the United  States with
the  acquisition  of The  Vincam  Group,  Inc. A PEO  provides a  comprehensive,
bundled  outsourcing  solution,  including  payroll,  HR,  benefits and workers'
compensation to its clients. ADP's combined PEO business, called TotalSource(R),
has 26 offices located in 11 states and supports  approximately 85,000 work-site
employees in 48 states.

         ADP complements  its payroll and HR services with  additional  employer
services  that include  products  ranging from time and  attendance  tracking to
401(k)  recordkeeping.  ADP's unemployment  compensation services aid clients in
managing and reducing unemployment insurance costs. In the last fiscal year, ADP
enhanced its position as a leading  benefits  administration  provider  with the
acquisition of netBOA, Inc., a provider of COBRA administration services.

         The continued  increase in  multinational  companies  makes payroll and
human resource  management  services a global  opportunity.  ADP Europe provides
payroll solutions to nearly 24,000 clients in nine European countries and is the
only  Pan-European  service  provider.  Additionally,  ADP is well positioned in
Latin America to take  advantage of future growth in this market.  As previously
stated,  Employer  Services'  European  and Latin  American  operations  already
comprise 12% of the consolidated  Employer Services worldwide revenues.  As this
business grows,  ADP's Global  Business  Services will provide a dedicated sales
and service organization trained and equipped to handle payroll for clients with
diverse locations in ADP's major world markets.

Brokerage Services

         ADP Brokerage  Services  provides  securities  transaction  processing,
broker  productivity  applications  and investor  communication  services to the
financial  services   industry.   These  services  include  bank  and  brokerage
back-office and related financial  computing  services such as trade processing,
automated  inquiry,  reporting  and record  keeping  services for  virtually all
financial  instruments  including  foreign  currency,  fixed  income,  equities,
commodities and derivatives.

         ADP serves a diverse  client base,  including full service and discount
brokerage firms,  global banks,  and Internet  brokerage  companies,  as well as
corporations,  mutual funds,  institutional investors,  specialty trading firms,
and other providers of financial services.

         In fiscal  2000,  ADP  processed  a  significant  portion  of U.S.  and
Canadian securities  transactions,  with combined daily volumes of more than 1.2
million trades per day, up 50% from the prior year. In addition,  ADP served the
North  American  securities  transaction  processing  needs of most large global
banks.

         This year, ADP processed over 25% of all online trades in North America
and  expanded  its  presence as a leading  service  provider  of  Internet-based
brokerage  services.  ADP also  initiated  new  relationships  with  Web  Street
Securities  and  Millennium  Clearing  Company  LLC, a  subsidiary  of  National
Discount Brokers Group, Inc.

         ADP Brokerage Services also provides computerized proxy vote tabulation
and shareholder communication,  distribution and fulfillment services, including
Internet-enabled  products and  services.  In fiscal 2000,  ADP handled over 680
million  shareholder  communications on behalf of its clients worldwide,  nearly
35% more than fiscal 1999. It also more than doubled  Internet  distribution  of
shareholder  communications  in fiscal 2000. ADP also signed Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter to a new multi-year investor communication services contract.  This year,
ADP created the IRexpress.com(SM) Internet platform suite of services that
allows investor relations  professionals to manage their process,  access
institutional ownership of information, and track institutional portfolios
online.

         Internationally,  ADP  Brokerage  Services  integrated  the delivery of
multiple products and services through its Global Processing  Solution.  ADP now
serves  brokerage and banking  clients in 25 countries,  providing  global trade
processing  and  settlement  systems for  international  securities  in multiple
currencies.  In fiscal 2000, ADP's Wilco Systems strengthened its ability to
adapt to market  changes by setting up a development  center in Hyderabad,
India.  In fiscal 2000,  ADP also  launched  initiatives  to continue  serving
the emerging online  brokerage  markets  internationally,  developing a new
Internet-enabled trading  solution  for  the  European  market,   with  global
straight  through processing  capabilities,  as well as  partnering  with a
leading  provider  of end-to-end  on-line  retail  financial  services  enabling
ADP to offer  turnkey Internet  solutions.  In addition,  ADP  maintained ISO
9002  certification  for shareholder  information  processing, an international
standard for the highest quality.

         In June 2000, ADP acquired Cunningham Graphics  International,  Inc., a
provider  of a wide  range  of  graphic  communications  services  to  financial
services,  insurance,  healthcare,  and  telecommunication  firms,  as  well  as
publishing  houses.  These services  include the production and  distribution of
time sensitive analytical research and marketing  materials,  as well as general
commercial and on-demand  printing  services.  Cunningham  Graphics  operates in
select international markets through its facilities in the United States, United
Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

Dealer Services

         ADP  Dealer  Services  provides  e-business  and  integrated  computing
solutions  for motor vehicle (car and truck)  retailers and their  manufacturers
worldwide. Approximately 40% of the automotive retailers in North America (about
20% globally) and more than 30 vehicle  manufacturers  use ADP's on-site systems
and communications networks to manage sales, operations and marketing, with over
200,000 installed applications.

         ADP offers clients a service solution that includes computer  hardware,
licensed software,  software support,  network  consulting,  design and hardware
maintenance  services.  Clients use ADP's systems to manage business  activities
such as accounting,  inventory,  factory  communications,  scheduling,  finance,
insurance,   sales  and  service.   ADP  designs,   establishes   and  maintains
communications  networks for its clients that allow  interactive  communications
among  multiple  site  locations  for larger  dealers  as well as links  between
franchise  dealers and their respective  manufacturers.  These networks are used
for new vehicle ordering, status inquiry and warranty submission and validation,
parts and vehicle  locating,  credit  application  submissions,  vehicle  repair
estimates, vehicle registration and lienholder information.

         In fiscal 2000, ADP Dealer  Services formed  ChoiceParts,  LLC with ADP
Claims Services and other partners to establish an efficient  parts  procurement
marketplace for auto retailers and collision repair centers.  ADP's  acquisition
last year of Dealer  Solutions,  Inc.,  a  developer  of  Windows  NT(R)  dealer
management systems software, is another significant step in ADP's Internet-based
strategy. This past fiscal year, ADP launched DealerSuite.com(SM), an e-business
portal that provides dealers with quick access to a wide range of Internet-based
products,  services  and  tools,  including  consumer  finance  sources,  online
training,  and ADP customer service.  ADP also introduced  myautogarage.com(SM),
ADP's Internet  initiative  with IBM that links dealers and  manufacturers  with
vehicle owners to create unique brand loyalty relationships.

Claims Services

         ADP Claims Services offers a broad line of claims information  products
to property and casualty insurance companies, claims adjusters, repair shops and
auto parts  recycling  facilities.  These  products  help insurers to accurately
estimate auto damage,  property  damage and bodily injury claims and help repair
shops and recyclers locate parts and manage their  operations.  The products and
services include the following: repair estimating applications and databases for
the  property  and  casualty,   and  collision  repair   industries,   including
wireless-enabled,  digital imaging,  and complete workflow services;  total loss
vehicle  valuations;  body shop management systems;  parts locator systems;  and
medical  cost  containment  applications  and  services  for the auto injury and
workers' compensation markets.

Markets and Marketing Methods

         All of ADP's  services  are sold broadly  across the United  States and
Canada.  Most ADP  services  are  offered  in Western  Europe and some  employer
services are offered in Brazil and Australia.  All services use common marketing
techniques,  including  direct  sales  methodologies  with  emphasis on referral
sources.

         None of ADP's major  business  groups have a single  homogenous  client
base or market.  For example,  while  Brokerage  Services  primarily  serves the
retail  brokerage  market,  it  also  serves  banks,

                                       5
<PAGE>

commodity   dealers,   the   institutional   brokerage   market  and  individual
non-brokerage corporations. Dealer Services primarily serves automobile dealers,
but also serves truck and  agricultural  equipment  dealers,  auto repair shops,
used  car  lots,  state  departments  of motor  vehicles  and  manufacturers  of
automobiles, trucks and agricultural equipment. Claims Services has many clients
who  are  insurance   companies,   but  also  provides  services  to  automobile
manufacturers,  body repair shops,  salvage yards,  distributors of new and used
automobile parts and other non-insurance clients.  Employer Services has clients
from a large  variety of  industries  and  markets.  Within this client base are
concentrations of clients in specific  industries.  Employer Services also sells
to auto dealers,  brokerage clients and insurance clients.  While concentrations
of clients exist, no one business group is material to ADP's overall revenue.

         None of  ADP's  businesses  are  overly  sensitive  to  price  changes.
Economic conditions among selected clients and groups of clients may and do have
a temporary impact on demand for ADP's services.

         ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings
and does not  believe any major  service or  business  unit in ADP is subject to
unique market risk.

Competition

         The computing services industry is highly competitive.  ADP knows of no
reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but
it believes that it is one of the largest providers of computerized  transaction
processing, data communication and information services in the world.

         ADP's  competitors   include  other  independent   computing   services
companies,  divisions of diversified  enterprises and banks. Another competitive
factor in the computing  services industry is the in-house  computing  function,
whereby a company installs and operates its own computing systems.

         Competition in the computing  services  industry is primarily  based on
service responsiveness,  product quality and price. ADP believes that it is very
competitive  in each of these  areas  and that  there are no  material  negative
factors impacting ADP's competitive position in the computing services industry.
No one competitor or group of competitors is dominant in the computing  services
industry.

Clients and Client Contracts

         ADP provides its services to nearly 500,000  clients.  No single client
accounts for revenues in excess of 1% of annual consolidated revenue.

         ADP has no material  "backlog"  because  the period  between the time a
client agrees to use ADP's services and the time the service begins is generally
very short and  because no sale is  considered  firm until it is  installed  and
begins producing revenue.

         ADP's average  client  retention is about 8 years in Employer  Services
and is 10 or more years in Brokerage,  Dealer and Claims Services,  and does not
vary significantly from period to period.

         ADP's services are provided  under written price  quotations or service
agreements  having  varying  terms and  conditions.  No one price  quotation  or
service agreement is material to ADP. Discounts,  rebates and promotions offered
by ADP to clients are not material.

                                       6
<PAGE>

         ADP  offers a service  warranty  to its  clients  that if any errors or
omissions  occur in its  service  offerings,  ADP will  correct  them as soon as
possible. In addition,  ADP provides,  either directly or through third parties,
maintenance  and support  for the  ADP-provided  equipment  and  software  which
facilitates the delivery of its services to clients.

Systems Development and Programming

         During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000,  1999 and 1998,  ADP spent
$460  million,  $412  million  and  $376  million,   respectively,   on  systems
development  and  programming  activities  for the  development  of new, and the
improvement and maintenance of existing, computing services.

Product Development

         ADP continually  upgrades,  enhances and expands its existing  products
and services.  Generally,  no new product or service has a significant effect on
ADP's revenue or  negatively  impacts its existing  products and  services,  and
ADP's products and services have a significant remaining life cycle.

Licenses

         ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer  programs
and databases. ADP's business is not dependent upon a single license or group of
licenses.  Third-party  licenses,  patents,  trademarks  and  franchises are not
material to ADP's business as a whole.

Number of Employees

         ADP employed approximately 40,000 persons as of June 30, 2000.

Item 2.  Properties

         ADP  leases  space  for  more  than 55 of its  processing  centers.  In
addition, ADP leases numerous small processing centers and sales offices. All of
these leases, which aggregate  approximately 5,800,000 square feet in the United
States,  Canada, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and South Africa, expire
at various times up to the year 2016. ADP owns 30 of its  processing  facilities
and its corporate  headquarters complex in Roseland, New Jersey, which aggregate
approximately 3,000,000 square feet.

         See  "Market  Price,   Dividend  Data  and  Other"   contained  in  the
Registrant's   2000  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,   which   information  is
incorporated  herein by reference.  As of September 6, 2000,  the Registrant had
33,985  registered  holders of its Common Stock,  par value $.10 per share.  The
Registrant's  Common Stock is traded on the New York,  Chicago and Pacific Stock
Exchanges.

         On July 6, 1999, the Registrant issued 6,317 shares of its Common Stock
in respect of an earnout paid to certain  shareholders  of a company  previously
acquired by the  Registrant  in exchange  for all of the issued and  outstanding
shares of such company pursuant to a stock acquisition agreement dated April 28,
1998. On December 23, 1999, the  Registrant  issued 178,228 shares of its Common
Stock in  respect  of an  earnout  paid to  certain  shareholders  of a  company
previously  acquired by the  Registrant  in  exchange  for all of the issued and
outstanding  shares of such company pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated
February 11, 1998. On June 30, 2000, the Registrant issued 293,325 shares of its
Common Stock to the  shareholders  of a company  acquired by the  Registrant  in
exchange for all of the issued and  outstanding  shares of the capital  stock of
such company pursuant to the terms of a share purchase agreement. The Registrant
issued the  foregoing  shares of Common  Stock  without  registration  under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption therefrom set
forth in Section 4(2) of such Act,  relating to sales by an issuer not involving
a public offering.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data

         See "Selected Financial Data" contained in the Registrant's 2000 Annual
Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

         See   "Management's   Discussion   and   Analysis"   contained  in  the
Registrant's   2000  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,   which   information  is
incorporated herein by reference.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

         Approximately half of the Registrant's  overall investment portfolio is
invested in overnight interest-bearing instruments, which are therefore impacted
immediately  by changes in interest  rates.  The other half of the  Registrant's
investment portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities,  with maturities up
to five and a half  years,  which  are  also  subject  to  interest  rate  risk,
including  reinvestment risk. The Registrant has historically had the ability to
hold these investments until maturity, and therefore this has not had an adverse
impact on income or cash flows.

<PAGE>


resolution  or  resolutions  that some or all of any or all classes or series of
the stock of the Corporation shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution
shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until each certificate is
surrendered  to  the  Corporation.   Notwithstanding  the  adoption  of  such  a
resolution by the Board of Directors,  every holder of stock in the  Corporation
represented  by  certificates  and upon request  every holder of  uncertificated
shares shall be entitled to have a certificate  signed by, or in the name of the
Corporation,  by the  Chairman,  the President or a Vice  President,  and by the
Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant  Secretary,
representing  the  number  of  shares   registered  in  certificate  form.  Such
certificate  shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may  determine,  to
the extent  consistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and
these By-Laws. [Section 158.]

     Section  5.02.  Signatures;  Facsimile.  All  of  such  signatures  on  the
                     ----------------------
certificate  referred to in Section  5.01 of these  By-Laws may be a  facsimile,

transfer  agent or registrar who has signed,  or whose  facsimile  signature has
been placed upon a certificate  shall have ceased to be such  officer,  transfer
agent or registrar  before such  certificate is issued,  it may be issued by the
Corporation  with the same  effect as if he or she were such  officer,  transfer
agent or registrar at the date of issue. [Section 158.]

     Section  5.03.  Lost,  Stolen  or  Destroyed  Certificates.  The  Board  of
                     ------------------------------------------
Directors  may  direct  that  a new  certificate  be  issued  in  place  of  any
certificate  theretofore  issued by the  Corporation  alleged to have been lost,
stolen  or  destroyed,  upon  delivery  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  proof
satisfactory to the Board of Directors of such loss,  theft or destruction.  The
Board of  Directors  may  require  the owner of such lost,  stolen or  destroyed
certificate,  or his legal  representative,  to  advertise  such loss,  theft or
destruction in such manner as the Board of Directors may require and to give the
Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made
against it on account of the  alleged  loss,  theft or  destruction  of any such
certificate or the issuance of any such new certificate. [Section 167.]

     Section 5.04.  Transfer of Stock.  Upon surrender to the Corporation or the
                    -----------------
transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares,  duly endorsed or

thereto,  cancel the old certificate and record the transaction  upon its books.
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws,
the Board of Directors may prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it
may deem appropriate relating to the issue,  transfer and registration of shares
of the Corporation. [Section 151(f).]

     Section 5.05. Record Date. In order to determine the stockholders  entitled
                   -----------
to  notice  of or to vote at any  meeting  of  stockholders  or any  adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date on which the  resolution  fixing the record date
is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which shall not be more than sixty nor
less  than  ten  days  before  the  date of such  meeting.  A  determination  of
stockholders  of  record  entitled  to  notice  of or to  vote at a  meeting  of
stockholders shall apply to

                                       14
<PAGE>


any adjournment of the meeting,  provided,  however, that the Board of Directors
may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

     In order that the  Corporation may determine the  stockholders  entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights
of the  stockholders  entitled to exercise  any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock,  or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of  Directors  may fix a record  date,  which  record  date  shall not
precede  the date upon which the  resolution  fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed,  the record date for determining  stockholders  for any
such purpose  shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. [Section 213.]

certificate  for  registration  of  transfer,  the  Corporation  may  treat  the
registered  owner as the person  exclusively  entitled to receive  dividends and
other  distributions,  to vote, to receive  notice and otherwise to exercise all
the  rights  and  powers  of  the  owner  of  the  shares  represented  by  such
certificate,  and the Corporation  shall not be bound to recognize any equitable
or legal claim to or  interest  in such shares on the part of any other  person,
whether or not the  Corporation  shall have  notice of such claim or  interests.
Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral  security,  and not
absolutely,  it shall be so  expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the
certificates  are presented to the  Corporation  for transfer or  uncertificated
shares are  requested to be  transferred,  both the  transferor  and  transferee
request the Corporation to do so. [Section 159.]

     Section  5.07.  Transfer  Agent and  Registrar.  The Board of Directors may
                     ------------------------------

all certificates  representing shares to bear the signature of any such transfer
agents or registrars.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 6.01.  Nature of Indemnity.  The  Corporation  shall  indemnify any
                    -------------------
person  who  was or is a  party  or is  threatened  to be  made a  party  to any
threatened,  pending or completed  action,  suit or  proceeding,  whether civil,
criminal,  administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the  Corporation,  or
is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the  Corporation as a
director or officer, of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust
or other  enterprise,  or by reason of any action  alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity,  and may indemnify any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to such an action, suit or proceeding by reason
of the fact that he or she is or was or has  agreed to  become  an  employee  or
agent of the  Corporation,  or is or was  serving  or has agreed to serve at the
request of the  Corporation  as an  employee  or agent of  another  corporation,
partnership,   joint  venture,  trust  or  other  enterprise,  against  expenses
(including  attorneys'  fees),  judgments,  fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually  and  reasonably  incurred  by him or  her or on his or her  behalf  in
connection with such

                                       15
<PAGE>


action,  suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom,  if he or she (x) acted in
good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the  Corporation  and, in the case of any such employee
or agent,  in a manner he or she  reasonably  believed to be not in violation of
any  policies or  directives  of the  Corporation,  and (y) with  respect to any
criminal  action or  proceeding  had no  reasonable  cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful;  except that in the case of an action or suit by or in the
right  of  the  Corporation  to  procure  a  judgment  in  its  favor  (i)  such
indemnification  shall  be  limited  to  expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees)
actually and reasonably  incurred by such person in the defense or settlement of
such action or suit, and (ii) no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim,  issue or matter as to which such person  shall have been  adjudged to be
liable to the Corporation  unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court
of  Chancery  or the  court in which  such  action  or suit  was  brought  shall
determine upon  application  that,  despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the  circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses  which the Delaware Court of Chancery or
such other court shall deem proper. The indemnification  under this Section 6.01
shall apply to all  directors  and  officers of the  Corporation  who sit on the
boards of directors of non-profit corporations in keeping with the Corporation's
philosophy.

     The  termination  of any action,  suit or  proceeding  by judgment,  order,
settlement,  conviction,  or upon a plea of nolo  contendere or its  equivalent,
shall not, of itself,  create a presumption  that the person did not act in good
faith  and in a  manner  which  he or she  reasonably  believed  to be in or not
opposed to the best  interests  of the  Corporation,  and,  with  respect to any
criminal action or proceeding,  had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct
was unlawful.

     Section 6.02.  Successful Defense. To the extent that a director,  officer,
                    ------------------
employee  or agent of the  Corporation  has been  successful  on the  merits  or
otherwise in defense of any action,  suit or  proceeding  referred to in Section
6.01 of these By-Laws or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or
she shall be indemnified against expenses  (including  attorneys' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

     Section  6.03.   Determination   That   Indemnification   Is  Proper.   Any
                      ---------------------------------------------------
indemnification  of a director or officer of the Corporation  under Section 6.01
of these By-Laws  (unless  ordered by a court) shall be made by the  Corporation
unless a determination is made that  indemnification  of the director or officer
is not proper in the circumstances  because he or she has not met the applicable
standard  of  conduct  set  forth  in  Section  6.01  of  these   By-Laws.   Any
indemnification of an employee or agent of the Corporation under Section 6.01 of
these By-Laws (unless ordered by a court) may be made by the Corporation  upon a
determination  that  indemnification  of the  employee or agent is proper in the
circumstances  because he or she has met the applicable  standard of conduct set
forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws. Any such determination shall be made (i)
by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action,  suit or
proceeding,  even  though  less  than a  quorum,  or (ii) if  there  are no such
directors,  or if such directors so direct,  by  independent  legal counsel in a
written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders.

     Section 6.04. Advance Payment of Expenses.  Expenses (including  attorneys'
                   ---------------------------
fees)  incurred  by a  director  or officer in  defending  any civil,  criminal,
administrative or investigative

                                       16
<PAGE>

action,  suit or proceeding  shall be paid by the  Corporation in advance of the
final  disposition  of  such  action,  suit or  proceeding  upon  receipt  of an
undertaking  by or on behalf of the  director or officer to repay such amount if
it  shall  ultimately  be  determined  that  he or  she is  not  entitled  to be
indemnified  by the  Corporation  as authorized  in this Article.  Such expenses
(including  attorneys'  fees)  incurred by other  employees and agents may be so
paid upon such terms and  conditions,  if any, as the Board of  Directors  deems
appropriate.  The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporation's  counsel to
represent  such  director,  officer,  employee or agent in any  action,  suit or
proceeding,  whether or not the  Corporation is a party to such action,  suit or
proceeding.

     Section 6.05. Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  Any
                   -------------------------------------------------------
indemnification  of a director or officer of the Corporation under Sections 6.01
and 6.02 of these  By-Laws,  or  advance of costs,  charges  and  expenses  to a
director or officer under Section 6.04 of these By-Laws, shall be made promptly,
and in any event within thirty days, upon the written request of the director or
officer.  If a determination  by the Corporation that the director or officer is
entitled  to  indemnification  pursuant  to this  Article is  required,  and the
Corporation  fails  to  respond  within  sixty  days to a  written  request  for
indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved such request. If the
Corporation  denies a written  request for indemnity or advancement of expenses,
in whole or in part,  or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made
within thirty days, the right to  indemnification or advances as granted by this
Article  shall  be  enforceable  by the  director  or  officer  in any  court of
competent jurisdiction.  Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection
with  successfully  establishing  his right to  indemnification,  in whole or in
part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.  It shall
be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for the  advance of costs,  charges and  expenses  under  Section  6.04 of these
By-Laws where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by or tendered
to the  Corporation)  that the  claimant has not met the standard of conduct set
forth in Section 6.01 of these  By-Laws,  but the burden of proving such defense
shall be on the Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation  (including
its Board of Directors,  its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to
have  made a  determination  prior  to the  commencement  of  such  action  that
indemnification  of the claimant is proper in the  circumstances  because he has
met the  applicable  standard  of  conduct  set forth in  Section  6.01 of these
By-Laws,  nor the fact  that  there  has  been an  actual  determination  by the
Corporation  (including its Board of Directors,  its independent  legal counsel,
and its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable  standard of
conduct,  shall be a defense  to the  action or  create a  presumption  that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

     Section  6.06.  Survival;  Preservation  of  Other  Rights.  The  foregoing
                     ------------------------------------------
indemnification  provisions  shall  be  deemed  to  be a  contract  between  the
Corporation  and each  director,  officer,  employee and agent who serves in any
such  capacity  at any  time  while  these  provisions  as well as the  relevant
provisions  of the  General  Corporation  Law are in  effect  and any  repeal or
modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with
respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any action, suit or
proceeding  previously or thereafter  brought or threatened based in whole or in
part upon any such state of facts.  Such a "contract

                                       17
<PAGE>


right" may not be modified  retroactively  without the consent of such director,
officer, employee or agent.

     The  indemnification  provided  by this  Article  VI  shall  not be  deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those  indemnified  may be entitled under
any By-Law,  agreement,  vote of  stockholders  or  disinterested  directors  or
otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in
another  capacity  while holding such office,  and shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director,  officer,  employee or agent and shall inure to
the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

     Section  6.07.  Insurance.   The  Corporation  may  purchase  and  maintain
                     ---------
insurance  on  behalf  of any  person  who is or was or has  agreed  to become a
director or officer of the  Corporation,  or is or was serving at the request of
the  Corporation as a director or officer of another  corporation,  partnership,
joint venture,  trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against
him or her  and  incurred  by him  or her or on his or her  behalf  in any  such
capacity,  or  arising  out of his or her  status  as such,  whether  or not the
Corporation  would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability
under the provisions of this Article,  provided that such insurance is available
on acceptable terms, which  determination  shall be made by a vote of a majority
of the entire Board of Directors.

     Section 6.08. Severability.  If this Article or any portion hereof shall be
                   ------------
invalidated  on any  ground by any  court of  competent  jurisdiction,  then the
Corporation  shall  nevertheless  indemnify  each  director  or officer  and may
indemnify  each employee or agent of the  Corporation  as to costs,  charges and
expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees)  judgments,  fines and  amounts  paid in
settlement  with  respect to any  action,  suit or  proceeding,  whether  civil,
criminal,  administrative  or  investigative,  including  an action by or in the
right of the  Corporation,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by any  applicable
portion of this Article that shall not have been  invalidated and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

     Section 7.01.  Dividends.  Subject to any applicable  provisions of law and

may be declared by the Board of Directors  at any regular or special  meeting of
the Board of Directors and any such dividend may be paid in cash,  property,  or

     A member of the Board of Directors, or a member of any Committee designated
by the Board of Directors shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon
the records of the Corporation and upon such information,  opinions,  reports or
statements presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees,  or
Committees of the Board of  Directors,  or by any other person as to matters the
director  reasonably  believes are within such other  person's  professional  or
expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on

behalf of the Corporation, as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities

Management's Discussion and Analysis

Operating Results

Revenues and earnings reached record levels during each of the past three fiscal
years. During fiscal '00 revenues increased 13% to almost $6.3 billion. Prior to
non-recurring  charges  in '99,  pre-tax  earnings  increased  21%  and  diluted
earnings per share  increased  16% to $1.31.  During fiscal '99 the Company sold
several  businesses and decided to exit several other  businesses and contracts.
The Company also recorded  transaction  costs and other  adjustments  related to
Employer Services'  acquisition of Vincam. The combination of these transactions
resulted in  non-recurring  charges of $0.03 in fiscal '99. Fiscal '00 was ADP's
39th consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth since becoming a
public company in 1961.

      Revenues and revenue growth by ADP's major business units are shown below:

                     -----------------------------   --------------------------
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


      Consolidated  revenues  grew 13% in fiscal '00  primarily  from  increased
market  penetration,  from an expanded array of products and services,  and from
increased  transaction  volume,  with relatively minor  contributions from price
increases.   Prior  to  acquisitions  and   dispositions,   revenues   increased
approximately 15%.

      The  consolidated  pre-tax margin was 20.5% in '00, 19.3% in '99 (prior to
non-recurring  charges)  and  18.1% in '98.  Pre-tax  margin  improved  over the
previous year as continued  automation  and operating  efficiencies  enabled the
Company to offset accelerated investments in new products, increased spending on
systems  development  and  programming,  and the  impact  of  transitioning  the
investment portfolio from tax-exempt to taxable instruments.

      Certain  revenues  and  expenses  are  charged to  business  units at a
standard rate for management and  motivation  reasons.  Other costs are recorded
based on  management  responsibility.  As a result,  various  income and expense
items,  including certain  non-recurring  gains and losses,  are recorded at the
corporate  level and certain  shared costs are not  allocated.  The prior years'
business unit revenues and pre-tax earnings have been restated to reflect fiscal
year 2000 budgeted foreign exchange rates.

<PAGE>

Employer Services

Employer  Services'  revenues  grew 11% in fiscal  '00,  and in the  absence  of
acquisitions and  dispositions  revenue growth would have been about 12% in '00,
and 15% in both '99 and '98.

      Employer  Services'  operating  margin was 21.4% in '00, 20.6% in '99 and
20.2% in `98.  Employer  Services'  operating  margin  improved due to operating
efficiencies  and the prior year  dispositions of several  businesses,  slightly
offset by investments in new products and acquisitions.

      Employer   Services'revenues   shown  above  include  interest  earned  on
collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients at a standard rate of 6%.

Brokerage Services

Brokerage  Services'  revenue  growth  of 29% was  impacted  by the  prior  year
dispositions of the front-office business and several other small, non-strategic
businesses.  In the absence of  acquisitions  and  dispositions,  revenue growth
would  have  been  about 31% in '00 aided by  record  brokerage  trade  volumes,
compared to 21% in '99 and 22% in '98.

      Brokerage Services' operating margin was 23% in '00 compared to 19% in '99
and 15% in '98. The improved margin resulted from the prior year dispositions of
several unprofitable businesses and strong trade processing activity.

      In '99 the Company divested the $150 million revenue  front-office "market
data"  business and as part of the agreement  took a minority  investment in the
acquiring company.

Dealer Services

Dealer  Services'  revenues  were  roughly  flat  in  '00.  In  the  absence  of
acquisitions and  dispositions,  '00 revenue growth would have been 3%, compared
to 7% in '99 and 8% in '98. Dealer  Services'  operating margin increased to 16%
in fiscal '00 compared to 15% in '99 and 14% in '98. Dealer Services'  operating
margin improved  primarily from operating  efficiencies in North America and the
dispositions of several small businesses in '00 and '99.

Other

The primary components of "Other" revenues are Claims Services, foreign exchange
differences,  and  miscellaneous  processing  services.  "Other"  also  includes
interest on corporate  investments of $119 million, $84 million, and $82 million
in '00, '99 and '98,  respectively.  In  addition,  "Other"  revenues  have been
adjusted for the  difference  between actual  interest  earned on invested funds
held for clients and interest  credited to Employer  Services at a standard rate
of 6%.

      During fiscal '00 the Company transitioned a portion of its corporate and
client fund  investments  from  tax-exempt  to taxable  instruments  in order to
increase  liquidity  of the overall  portfolio.  Approximately  $2.6  billion of
tax-exempt  investments  were  sold  prior  to  maturity  at a  pre-tax  loss of
approximately  $32 million ($10 million  corporate funds, $22 million funds held
for clients),  and the proceeds were  reinvested at higher  prevailing  interest
rates, which will benefit future periods.

      During fiscal '99 the Company sold its Peachtree Software and Brokerage
Services front-office  businesses,  and decided to exit several other businesses
and contracts.  The combination of these  transactions and certain other charges
resulted in an approximately  $37 million  reduction in general,  administrative
and selling expenses and a $40 million provision for income taxes.

      Additionally,  '99 includes approximately $21 million of transaction costs
and other  adjustments in general,  administrative  and selling  expenses,  ($14
million  after-tax)   recorded  by  Vincam  prior  to  the  March  1999  pooling
transaction.


      In each of the past three years,  investments in systems  development  and
programming  have increased to accelerate  automation,  migrate to new computing
technologies, and develop new products.

      Certain  member   countries  of  the  European  Union  have  agreed  to
transition  to the  Euro as a new  common  legal  currency.  The  costs  of this
transition are not expected to have a material effect on ADP.

      In '00 the Company's effective tax rate was 34.8%. Excluding the impact
of non-recurring charges associated with certain acquisitions,  dispositions and
other activities, the effective tax rate was 33.2% in '99, and 31.7% in '98. The
increased rate is primarily a result of non-taxable  investment income declining
as a percentage  of pre-tax  income.  The  transition,  referred to above,  of a
portion  of the  Company's  investment  portfolio  to taxable  investments  will
continue to increase the Company's effective tax rate in fiscal '01.

      For '01 ADP is planning  another  record year with revenue growth of about
13% to 15% and diluted earnings per share growth of 16% to 18% over '00 results.

Financial Condition

ADP's financial condition and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong. At June
30,  2000,   cash  and   marketable   securities   approximated   $2.5  billion.
Shareholders'  equity was almost $4.6 billion,  and return on average equity for
the year was about 20%. The ratio of  long-term  debt to equity at June 30, 2000
was 3%.

      Cash flow from operating activities  approximated $1.1 billion in '00 with
another excellent year expected in '01.

      In '00 4.6 million  shares of common  stock were  purchased  at an average
price of approximately $43 as part of an ongoing program to fund  equity-related
employee  benefits.  The Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to
19.9 million additional shares.

      In '00 zero coupon convertible  subordinated notes were converted to about
0.8 million shares of common stock.

      During '00 the Company purchased several businesses for approximately $200
million  in cash  and  common  stock.  The cost of  acquisitions  in '99 and '98
aggregated $107 million and $351 million, respectively.

      During  '99 the  Company  issued  7.2  million  shares of common  stock to
acquire Vincam in a pooling of interests transaction,  and the Company's results
were  restated  accordingly.  The Company also  acquired  several  businesses in
fiscal '99  (subsequent  to the Vincam  merger) and '98 in pooling of  interests
transactions in exchange for  approximately  4 million,  and 1 million shares of
common stock, respectively. The Company's consolidated financial statements were
not restated because in the aggregate these transactions were not material.

      Capital expenditures during '00 were $166 million following investments of
$178  million in '99 and $202  million in '98.  Capital  spending  in fiscal '01
should approximate $225 million.

      Approximately  half  of the  Company's  overall  investment  portfolio  is
invested in overnight interest-bearing instruments, which are therefore impacted
immediately  by  changes in  interest  rates.  The other  half of the  Company's
investment portfolio is invested in fixed-income securities,  with maturities up
to five and a half  years,  which  are  also  subject  to  interest  rate  risk,
including  reinvestment  risk. The Company has  historically  had the ability to
hold these investments until maturity, and therefore this has not had an adverse
impact on income or cash flows.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A.  Consolidation  and Basis of  Preparation.  The  consolidated  financial
statements include the financial results of Automatic Data Processing,  Inc. and
its  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  Intercompany  balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

      The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the  amounts  reported  in the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from these
estimates.

B. Revenue Recognition. Service revenues, including monthly license, maintenance
and other fees,  are  recognized  as services  are  provided.  Prepaid  software
licenses and the gross profit on the sale of hardware is  recognized  in revenue
primarily at  installation  and client  acceptance  with a portion  deferred and
recognized on the straight-line basis over the initial contract period. Interest
earnings  on  collected  but not yet  remitted  funds  held for  clients  are an
integral  part of certain of the Employer  Services  product  offerings  and are
recognized  in  revenues as earned.  Professional  Employer  Organization  (PEO)
revenues are net of pass-through costs, which include wages and taxes.

C. Cash and Cash Equivalents.  Highly-liquid investments with a maturity of
ninety days or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

D. Investments.  Short-term and long-term  marketable  securities and funds held
for clients are primarily invested in high-grade fixed-income  instruments.  All
of the Company's marketable  securities,  including $3,363 million of funds held
for clients,  are  considered to be  "available-for-sale"  at June 30, 2000 and,
accordingly,  are  carried  on the  balance  sheet  at fair  market  value.  The
remainder  of the funds held for  clients  are cash  equivalents.  Approximately
$1,702 million of the  "available-for-sale"  investments mature in less than one
year, $1,058 million in 1-2 years,  $1,060 million in 2-3 years, $284 million in
3-4 years, and $484 million in 5-6 years.

E. Property,  Plant and Equipment.  Property, plant and equipment is stated
at cost and  depreciated  over the  estimated  useful lives of the assets by the
straight-line method.  Leasehold  improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

      The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data processing equipment                                           2 to 3 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buildings                                                         20 to 40 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furniture and fixtures                                              3 to 7 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F.  Intangibles.  Intangible  assets  are  recorded  at cost  and are  amortized
primarily on the straight-line basis. Goodwill is amortized over periods from 10
to 40 years, and is periodically  reviewed for impairment by comparing  carrying
value to undiscounted expected future cash flows. If impairment is indicated,  a
write-down to fair value (normally measured by discounting estimated future cash
flows) is taken.

G.  Foreign  Currency  Translation.  The net  assets  of the  Company's  foreign
subsidiaries  are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect
at the end of each period,  and revenues and expenses are  translated at average
exchange rates during the periods.  Currency  transaction gains or losses, which
are  included  in the  results of  operations,  are  immaterial  for all periods
presented.  Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in other
comprehensive income on the balance sheet.

I. Restatement of Prior Financial Statements. Certain reclassifications and
restatements, including the inclusion of funds held for clients and client funds
obligations  on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  have been made to  previous
years' financial statements to conform to current presentation.

Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions

      During  fiscal  2000,  1999,  and  1998,  the  Company  purchased  several
businesses  for  approximately  $200  million  (including  $25 million in common
stock),  $107 million and $351 million  (including $13 million in common stock),
respectively, net of cash acquired. The results of these acquired businesses are
included from the date of acquisition.

      In March 1999 the  Company  issued 7.2 million  shares of common  stock to
acquire The Vincam  Group  (Vincam),  a leading  PEO  providing a suite of human
resource functions to small- and medium-sized  employers on an outsourced basis,
in a pooling of interests  transaction.  The Company also acquired several other
businesses in fiscal 1999  (subsequent  to the Vincam  acquisition)  and 1998 in
pooling of interests  transactions in exchange for approximately 4.3 million and
0.9 million shares of common stock, respectively.

      Additionally, in fiscal 2000 and 1999, the Company sold several businesses
with  annual   revenues  of   approximately   $27  million  and  $270   million,
respectively.  As part of the 1999 business  dispositions,  the Company received
$90 million of  convertible  preferred  stock which is included in other assets.
The $90 million approximates fair value.


Note 3. Non-recurring Items

<PAGE>

During  fiscal  1999 the  Company  sold its  Peachtree  Software  and  Brokerage
Services front-office "market data" businesses and decided to exit several other
businesses and contracts.  The  combination  of these  transactions  and certain
other non-recurring  charges resulted in a net pre-tax gain of approximately $37
million and a $40 million provision for income taxes.

      Additionally,  1999 also includes approximately $21 million of transaction
costs and other  non-recurring  adjustments ($14 million after-tax)  recorded by
Vincam prior to the March 1999 pooling transaction.


Note 4. Receivables

Accounts  receivable is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $48 million
and $46 million at June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

      The  Company  finances  the sale of  computer  systems  to  certain of its
clients.  These finance  receivables,  most of which are due from automobile and
truck dealerships, are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



      Unearned  income from finance  receivables  represents the excess of gross
receivables  over the sales price of the  computer  systems  financed.  Unearned
income is  amortized  using the interest  method to maintain a constant  rate of
return on the net investment over the term of each contract.

or through  acquisitions) to provide data processing  services to various groups
of clients  (amortized  over periods from 5 to 36 years) and purchased  software
(amortized over periods from 3 to 10 years). Amortization of intangibles totaled

      The  zero  coupon  convertible  subordinated  notes  have a face  value of
approximately $159 million at June 30, 2000 and mature February 20, 2012, unless
converted or redeemed earlier. At June 30, 2000, the notes were convertible into
approximately  4.1 million shares of the Company's  common stock.  The notes are
callable at the option of the Company,  and the holders of the notes can convert
into common  stock at any time or require  redemption  in 2002 and 2007.  During
fiscal 2000 and 1999,  approximately  $31 million and $101 million face value of
notes were  converted  or  redeemed. <PAGE>

 As of June 30, 2000 and 1999,  the quoted market prices for the zero coupon
notes were approximately $208 million and $197 million,  respectively.  The fair
value of the other debt, included above, approximates its carrying value.

      During fiscal 2000 and 1999,  the average  interest rate for notes payable
was 5.0% and 4.3%, respectively.

Note 7. Funds Held for Clients and Client Funds Obligations

As part of its integrated  payroll and payroll tax filing services,  the Company
impounds funds for federal,  state and local employment taxes from approximately
350,000 clients; files annually over 17 million returns;  handles all regulatory
correspondence,  amendments, and penalty and interest disputes; remits the funds
to the appropriate tax agencies; and handles other employer-related services. In
addition  to fees paid by  clients  for these  services,  the  Company  receives
interest during the interval between the receipt and disbursement of these funds
by investing  the funds  primarily in  fixed-income  instruments.  The amount of
collected but not yet remitted  funds for the  Company's  payroll and tax filing
and certain other  services  varies  significantly  during the year and averaged
approximately $6.9 billion in fiscal 2000, $5.9 billion in fiscal 1999, and $5.2
billion in fiscal 1998.


Note 8. Employee Benefit Plans

A. Stock  Plans.  The  Company  has stock  option  plans  which  provide for the
issuance to eligible  employees of incentive and  non-qualified  stock  options,
which may expire as much as 10 years from the date of grant,  at prices not less
than the fair  market  value on the date of grant.  At June 30,  2000 there were
9,400  participants  in the plans.  The  aggregate  purchase  price for  options
outstanding at June 30, 2000 was approximately $1.3 billion.  The options expire
at various points between 2000 and 2010.

      In  addition  to  fixed  rentals,   certain  leases  require   payment  of
maintenance  and real estate taxes and contain  escalation  provisions  based on
future adjustments in price indices.

      In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims
and  litigation.  The Company  does not  believe  that the  resolution  of these
matters will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 11. Financial Data By Segment

Employer  Services,  Brokerage  Services and Dealer  Services are the  Company's
largest business units. ADP evaluates performance of its business units based on
recurring operating results before interest on corporate funds, income taxes and
foreign currency gains and losses.  Certain revenues and expenses are charged to
business units at a standard rate for management and motivation  reasons.  Other
costs are recorded  based on  management  responsibility.  As a result,  various
income and expense items,  including certain non-recurring gains and losses, are
recorded at the  corporate  level and certain  shared  costs are not  allocated.
Goodwill amortization is charged to business units at an accelerated rate to act
as a surrogate  for the cost of capital for  acquisitions.  Interest on invested
funds held for clients are recorded in Employer  Services revenues at a standard
rate of 6%, with the adjustment to actual  revenues  included in "Other".  Prior
years' business unit revenues and pre-tax earnings have been restated to reflect
fiscal year 2000 budgeted foreign  exchange rates.  Business unit assets include
funds held for clients but exclude  corporate  cash,  marketable  securities and
goodwill.  "Other" consists  primarily of Claims Services,  corporate  expenses,
non-recurring items and the reconciling items referred to above.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

     Management is responsible for the preparation of the accompanying financial
statements.  The  financial  statements,  which  include  amounts  based  on the
application  of  business  judgments,  have been  prepared  in  conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles.  Deloitte & Touche LLP,  independent
certified public accountants, have audited our consolidated financial statements
as described in their report.

     The  Company  maintains  financial  control  systems  designed  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  that assets are  safeguarded  and that  transactions  are
executed and recorded in accordance with management  authorization.  The control
systems  are  supported  by written  policies  and the  control  environment  is
regularly  evaluated  by both the  Company's  internal  auditors  and Deloitte &
Touche.

     The Board of  Directors  has an Audit  Committee  comprised of four outside
directors.  The Audit  Committee  meets  with  both  Deloitte  & Touche  and the
internal  auditors  with and without  management's  presence.  It  monitors  and
reviews the Company's financial statements and internal controls,  and the scope
of the internal auditors' and Deloitte & Touche's audits.  Deloitte & Touche and
the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey


     We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Automatic
Data  Processing,  Inc. and  subsidiaries  as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, and the
related  consolidated  statements of earnings,  shareholders'  equity,  and cash
flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  June 30,  2000.  These
consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards  require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations
and its cash  flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  June 30,
2000, in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
