                                        PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
- -----------------

    Automatic Data Processing, Inc., incorporated in Delaware in 1961, and its
subsidiaries (collectively, "ADP") are engaged in the computing services
business.  The following summary describes ADP's activities.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT

    All of ADP's computing services enable clients to process and/or distribute
data (their own, ADP's or that of third parties) and/or to interactively access
and utilize ADP and third party databases and information, utilizing ADP's
batch, interactive and client site systems.

EMPLOYER SERVICES

    ADP's Employer Services offers a comprehensive range of payroll, payroll
tax filing and reporting, human resource (HR), benefits administration, time and
attendance, 401(k) recordkeeping, and unemployment compensation management
services.  These services are provided to over 395,000 clients engaged in a wide
variety of businesses.  In addition to its direct marketing, ADP has marketing
relationships with many banks and accountants whereby ADP offers its services to
their business clients.

    Payroll and tax filing and reporting services comprise over 85% of Employer
Services' revenue.  Payroll services include the preparation of pay checks and
direct deposits (with major bank partners), along with supporting journals,
summaries and management reports.  ADP also supplies the quarterly and annual
social security, medicare, and federal, state and local income tax withholding
reports required to be filed by employers and employees.  ADP's tax filing
services process federal, state and local payroll taxes on behalf of ADP clients
and remit such taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities when due.  As new
products evolve (such as new hire reporting, ADP check/full service direct
deposit and wage garnishment payment), the ADP Tax Filing center is also
responsible for the efficient movement of funds and information to third
parties.

    As market trends increasingly favor both outsourcing and software as
preferred payroll solutions, ADP's "Payroll AnyWay" strategy presents to
businesses of virtually every size and type an extensive menu of outsourced and
on-site payroll solutions, from turnkey service to client-site software. 
Employers are segmented by size and complexity to effectively match their needs
to products and service teams that will best meet their expectations. 
Approximately 35% of Employer Services' payroll and payroll tax filing services
revenue during the past fiscal year was attributable to its Emerging Business
Services (for companies with less than 100 employees); approximately 35% of such
revenue was attributable to Major Accounts (for companies with between 100 and
999 employees) and approximately 30% of such revenue was attributable to
National Accounts (for companies with 1,000 or more employees).

    ADP's HR services, operating in conjunction with a client's payroll
database, provide comprehensive recordkeeping HR services, including benefits
administration and outsourcing, applicant tracking, employee history and
position control.  The various HR systems run on standalone PC's, local or wide
area networks or client/server systems.



                                         -1-
<PAGE>

    Emerging Business Services processes payroll for approximately 300,000
clients.  Major Accounts offers a robust line of best-of-breed payroll and human
resource solutions for medium-size companies with full database and functional
integration between payroll and HR.  Many of the world's largest corporations
are ADP National Accounts clients.  In many cases, ADP provides system solutions
for clients' entire human resource, payroll and benefits needs.  For those
companies who choose to process these applications in-house, ADP delivers
stand-alone services such as tax filing, check printing and distribution,
year-end statements (W-2's), and benefits administration.

    The ADP Tax Filing Center, which supports all three market segments,
electronically interfaces with over 2,000 tax agencies from the Internal Revenue
Service to local school districts.  Over 285,000 clients rely on tax filing to
assure regulatory compliance.

    ADP's Electronic Services Division complements Employer Services' market
segments with a product mix that augments ADP's payroll and HR services. 
Included in such product mix are 401(k) recordkeeping and administrative
services (relating to defined benefit plans), flexible spending, healthcare and
other group benefits plans, and a comprehensive time and attendance system fully
integrated into ADP's payroll systems.  ADP's unemployment compensation services
aid clients in managing and reducing unemployment insurance costs.  Peachtree
and One Write software business applications are sold to small clients through
retail channels.

    ADP's penetration of the benefits administration market accelerated with
its acquisition of Health Benefits America, a provider of health care benefits
design and communications programs, COBRA administration and other relevant
services.  ADP has firmly established itself as a leading professional employer
organization through its TotalSource acquisition and positioned itself to
aggressively increase its presence in the fast-expanding employee leasing
industry.

    The continued increase in multinational companies makes payroll and human
resource management services a global opportunity.  This development and a
strong demand for outsourcing makes Europe a particularly attractive
marketplace.  Employer Services already has 35,000 payroll and HR clients in
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom.  The core of ADP's strength in the European market currently is
in the larger company segment - those firms with 1,000 or more employees.  The
goal is to expand Employer Services to all major countries in Europe and be the
leading provider of outsourcing and on-site services for employer solutions in
all market segments.

    ADP has also become the largest provider of payroll services to Canadian
businesses with its recent purchases of the Royal Bank of Canada's and
Scotiabank's payroll businesses.  ADP's recent acquisition of a Brazilian
computing services company gives it a strong initial position in the growing
South American employer services marketplace.

BROKERAGE SERVICES

    ADP's Brokerage Services provides securities processing, real-time market 
information, and investor communications services to the financial services 
industry.  ADP is the largest provider of securities processing services in 
North America.  In fiscal 1997, ADP processed approximately 20% of the retail 
equity transactions in the United States and Canada, handling an average of 
over 475,000 trades per day.  In the market information sector, Brokerage 
Services supports more than 97,000 desktops in over 1,600 firms worldwide.  
ADP provides shareholder communication services, handling all shareholder 
mailings and proxy processing for shareholders whose securities are left in 
"street name" 

                                         -2-
<PAGE>

in the custody of ADP's "nominee" clients (principally brokerage firms and
banks).  In fiscal 1997, ADP processed over 285 million shareholder mailings for
over 12,000 publicly-traded companies on behalf of more than 800 brokerage firms
and banks and 400 mutual fund families.  Shareholder ballots representing
approximately 155 billion shares were electronically processed.    

    ADP provides front-office database, news, analytic and quotation services
for the investment and brokerage community through terminals located on brokers'
desks.  ADP provides such services through interactive work stations (utilizing
client-server architecture) for all active equity securities, commodities,
currencies, and interest rate futures.  ADP also offers its international
clients real-time news processing systems, real-time fixed income, foreign
exchange and money market information, and sophisticated analytics.

    ADP provides back-office stock brokerage and related financial computing
services such as trade processing, cage management, stock loan accounting,
on-line inquiry and data collection, portfolio reporting, order matching and
on-line trading.  All of these services are offered in the United States and
Canada.  ADP's Wilco Systems' Gloss series international trading and settlement
systems offer global multi-instrument, multi-currency trading, settlement and
accounting services.

    As part of its shareholder communication services, StreetLink is a quickly
deliverable laser printed alternative to expensive quarterly mailings to
shareholders.  Proxy Edge is an electronic voting service which dramatically
improves voting efficiency and record keeping.  PhoneVOTE Services enable mutual
fund shareholders to vote their proxy over the telephone for same-day
tabulation.

DEALER SERVICES

    ADP's Dealer Services provides computing, data and professional services to
automobile and truck dealers and manufacturers world-wide.  Over 18,000 dealers
use ADP's on-site systems and communications networks to manage every area of
sales and operations in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Mexico and Taiwan.  ADP
addresses critical dealership areas and offers software and professional
services to improve consumer loyalty, asset management, innovative technology,
employee productivity training, manufacturer relations, business improvements
and real-time information access.

    It offers clients a service solution which includes ADP computer hardware,
licensed software, software support and hardware maintenance services.  Clients
use ADP's systems to manage their accounting, inventory, factory communications,
scheduling, leasing, sales and service activities.  ADP establishes and
maintains communications networks for its clients which allow interactive
communications between manufacturers and their respective dealers.  These
communication networks are used for new vehicle ordering, status inquiry and
warranty claims, parts and vehicle locating, credit checks, vehicle repair
estimating, vehicle registration and vehicle lienholder information.

    ADP continues to automate the business processes for its clients through
value-added products such as paperless parts cataloging, repair shop pricing and
scheduling, laser printing, and data archiving and document storage.

    Changes in customer expectations and manufacturer's requirements are
modifying how the traditional dealership conducts business.  In response to
these changes, ADP is providing consulting services to its dealer clients to
help them reengineer their management processes.  It also offers solutions to
help employee productivity and training, and provides the tools and services
necessary to improve dealership productivity and profitability.




                                         -3-
<PAGE>

CLAIMS SERVICES

    ADP offers a broad line of claims information products to property and
casualty insurance companies, claims adjusters, repair shops and auto parts
recycling facilities in the United States and Canada to help its clients
accurately estimate auto damage, bodily injury and property claims.  The
services include automated collision damage repair estimating for cars and
trucks, vehicle valuation services for total losses, and parts locating and
pricing services to auto insurers and repairers to facilitate the claims
settlement and parts locating processes.  ADP provides management information
and vehicle damageability and repair cost statistics to insurance companies,
government agencies and automobile manufacturers.  A pen-based, mobile auto
estimating system, using state-of-the-art technology and graphical user
interfaces, has won broad market acceptance.

    ADP provides, through its Integrated Medical Solutions business,
services that evaluate the appropriateness of medical treatment and invoicing
for bodily injury claims arising from motor vehicle accidents.  The core
product, Provider Bill Audit (PBA), is an expert system that performs fee and
utilization audits of medical provider bills involving soft tissue injury and
that provides auto insurers with a consistent methodology for assessing the
proper diagnoses and treatment of automobile-related injuries.  The Injury
Claims Evaluations product compliments the PBA system with proprietary injury
valuations, helping adjusters to make fair and equitable settlements when usual
and customary costs are disputed.

NATURE OF SERVICES PROVIDED

    In each of Employer Services, Dealer Services, Claims Services and most of
Brokerage Services, ADP's services primarily involve the processing and
utilization of client and/or third party data.  In the front-office component of
the Brokerage Services business, the primary service takes the form of providing
securities, commodities and currencies quotation data (which data is provided by
various exchanges) and news to clients; this front-office component represents
less than 10% of consolidated revenue.

    Services to all industries are generally available by the electronic
transmission (through communications lines) of computer-generated data and
information from and to clients.  Services are offered through a variety of
systems and networks which run on industry-standard operating systems. 
Virtually none of ADP's services require ADP-proprietary hardware and/or
operating systems.

    All of ADP's services utilize somewhat similar facilities, computers,
communications networks, salesforces, and client service support personnel. 
ADP's businesses share numerous facilities, selected computer rooms and
communications networks, and ADP occasionally transfers some of its employees
among business units.  The input and output of all of ADP's businesses is data
and information.  On occasion ADP has transferred services and products between
business units.

    While the labor intensiveness of a service may vary somewhat based on the
degree of automation and complexity in providing the service, all services use
the same basic functions as described above.  None of ADP's service offerings
are particularly capital intensive.

MARKETS AND MARKETING METHODS

    All of ADP's services are sold broadly across the United States and Canada. 
Non-North American services amounted to approximately 12.5% of fiscal 1997
revenue.  All services use 



                                         -4-
<PAGE>

common marketing techniques, including direct sales methodologies with emphasis
on referral sources.

    None of ADP's major business groups have a single homogenous client base or
market.  For example, while Brokerage Services primarily serves the retail
brokerage market, it also serves banks, commodity dealers, the institutional
brokerage market and individual non-brokerage corporations.  Dealer Services
primarily serves automobile dealers, but also serves truck and agricultural
equipment dealers, auto repair shops, used car lots, state departments of motor
vehicles, and manufacturers of automobiles, trucks and agricultural equipment. 
Claims Services has many clients who are insurance companies, but also provides
services to automobile manufacturers, body repair shops, salvage yards,
distributors of new and used automobile parts and other non-insurance clients. 
Employer Services has clients from a large variety of industries and markets. 
Within this client base are concentrations of clients in specific industries. 
While concentrations of clients exist, no one business group is material to
ADP's overall revenue.  Employer Services also sells to auto dealers, brokerage
clients, and insurance clients.

    None of ADP's businesses are overly sensitive to price changes.  Economic
conditions among selected clients and groups of clients may and do have a
temporary impact on demand for ADP's services.

    ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and
does not believe any major service or business unit in ADP is subject to unique
market risk.

COMPETITION

    The computing services industry is highly competitive.  ADP knows of no
reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but
it believes that it is one of the largest independent computing services
companies in the United States.

    ADP's competitors include other independent computing services companies,
divisions of diversified enterprises and banks.  Another competitive factor in
the computing services industry is the in-house computing function, whereby a
company installs and operates its own computing systems.

    Competition in the computing services industry is primarily based on 
service responsiveness, product quality and price.  ADP believes that it is 
very competitive in each of these areas and that there are no material 
negative factors impacting ADP's competitive position in the computing 
services industry. No one competitor or group of competitors is dominant in 
the computing services industry.

CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS

    ADP provides computing services to over 400,000 clients.  Annual revenues 
attributable to large client accounts range from $1 million to approximately 
$50 million per client, while thousands of small client accounts produce 
annual revenues of less than $1,000 each.  ADP's largest single client 
accounts for approximately 1% of its annual revenue.

    ADP has no material "backlog" because the period between the time a 
client agrees to use ADP's services and the time the service begins is 
generally very short and because no sale is considered firm until it is 
installed and begins producing revenue.

                                         -5-
<PAGE>

    ADP's average client retention is seven years in Employer Services and is
ten or more years in Brokerage, Dealer and Claims Services, and does not vary
significantly from period to period.

    Discounts, rebates and promotions offered by ADP to clients are not
material.

    ADP's services are provided under written Price Quotations or Services
Agreements having varying terms and conditions.  No one Price Quotation or
Service Agreement is material to ADP.

SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING

    During the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, ADP spent
$296,544,000, $249,635,000 and $193,173,000, respectively, on systems
development and programming activities for the development of new, and the
improvement and maintenance of existing, computing services.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

    ADP continually upgrades, enhances and expands its existing products and
services.  Generally, no new product or service has a significant effect on
ADP's revenue or negatively impacts its existing products and services, and each
existing product and service has a significant remaining life cycle.

LICENSES

    ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and
databases.  ADP's business is not dependent upon a single license or group of
licenses. Licenses, patents, trademarks and franchises are not material to ADP's
business as a whole.

COMPENSATION OF MARKETING AND SALES PERSONNEL

    The compensation arrangements of ADP's marketing and sales personnel vary
significantly based on the tenure of the particular salesperson, with the
commission-based portion of total compensation averaging approximately 40%.  ADP
sets minimum sales quotas on an individual basis.

COMPUTER SYSTEMS

    ADP does not manufacture computer systems or act as a distributor of
computer systems.  ADP may, however, be deemed to be a value-added reseller of
computer systems insofar as its services often include computer equipment as
part of the total service solution.

    ADP's services are offered on a variety of computer platforms which run
various operating systems.  These computer platforms include those offered by
IBM, IBM-compatibles, Digital Equipment Corporation, Apple, Motorola, Hewlett
Packard and McDonnell Douglas.  The industry-standard operating systems
supporting such computer platforms include DOS, Windows, OS2, VSE, MVS, VMS,
System 7 OS, Unix, Reality and Pick.

    ADP's service warranty to its clients is that if any errors or omissions
occur in its service offerings, ADP will correct them as soon as possible.  In
addition, ADP provides, either directly or through third parties, maintenance
and support for the ADP-provided equipment and software which facilitates the
delivery of its services to clients.

Letter from the Chief Executive Officer

     We have just finished my first year as ADP's chief executive officer. I am
happy to tell you that we had an excellent year.

FISCAL 1997 RESULTS

     In fiscal '97, ADP continued its unequaled growth record by reporting its
144th consecutive quarter of record revenues and earnings per share (EPS) and
its 36th consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. 

     Following last year's acquisition of GSI, we continued our international
expansion with additional acquisitions in '97. We have now achieved the #1
European market share position in both Employer and Dealer Services. 

     With this expansion, revenue increased 15% to over $4.1 billion. Prior to
minor non-recurring items, pretax earnings increased 19%, net earnings advanced
16% and earnings per share increased 15% to $1.80 from $1.57 last year.
Non-recurring items in the fourth quarter included an anticipated loss related
to the previously announced disposition of our Autolnfo business and reduced EPS
by $.04. 

     In recognition of these strong operating results, our Board declared its
twenty-third consecutive annual dividend increase, from $.40 to $.46 per share,
effective January 1, 1997.

     ADP continues to operate from a position of significant strength and
liquidity. Cash flow from operations exceeded $700 million and year-end cash and
marketable securities approximated $1.5 billion, after spending of $243 million
in '97 to acquire businesses and ADP shares. We purchased 3.2 million ADP shares
on the open market to fund employee equity plans. 

     Shareholders' equity exceeds $2.6 billion. The ratio of long-term debt to
equity is a comfortable .15 to 1 and return on average shareholders' equity is a
very healthy 21%. 

     Capital expenditures for the year were $175 million, about 5% of revenue.
This compared to $164 million last year.

LOOK AHEAD

As we look to the future, we expect to capitalize on our strengths which include
(1) the good fortune of being in a growth industry, computing information
services; (2) leading market share positions in each of our four core
businesses: Employer, Brokerage, Dealer and Claims Services; (3) a strong client
service orientation; (4) a superb direct sales capability; (5) a powerful
financial position from which to compete; and (6) a trained, dedicated associate
team committed to our objectives. 

     As we leverage these strengths into our strategies over the next few years,
we expect our primary growth to be internally generated from our current core
businesses. This growth will come from further penetration of our markets,
extending our market opportunities through broader product offerings and through
additional international expansion. We also intend to supplement this internal
growth in our core markets with acquisitions which will further these
strategies.

                                                                               3

<PAGE>
     In addition, we continue to look for an entry into an additional computing
information services market which complements our core businesses and leverages
our existing strengths. 

COMMITMENT TO WORLD CLASS SERVICE 

Among ADP's strengths is a strong client service orientation. Our service levels
are very good today in each ADP business. But we are committed to achieving
world class service levels where we delight our clients and exceed our clients'
expectations. We define service broadly, from initial contact with a prospect,
to product quality, to client responsiveness and happiness. We clearly see world
class service as a journey where, whenever we get close to the destination, we
move it out farther. This year, we are investing more than ever before in our
associates, tools and processes to raise service quality levels. We believe
these investments will improve client retention, enhance sales and improve
associate retention. It is good for all of our stakeholders (clients, associates
and shareholders.)

CURRENT OPTIMISM 

At ADP, there are always many exciting opportunities. It is one of our
strengths. Here are three perspectives to think about. 

     First, our internal growth rate -- excluding acquisitions and dispositions
- -- in Employer Services, ADP's largest business, expanded for the 4th year in a
row and we expect that trend to continue through '98 and beyond. 

     Second, we have more significant new client opportunities in our back
office Brokerage Services than we have had in over a decade. We are installing
Legg Mason now and we are getting close with additional prospects.

     Third, our European expansion opportunities in both Dealer Services and
Employer Services are better than ever. While we already are the number one
European market share services leader in both of these businesses, we have
significant room for further penetration and acquisition of competitors ... and
we just entered South America with the acquisition of an Employer Services
business in Brazil. 

Importance of People 

The most critical element in our success is our team of 30,000 associates who
continually strive to provide world class service to our more than 400,000
clients. Fortunately, we attract exceptionally dedicated and motivated people
with a strong results orientation. They share our vision and help us win in the
marketplace. Each person counts, each client counts, and each contact between a
client and associate counts.

     In '97, Russell Fradin joined ADP as Senior Vice President, Richard
Haviland was promoted to Chief Financial Officer, and Howard Koenig, Gordon
Mettam and Raymond Colotti were promoted to Corporate Vice President in
recognition of their important contributions and responsibilities.

     After 10 years of valuable service, Charles Lazarus has decided not to
stand for re-election to our Board and after 9 years as Group President of our
Brokerage Services business, Robert Casale will be retiring shortly. We will
miss their contributions.

     On a much sadder note, Joseph Pirret, our Treasurer and a 23 year ADP
associate, died suddenly in June. Joe's contributions over the years were
immense, and we will miss him greatly.

FORECAST 

I am very confident that ADP is well positioned for long-term growth and
profitability. In '98, we expect both double-digit revenue and earnings per
share growth while we make significant investments in our future.

     I hope you share my excitement, enthusiasm and optimism. I want to
especially tell our 30,000 ADP associates how much I appreciate their efforts
and results. Without them, none of this is possible.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN


1997 marked my first ADP year in less than a full-time leadership role, and I am
pleased to observe the outstanding accomplishments of the current management
team under Art Weinbach's leadership. 

     As cited in Art's letter to shareholders, we concluded our 36th year (144
consecutive quarters) of uninterrupted growth in both revenue and earnings per
share. According to the Compustat database of 9,500 publicly owned companies,
only one other company's growth record has endured half as long as our 144
fiscal quarters. Consistency in continually attaining new heights without
occasional financial disappointments is most difficult and unusual. The whole
ADP team deserves special recognition for their collective achievement. I am
quite confident that four more growth quarters will be added to that record in
fiscal '98.

     Many shareholders have asked me how my time has been redirected after so
many years of more than full-time focus on ADP matters. During the past year, I
am pleased to have played a leading role on two government-related
"commissions," one to help restructure the Internal Revenue Service and the
other to help shift military resources from overhead functions to more
cutting-edge, rapid response defense capabilities. In between times, I've also
played pro bono roles in several endeavors to enhance our nation's educational
and economic development accomplishments.

     I think that it is most appropriate for those individuals and companies who
have benefited from our society to give back to that society so that others may
be assisted.

     I thank our shareholders for their support and confidence in ADP. The Board
of Directors and our 30,000 ADP associates are committed to providing you with
continued growth and good return on your investment.

EMPLOYER SERVICES

ADP's oldest and largest business is Employer Services (ES), which contributes
more than half of ADP's revenues. ES provides a comprehensive range of payroll,
human resource, benefits administration, time and attendance, and tax filing and
reporting services to about 400,000 employers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

Pull Quote:

"WE AT PIERCE LEAHY TAKE PRIDE IN MAKING THE STAFFS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES FEEL
THAT THEY'RE PART OF THE TEAM RIGHT AWAY. ADP HELPS US ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE BY
COMPLETING EACH PAYROLL CONVERSION IN AN EFFICIENT, COST EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY
MANNER."

     This year, ES revenue increased 19% to over $2.2 billion. Today ADP
processes the paychecks of over 21 million employees in North America and 2
million in Europe. In '97, we also printed 35 million W-2 forms at our 40
computer centers in the U.S.

     As market trends increasingly favor both outsourcing and software as
preferred payroll solutions, ES is uniquely positioned to be the logical vendor
of choice for more and more companies. ADP's "Payroll AnyWay" strategy presents
to businesses of virtually every size and type an extensive menu of outsourced
and on-site payroll solutions, from turnkey service to client-site software. In
addition, we have segmented employers by size and complexity to effectively
match their needs to products and service teams that will best meet
expectations.

     In North America, ES focuses on three market segments: National Accounts
(for companies with 1,000 or more employees), Major Accounts (100 to 999
employees), and Emerging Business Services (for companies with fewer than 100
employees).

     Many of the world's largest corporations are ADP National Accounts clients.
In many cases, we provide system solutions for their entire human resource,
payroll and benefits needs. For those companies who choose to process these
applications in-house, we deliver valuable stand-alone services such as tax
filing, check printing and distribution, year-end statements (W-2s), and
benefits administration. This year, National Accounts revenue grew rapidly and
average client tenure is over a decade, and rising.

     Major Accounts offers a robust line of best-of-breed payroll and human
resource solutions for medium-size companies with full database and functional
integration between payroll and human resources (HR). Nearly 65% of the
medium-size firms in the U.S., who have elected to outsource their payrolls, are
ADP Major Accounts clients.

     Emerging Business Services processes payroll for 300,000 clients--far more
than any other small business payroll provider. Over 10 million small and
emerging companies are in the domestic marketplace, and represent a $12 billion
market opportunity for ES.

     The ADP Tax Center, which supports all three market segments,
electronically interfaces with 2,000 tax agencies from the IRS to local school
districts.

     Last year the Tax Center processed 13 million federal and state employer
payroll tax returns, and transmitted over $200 billion in taxes to appropriate
tax collection agencies.

     The Electronic Services Division (ESD) also complements our market segments
with a product mix that augments our payroll and HR services--from 401(k) to
time and attendance tracking. Additionally, we offer Peachtree software business
applications and Business Express bill payment services for small clients.

Pierce Leahy Corp. is one of the largest international providers of records
management and related services--and it's still growing. Acquired companies not
only bring growth but numerous additions and adjustments to payroll. So paying
new employees accurately and on-time is a high priority for Pierce Leahy's
management.

SOLUTION

ADP ASSOCIATES DEVELOPED A TAILORED PLAN TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THE PAYROLL
CONVERSION PROCESS FOR EACH OF PIERCE LEAHY'S ACQUISITIONS. THE MODEL PROVIDED A
LIST OF ACTION ITEMS--"DELIVERABLES"--REQUIRED BY BOTH ADP AND THE CLIENT. BY
CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE PLAN AND MONITORING EACH TASK, THE CONVERSIONS OF FOUR NEW
ACQUISITIONS TO THE ADP SYSTEM WENT SMOOTHLY. NOBODY MISSED A BEAT--OR A
PAYCHECK.


                                                                               7

<PAGE>

We anticipate sustained growth at buoyant levels in ESD because these additional
applications are high value-added and its products are in high-growth markets.

     From time to time, we supplement our internal growth through selective
acquisitions. This strategy allows us to expand existing products and services
or pursue entirely new opportunities by shortening the time to market.

     We became the largest provider of payroll services to Canadian businesses
with our purchases of and alliances with Royal Bank of Canada's and the
Scotiabank's payroll businesses. In July, we also acquired a Brazilian computing
services company, giving us a strong initial position in the growing South
American employer services marketplace.

     Additionally, we made three important moves to accelerate our penetration
of the multi-billion dollar benefits administration market. First, we acquired
Health Benefits America (HBA), a provider of health care benefits administration
services. Then we formed a strategic alliance in benefits administration with
William M. Mercer, Inc., one of the leading benefits consulting firms in the
U.S.

     We also acquired Staff Management Services of Florida, Inc., which we
renamed TotalSource. This acquisition firmly establishes ADP as a leading
professional employer organization (PEO), and positions us to aggressively
increase our presence in the rapidly-expanding employee leasing business.

     The continued increase in multinational companies clearly makes payroll and
human resource management services a global opportunity. This development and a
strong demand for outsourcing make Europe a particularly attractive marketplace
for ADP.

     ES already has 35,000 payroll and

<PAGE>

HR clients in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, 
Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our client retention rate in Europe is 
especially high, averaging over 90%. Our core strength in Europe currently is 
with larger companies--those with 1,000 or more employees. Our aim is to 
rapidly expand ES' business in major European countries and be the leading 
provider of employer solutions in all market segments. We strengthened our 
product offerings to smaller companies by introducing new "payroll by phone" 
offerings in France.

                                                                               9

BROKERAGE SERVICES

ADP's second largest business, Brokerage Services, contributes over 20% of ADP's
overall revenues. Brokerage Services is a leading provider of securities
processing, real-time market information and investor communications services.

Pull Quote:

"WHEN WE NEEDED NEW INNOVATIONS TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE, ADP STEPPED UP
TO THE PLATE WITH THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY, THE SOLUTIONS, AND HIGH QUALITY SERVICE
TO HELP US MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR 750,000 CLIENTS. ADP HAS BEEN KEY TO OUR GROWTH
AS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LEADER IN OUR INDUSTRY."

     ADP is the largest provider of securities processing services in North
America. This year we processed approximately 20% of the retail equity
transactions in the United States and Canada, handling an average of over
475,000 trades per day. We also added Legg Mason Wood Walker Incorporated as a
processing client. In the market information sector, we support more than 97,000
desktops in over 1,600 firms worldwide.

     ADP Investor Communications Services (ICS) is the largest processor and
provider of shareholder communications services, and serves more than 12,000
publicly traded companies on behalf of more than 800 brokerage firms and banks
and 400 mutual fund families. During '97, ICS processed over 285 million
mailings.

     In addition, ICS received and tabulated shareholder ballots that
represented over 155 billion shares. ICS introduced ADP GLOBAL PROXY SERVICES
which operates in 50 countries and aims to be the global processing standard.

     While handling these increased volumes, ICS received ISO 9002
certification, recognizing our superior level of quality assurance. 

     Brokerage Services continues to provide quality, highly integrated products
supported by reliable service, as indicated by our new products and
enhancements.

     This year, we introduced BPS ADVANTAGE, a client/server-based relational
database that allows our brokerage clients to easily access real-time customer
information, such as account holdings and transactions, and customize and
distribute data within their firms.

     ADP's POWER PARTNER, which provides advanced market information, has become
the product of choice for retail brokers.

10

<PAGE>

     This powerful system delivers real-time information, analytics and custom
charting for equity, options, and futures traded on all North American exchanges
and over 100 foreign exchanges.

     We also launched K2, a state-of-the-art market information and analytical
product, designed for traders and money managers in the institutional
marketplace. ADP developed K2 with the goal of integrating all of our
institutional products on a common platform. This sets the stage for bringing
together front-, middle-, and back-office services at the desktop for integrated
processing.

     Many of our investments also are helping our clients to expand their
internal information management capabilities.

     Starting with Deutsche Bank AG's New York branch, our new Impact
transaction processing product will help to clear fixed income securities, track
instrument positions, produce confirmations and settle transactions more
effectively than ever.

     Wilco Systems is a rapidly growing ADP subsidiary, which offers
international trading and settlement systems. Wilco recently introduced GLOSS HV
which is a multi-instrument, multi-currency, trading, settlement and accounting
system. In December '96, Bankers Trust signed a global license agreement to use
Wilco's Gloss HV trading and settlement system. Wilco continues to make gains in
the global market with several more large prospects in the offing.

During the past year Waterhouse Securities, the 4th largest discount brokerage
in the U.S., started a new correspondent clearing division--National Investor
Services Corp. (NISC), to supplement its discount brokerage business. To make a
difference in such a competitive marketplace, the firm needed a partner that
could provide comprehensive, leading-edge brokerage processing
applications--supported by responsive, reliable systems and service.

ADP Dealer Services is the world's largest provider of computing, data and
professional services to auto and truck dealers and manufacturers. Over 18,000
dealers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin America use ADP's
on-site systems and communications networks to manage virtually every area of
operations.

Pull Quote:

"THE MEASURE OF A COMPANY'S COMMITMENT IS WHEN THEY STAND BY IT UNDER THE MOST
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS. ADP DID THAT AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE WE CAN COUNT ON
THEM."

     In '97, Dealer Services revenue increased 17% and client retention rates
remained very strong--over 95% in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Mexico and Taiwan.


     This year, we began to segment our client base by size and complexity. Our
objective is to better align product and service offerings to dealerships
according to their needs.

     We entered into an agreement with Credit Management Solutions, Inc. (CMSI),
permitting us to market their CREDIT CONNECTION product. This real-time, on-line
credit processing system expeditiously links dealers to lending institutions and
accelerates decisions on consumer auto loans. A process that had once taken
hours now only takes minutes.

     We introduced ADP MANAGEMENT ADVISOR, a graphical user interfaced, on-line
analytical application that enables dealers to control their expenses and
maximize profits. In addition, we unveiled our new high-power systems platform,
Millennia3, which includes flexible, cost-effective, and scalable
enterprise-wide system solutions.

     ADP Dealer Services also is the leading service provider to the emerging
retail auto "super-store" market. We help these very large dealers design and
implement enterprise-wide information and technology strategies, including
state-of-the-art retailing systems, which enable customers to very easily select
and even purchase a vehicle at touch-screen kiosks.

     Both manufacturers and dealers are placing greater emphasis on effective
contact with consumers. ADP is well positioned to assist. ADP AutoConnect
already has 4,500 web sites which connect consumers and dealers on the Internet.
Our Relationship Marketing System uses laptops and work-stations to aid the
customer handling process. In addition, the recently acquired Picture Perfect
Promotions, Inc. offers our clients on-demand, direct mail marketing
capabilities.

     As auto and truck manufacturers become more proactive in creating brand
awareness, ADP Dealer Services, through the Professional Services of our Sandy
Group, helps dealers and manufacturers promote brand identity. This year, Sandy
began a multi-year marketing program for one large manufacturer, which conveys
highly individualized, tailored one-on-one monthly mailings to all vehicle
owners of that manufacturer's brand.

     ADP serves over 9,000 European dealers. In '97, we expanded to Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Finland, and now have operations
in every major European country. As part of our global strategy, we made two
significant acquisitions: Istel Nordic (operating as JDC) in Denmark and
Germany, and Sicit MT&T S.p.A., Italy's largest dealer system provider.

     Today, over 40% of ADP Dealer Services clients are outside the North
American market. We are clearly Europe's leading dealer services provider.

CLAIMS SERVICES

ADP's Claims Services, the leading claims information provider to the property
and casualty insurance industry, offers a broad line of products to help clients
accurately estimate auto damage, bodily injury, and property claims.

Pull Quote

"OUR INDUSTRY SURVIVES BY MAKING WISE CHOICES TO CAREFULLY MANAGE RISK. WHEN IT
COMES TO TIMELY AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE, WE COULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN A CLAIMS
SOLUTION PARTNER BETTER THAN ADP."

     Our clients include 14 of the 15 largest auto insurance carriers, more than
250 additional insurance carriers and independent adjusting companies, over
7,000 collision repair facilities, and more than 3,600 auto parts recycling
facilities in the United States and Canada. Revenue grew over 20% this year, and
we succeeded in renewing all our major contracts.

     In Estimating Services, virtually every product increased its market
penetration. Our pen-based vehicle damage appraisal system, PenPro, operates on
a PC laptop and has won broad market acceptance. This year, we installed over
1,500 new users.

     AUTOSOURCE, our total loss valuation product, grew nearly 30%. SHOPLINK
estimating systems for collision repair facilities achieved 70% revenue growth
in '97, and is now installed in over 7,000 auto body shops. PHOTOLINK is the de
facto industry standard for digital imaging between repair shops, claims
adjusters and insurance companies. It is used by 75% of the claims professionals
who employ imaging system.

     Over 3,600 auto parts recycling facilities and salvage yards now manage
their inventories using ADP Parts Services, which helps the flow of parts
information between insurers, body shops and parts recyclers. ADP is also the
data collector for the ARA International Database. Updated daily, it contains
over 10 million items and is the preferred resource for locating recycled auto
parts. Under a recent agreement with the FTC, we have agreed to sell part of
this service in order to create a more competitive environment.

January '97. It already has 1,650 installations, and is growing steadily.

     Integrated Medical Solutions (IMS), which processes bodily injury claims
arising from auto accidents, increased revenue 60%. Provider Bill Audit (PBA) is
IMS's computerized system that reviews medical bills. PBA software is licensed
by many major insurance carriers and is clearly the most successful of its kind.

     This year, IMS became the first vendor to offer automated medical
utilization review, preferred provider access and managed care services via an
integrated product expressly designed for the auto claims market.

     We further expanded our capabilities to claims adjusters by introducing
Injury Claims Evaluations (ICE) as a complement of the PBA system. ICE helps
adjusters to make fair and equitable settlements when pain and suffering claims
are involved in third party auto liability claims.

     IMS recently expanded further into workers' compensation bill review by
acquiring Medical Bill Review Services.

     We will continue to sharpen our focus on major strategic opportunities that
add value for our clients in the property and casualty industry.

(A) AFTER IMPACT OF NON-RECURRING ITEMS (SEE NOTE 3).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OPERATING RESULTS

Revenue and earnings reached record levels during each of the past three fiscal
years. During fiscal '97, revenue increased 15% to over $4.1 billion. Prior to
minor non-recurring charges, pretax earnings increased 19% and earnings per
share (EPS) increased 15% to $1.80. The Company reached a settlement with the
Federal Trade Commission to divest certain assets acquired in fiscal '95, and
consequently, a non-recurring charge was recorded in the fourth quarter lowering
EPS by $.04 to $1.76 for the year. Fiscal '97 EPS was not impacted by the net
effect of certain non-recurring items related to the Brokerage Front Office
business (see Brokerage discussion below). Fiscal '97 was ADP's 36th consecutive
year of double-digit earnings per share growth since becoming a public company
in 1961.

     Revenue and revenue growth by ADP's major service groups are shown below:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (A) RECLASSIFIED

   Consolidated revenue grew 15% in fiscal '97 primarily from increased market
penetration, an expanded array of products and services and from acquisitions,
with relatively minor contributions from price increases. Prior to acquisitions,
business dispositions and foreign exchange differences, revenue increased
approximately 12%.

   Prior to non-recurring charges, the consolidated pretax margin was 18.3% in
'97, 17.8% in '96 and 18.5% in '95. Pretax margin improved over the previous
year as continued automation and operating efficiencies enabled the Company to
offset start-up costs associated with new products and acquisitions. Pretax
margin in '97 after non-recurring charges was 17.6%.

   The Company does not prepare its financial statements in a manner that
generates the true stand-alone profitability for each unit and profitability
measurements are not maintained in a consistent manner among the Company's major
service groups. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to business units at a
standard rate for management and motivation reasons. Other costs are recorded
based on management responsibility. As a result, various income and expense
items are recorded at the corporate level and certain shared costs are not
allocated. Consequently, comparisons of specific margins between groups are not
meaningful, although trend information within a service group is a useful
directional indicator.

EMPLOYER SERVICES (ES)

Employer Services' revenue grew 19% in fiscal '97, and in the absence of
acquisitions revenue growth would have been about 11%, up from 10% in '96.

     In '97 and '96 the overall operating margin was 22%. The margin in North
America has improved by about 1% versus fiscal '96 primarily due to continued
automation and operating efficiencies. This increased field margin has enabled
ES to increase investments in product development and sales. The overall ES
margin remained flat as a result of greater weighting of international
operations which have somewhat lower margins in '97.

     ES' revenue shown above includes the pretax equivalent of interest earned
on funds collected from clients as part of the Company's integrated payroll and
payroll tax filing services. The pretax equivalent has been calculated at a
standard rate. In fiscal '97 the standard rate was changed from 7.8% in prior
years to 6% and, accordingly, the previously reported balances for Employer
Services' and "Other" revenue have been reclassified. As a result of this
change, the ES margin is 3% lower than previously reported.

BROKERAGE SERVICES

Brokerage revenue grew by 13% aided by very high back-office trading volumes. In
the absence of acquisitions, revenue growth would have been about 12%, the same
as in '96.

   Prior to non-recurring items in '97, Brokerage Services' operating margin was
about 14% in '97, compared to 13% in both '96 and '95. In '97 the Company
recorded a non-taxable $19 million gain to net earnings related to the return of
a front-office client deposit. The Company also recorded a provision of $31
million ($19 million after tax) to restructure its front-office business in
order to reduce product lines and platforms and consolidate data centers. This
effort will continue and will result in about $25 million lower earnings in the
front-office business in '98. 

DEALER SERVICES 

Dealer Services' revenue grew 17% in '97, compared to 26% in '96 and 32% in '95.
Revenue growth in each year was aided by several small acquisitions. In the
absence of acquisitions, '97 revenue growth would have been 6%. Revenue growth
has been aided by increased usage of applications at auto dealerships, while at
the same time changes in industry distribution channels have slowed auto
dealership investments in new computer systems. Dealer Services' margins
decreased slightly to 17% in fiscal '97 from 18% in '96 and 20% in '95 primarily
due to the integration of acquisitions and a shift in product mix.

OTHER 

The primary components of "Other" revenue are claims services, services for
wholesalers, interest income, foreign exchange differences, and miscellaneous
processing services. In addition, "Other" revenue has been reduced to adjust for

                                                                              17
<PAGE>

the difference between actual interest income earned on invested tax filing
funds and income credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 6.0%.

     A non-recurring pre-tax charge of $17.8 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal '97 reflecting the Company's settlement with the Federal Trade
Commission, under which the Company will divest certain non-material assets.

     In each of the past three years, investments in systems development and
programming have increased at a greater rate than the Company's overall growth
rate. Investments have increased to accelerate automation, migrate to new
computing technologies, address Year 2000 compliance, and develop new products.

     In '97 the Company's effective tax rate was approximately 29%, up from 28%
in '96 and 26% in '95. The increased rate is primarily as a result of the
greater weighting of taxable versus non-taxable earnings, and the impact of
non-deductible goodwill arising from the '96 GSI acquisition.

     For '98 ADP is planning another record year with about 15% growth in
revenue and double-digit growth in earnings per share over the '97 results prior
to non-recurring items.

     Additional comments and operating results are included in the Letters to
Shareholders on pages 3 through 5 and in the business descriptions presented on
pages 6 through 15.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

ADP's financial condition and balance sheet remains exceptionally strong. At
June 30, 1997, cash and marketable securities approximated $1.5 billion.
Shareholders' equity exceeded $2.6 billion, and return on average equity for the
year was 21%. The ratio of long-term debt to equity at June 30, 1997 was 15%.

     Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $700 million in '97. We expect
another excellent cash-flow year in '98.

     In '97, 3.2 million shares of common stock were purchased at an average
price of approximately $40, as part of an ongoing program to fund equity related
employee benefits. The board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to
4.4 million additional shares.

     During '97, the Company purchased several businesses for approximately $115
million in cash and $7 million in common stock. The cost of acquisitions in '96
and '95 aggregated $473 million and $123 million, respectively. The Company also
acquired several businesses in the three years ended 1997, 1996 and 1995 in
pooling of interest transactions in exchange for 3.0, 1.0 and 2.4 million shares
of common stock, respectively. The company's historical financial statements
were not restated because in the aggregate these pooling transactions were not
material.

     Capital expenditures during '97 were approximately $175 million following
investments of $164 million in '96 and $118 million in '95. Capital spending in
fiscal '98 should approximate $230 million and remains at a very comfortable
level at about 5% of revenues.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 1997, 1996 AND 1995

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Consolidation and Basis of Preparation. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its majority-owned
subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

B. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

C. Marketable Securities. Marketable securities consist primarily of high grade
fixed income investments. Most of the Company's marketable securities are
considered to be "available-for-sale", and, accordingly, are carried on the
balance sheet at fair market value, which approximates cost. Gains/losses from
the sale of marketable securities have not been material. Approximately $131
million of the Company's long-term marketable securities mature in 1-2 years,
$158 million in 2-3 years, $115 million in 3-4 years, and the remainder in less
than 7 years.

D. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated
over the estimated useful lives of the assets by the straight-line method.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease
or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

   The estimated useful lives of assets are primarily as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT                     2 TO 3 YEARS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDINGS                                   20 TO 40 YEARS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FURNITURE AND FIXTURES                        3 TO 7 YEARS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Intangibles. Intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized
primarily on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is amortized over periods from 15
to 40 years, and is periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing carrying
value to undiscounted expected future cash flows. If impairment is indicated, a
write-down to fair value (normally measured by discounting estimated future cash
flows) is taken.

F. Revenue Recognition. Service revenue, including software license fees,
maintenance fees and other ancillary fees, is recognized as services are
provided. In those instances where hardware is sold to clients as part of a
bundled service offering, the gross profit on the sale of hardware and prepaid
software license fees, less costs of selling and installation, is deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial contract period, which
generally is from 5 to 7 years.

G. Foreign Currency Translation. The net assets of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect
at the end of each period, and revenue and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates during the periods. Currency transaction gains or losses, which
are included in the results of operations, are immaterial for all periods
presented. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included as a
separate component of shareholders' equity.

H. Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share are based upon the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.

I. Line of Business. The Company is engaged in the computing services business.

J. Reclassification of Prior Financial Statements. Certain reclassifications
have been made to previous years' financial statements to conform to current
classifications.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS 

Effective November 1, 1995, ADP acquired control of GSI-Participations, a
computer services company based in Paris, France for approximately $460 million
in cash plus transaction costs and other related liabilities assumed. The GSI
transaction resulted in approximately $596 million of goodwill and other
intangibles (primarily customer lists and software), which are being amortized
over periods ranging from 5 to 40 years.

   During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company purchased several other
businesses for approximately $122 million (including $7 million in common
stock), $91 million (including $20 million in common stock), and $123 million
(including $16 million in common stock), respectively, net of cash acquired. The
results of these acquired businesses were not material to the Company's
consolidated financial statements, and are included from the date of
acquisition.

   The Company also acquired several businesses in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995 in
pooling of interest transactions in exchange for 2,827,000, 969,000 and
2,362,000 shares of common stock, respectively. The Company's consolidated
financial statements were not restated because in the aggregate these
transactions were not material. 

NOTE 3. NON-RECURRING ITEMS 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company reached a settlement with the
Federal Trade Commission under which the Company will divest certain assets, the
amount of which is not material. An estimated pretax loss of $17.8 million was
recorded in connection with the settlement.

   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, a major Brokerage Services client
formalized its intention to cancel its services contract with the Company, and,
as a result, a client contract 

                                                                              23

deposit was returned to the Company resulting in a non-taxable gain to net
earnings of approximately $19 million. The Company is restructuring the internal
operations of the Brokerage front office business to better align the business'
cost structure with the lower revenue which will result as this client reduces
its use of ADP services over the next 12-18 months. A provision of approximately
$31 million ($19million after tax) was recorded in order to reduce product lines
and platforms and consolidate data centers.

NOTE 4. RECEIVABLES

Accounts receivable is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $40 million
and $35 million at June 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

   The Company finances the sale of computer systems to certain of its clients.
These finance receivables, substantially all of which are due from automobile
and truck dealerships, are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as
follows:

              $  97,057   $176,771    $ 86,556   $188,184
- ----------------------------------------------------------

   Unearned income from finance receivables represents the excess of gross
receivables over the sales price of the computer systems financed. Unearned
income is amortized using the interest method to maintain a constant rate of
return on the net investment over the term of each contract.

   Long-term receivables at June 30, 1997 mature as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------

   Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights (acquired directly or
through acquisitions) to provide data processing services to various groups of
clients (amortized over periods from 5 to 36 years) and purchased software
(amortized over periods from 3 to 10 years). Amortization of intangibles totaled
$92 million for fiscal 1997, $81 million for 1996 and $66 million for 1995. 

NOTE 6. Debt 

A portion of the purchase price of certain international acquisitions
has been funded by borrowing in local currency (equivalent to $129 million as of
June 30, 1997 and $91 million as of June 30, 1996) on a short-term basis at an
average interest of 5.8% in fiscal 1997 and 4.1% in fiscal 1996. These
borrowings have been designated as hedges against the Company's net investment
in the businesses acquired.

   Components of long-term debt are as follows:

NOTE 7. PAYROLL AND PAYROLL TAX FILING SERVICES

As part of its integrated payroll and payroll tax filing services, the Company
collects funds for federal, state and local employment taxes from approximately
285,000 clients, files annually over 13.0 million returns, handles all
regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, remits
the funds to the appropriate tax agencies, and handles other employer related
services. In addition to fees paid by clients for these services, the Company
receives interest during the interval between the receipt and disbursement of
funds by investing the funds primarily in AA or better rated fixed income
municipal instruments, with no more than $80 million in any single instrument.
The amount of collected but unremitted funds varies significantly during the
year and averaged approximately $4.5 billion in fiscal 1997, $3.7 billion in
fiscal 1996 and $3.3 billion in fiscal 1995. The amount of such funds was $5.8

   In addition to fixed rentals, certain leases require payment of maintenance
and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future
adjustments in price indices.

and litigation. The Company does not believe that the resolution of these
matters will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management is responsible for the preparation of the accompanying financial
statements. The financial statements, which include amounts based on the
application of business judgments, have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent
certified public accountants, have audited our consolidated financial statements
as described in their report.

      The Company maintains financial control systems designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are 
executed and recorded in accordance with management authorization. The 
control systems are supported by written policies and the control environment
is regularly evaluated by both the Company's internal auditors and Deloitte & 
Touche.

      The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee comprised of four outside 
directors. The Audit Committee meets with both Deloitte & Touche and the 
internal auditors with and without management's presence. It monitors and 
reviews the Company's financial statements and internal controls, and the 
scope of the internal auditors' and Deloitte & Touche's audits.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
Roseland, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Automatic Data
Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1997. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, 
in all material respects, the financial position of Automatic Data 
Processing, Inc. and subsidiaries at June 30, 1997 and 1996, and the results 
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended June 30, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.
