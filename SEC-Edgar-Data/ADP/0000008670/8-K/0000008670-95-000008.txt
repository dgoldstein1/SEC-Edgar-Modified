                                                  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


ADP SIGNS AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE GSI


     ROSELAND, N.J. August 31, 1995 -- Automatic Data Processing, Inc. has
entered into an agreement to acquire for cash all of the outstanding shares
of GSI, a European computer services company based in Paris, France.  The
transaction is valued at FF 2.3 billion (approximately US $460 million) and is
subject to GSI shareholder and various governmental approvals.  The trans-
action is expected to close before the end of the calendar year and may have
a slightly dilutive effect on ADP's earnings per share.


     GSI is the European leader in providing payroll and human resource
information services.  GSI also provides facilities management, banking,
clearing and other information services in Europe.

     GSI's revenues are in excess of FF 2 billion (US $400 million) and the
company has over 3,000 employees, with operations in France, Germany, Italy,
Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.


     Josh S. Weston, chairman and chief executive officer of ADP, said, "The
acquisition of GSI positions ADP as the largest global provider of payroll
and human resource services.  The exceptional strength of the GSI management
team will facilitate our continued expansion in Europe."

     ADP, with $3 billion in revenue and 350,000 clients, is one of the largest
independent computing services firms in the United States.
