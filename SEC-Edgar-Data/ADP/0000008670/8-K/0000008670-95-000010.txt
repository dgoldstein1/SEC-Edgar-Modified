Item 2.   Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

    (a) On October 27, 1995, the Registrant acquired control of the
GSI Group (as defined below) when it announced that, pursuant to an
ongoing tender offer that was commenced on October 16, 1995 for all
of the outstanding shares of GSI Participations SCA ("GPSCA") not
held by GSI Associes S.A.("GA"), and all of the shares of GA, it
had acquired control over 80% of the outstanding shares of GPSCA.
The shares of GPSCA held by GA are the only asset held by GA.  The
Registrant expects to acquire control of approximately 100% of the
outstanding shares of GPSCA by January 15, 1996, the expiration
date for the ongoing tender offer.  If the Registrant purchases all
of the shares of GPSCA not held by GA and all of the shares of GA,
the total purchase price will be approximately FF 2.3 billion
(approximately US $460 million).  The purchase price was determined
by arms-length negotiations between representatives of the
Registrant, the shareholders of GPSCA and the shareholders of GA,
respectively, following a competitive bidding process, and the
funds used and to be used by the Registrant in connection with the
acquisition of the aforementioned shares of GPSCA and GA are from
the Registrant's working capital.  Prior to the Registrant's
acquisition of the aforementioned shares of GPSCA and GA, such
shares were held primarily by institutional investors and
individuals who are employees or former employees of GSI Group (as
defined below).

    GPSCA, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the "GSI
Group"), is the European leader in providing payroll and human
resource information services. GSI Group also provides facilities
management, banking, clearing and other information services.
For a more complete description of GSI Group, see the
Registrant's press release which is filed as Exhibit B-1 to this
Form 8-K.

    (b) The assets acquired by the Registrant as a result of the
acquisition described herein, which assets consist primarily of
property, plant, equipment, accounts receivable and certain
intangible property, are used by GSI Group in providing the
services described in Item 2(a) above, and the Registrant intends
to continue such use of such assets.

Item 7.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.

    (a) The annual audited financial statements of the acquired
business which are required by Item 7(a) of this Form 8-K are
filed as Exhibit C-1 to this Form 8-K.  It is impracticable at
this time for the Registrant to provide the unaudited financial
statements for the interim periods which are required by Item
7(a) of this Form 8-K.  Such unaudited financial statements for
the interim periods will be filed by the Registrant as an
amendment to this Form 8-K as soon as practicable, but in any
event not later than 60 days after the date hereof.

    (b) It is impracticable at this time for the Registrant to
provide the pro forma financial information relative to the
acquired business which is required by Item 7(b) of this Form 8-
K.  Such pro forma financial information will be filed by the
Registrant as an amendment to this Form 8-K as soon as
practicable, but in any event not later than 60 days after the
date hereof.  <PAGE>

Maison Lazard et Cie
12 avenue Percier
75008 Paris

Dear Sirs,

1.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this letter, we
hereby offer, irrevocably and with intent to be legally bound, to
purchase, at the price specified in paragraph 5:

        (i)   all of the shares of GSI Participations SCA
              ("GPSCA") not held by GSI Associes S.A. ("GA"); and

        (ii)  all of the shares of GA.

2.   The present offer is subject to the condition of the holding
of a meeting of the Board of  Directors of GA, to be convened no
later than 7 p.m., Paris time, August 25, 1995, at which said
Board shall:

        (i)   endorse the present offer;

        (ii)  convene a meeting of the shareholders of GA to be
              held no later than October 6, 1995 for the purpose
              of:

              -   endorsement of the transactions
                  contemplated herein; and
              -   amendment of the by-laws of GA to the extent
                  necessary to implement the transactions
                  contemplated herein (including if so requested
                  by ADP the right of GPSCA to replace GA as
                  associe commandite of GPSCA or to terminate the
                  commandite arrangement); and

        (iii)  approve a report to the shareholders which
               recommends the approval of the aforesaid
               transactions and amendments of the by-laws of GA
               referred to in (ii) above.

3.   The present offer is subject to the additional condition
that, on or before September 6,  1995, shareholders of GPSCA
representing no less than 67% of the capital of said company
(including all of the Individuals listed in Exhibit A) provide to
ADP:



<PAGE>
                                       -2-



          3.1 - representations substantially in the form of
Exhibit B;

          3.2 - a call option with respect to their shares which,
subject to the provisions of paragraph 11, can be exercised by
ADP at its sole discretion during a period of two years from the
date hereof, at the price defined in paragraph 5 below;

          3.3 - in the event of a capital increase of GPSCA,
a commitment either to transfer all of such shareholder's
subscription rights to ADP or to exercise such rights (in
which event the shares issued pursuant to such exercise of
rights will become subject to the aforesaid call option); and
a commitment not to support any capital increase reserved to
a third party;

          3.4 - a commitment not to tender their shares to
any third party until the earlier of (i) two years from the
date hereof, or (ii) the listing of GPSCA shares on the cote
officielle or second marche; and

          3.5 - in the event of a listing of GPSCA shares as
provided in the preceding subparagraph, a right of first
refusal entitling ADP to acquire said shares (i) at the
listed price on the date upon which said shareholder proposes
to sell such shares, if the shareholder proposes to sell its
shares on the market or (ii) at the price offered by a third
party, if the shareholder proposes to sell its shares to such
third party. Such right of first refusal shall expire two years
following the date hereof.

4.   At its aforesaid meeting on August 25, 1995, the Board
of Directors of GA shall undertake on behalf of GA and GPSCA
that:

          4.1  neither of such companies shall, directly or
indirectly, enter into any discussion, negotiation or
agreement with any third party pertaining to the sale of any
shares in GA or GPSCA ; and

          4.2  each such company shall exercise its best
efforts, to the extent permitted by law, in order to convince
its shareholders to tender their shares to ADP so as to
permit ADP to obtain no less than 67% of the shares of said
company.

5.   The aggregate purchase price to be paid by ADP for one
hundred per cent of the equity securities of GA and of all of
the equity securities of GPSCA not held by GA is 2.3 billion
French Francs, it being understood:

          5.1  that the respective prices paid for each share
of GA and each share of GPSCA shall be computed by Lazard
Freres & Cie on a proportional basis taking into account GA's
holdings of GPSCA shares, and such determination shall be
definitive and binding on all parties; and

<PAGE>
                                       -3-


          5.2  that said purchase prices may be adjusted in
accordance with Exhibit C.

Such purchase prices shall be paid to the tendering
shareholder in cash, immediately upon surrender of the
relevant shares minus the advisory fee payable to Maison
Lazard & Cie pursuant to its engagement agreement with GPSCA
(the relevant terms of which shall be communicated to ADP by
GPSCA), which fee shall be withheld from such payment and
paid directly to Maison Lazard & Cie.

6.   ADP undertakes to exercise its best efforts in order to
obtain promptly all governmental approvals necessary in order
to consummate the transactions discussed herein. ADP
represents that it is duly authorized to carry out the
transactions herein contemplated without any further action
by its Board of Directors or any other body of ADP.

7.   Subject only to ADP's receipt of governmental approvals
as provided in paragraph 6, to favorable action by the Board
of Directors and the shareholders of GA and GPSCA as provided
in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, and to the provisions of
paragraph 11, ADP shall purchase at the price defined in
paragraph 5 all of the shares of GA and GPSCA that are
tendered to it within 30 days of fulfillment of the last of
such conditions. In the event that such 30 day period does
not commence until after November 15, 1995 (otherwise than as
a result of ADP's failure to secure such governmental
approvals on or before such date), ADP's obligations shall be
subject to the additional condition that there shall have
been no material adverse change affecting the business or
financial condition of GPSCA between the date hereof and the
date of commencement of such 30-day period.

8.   If the shareholders of GA fail to vote favorably any of
the resolutions contemplated in paragraph 2 above, ADP shall
nonetheless be required to offer to purchase at the price
provided for in paragraph 5 all of the GA shares and all of
the GPSCA shares not held by GA provided only that:

          8.1  GA ceases to be the associe commandite of
GPSCA at any time within the two year period following the
date hereof;

          8.2  there shall have been no material adverse
change affecting the business or financial condition of GPSCA
between the date hereof and the date of termination of GA's
status as associe commandite of GPSCA, it being understood
that, subject to the provisions of paragraph 11, ADP shall be
required to purchase all shares tendered during the period of
90 days following the date of such termination of GA's status
as associe commandite effective as of the last day of such
period;

<PAGE>
                                       -4-


          8.3  the obligation of ADP to acquire the GA shares
under this paragraph 8 shall be subject to the additional
conditions that (i) GA shall have adopted the amendments to
its by-laws necessary in order to make such acquisition
possible and that (ii) a majority of the shares of GA are
tendered to ADP prior to expiration of such 90-day period. In
the event that either of such conditions is not satisfied
within such period, ADP shall have no further obligation with
respect to the GA shares but shall continue to be obligated
to acquire the GPSCA shares as provided elsewhere herein.

9.   Until the date of the shareholders' meeting of GA
contemplated in paragraph 2 or, if the GA shareholders adopt
at the said meeting the resolutions contemplated in said
paragraph 2, until the end of the 30-day period mentioned in
paragraph 7, GA and GPSCA and all companies directly or
indirectly under their control shall be managed in the
ordinary course of business only and shall refrain (i) from
purchasing or selling any substantial asset outside of the
ordinary course of business (with the exception of the
Businesses listed in Table 1 of Exhibit C), (ii) from
modifying their respective bylaws or capital structure in any
respect whatsoever (except as provided for herein), and (iii)
from deciding any distribution of dividends and/or assets,
except as permitted pursuant to paragraph 10. GA and GPSCA
shall, until completion of all actions contemplated herein,
keep ADP informed of all steps taken by GA and GPSCA to meet
the conditions set forth herein, and shall provide to ADP
copies of their respective management accounts and of all
audited accounts.

10.  There shall be no declaration or distribution of
dividends by GPSCA in excess of the amount mandated under
article 29 of GPSCA's statutes (as presently in effect)
without the prior consent of ADP prior to expiration of the
period of two years from the date hereof, it being
understood, however, that ADP acknowledges and accepts the
advance on dividends paid in July 1995.

11.  ADP agrees not to make any purchase of GA or GPSCA
shares outside the 30-day period specified in paragraph 7 and
the 90-day period specified in paragraph 8 without the prior
consent of Lazard Freres & Cie, which shall not be withheld
unless the effect of such proposed sale outside such periods
would, in the discretionary judgement of Lazard Freres & Cie,
be to distort the price adjustment computation contemplated
in Exhibit C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
letter, ADP agrees not to cause either of such periods to
commence prior to October 16, 1995 without the consent of
GPSCA.

       A purchase price adjustment shall be computed by Lazard
Freres & Cie, as of the earliest of (i) the first day of the 30-
day period specified in paragraph 7, (ii) the first day of the
90-day period specified in paragraph 8, and (iii), subject to
paragraph 11, the first acquisition of any GA or GPSCA shares by
ADP (the "Adjustment Date") as follows.

       The aggregate purchase price shall be increased by any
aggregate surplus and reduced by any aggregate shortfall between
(i) net alter tax proceeds from the divestiture of the Businesses
set out below in Table 1 which have been divested prior to such
Adjustment Date; and (ii) their respective Estimated Values set
out below in Table 1.

       Said purchase price shall also be reduced by 33% of the
aggregate Estimated Values set out below in Table 1 for the
Businesses which have not been divested as of the Adjustment
Date, provided, however, that in respect of any Business which,
as of the Adjustment Date, has not been divested but is the
subject of a binding divestiture agreement (including such an
agreement that is conditional upon customary closing conditions
such as governmental approvals), the rate of reduction shall be
15% in lieu of 33%.

       The price shall also be increased by the amount of any
proceeds payable to GPSCA or GA in consideration of any shares
issued pursuant to any options that may have been issued and
remain outstanding as of the date hereof, insofar as such shares
are required to be taken into account as "equity securities" for
purposes of computing prices per share pursuant to paragraph 5.

         Any adjustments made by Lazard Freres & Cie shall be
definitive and binding on all parties.

1 - Consolidation principles and methods

The consolidated financial statements of GSI-Participations have
been prepared according to the accounting standards published by
the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and
conform to French law on consolidated financial statements.

1.1. GROUP STRUCTURE

The consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements of GSI-Participations and those of its direct and
indirect subsidiaries listed in the Appendix.

Companies wholly owned by the Group are consolidated using the
full consolidation method.  The "groupement d'interet economique"
(GIE) GSA, 51%-owned by GSI on a joint basis with Steria and
Andersen Consulting, is consolidated using the proportional
consolidation method.

1.2 GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition price
and the Group share in the underlying unallocated net assets and
liabilities of the company acquired.  Goodwill is reported
separately on the balance sheet.

For those acquisitions which represent a major expansion of the
Group's activities in terms of expertise or geographical market
coverage, goodwill is amortized using the straight line method
over a maximum period of 20 years.  Only the goodwill on the
acquisition of the minority interests on GSI SA is amortized over
a 40 year period.

Other goodwill is amortized over a shorter period not exceeding 5
years.

1.3 TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
French francs at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
year and their income statements are translated at the average
exchange rate for the year.

The impact on equity of exchange rate movements from one year to
the next has been included directly in consolidated retained
earnings.

2- Accounting principles and bases of valuation

2.1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE

Expenditure on research and development is written-off in the
year in which it occurred.

2.2  INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Software and licenses acquired are amortized over a period of 1
to 3 years.  Other intangibles are amortized over a maximum
period of 5 years.

2.3 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plan and equipment are stated at cost.

Depreciation is based on the expected useful life and is charged
using either the straight line or the declining balance method,
depending on the nature of the assets concerned.

Computer hardware is depreciated over a period of 2 to 5 years.
Other fixed assets (fixtures, furniture, equipment, etc. ) are
depreciated over a period of 5 to 10 years.

2.4 DEFERRED TAXES

The effects of deferred taxation resulting from temporary
differences between the fiscal value and the accounting value of
assets and liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial
statements using the liability method.
                                        -7-
<PAGE>

No account is taken in the financial statements of deferred tax
assets resulting from tax loss carry forwards,and the temporary
timing differences are written off as they arise.

2.5 RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Retirement benefits for the employees of companies in France are
fully provided for in the balance sheet.  The provision is
calculated using the discounted present vale of future benefits.
Similar rights recognized by subsidiaries outside France are
included in the consolidated financial statements.

2.6 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF RESULTS ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS

Profits and losses on long-term contracts are recorded using the
percentage of completion method.

According to this method, revenue and margin are recorded as the
contract progresses; losses are fully provided for when they seem
probable and the excess or shortfall in invoicing compared with
the level of work in progress is recorded as deferred income or
income receivable.
