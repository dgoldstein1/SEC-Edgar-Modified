To the Associates of GSI-Participations.

In accordance with the assignment vested in us by General
Meetings of May 23, 1991 and June 24, 1994, we herewith present
our report on:

 .our examination of the consolidated financial statements of
GSI-Participations, as appended to this report,
 .our verification of the Group's management report, with
respect to the year ended December 31, 1994.

OPINION ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In auditing the consolidated financial statements, we have
performed such examinations and verifications as we deemed
necessary in accordance with generally accepted accounting
standards.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly the net worth, financial position and earnings of the
Group made up of the consolidated companies.

SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS

have also made the specific verifications required by law.

In our opinion, the information in the Group's management report
fairly and accurately reflects the consolidated financial
statements.

1 - Consolidation principles and methods

The consolidated financial statements of GSI-Participations have
been prepared according to the accounting standards published by
the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and
conform to French law on consolidated financial statements.

1.1. GROUP STRUCTURE

The consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements of GSI-Participations and those of its direct and
indirect subsidiaries listed in the Appendix.

Companies wholly owned by the Group are consolidated using the
full consolidation method.  The "groupement d'interet economique"
(GIE) GSA, 51%-owned by GSI on a joint basis with Steria and
Andersen Consulting, is consolidated using the proportional
consolidation method.

1.2 GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition price
and the Group share in the underlying unallocated net assets and
liabilities of the company acquired.  Goodwill is reported
separately on the balance sheet.

For those acquisitions which represent a major expansion of the
Group's activities in terms of expertise or geographical market
coverage, goodwill is amortized using the straight line method
over a maximum period of 20 years.  Only the goodwill on the
acquisition of the minority interests on GSI SA is amortized over
a 40 year period.

Other goodwill is amortized over a shorter period not exceeding 5
years.

1.3 TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
French francs at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
year and their income statements are translated at the average
exchange rate for the year.

The impact on equity of exchange rate movements from one year to
the next has been included directly in consolidated retained
earnings.

2- Accounting principles and bases of valuation

2.1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE

Expenditure on research and development is written-off in the
year in which it occurred.

2.2  INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Software and licenses acquired are amortized over a period of 1
to 3 years.  Other intangibles are amortized over a maximum
period of 5 years.

2.3 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plan and equipment are stated at cost.

Depreciation is based on the expected useful life and is charged
using either the straight line or the declining balance method,
depending on the nature of the assets concerned.

Computer hardware is depreciated over a period of 2 to 5 years.
Other fixed assets (fixtures, furniture, equipment, etc. ) are
depreciated over a period of 5 to 10 years.

2.4 DEFERRED TAXES

The effects of deferred taxation resulting from temporary
differences between the fiscal value and the accounting value of
assets and liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial
statements using the liability method.
                                        -7-
<PAGE>

No account is taken in the financial statements of deferred tax
assets resulting from tax loss carry forwards,and the temporary
timing differences are written off as they arise.

2.5 RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Retirement benefits for the employees of companies in France are
fully provided for in the balance sheet.  The provision is
calculated using the discounted present vale of future benefits.
Similar rights recognized by subsidiaries outside France are
included in the consolidated financial statements.

2.6 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF RESULTS ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS

Profits and losses on long-term contracts are recorded using the
percentage of completion method.

According to this method, revenue and margin are recorded as the
contract progresses; losses are fully provided for when they seem
probable and the excess or shortfall in invoicing compared with
the level of work in progress is recorded as deferred income or
income receivable.

                          PRO FORMA

         CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
June 30, 1995 and the unaudited pro forma statement of consolidated earnings
for the year ended June 30, 1995 give effect to the acquisition of GSI -
Participations ("GSI") by Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ("ADP").

The pro forma information is based on the historical consolidated financial
statements of ADP and GSI (after giving effect to certain adjustments to GSI's
financial statements resulting from the application of U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles), giving effect to the GSI transaction under the purchase
method of accounting and the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying
notes to the pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.  The
pro forma adjustments are based on information available as of the date hereof,
while the actual adjustments will be based on the ultimate appraisals,
evaluations, and estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the actual adjustments
will not differ from those reflected herein.

The pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the
acquisition as if it had occurred on June 30, 1995.  The pro forma statement
of consolidated earnings gives effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred
on July 1, 1994.

The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is
not indicative of the financial position or the results of operations which
would actually have been reported had the acquisition been in effect during
these periods, or which may be reported in the future.  These pro forma
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical
financial statements and related notes of ADP included within its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 1995, and with the financial statements
and related notes of GSI for the year ended December 31, 1994 included in
Form 8-K filed by ADP on November 6, 1995 and for the six months ended June 30,
1995 contained in this Form 8-KA.

       from French francs to U.S. dollars at an exchange ratio of .2067
       (rate at June 30, 1995) dollars to the franc.  The income statement
       for the year ended June 30, 1995 has been translated at a rate of .1935

       leased space [$10,151,000] (recorded in order to comply with Statement
       of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5).  Additionally, certain claims
       have been made against GSI in the normal course of business. The fair
       value of such contingencies is not currently determinable based on the
       information available at this time.

(d)    Represents adjustments to reflect the proper useful life and accumulated
       depreciation of property,plant and equipment related to specific client
       contracts.

(e)    Represents the impact of the adjustments referred to in (c) and
       (d) above on the Statement of Consolidated Earnings, as if the
       acquisition had occurred as of July 1, 1994.

(f) Represents the elimination of the assets and liabilities and results of
    operations of GSI entities disposed of during the year ended June 30, 1995
    or to be disposed of subsequent to June 30, 1995, including GSI's interest

    disposals of assets [$3,960,000].

(h) Represents miscellaneous adjustments related to initial estimates of fair
    value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

(i) Represents reduction of ADP's historical cash and marketable securities

(j) Represents the elimination of GSI's historical goodwill existing as of the
    acquisition date [$35,655,000] and the initial estimate of goodwill and
    other intangibles arising from the acquisition.  This estimate will be
    adjusted based on the ultimate appraisals, evaluations, and estimates of
    the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

(k) Upon completion of the valuation process, a deferred tax liability and/or
    asset will be recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 109 for differences between the assigned value
    and the tax bases of all assets acquired, other than goodwill, and

         This estimate is calculated based on an assumed
         blended amortization period of 25 years.  This
         estimate will be adjusted based on the ultimate
         appraisals, evaluations, and estimates of the
         fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
         assumed which will be developed and documented
         over the next year.

      4. elimination of restructuring charges previously      (12,774,000)
