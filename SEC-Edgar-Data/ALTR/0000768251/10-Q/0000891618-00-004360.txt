              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (UNAUDITED)


Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation:

The condensed consolidated financial information as of June 30, 2000 and for the
six month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 included herein is unaudited and
has been prepared by the Company in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary to state
fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
for the periods presented. The December 31, 1999 balance sheet was derived from
audited financial statements on that date. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as
well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results will differ from those estimates, and such differences
may be material to the financial statements. These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1999 included
in the Company's Annual Report and Form 10-K, as filed on March 24, 2000, with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the six
months ended June 30, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for any future periods.

This interim period ended on the Friday nearest June 30th. For presentation
purposes, the interim financial statements and accompanying notes refer to the
Company's interim periods ending as of June 30th.

Note 3 - Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income, including net income and unrealized loss on
available-for-sale investments, was $98.7 million and $172.4 million for the
three and six month periods ending June 30, 2000, respectively. Comprehensive
income approximated net income of $51.1 million and $98.1 million for the three
and six month periods ended June 30, 1999, respectively.


                                                                               6
<PAGE>   7

Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1.0 million presented in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2000 consists
of the accumulated unrealized loss on available-for-sale investments of $1.6
million, net of income taxes of $0.6 million.


Note 4 - Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period and excludes the dilutive effect of stock options. Diluted income per
share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during a
period. In computing diluted income per share, the tax benefit resulting from
employee stock transactions and the average stock price for the period are used
in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from exercise of
stock options.

A reconciliation of basic and diluted income per share is presented below (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

In June 2000, the Company sold put warrants to an independent third party. These
put warrants entitle the holder the right to sell 750,000 shares of Altera's
common stock to Altera at a specified price on the maturity date. The cash
proceeds from the sale of the put warrants were approximately $7.0 million and
have been included in capital in excess of par value. As of June 30, 2000,
warrants for all 750,000 shares were outstanding. These warrants will expire
between August 2000 and November 2000 and have exercise prices between $64.09
and $68.80 per share.

Note 7 - New Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 establishes standards for
accounting and reporting on derivative instruments for periods beginning after
June 15, 2000 and early adoption is permitted. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities and measured at fair value. Furthermore, SFAS No. 133 requires
current recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. The Company expects that its adoption of SFAS No. 133, which will
become effective in fiscal year 2001, will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial statements.

In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44 ("FIN 44") "Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25". FIN 44 clarifies the application of Opinion No. 25 for (a) the
definition of employee for purposes of applying Opinion No. 25, (b) the criteria
for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the
accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. The adoption of FIN 44, which
became effective July 1, 2000, did not have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.


Note 8 - Acquisitions

The Company completed the acquisitions of all of the outstanding capital stock
of DesignPRO Inc. ("DesignPRO"), a developer and provider of intellectual
property (IP) cores and custom design solutions, and Right Track CAD Inc.
("Right Track"), a developer of architectural and computer aided design (CAD)
tools for advanced programmable logic devices (PLDs), on April 19, 2000 and May
1, 2000, respectively.

The Company issued 442,827 shares of Altera's common stock and paid
approximately $11.5 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $0.3 million, for
all of the capital stock of DesignPRO and Right Track. In addition, Altera
granted options to purchase 161,573 shares of Altera's common stock in exchange
for all of the stock options outstanding of DesignPRO and Right Track. The fair
value of Altera's shares and options issued was approximately $42.5 million and
$14.6 million, respectively. Altera incurred direct acquisition costs of
approximately $0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price. Total
consideration for the two acquisitions was $69.2 million. The acquisitions were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price was
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based in part on an independent appraisal of their respective fair values. Total
consideration paid in connection with the acquisitions was attributable to the
following (in thousands):

No supplemental pro forma information is presented due to the immaterial effect
on prior period results of operations.

The Company recorded aggregate deferred stock-based compensation of $41.3
million representing the value of restricted stock issued in conjunction with
the acquisitions of DesignPRO and Right Track. Deferred stock-based compensation
is being amortized to research and development expense over a period of two to
four years. For the three months ended June 30, 2000, amortization of deferred
stock-based compensation was $2.1 million.

The amounts allocated to market ready technology and IPR&D were made in a manner
consistent with widely recognized appraisal practices. The analysis resulted in
a valuation of $21.2 million for market ready technology which had reached
technological feasibility and therefore was capitalizable. The market ready


                                                                               8
<PAGE>   9

technology is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five to
six years. The analysis also resulted in a $6.3 million charge to acquired
in-process research and development. The acquired in-process technology
represents the appraised value of technologies in the development stage that had
not yet reached technological feasibility and does not have alternative future
uses. This amount was expensed as a non-recurring charge upon consummation of
the acquisitions.

The value assigned to IPR&D was determined by identifying research projects in
areas for which technological feasibility had not been established. For both the
Right Track and DesignPRO valuations, the values were determined by estimating
the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable and then
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a
percentage of completion. The percentage of completion was determined using
milestones representing management's estimate of effort, value added, and degree
of difficulty of the portion of each project completed as of the acquisition
date, as compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to
bring each project to technical feasibility.

If the projects discussed above are not successfully developed, the sales and
profitability of the Company may be adversely affected in future periods.
Additionally, the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired.
Company management believes that the IPR&D charge is valued consistently with
the SEC staff's current views regarding valuation methodologies. There can be no
assurances that the SEC staff will not take issue with any assumptions used in
our valuation model and require the Company to revise the amount allocated to
IPR&D.


Note 9 - Subsequent Event:

On July 13, 2000, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of
a 100 percent stock dividend to holders of record of the Company's common stock
on July 26, 2000. The dividend shares will be distributed to stockholders on or
about August 10, 2000. The pro forma earnings per share and weighted average
shares outstanding given the effect of the stock split are as follows (shares in

ITEM 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

        The following Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are generally written in the
future tense and/or are preceded by words such as "expects," "suggests,"
"believes," "anticipates," or "intends." The Company's future results of
operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this Report
involve a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the
Company's control. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in
proximity to forward looking statements in this Report. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from projected results include, but are not
limited to, risks associated with the Company's ability to achieve continued
cost reductions and maintain gross margins, the Company's ability to continue to
achieve die size reductions, the Company's ability to achieve and maintain
appropriate inventory mix and levels and respond successfully to changes in
product demand, the ability of price reductions to increase demand and
strengthen the Company's market share over the long term, successful development
and subsequent introduction of new products through investment in research and
development and application of new process technologies to old and new product
lines, market acceptance of the Company's new products, continued demand for the
Company's existing products, and general market conditions. Additional risk
factors are disclosed in the Company's 1999 Annual Report and Form 10-K on file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales

        Beginning with the second quarter of 2000, the Company classifies its
products by supply voltage, replacing the previous methodology that classified
products by the categories New, Mainstream and Mature. All prior data have been
updated to reflect the change. In general, customers prefer products with lower
supply voltages because they use less power and dissipate less heat, normally
resulting in lower overall system cost. Lower supply voltages result from more
advanced fabrication processes which also yield higher performance and lower
cost. Thus, supply voltage correlates with product maturity: lower voltages
represent newer products. The Company classifies its products into the following
supply voltage categories: 1.8-volt products consist of the APEX 20KE family;
2.5-volt products include the MAX 7000B, FLEX 10KE, APEX 20K and ACEX 1K
families; 3.3-volt products include the MAX 3000A/7000A, FLEX 6000 and FLEX 10KA
families; 5.0-volt products consist of the Classic, MAX 7000/7000S, MAX 9000,
FLEX 8000 and FLEX 10K families; and Other products include tools, FLASHlogic,
configuration devices and MPLDs.

        Sales during the second quarter of 2000 were $340.7 million, 72.3%
higher than the $197.8 million reported for the same period last year. Sales in
the second quarter of 2000 increased from the same period last year primarily
due to increases in unit sales of all product voltage categories. The increase
in sales was partially offset by decreases in the average unit selling prices of
higher voltage products. Sales of 2.5-volt products were $43.1 million, 621.6%
higher than the $6.0 million reported for the same period last year. Sales of
3.3-volt products increased to $119.3 million in the second quarter of 2000, a
158.0% increase from $46.2 million in the second quarter of 1999. During the
same period, sales of 5.0-volt products increased 15.7% to $152.8 million from
$132.1 million, and sales of Other products increased 33.0% to $18.0 million
from $13.5 million.

        Sales during the six months ended June 30, 2000 were $613.5 million,
59.7% higher than the $384.2 million reported for the same period last year.
This increase is attributable primarily to the increase in unit sales of all
product voltage categories, partially offset by decreases in average unit
selling prices of higher voltage products. Sales of 2.5-volt products were $73.3
million, 743.9% higher than the $8.7 million reported for the same period last
year. Sales of 3.3-volt products increased to $202.2 million for the first six
months of 2000, a 142.1% increase from $83.5 million for the first six months of
1999. During the same period, sales of 5.0-volt products increased 12.2% to
$294.2 million from $262.2 million, and sales of Other products increased 16.3%
to $34.6 million from $29.8 million.

        As a percentage of total sales, sales in North America, Europe and Asia
Pacific increased, while sales in Japan declined during the first six months of
2000 compared to the first six months of 1999. In absolute dollars, sales in
North America increased 62.5% to $350.1 million from $215.4 million, Europe
increased 89.5%


                                                                              10
<PAGE>   11

to $136.2 million from $71.9 million, Asia Pacific increased 60.7% to $35.1
million from $21.8 million and Japan sales increased 22.7% to $92.1 million from
$75.1 million.

        In October 1999, the Company sold to Cypress Semiconductor Corporation
("Cypress") the exclusive right to manufacture, market and sell its MAX 5000
programmable logic device product family and its equity interest in Cypress
Semiconductor (Texas), Inc. Excluding the MAX 5000 product family, total sales
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2000 grew 75.2% and 62.5%,
respectively over the same periods last year.

Gross Margin

        Gross Margin, as a percentage of sales, for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2000 were 66.3% and 65.9%, respectively. Gross margin for the
comparable periods in 1999 were 63.5% and 63.2%, respectively. The increase in
gross margin was primarily attributable to cost reductions as a result of
manufacturing process improvements.

        Yields on newer, lower voltage products continued to improve for the six
months ended June 30, 2000 over the same period a year ago. This includes
improvements in the APEX 20K/20KE, FLEX 10KE and FLEX 10KA product families. The
Company continues to spend a significant amount of financial resources to
improve production yields on both new and established products. Difficulties in
production yields can often occur when the Company is beginning production of
new products or transitioning to new processes. These difficulties can
potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability.
For example, in the fourth quarter of 1999, process control issues associated
with WaferTech's volume ramp up resulted in low die yields on FLEX 10KA and FLEX
10KE products leading to reduced product availability in these families. As a
result, the Company was unable to support distributor stocking at desired levels
and in some cases could not meet end customer demand. Management expects to
continue to introduce new and established products using new process
technologies and may encounter similar start-up difficulties during the
transition to such process technologies. Further, production throughput times
vary considerably among the Company's wafer suppliers, and the Company may
experience delays from time to time in processing some of its products which
also may result in higher costs and lower product availability.

Research and Development

        Excluding the effects of the one-time acquired IPR&D charge, research
and development expenditures for the three months ended June 30, 2000 were $38.9
million, or 11.4% of sales, compared to $19.9 million, or 10.0% of sales, for
the same period last year. For the six months ended June 30, 2000, research and
development expenses were $73.3 million, or 12.0% percent of sales, compared to
$36.9 million, or 9.6% of sales, for the first six months of 1999. Historically,
the level of research and development expenditures as a percentage of sales has
fluctuated in part due to the timing of the purchase of masks and wafers used in
development and prototyping of new products. The Company expects that, in the
long term, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars
primarily due to the Company's efforts to develop new products. Research and
development expenditures include expenditures for labor, prototype and
developmental wafers, the amortization of deferred stock-based compensation, and
expenses for the development of process technology, new packages, and software
to support new products and design environments.

        Research and development expenses for the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2000 increased $19.0 million and $36.4 million, respectively over
the same periods last year. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily a
result of increased headcount, additional spending on masks, wafers, package
development and outside development services relating to the development of new
products including the FLEX 10KE, MAX 7000A/7000B and APEX 20K/20KE families, as
well as development of the Company's Quartus software and Excalibur embedded
processor solutions. During the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded
deferred stock-based compensation of $41.3 million for the acquisitions of
DesignPRO and Right Track which is being amortized to research and development
expense over a period of two to four years. For the three months ended June 30,
2000, amortization of deferred stock-based compensation was $2.1 million.

        The Company expects to continue to make significant investments in the
development of MAX 7000A/7000B, APEX 20K/20KE, Quartus software, Excalibur
embedded processor solutions and future products. During the first quarter of
1999, the Company shipped a new family of devices, APEX 20K, and its


                                                                              11
<PAGE>   12

new fourth generation software design tool, Quartus. During the fourth quarter
of 1999, the Company began shipping its APEX 20KE family of devices. The rollout
of the 1.8-volt APEX 20KE product family progressed further during the second
quarter of 2000, during which time four new devices began shipping including the
APEX EP20K1500E, one of the world's largest programmable devices. The APEX 20KE
family offers advanced features over the APEX 20K family including lower power
consumption, faster performance, expanded I/O support and smaller die sizes.
APEX 20K/20KE devices utilize a new architecture for programmable logic and
address higher density designs. APEX 20K/20KE devices are exclusively supported
by the Company's new software design tool, Quartus. Also during the second
quarter of 2000, the Company introduced its new Excalibur embedded processor
solutions. Excalibur solutions combine programmable logic, memory and a
processor core, allowing users to integrate an entire system on a single PLD.
These solutions provide programmable flexibility and system-level integration
while bringing advanced processor technology to the broad marketplace.
Management expects APEX 20K/20KE devices, Quartus software and Excalibur
solutions to be successful in the marketplace, however, the commercial success
of these products is dependent on the acceptance of the use of APEX 20K/20KE
devices in high-density designs, as well as the acceptance of the Quartus design
software and Excalibur solutions. Management can give no assurances on the
market acceptance of the Company's products.

        The Company also continues to focus its efforts on the development of
new programmable logic chips, related development software and hardware, and
advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes. However, there can be no
assurance that the Company will accomplish its goals in the development and
subsequent introduction of new products and manufacturing processes.
Furthermore, there is no assurance that these products will achieve market
acceptance, that the new manufacturing processes will be successful, or that the
suppliers will provide the Company with the quality or quantity of wafers and
materials that the Company requires. The Company must continue to develop and
introduce new products in a timely manner to help counter the industry's
historical trend of declining prices as products mature.

Selling, General and Administrative

        Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999 were $48.8 million and $33.7 million, or 14.3% and 17.1%
of sales, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999,
selling, general and administrative expenses were $92.2 million and $66.1
million, or 15.0% and 17.2% of sales, respectively. Selling, general and
administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales,
marketing and administrative personnel, commissions and incentive expenses,
advertising and promotional expenditures, and legal expenses. Also included in
selling, general and administrative expenses are costs related to the direct
sales force and field application engineers who work in field sales offices
worldwide and stimulate demand by assisting customers in the use and proper
selection of the Company's products.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2000 increased $15.1 million and $26.1 million,
respectively from the same periods last year. The increase in absolute dollars
was mainly driven by increased headcount for sales, marketing and administration
personnel, higher advertising expenses, and higher commission and incentive
expenses associated with higher sales.

In-Process Research and Development

        The Company recorded a non-recurring charge of $6.3 million related to
the purchase of DesignPRO and Right Track. This was determined through valuation
techniques generally used by appraisers in the high-technology industry and was
immediately expensed in the period of acquisition because technological
feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified.
The charge is discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements contained herein.

Income from Operations

        Income from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999
was $132.0 million and $71.9 million, or 38.7% and 36.4% of sales, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, income from operations was
$232.4 million and $139.8 million, or 37.9% and 36.4%, respectively. The
year-to-year increase in operating income, as a percentage of sales, was
primarily due to improvements in gross margin partially offset by increased
research and development expenses as a percentage of sales.


                                                                              12
<PAGE>   13

Interest and Other Income

        Interest and other income for the three months ended June 30, 2000 and
1999 was $10.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively. For the six months ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, interest and other income was $20.9 million and $10.6
million, respectively. Interest and other income consists mainly of interest
income on investments in high quality fixed income securities. The increase in
interest and other income was primarily due to the increase in interest income
related to higher investment balances and higher interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes

        The Company's effective tax rate was 31.0% and 32.5% for the six month
periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The year over year reduction
in effective tax rate primarily resulted from the reinstitution of the research
and development tax credit and a change in the geographic mix of revenue.

Equity Investment

        In June 1996, the Company, TSMC and several other partners formed
WaferTech, LLC ("WaferTech"), a joint-venture company, to build and operate a
wafer manufacturing plant in Camas, Washington. In return for a $140.4 million
cash investment, the Company received an 18% equity ownership in the
joint-venture company and certain obligations and rights to procure up to 27% of
the joint-venture's output at market prices. In January 1999, the Company
purchased from Analog Devices, Inc. an additional 5% equity ownership interest
in WaferTech for approximately $37.5 million, increasing its ownership interest
to 23%. This increased investment in WaferTech provides the Company with
additional obligations and rights to procure up to 35% of the joint-venture's
future output. In October 1999, the Company made an additional $23.0 million
cash investment in WaferTech. As a result of this additional cash investment,
there were no changes to the Company's ownership interest or obligations and
rights for the procurement of the joint-venture's output. The Company accounts
for this investment under the equity method based on the Company's ability to
exercise significant influence on the operating and financial policies of
WaferTech. For the three months ended June 30, 2000, the Company recorded a
marginal profit in WaferTech, as compared to a loss of $1.5 million for the same
period a year ago. The Company's equity in the loss of WaferTech for the six
month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 was $1.4 million and $3.5 million,
respectively. WaferTech has experienced lower than forecast production yields
resulting in lower than forecast output. Although the Company expects future
WaferTech production volumes and yields to increase, the ramp up of WaferTech's
production has been slower than forecasted and has not met the targeted levels.
There can be no assurances that WaferTech will continue to make a profit and
that WaferTech will not have an adverse impact on the Company's operating
results.

Future Results

        Future operating results will depend on the Company's ability to
develop, manufacture and sell complex semiconductor components and programming
software that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing
vendors. The Company's efforts in this regard may not be successful. The Company
is developing programmable chips for applications that are presently served by
other ASIC vendors. These vendors have well-established market positions and a
solution that has been proven technically feasible and economically competitive
over several decades. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
successful in displacing ASIC vendors in the targeted applications and
densities. Furthermore, other programmable logic vendors are targeting these
applications and may be successful in securing market share to the exclusion of
the Company. Moreover, standard cell technologies are increasingly used by the
Company's customers to achieve greater integration in their systems; this may
not only impede the Company's efforts to penetrate the ASIC market, but may also
displace the Company's products in the applications that it presently serves.
The Company's future growth will depend on its ability to continually, and on a
timely basis, introduce new products, and to continue to improve the performance
of the Company's products in response to both evolving demands of the market
place and competitive product offerings.

        The Company is highly dependent upon subcontractors to manufacture
silicon wafers and assemble, test and ship product to end customers. The Company
is also dependent on its wafer foundry partners to improve process technologies
in a timely manner to enhance the Company's product designs and cost structure.
Their inability to do so could have a severe negative impact on the Company. The
vast majority of the Company's products are manufactured and shipped to
customers by subcontractors located in Asia, principally Hong Kong, Japan,
Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan. Disruptions or adverse supply
conditions arising from market conditions, political strife, labor disruptions
and other factors could have adverse


                                                                              13

consequences on the Company's future results. Market demand for silicon wafers
increased significantly during the course of 1999 and through the second quarter
of 2000, while supply of such wafers has increased at a much slower rate,
resulting in a firmer pricing environment, less responsiveness to requests for
expedited delivery by wafer suppliers, and in some cases, unsatisfied demand. In
general, the lead time to increase market wafer supply by building additional
wafer fabrication facilities is approximately two years and in periods where
demand for wafers increases rapidly for a prolonged period, market shortages
tend to occur. Management believes that for at least the next several quarters,
demand will exceed the foundry industry's ability to supply silicon wafers and
that certain companies that rely on the foundry industry will not be successful
in securing all of the wafers that they desire, thereby constraining their
revenues. The Company believes that under such circumstances it is important to
have close business relationships with wafer suppliers in order to receive the
desired quantity of product. The Company believes that it enjoys close working
relationships with its principal wafer supplier, TSMC. However, there can be no
assurance the Company will be successful in securing its total desired output
from TSMC or that the Company's future growth will not be impaired by the
scarcity of silicon wafers.

        Natural or man-made disasters, normal process fluctuations and variances
in manufacturing yields could have a severe negative impact on the Company's
operating capabilities. For example, in September 1999, a major earthquake
struck Taiwan resulting in widespread physical damage and loss of life. The
earthquake halted wafer fabrication production at the Company's primary vendor,
TSMC, for several days and then only limited production began. It was nearly two
weeks before full production resumed, and additionally some portion of the
inventory in the production process was scrapped as a result of damage incurred
during the earthquake. The Company has sought to diversify its operating risk by
participating in the WaferTech joint-venture to manufacture silicon wafers with
other partners in Camas, Washington. Production began at the WaferTech
joint-venture in October 1998 and volume production was achieved in 1999.
WaferTech has experienced lower than forecast production yields resulting in
lower than forecast output. Although the Company expects future WaferTech
production volumes and yields to increase, the ramp up of WaferTech's production
has been slower than forecasted and has not met the targeted levels. There can
be no assurances that the worldwide supply and demand for semiconductor wafers
will be such that WaferTech will continue to make a profit and that WaferTech
will not have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results.

        Also, a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including
general economic conditions and cycles in world markets, exchange rate
fluctuations or a lack of growth in the Company's end markets could adversely
impact future results. Because of the foregoing and other factors that might
affect the Company's operating results, past financial performance should not be
considered an indicator of future performance, and investors should not use
historical trends to anticipate future results. In addition, the cyclical nature
of the semiconductor industry and other factors have resulted in a highly
volatile price of the Company's common stock.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During the first six months of 2000, cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments increased by $37.8 million to $883.5 million from $845.7
million at December 31, 1999. During the first six months of 2000, the Company's
operating activities generated net cash of $249.3 million. This cash flow was
primarily attributable to net income of $173.4 million, adjusted by non-cash
items including equity in the loss of WaferTech of $1.4 million, depreciation
and amortization of $17.1 million, the one-time write-off of $6.3 million for
acquired in-process research and development, an increase in deferred income on
sales to distributors and income taxes payable of $100.3 million and $65.3
million, respectively. These items were partially offset by an increase in
deferred income taxes, accounts receivable and inventories of $24.3 million,
$73.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively.

        Cash provided by investing activities of $49.7 million for the first six
months of 2000 was primarily the result of net sales of short-term investments
of $99.9 million, partially offset by cash payments of $11.5 million for the
acquisitions of DesignPRO and Right Track, as well as the Company's $36.6
million investment in manufacturing and data processing equipment and software,
and building improvements in its headquarter facility.

        For the first six months of 2000, the net cash used by the Company in
its financing activities was $159.7 million. The Company repurchased 2.4 million
shares of its common stock for $187.4 million, partially offset by net proceeds
of $20.7 million from the issuance of 2.5 million shares of common stock to
employees


                                                                              14
<PAGE>   15

through various option and employee stock purchase plans. In addition, the
Company received $7.0 million from the sale of put warrants.

Financial Condition

        Since its inception, the Company has used a combination of equity and
debt financing and cash generated from operations to support its operating
activities.

        As of June 30, 2000, the Company had $883.5 million of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments available to finance future growth. The
Company believes the available sources of funds and cash expected to be
generated from operations will be adequate to finance current operations,
capital expenditures and common stock repurchases for at least the next year.

Impact of Currency and Inflation

        The Company purchases the majority of its materials and services in U.S.
dollars, and its foreign sales are transacted in U.S. dollars. The Company has,
in the past, entered into forward contracts to hedge against currency
fluctuations and to meet contractual commitments denominated in foreign
currencies. During the second quarter of 2000, the Company entered into a
forward exchange contract to purchase Malaysian ringgit to meet a portion of its
firm contractual commitments of ringgit required. The contract will be settled
in June 2001. The Company may choose to enter into similar contracts from time
to time should conditions appear favorable. Effects of inflation on the
Company's financial results have not been significant.


ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

        As of June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company's investment portfolio
consisted of fixed income securities of $726.0 million and $616.1 million,
respectively. These securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject
to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates
increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by
10% from levels as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, the decline in the fair value of
the portfolio would not be material. Additionally, the Company has the ability
to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and, therefore, the Company
would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows.

        The Company has international subsidiary and branch operations and is,
therefore, subject to foreign currency rate exposure. To date, the exposure to
the Company related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant. If the
foreign currency rates fluctuate by 10% from rates at June 30, 2000 and 1999,
the effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations would
not be material. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be a
material impact in the future.



                                                                              15

PART II OTHER INFORMATION


ITEM 1: Legal Proceedings

        The Company is a party to lawsuits and may in the future become a party
to lawsuits involving various types of claims, including, but not limited to,
unfair competition and intellectual property matters. Legal proceedings tend to
be unpredictable and costly and may be affected by events outside the control of
the Company. There is no assurance that litigation will not have an adverse
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The
Company's major litigation matters as of June 30, 2000 are described below.

        In June 1993, Xilinx, Inc. ("Xilinx") brought suit against the Company
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the Company's alleged
infringement of certain patents held by Xilinx. In June 1993, the Company
brought suit against Xilinx, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief
based on Xilinx's alleged infringement of certain patents held by the Company.
In April 1995, the Company filed a separate lawsuit against Xilinx in Delaware,
Xilinx's state of incorporation, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief
based on Xilinx's alleged infringement of one of the Company's patents. In May
1995, Xilinx counter-claimed against the Company in Delaware, asserting defenses
and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the Company's
alleged infringement of certain patents held by Xilinx. Subsequently, the
Delaware case has been transferred to California. In October 1998, both parties
filed motions for summary judgment with respect to certain issues in the first
two cases regarding infringement or non-infringement and validity or invalidity
of the patents at issue in the respective cases. In October 1999 - December
1999, the Court ruled on the motions. In the Xilinx suit, the Court ruled that
one of Xilinx's claims is invalid and another claim was withdrawn. The Court
also ruled that issues of infringement and validity on the remaining claims are
subject to trial which has been re-scheduled to begin October 5, 2000. In the
Company's suit, the Court granted that one of the Company's patents is invalid,
granted that one patent is not infringed, and granted another patent is not
literally infringed but denied non-infringement under doctrine of equivalence.
The Court also ordered that the parties engage in mediation, which began
February 24, 2000; although no substantial progress to resolution has been made,
mediation is continuing. Due to the nature of the litigation with Xilinx and
because the lawsuits are still in the pre-trial stage, the Company's management
cannot estimate the total expense, the possible loss, if any, or the range of
loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the allegations.
Management cannot ensure that Xilinx will not succeed in obtaining significant
monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale of the
Company's products, including but not limited to MAX 7000, FLEX 8000 or MAX 9000
families of products, or succeed in invalidating other of the Company's patents.
Although no assurances can be given as to the results of these cases, the
Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in the
Xilinx suit and intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

        In May 2000, the Company brought a new suit against Xilinx, seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief based on Xilinx's alleged infringement of
certain patents held by the Company and not previously asserted. In July 2000,
Xilinx filed a counterclaim against the Company alleging infringement of certain
patents held by Xilinx and not previously asserted. The Court has issued an
order setting the claim construction hearing for December 6 and 7, 2000. Due to
the nature of the litigation with Xilinx and because the lawsuit is still in the
pre-trial stage and discovery is in early stages, the Company's management
cannot estimate the total expenses, the possible loss, if any, or the range of
loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the counterclaim
allegations. Although no assurances can be given as to the results of this case,
the Company intends to defend itself vigorously in the matter.

        In August 1994, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD") brought suit
against the Company seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the
Company's alleged infringement of certain patents held by AMD. In September
1994, the Company answered the complaint asserting that it is licensed to use
the patents which AMD claims are infringed and filed a counterclaim against AMD
alleging infringement of certain patents held by the Company. In October 1997,
upon completion of trials bifurcated from the infringement claims, the District
Court ruled that the Company is licensed under all patents asserted by AMD in
the suit. In December 1997, AMD filed a Notice of Appeal of the District Court's
rulings. In April 1999, the Federal Circuit Court ruled in AMD's favor on its
appeal, finding that the Company is not licensed to AMD's patents, and remanded
the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. In 1999, Lattice
Corporation ("Lattice") entered into an agreement with AMD which includes
assuming both the claims against the Company and the claims against AMD and has
replaced AMD in the suit with Vantis Corporation ("Vantis"), a wholly owned


                                                                              16

subsidiary of Lattice. Due to the nature of the litigation, the Company's
management cannot estimate the total expense, the possible loss, if any, or the
range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the
allegations. Management cannot ensure that Lattice will not succeed in obtaining
significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale
of the Classic, MAX 7000, FLEX 8000, MAX 9000 and FLEX 10K product families, or
succeed in invalidating any of the Company's patents remaining in the suit.
Although no assurances can be given as to the results of this case, the Company
intends to defend itself vigorously in the matter.

        In May 2000, the Company brought a new suit against Lattice seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief based on Lattice's alleged infringement
of certain patents held by the Company. In July 2000, Lattice filed a
counterclaim against the Company alleging infringement of certain patents held
by Lattice. Due to the nature of the litigation with Lattice and because the
lawsuit is still in the pre-trial stage, the Company's management cannot
estimate the total expenses, the possible loss, if any, or the range of loss
that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the counterclaim allegations.
Although no assurances can be given as to the results of this case, the Company
intends to defend itself vigorously in the matter.

        In November 1999, the Company filed suit against Clear Logic Inc.
("Clear Logic") alleging that Clear Logic is unlawfully appropriating the
Company's registered mask work technology in violation of the federal mask work
statute and that Clear Logic has unlawfully interfered with the Company's
relationships and contracts with its customers. The lawsuit seeks compensatory
and punitive damages and an injunction to stop Clear Logic from unlawfully using
the Company's mask work technology and from interfering with the Company's
customers. Clear Logic has answered the complaint by denying that it is
infringing the Company's mask work technology and denying that it has unlawfully
interfered with the Company's relationships and contracts with its customers.
Clear Logic has also filed a counterclaim against the Company for unfair
competition under California law alleging that the Company has made false
statements to its customers regarding Clear Logic. Due to the nature of the
litigation with Clear Logic and because the lawsuit is still in the pre-trial
stage, the Company's management cannot estimate the total expenses, the possible
loss, if any, or the range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection
with the counterclaim allegations. Although no assurances can be given as to the
results of this case, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously in the
matter.

                               ALTERA CORPORATION

                        1987 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

                        (Restated effective May 10, 2000)


        The following constitute the provisions of the 1987 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan of Altera Corporation.

        1. Purpose. The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the
Company and its Designated Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase Common
Stock of the Company through accumulated payroll deductions. It is the intention
of the Company to have the Plan qualify as an "Employee Stock Purchase Plan"
under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
provisions of the Plan shall, accordingly, be construed so as to extend and
limit participation in a manner consistent with the requirements of that section
of the Code.

        2. Definitions.

               (a) "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.

               (b) "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

               (c) "Common Stock" shall mean the Common Stock, $0.001 par value,
of the Company.

               (d) "Company" shall mean Altera Corporation, a Delaware
corporation.

               (e) "Compensation" shall mean all regular straight-time gross
earnings, plus sales commissions and sales incentives, but exclusive of payments
for overtime, shift premium, other incentive compensation, other incentive
payments, bonuses, or other compensation.

               (f) "Continuous Status as an Employee" shall mean the absence of
any interruption or termination of service as an Employee. Continuous Status as
an Employee shall not be considered interrupted in the case of a leave of
absence agreed to in writing by the Company, provided that such leave is for a
period of not more than ninety (90) days or reemployment upon the expiration of
such leave is guaranteed by contract or statute.

               (g) "Designated Subsidiaries" shall mean the Subsidiaries which
have been designated by the Board from time to time in its sole discretion as
eligible to participate in the Plan.

               (h) "Employee" shall mean any person, including an officer, who
is customarily employed for at least twenty (20) hours per week and more than
five (5) months in a calendar year by the Company or one of its Designated
Subsidiaries.


<PAGE>   2

               (i) "Exercise Date" shall mean the last day of each offering
period of the Plan.

               (j) "Offering Date" shall mean the first day of each offering
period of the Plan.

               (k) "Plan" shall mean this Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

               (l) "Subsidiary" shall mean a corporation, domestic or foreign,
of which not less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting shares are held by the
Company or a Subsidiary, whether or not such corporation now exists or is
hereafter organized or acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary.

        3. Eligibility.

               (a) Any person who is an Employee as of the Offering Date of a
given offering period shall be eligible to participate in such offering period
under the Plan, subject to the requirements of paragraph 5(a) and the
limitations imposed by Section 423(b) of the Code.

               (b) Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding,
no Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after
the grant, such Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to
such Employee pursuant to Section 425(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or
hold outstanding options to purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more
of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the
Company or of any subsidiary of the Company; or (ii) which permits his rights to
purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans (described in Section 423
of the Code) of the Company and its subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which
exceeds Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) of fair market value of such
stock (determined at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in
which such option is outstanding at any time.

        4. Offering Periods. The Plan shall be implemented by one offering
during each six- (6) month period of the Plan, commencing on or about August 16,
1988, and continuing thereafter until terminated in accordance with paragraph 19
hereof. The Board shall have the power to change the duration of offering
periods with respect to future offerings without shareholder approval if such
change is announced at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled beginning
of the first offering period to be affected.

        5. Participation.

               (a) An eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by
completing a subscription agreement authorizing payroll deduction, on the form
provided by the Company, and filing it with the Company's payroll office prior
to the applicable Offering Date, unless a later time for filing the subscription
agreement is set by the Board for all eligible Employees with respect to a given
offering.


<PAGE>   3

               (b) Payroll deductions for a participant shall commence on the
first payroll following the Offering Date and shall end on the Exercise Date of
the offering to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated
by the participant as provided in paragraph 6(c) or 10.

        6. Payroll Deductions.

               (a) At the time a participant files his subscription agreement,
he shall elect to have payroll deductions made on each payday during the
offering period in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Compensation
which he receives on such payday, and the aggregate of such payroll deductions
during the offering period shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of his aggregate
Compensation during said offering period.

               (b) All payroll deductions made by a participant shall be
credited to his account under the Plan. A participant may not make any
additional payments into such account.

               (c) A participant may discontinue his participation in the Plan
as provided in paragraph 10. A participant may also lower to zero, but not
thereafter increase, the rate of his payroll deductions during the offering
period by notifying the Company in writing. The decrease shall be effective
fifteen (15) days following the Company's receipt of the notification. Should an
eligible Employee decided to again participate in the Plan for future offering
periods, he must complete and file with the Company a new authorization for
payroll deduction.

        7. Grant of Option.

               (a) On the Offering Date of each offering period, each eligible
Employee participating in the Plan shall be granted an option to purchase (at
the per-share option price) up to a number of shares of the Company's Common
Stock determined by dividing such Employee's payroll deductions accumulated
during such offering period (not to exceed an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
of his Compensation during the applicable offering period) by the option price
as defined in Section 7(b) herein, subject to the limitations set forth in
Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof, and provided, however, that in no event shall such
option be exercisable for a number of shares in excess of Twelve Thousand Five
Hundred Dollars ($12,500) divided by eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair
market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Offering Date. Fair
market value of a share of the Company's Common Stock shall be determined as
provided in Section 7(b) herein.

               (b) The option price per share of the shares offered in a given
offering period shall be the lower of: (i) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair
market value of a share of the Common Stock of the Company on the Offering Date;
or (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a share of the
Common Stock of the Company on the Exercise Date. The fair market value of the
Company's Common Stock on a given date shall be determined by the Board in its
discretion; provided, however, that where there is a public market for the
Common Stock, the fair market value per share shall be the mean of the bid and
asked prices of the Common Stock for such date, as reported in The Wall Street
Journal (or, if not so reported, as otherwise


<PAGE>   4

reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
(NASDAQ) System) or, in the event the Common Stock is listed on a stock
exchange, the fair market value per share shall be the closing price on such
exchange on such date, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.

        8. Exercise of Option. Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as
provided in paragraph 10, his option for the purchase of shares will be
exercised automatically on the Exercise Date of the offering period, and the
maximum number of full shares subject to option will be purchased for him at the
applicable option price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his account.
The shares purchased upon exercise of an option hereunder shall be deemed to be
transferred to the participant on the Exercise Date. During his lifetime, a
participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him.

        9. Delivery. As promptly as practicable after the Exercise Date of each
offering period, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each participant, as
appropriate, of a certificate representing the shares purchased upon exercise of
his option. Any cash remaining to the credit of a participant's account under
the Plan at the termination of each offering period which is insufficient to
purchase a full share of Common Stock of the Company shall be credited to the
participant's account for the next offering period, thereby reducing the maximum
amount which may be withheld from Compensation during such next offering period
if it would otherwise exceed the limits set forth in paragraphs 3(b) or 6(a),
or, if requested by the participant or if the participant has elected not to
participate for such following period, shall be returned to said participant.

        10. Withdrawal; Termination of Employment.

               (a) A participant may withdraw all, but not less than all, the
payroll deductions credited to his account under the Plan at any time prior to
the Exercise Date of the offering period by giving written notice to the
Company. All of the participant's payroll deductions credited to his account
will be paid to him promptly after receipt of his notice of withdrawal, and his
option for the current period will be automatically terminated, and no further
payroll deductions for the purchase of shares will be made during the offering
period.

               (b) Upon termination of the participant's Continuous Status as an
Employee prior to the Exercise Date of the offering period for any reason,
including retirement or death, the payroll deductions credited to his account
will be returned to him or, in the case of his death, to the person or persons
entitled thereto under paragraph 14, and his option will be automatically
terminated.

               (c) In the event an Employee fails to remain in Continuous Status
as an Employee of the Company for at least twenty (20) hours per week during the
offering period in which the employee is a participant, he will be deemed to
have elected to withdraw from the Plan, and the payroll deductions credited to
his account will be returned to him and his option terminated.


<PAGE>   5

               (d) A participant's withdrawal from an offering will not have any
effect upon his eligibility to participate in a succeeding offering or in any
similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company.

        11. Interest. No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a
participant in the Plan.

        12. Stock.

               (a) The maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock
which shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be six million eight
hundred fifty thousand (6,850,000) shares, subject to adjustment upon changes in
capitalization of the Company as provided in paragraph 18. If the total number
of shares which would otherwise be subject to options granted pursuant to
Section 7(a) hereof on the Offering Date of an offering period exceeds the
number of shares then available under the Plan (after deduction of all shares
for which options have been exercised or are then outstanding), the Company
shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining available for option
grant in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine
to be equitable. In such event, the Company shall give written notice of such
reduction of the number of shares subject to the option to each Employee
affected thereby, and shall similarly reduce the rate of payroll deductions, if
necessary.

               (b) The participant will have no interest or voting right in
shares covered by his option until such option has been exercised.

               (c) Shares to be delivered to a participant under the Plan will
be registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant
and his spouse.

        13. Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Board of the
Company or a committee of members of the Board appointed by the Board. The
administration, interpretation or application of the Plan by the Board or its
committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all participants. Members
of the Board who are eligible Employees are permitted to participate in the
Plan, provided that:

               (a) Members of the Board who are eligible to participate in the
Plan may not vote on any matter affecting the administration of the Plan or the
grant of any option pursuant to the Plan.

               (b) If a committee is established to administer the Plan, no
member of the Board who is eligible to participate in the Plan may be a member
of the committee.

        14. Designation of Beneficiary.

               (a) A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary
who is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant's account
under the Plan in the event of such participant's death subsequent to the end of
the offering period but prior to delivery to him


<PAGE>   6

of such shares and cash. In addition, a participant may file a written
designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the participant's
account under the Plan in the event of such participant's death prior to the
Exercise Date of the offering period.

               (b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the
participant at any time by written notice. In the event of the death of a
participant, and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the
Plan who is living at the time of such participant's death, the Company shall
deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate
of the participant; or, if no such executor or administrator has been appointed
(to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver
such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or
relatives of the participant; or, if no spouse, dependent or relative is known
to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.

        15. Transferability. Neither payroll deductions credited to a
participant's account nor any rights, with regard to the exercise of an option
or to receive shares under the Plan, may be assigned, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and
distribution or as provided in paragraph 14 hereof) by the participant. Any such
attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without
effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw
funds in accordance with paragraph 10.

        16. Use of Funds. All payroll deductions received or held by the Company
under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the
Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.

        17. Reports. Individual accounts will be maintained for each participant
in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Employees
promptly following the Exercise Date, which statements will set forth the
amounts of payroll deductions, the per share purchase price, the number of
shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.

        18. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required
action by the shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock
covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised and the
number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under
the Plan but have not yet been placed under option (collectively, the
"Reserves"), as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each
option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised, shall be proportionately
adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common
Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or
decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of
consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected
without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board,
whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Except as expressly provided herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock
of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any


<PAGE>   7

class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with
respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an option.

        In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company,
the offering period will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such
proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. In the event of a
proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the
merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each option under the
Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such
successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation,
unless the Board determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu
of such assumption or substitution, that the participant shall have the right to
exercise the option as to all of the optioned stock, including shares as to
which the option would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an
option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a
merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the participant that the option
shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of
such notice, and the option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.

        The Board may, if it so determines in the exercise of its sole
discretion, also make provision for adjusting the Reserves, as well as the price
per share of Common Stock covered by each outstanding option, in the event that
the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights
offerings or other increases or reductions of shares of its outstanding Common
Stock, and in the event of the Company being consolidated with or merged into
any other corporation.

        19. Amendment or Termination. The Board may at any time terminate or
amend the Plan. Except as provided in paragraph 18, no such termination can
affect options previously granted, nor may an amendment make any change in any
option theretofore granted which adversely affects the rights of any
participant, nor may an amendment be made without prior approval of the
shareholders of the Company (obtained in the manner described in paragraph 21)
if such amendment would:

               (a) Increase the number of shares that may be issued under the
Plan;

               (b) Permit payroll deductions at a rate in excess of ten percent
(10%) of the participant's Compensation;

               (c) Change the designation of the employees (or class of
employees) eligible for participation in the Plan; or

               (d) If the Company has a class of equity securities registered
under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act") at the time of such amendment, materially increase the benefits
which may accrue to participants under the Plan.

        If any amendment requiring shareholder approval under this paragraph 19
of the Plan is made subsequent to the first registration of any class of equity
securities by the Company under


<PAGE>   8

Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such shareholder approval shall be solicited as
described in paragraph 21 of the Plan.

        20. Notices. All notices or other communications by a participant to the
Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly
given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by
the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.

        21. Shareholder Approval.

               (a) Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval by the
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or after the date
the Plan is adopted. If such shareholder approval is obtained at a duly held
shareholders' meeting, it must be obtained by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company, or if such
shareholder approval is obtained by written consent, it must be obtained by the
unanimous written consent of all shareholders of the Company; provided, however,
that approval at a meeting or by written consent may be obtained by a lesser
degree of shareholder approval if the Board determines, in its discretion after
consultation with the Company's legal counsel, that such a lesser degree of
shareholder approval will comply with all applicable laws and will not adversely
affect the qualification of the Plan under Section 423 of the Code.

               (b) If and in the event that the Company registers any class of
equity securities pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, any required
approval of the shareholders of the Company obtained after such registration
shall be solicited substantially in accordance with Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

               (c) If any required approval by the shareholders of the Plan
itself or of any amendment thereto is solicited at any time otherwise than in
the manner described in paragraph 21(b) hereof, then the Company shall, at or
prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders held subsequent to the later
of (i) the first registration of any class of equity securities of the Company

          (As amended October 5,1999 and Restated as of May 10, 2000)


       1.     Purposes of the Plan. The purposes of this Stock Option Plan are:

                -       to attract and retain the best available personnel for
                        positions of substantial responsibility,

                -       to provide additional incentive to Employees and
                        Consultants, and

                -       to promote the success of the Company's business.

        Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options or
Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by the Administrator at the time of
grant.

        2.      Definitions. As used herein, the following definitions shall

the regulations promulgated thereunder.

for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated);
provided, however, that Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan
shall not be returned to the Plan and shall not become available for future
distribution under the Plan.

        4.      Administration of the Plan.

               (a) Procedure.

                      (i) Multiple Administrative Bodies. If permitted by Rule
16b-3, the Plan may be administered by different bodies with respect to
Directors, Officers who are not Directors, and Employees who are neither
Directors nor Officers.

Subject to Section 16. With respect to Option grants made to Employees who are
also Officers or Directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Plan
shall be administered by (A) the Board, if the Board may administer the Plan in

administration of employee benefit plans under which Section 16 exempt
discretionary grants and awards of equity securities are to be made, or (B) a

relating to the disinterested administration of employee benefit plans under
which Section 16 exempt discretionary grants and awards of equity securities are
to be made. Once appointed, such Committee shall continue to serve in its
designated capacity until otherwise directed by the Board. From time to time the
Board may increase the size of the Committee and appoint additional members,
remove members (with or without cause) and substitute new members, fill
vacancies (however caused), and remove all members of the Committee and
thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by the
rules under Rule 16b-3 relating to the disinterested administration of employee
benefit plans under which Section 16 exempt discretionary grants and awards of
equity securities are to be made.


                                       4
<PAGE>   5

                      (iii) Administration With Respect to Other Persons. With
respect to Option grants made to Employees or Consultants who are neither
Directors nor Officers of the Company, the Plan shall be administered by (A) the
Board or (B) a committee or committees designated by the Board, which committee
shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws. Once appointed, such Committee
shall serve in its designated capacity until otherwise directed by the Board.
The Board may increase the size of the Committee and appoint additional members,
remove members (with or without cause) and substitute new members, fill
vacancies (however caused), and remove all members of the Committee and
thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by
Applicable Laws.

               (b) Powers of the Administrator. Subject to the provisions of the
Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated
by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority, in
its discretion:

                      (i) to grant options to Employees and Consultants
hereunder;

                      (ii) to determine the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock, in accordance with Section 2(n) of the Plan;

                      (iii) to determine the Consultants and Employees eligible
to be granted Options hereunder;

                      (iv) to determine whether and to what extent Options are
granted hereunder;

                      (v) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to
be covered by each Option granted hereunder;

                      (vi) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

                      (vii) to determine the terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted hereunder. Such
terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the
time or times when Options may be exercised (which may be based on performance
criteria), any vesting acceleration, and any restriction or limitation regarding
any Option or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on
such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;

                      (viii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and
awards granted pursuant to the Plan;

                      (ix) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to
sub-plans established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment
under foreign tax laws;


                                       5
<PAGE>   6

                      (x) to modify or amend each Option (subject to Section
14(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the
post-termination exercisability period of Options longer than is otherwise
provided for in the Plan;

                      (xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the
Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Option previously
granted by the Administrator; and

                      (xii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or
advisable for administering the Plan.

               (c) Effect of Administrator's Decision. The Administrator's
decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all
Optionees and any other holders of Options.

        5. Eligibility. Nonstatutory Stock Options may be granted to those
Employees and Consultants selected by the Administrator. Incentive Stock Options
may be granted only to those Employees selected by the Administrator. If
otherwise eligible, an Employee or Consultant who has been granted an Option may
be granted additional Options.

        6. Limitations.

               (a) Each Option shall be designated in the written option
agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair
Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under
all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such
Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this
Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order
in which they were granted.

               (b) Neither the Plan nor any Option shall confer upon an Optionee
any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's employment or consulting
relationship with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the
Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such employment or
consulting relationship at any time, with or without cause.

               (c) The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options to
Employees:

                      (i) No Employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of
the Company, Options to purchase more than 500,000 Shares.

                      (ii) In connection with his or her initial employment, an
Employee may be granted Options to purchase up to an additional 500,000 Shares
which shall not count against the limit set forth in subsection (i) above.

                      (iii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted
proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as
described in Section 12.


                                       6
<PAGE>   7

        7. Term of Plan. Subject to Section 18 of the Plan, the Plan shall
become effective upon its approval by the shareholders of the Company as
described in Section 18 of the Plan. It shall continue in effect for a term of
ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 14 of the Plan.

        8. Term of Option. The term of each Option shall be stated in the Notice
of Grant; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the
term shall be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may
be provided in the Notice of Grant.

        9. Option Exercise Price and Consideration.

               (a) Exercise Price. The per share exercise price for the Shares
to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be no less than 100% of the
Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

               (b) Waiting Period and Exercise Dates. At the time an Option is
granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be
exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before the
Option may be exercised. In so doing, the Administrator may specify that an
Option may not be exercised until the completion of a service period.

               (c) Form of Consideration. The Administrator shall determine the
acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method
of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall
determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such
consideration may consist entirely of:

                      (i) cash;

                      (ii) check;

                      (iii) promissory note;

                      (iv) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired
upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six
months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said
Option shall be exercised;

                      (v) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice
together with such other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if
applicable, shall require to effect an exercise of the Option and delivery to
the Company of the sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price;

                      (vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to
the Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's
participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or
arrangement;

                      (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment;
or


                                       7
<PAGE>   8

                      (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for
the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

        10. Exercise of Option.

               (a) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder. Any Option
granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at
such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set
forth in the Option Agreement.

                      An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

                      An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company
receives: (i) written notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option
Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full
payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full
payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the
Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued
upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if
requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse.
Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued (as evidenced by
the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock,
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to
be issued) such stock certificate promptly after the Option is exercised. No
adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date
is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in
Section 12 of the Plan. Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the
number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for
sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is
exercised.

               (b) Termination of Employment or Consulting Relationship.

                      (i) In General. Upon termination of an Optionee's
Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant, other than upon the Optionee's
death, Disability, or Retirement, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option
within such period of time as is specified in the Notice of Grant to the extent
that he or she is entitled to exercise it on the date of termination (but in no
event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the
Notice of Grant). In the absence of a specified time in the Notice of Grant, the
Option shall remain exercisable for thirty (30) days following the Optionee's
termination. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, such period of time for
exercise shall not exceed three (3) months from the date of termination. If, on
the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her
entire Option, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option
shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise
his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option
shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

                      Notwithstanding the above, in the event of an Optionee's
change in status from Consultant to Employee or Employee to Consultant, the
Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant shall not
automatically terminate solely as a result of such change in status. In the
event of an Optionee's change in status from Employee to Consultant, each


                                       8
<PAGE>   9

Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as an
Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory
Stock Option three months and one day following such change of status.

                      (ii) Retirement of Optionee. In the event of termination
of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant as a result of
his or her Retirement, such Optionee's Option shall, in the sole discretion of
the Administrator, accelerate vesting or continue to vest, continue to become
exercisable, and may be exercised during such period of time as is determined by
the Administrator and as provided in the Option Agreement (but in no event may
the Option be exercised after the expiration date of the term of such Option as
set forth in the Option Agreement). If, at the end of such period of time, the
Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the Shares
covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If
the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by
the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such
Option shall revert to the Plan.

                      (iii) Disability of Optionee. Upon termination of an
Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant as a result of the
Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option at any time
within three (3) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12)
months as is determined by the Administrator, with such determination in the
case of an Incentive Stock Option being made at the time of grant of the Option)
from the date of termination, but only to the extent that the Optionee is
entitled to exercise it on the date of termination (and in no event later than
the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant).
If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or
her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option
shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise
his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate,
and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

                      (iv) Death of Optionee. Upon the death of an Optionee:

                             (a) during the term of the Option who is at the
time of his or her death an Employee or Consultant of the Company and who shall
have been in Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant since the date of
grant of the Option, the Option may be exercised by the Optionee's estate or by
a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance
at any time within six (6) months (or, in the case of Retirement, such longer
period of time, not to exceed 12 months, as determined by the Administrator)
following the date of death, but in no event later than the date of expiration
of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement, and only to the
extent of the right to exercise the Option that would have accrued had the
Optionee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as an Employee or
Consultant six (6) months after the date of death, subject to the limitation set
forth in Section 6(a); or

                             (b) within thirty (30) days (or such other period
of time not exceeding three (3) months as is determined by the Administrator,
with such determination in the case of an Incentive Stock Option being made at
the time of grant of the Option) after his or her termination of Continuous
Status as an Employee or Consultant, the Option may be exercised by


                                       9
<PAGE>   10

the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the
Option by bequest or inheritance, at any time within six (6) months (or, in the
case of Retirement, such longer period of time, not to exceed 12 months, as
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death, but in no event
later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the
Option Agreement, and only to the extent of the right to exercise the Option
that had accrued at the date of termination.

                             (c) Buyout Provisions. The Administrator may at any
time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously
granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish
and communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

                             (d) Rule 16b-3. Options granted to individuals
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Insiders") must comply with the
applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such additional conditions
or restrictions as may, in the Administrator's sole discretion, be necessary and
desirable to qualify thereunder for the maximum exemption from Section 16 of the
Exchange Act with respect to Plan transactions.

        11. Non-Transferability of Options. An Option may not be sold, pledged,
assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by
will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the
lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.

        12. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger, or
Asset Sale.

               (a) Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by
the shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by
each outstanding Option, and the number of shares of Common Stock which have
been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options have yet
been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or
expiration of an Option, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered
by each such outstanding Option, shall be proportionately adjusted for any
increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting
from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, or
reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the
number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of
consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected
without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board,
whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding, and conclusive.
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of
stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class,
shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to,
the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option.

               (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each
Optionee as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed
transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for an Optionee to
have the right to exercise his or her Option prior to such transaction as to all
of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the


                                       10
<PAGE>   11

Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may
provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any Shares purchased
upon exercise of an Option shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the
proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner
contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Option will
terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.

               (c) Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company
with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets
of the Company, each outstanding Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option
substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the
successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to
assume or substitute for the Option, the Optionee shall have the right to
exercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to
which it would not otherwise be exercisable. If an Option is exercisable in lieu
of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the
Administrator shall notify the Optionee that the Option shall be fully
exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and
the Option shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes
of this paragraph, the Option shall be considered assumed if, following the
merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or
receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately
prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash,
or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of
consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares);
provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of
assets was not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent,
the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide
for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option, for each
Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, to be solely common stock of the
successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share
consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of
assets.

        13. Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option shall be, for all
purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting
such Option, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator.
Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Optionee within a
reasonable time after the date of such grant.



                                       11

        14. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

               (a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend,
alter, suspend, or terminate the Plan.

               (b) Shareholder Approval. The Company shall obtain shareholder
approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply
with Rule 16b-3 or with Section 422 of the Code (or any successor rule or
statute or other applicable law, rule, or regulation, including the requirements
of any exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or
quoted). Such shareholder approval, if required, shall be obtained in such a
manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law, rule, or
regulation.

               (c) Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment, alteration,
suspension, or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee,
unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator,
which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.

        15. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.

               (a) Legal Compliance. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the
exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and
delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law,
including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, Applicable Laws,
and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the
Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the
approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

               (b) Investment Representations. As a condition to the exercise of
an Option, the Company may require the person exercising such Option to
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being
purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or
distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a
representation is required.

        16. Liability of Company.

               (a) Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company
to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which
authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful
issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any
liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which
such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

               (b) Grants Exceeding Allotted Shares. If the Optioned Stock
covered by an Option exceeds, as of the date of grant, the number of Shares
which may be issued under the Plan without additional shareholder approval, such
Option shall be void with respect to such excess Optioned Stock, unless
shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of
Shares subject to the Plan is timely obtained in accordance with Section 14(b)
of the Plan.


                                       12
<PAGE>   13

        17. Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan,
will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

        18. Shareholder Approval. Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to
approval by the shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or
after the date the Plan is adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained
in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws and the rules of
any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is listed.
