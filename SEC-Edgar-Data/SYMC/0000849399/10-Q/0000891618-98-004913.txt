SYMANTEC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements of Symantec Corporation ("Symantec" or the
"Company") as of September 30, 1998 and for the three and six month periods
ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 are unaudited and, in the opinion of
management, contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items
necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position and results of
operations for the interim periods. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
notes thereto included in Symantec's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended March 31, 1998. The results of operations for the three and six month
periods ended September 30, 1998 are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the entire year. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Certain previously reported amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation format.

During the September 1998 quarter, the Company acquired certain assets of Intel
Corporation ("Intel") (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in this Form 10-Q). During the June 1998 quarter, the Company acquired certain
assets of International Business Machines ("IBM") and Binary Research Limited
("Binary") (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this
Form 10-Q). The results of operations from these have been included in
Symantec's results of operations since the date of acquisition.

In October 1997 and March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
("AcSEC") issued Statements of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue
Recognition," and SOP 98-4, "Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition," respectively, which provide guidance on
applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on
software transactions and were effective for Symantec beginning with the June
30, 1998 quarter. AcSEC issued an exposure draft in July 1998 regarding the
permanent deferral of certain provisions of SOP 97-2. At AcSEC's October 27,
1998 meeting, the exposure draft was not approved. AcSEC approved, instead, a
revised version of the SOP, which must still be cleared by the FASB. The Company
will continue to address the revised SOP and any further developments and their
impact on the Company's net revenues and results of operations.

Symantec has a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as
of and for the periods ended September 30, 1998, March 31, 1998 and September
30, 1997 reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended October 2, 1998, April
3, 1998 and October 3, 1997, respectively. The six months ended September 30,
1998 comprised 26 weeks of revenue and expense activity, while the comparable
prior year period comprised 27 weeks.

During the quarter ended September 30, 1998, the Company made a decision to
restructure its operations and outsource its domestic manufacturing operations.
As a result, it recorded a $3.8 million charge for personnel severance to reduce
the workforce by approximately 5% in both domestic and international operations
and a $1.3 million charge for the planned abandonment of a manufacturing
facility lease. As of September 30, 1998, $1.2 million of the $5.1 million has
been incurred. These activities will be substantially complete by the end of
fiscal 1999.

As of September 30, 1998, total accrued acquisition, restructuring and other
expenses were approximately $6.2 million and include approximately $1.8 million
for the elimination of duplicative and excess facilities, $2.5 million for
personnel severance and $1.9 million for other expenses.

NOTE 5.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income,"
beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes new
rules for the reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income and its
components; however, it has no impact on net income (loss) or stockholders'
equity. The components of comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, are as

NOTE 6.  LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

On March 18, 1996, a class action complaint was filed by the law firm of
Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach in Superior Court of the State of
California, County of Santa Clara, against the Company and several of its
current and former officers and directors. The complaint alleges that Symantec
insiders inflated the stock price and then sold stock based on inside
information that sales were not going to meet analysts' expectations. The
complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The complaint has been refiled
twice in state court, most recently on January 13, 1997, following Symantec's
demurrers directed to previous complaints. The parties are currently conducting
discovery. On January 7, 1997, the same plaintiffs filed a complaint in the
United States District Court, Northern District of California, based on the same
facts as the state court complaint, for violation of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The district court dismissed that complaint, and plaintiffs served an
amended complaint in April 1998. Symantec's motion to dismiss the new federal
complaint is currently pending. Symantec believes that neither the state court
complaint nor the federal court complaint has any merit and will vigorously
defend itself against both complaints.

On April 23, 1997, Symantec filed a lawsuit against McAfee Associates, Inc.,
which pursuant to a merger has become Network Associates, Inc. ("Network
Associates"), in the United States District Court, Northern District of
California, for copyright infringement and unfair competition. On October 6,
1997, the court found that Symantec

had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of certain copyright
claims, and issued a preliminary injunction (i) prohibiting Network Associates
from infringing Symantec's rights in specified materials by marketing, selling,
transferring or directly or indirectly copying into any new Network Associates
product or new version of an existing product that has Symantec code, (ii)
requiring Network Associates to notify distributors who are still selling
versions of PC Medic 97 that have Symantec's code to tell customers that they
should upgrade to versions that do not contain Symantec code, and (iii)
requiring Network Associates to provide Symantec and the court with a sample of
the notice to be used. On October 17, 1997, Symantec amended its complaint to
include additional claims for copyright infringement and misappropriation of
trade secrets, based on additional evidence found in the discovery process. On
April 1, 1998, Symantec amended its complaint to add claims for misappropriation
of trade secrets, RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) and
related claims based on additional evidence uncovered in the litigation.
Following motions by Network Associates, the court dismissed Symantec's unfair
competition and trade secret claims regarding the copyrighted code and its RICO
and interference claims. On October 22, 1998, the court consolidated this case
with the case against Network Associates and the case brought by CyberMedia,
both of which are described below.

On September 4, 1998, Symantec filed a new lawsuit against Network Associates in
the United States District Court, Northern District of California, for copyright
infringement, trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition. Symantec
continues to investigate the extent to which Network Associates may have
misappropriated Symantec's intellectual property, and plans to aggressively
pursue its remedies under this lawsuit, which include both injunctive relief and
monetary damages.

On September 15, 1997, Hilgraeve Corporation ("Hilgraeve") filed a lawsuit in
the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, against
Symantec, alleging that unspecified Symantec products infringe a patent owned by
Hilgraeve. The lawsuit requests damages, injunctive relief and costs and
attorney fees. Symantec believes this claim has no merit and intends to defend
the action vigorously.

On February 4, 1998, CyberMedia, Inc. ("CyberMedia,"), which in September 1998
was acquired by Network Associates, filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, against Symantec, ZebraSoft
Inc., and others, alleging that Symantec Norton Uninstall Deluxe infringes
CyberMedia's copyright, and asserting related state law claims. The suit
requests damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys fees. In May 1998,
CyberMedia filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction prohibiting sale or
development of the challenged code, which preliminary injunction was granted
with respect to Symantec's domestic activities in September 1998. Symantec
believes it has meritorious defenses to this claim and intends to defend the
action vigorously.

On February 19, 1998, a class action complaint was filed by the Milberg, Weiss,
Bershad, Hynes & Lerach law firm in Santa Clara County Superior Court, on behalf
of a class of purchasers of pre-version 4.0 Norton AntiVirus products. A similar
complaint was filed in the same court on March 6, 1998 by an Oregon law firm.
Those actions were consolidated, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed
in late October 1998. The original complaint purports to assert claims for
breach of implied warranty, fraud, unfair business practices and violation of
California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act, among others, arising from the alleged
inability of earlier versions of Norton AntiVirus(R) to function properly after
the year 2000. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief.
Symantec believes that these actions have no merit and intends to defend itself
vigorously.

In connection with the May 1998 asset purchase agreement with IBM (see Note 8 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q), claims of patent
infringement previously asserted by IBM with respect to certain of the Company's
products were resolved. The terms of resolution were not material to Symantec.

In July 1998, the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) ruled that
Symantec should pay $5.8 million plus costs to Triolet Systems, Inc. and Brian
Duncombe in a decade-old copyright action, for damages arising from the grant of
a preliminary injunction against the defendant. The damages were awarded
following the court's ruling that

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED



evidence presented later in the case showed the injunction was not warranted.
Symantec inherited the case through its 1995 acquisition of Delrina Corporation,
which was the plaintiff in this lawsuit. Symantec has appealed the decision.
Symantec recorded a charge of $5.8 million in June 1998 representing the
unaccrued portion of the judgment plus costs.

Over the past few years, it has become common for software companies, including
Symantec, to receive claims of patent infringement. Symantec is currently
evaluating claims of patent infringement asserted by several parties, with
respect to certain of the Company's products. While the Company believes that it
has valid defenses to these claims, the outcome of any related litigation or
negotiation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future results
of operations or cash flows.

Symantec is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. The Company intends to defend all of the
aforementioned pending lawsuits vigorously, and although adverse decisions (or
settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, the final resolution of
these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a
material adverse affect on the financial condition of the Company, although it
is not possible to estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these
cases. Depending, however, on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution
of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's future results of
operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular
period. The Company has accrued certain estimated legal fees and expenses
related to certain of these matters; however, actual amounts may differ
materially from those estimated amounts.

NOTE 7.  STOCK REPURCHASE

On June 9, 1998, the Board of Directors of Symantec authorized the repurchase of
up to 5% of Symantec's outstanding common stock before December 31, 1998. Among
other purposes, the shares will be used for employee stock purchase programs and
option grants. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the June 1998
quarter. The Company repurchased 1.7 million shares at prices ranging from
$17.13 to $27.21, for an aggregate amount of $39.8 million, during the September
1998 quarter. Of the $39.8 million, approximately $18.5 million was charged to
retained earnings after appropriate amounts were deducted from common stock and
capital in excess of par. Subsequent to September 30, 1998 and through October
30, 1998, the Company completed the repurchase and has now repurchased a total
of 2.875 million shares at prices ranging from $13.10 to $27.21, for an
aggregate amount of approximately $56.3 million.

NOTE 8.  PURCHASE OF CERTAIN ASSETS

On May 19, 1998, IBM and Symantec entered into an agreement whereby Symantec
licensed IBM's immune system technology for $16.0 million plus certain potential
future royalties. Symantec also entered into a patent cross-licensing agreement
under which the parties licensed to each other their respective patent
portfolios. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Symantec assumed
liabilities of $3.0 million and incurred additional expenses of approximately
$1.3 million as part of the transaction. As of September 30, 1998, Symantec paid
IBM $8.0 million in cash with the remaining $8.0 million payable in two equal
installments in August 1999 and November 1999. As part of the agreement, IBM
assigned its existing anti-virus customer and OEM contracts to Symantec. Under
the transaction, Symantec recorded approximately $16.0 million for in-process
research and development acquired from IBM, $3.0 million for goodwill and $1.3
million for certain prepaid research and development and other assets. The
amount of in-process research and development acquired from IBM was established
by an independent valuation specialist based on management's estimates. Symantec
also entered into a contract research and development arrangement with IBM to
develop certain products in return for payments totaling $4.0 million, which has
been completed as of September 30, 1998.

On June 24, 1998, Symantec entered into an agreement whereby Symantec purchased
certain assets of Binary, an Auckland, New Zealand based company, for $27.5
million. Symantec also incurred $0.7 million of acquisition related costs. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Under the transaction, Symantec
recorded approximately $13.3 million for in-process research and development
acquired from Binary and $14.2 million for capitalized software technology, with
the remainder of the purchase price allocated to net tangible and intangible
assets. The amount of in-process research and development acquired from Binary
was established by an independent valuation specialist based on management's
estimates. The capitalized software is being amortized over a 3-year period. As
of September 30, 1998, the Company incurred approximately $1.6 million of
amortization expense related to this asset.

The following unaudited pro forma results of operations for the three and six
month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 are as if the acquisition of
Binary had occurred at the beginning of each period presented. The pro forma
information excludes approximately $1.2 million of capitalized software
amortization and the tax effect of the charge for the three months ended
September 30, 1998. The pro forma information excludes the one-time write-off of
$13.3 million of in-process research and development and the tax effect of the
charge and $1.6 million of capitalized software amortization and its tax effect
for the six month period ended September 30, 1998. The pro forma information has
been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not indicative of what
operating results would have been if the acquisition had taken place at the
beginning of each period presented or of future operating results.

On September 28, 1998, Symantec entered into an agreement whereby it purchased
Intel Corporation's anti-virus business for approximately $16.5 million.
Symantec also licensed Intel systems management technology which it will combine
with its own anti-virus technology to create improved anti-virus management
solutions for corporate organizations. As part of the agreement, Intel will
continue to support its anti-virus customers and will transition support to
Symantec by June 1999. In addition, Intel will promote Norton Antivirus through
its worldwide reseller channels. Subsequent to September 30, 1998 and through
October 30, 1998, Symantec has paid approximately $11.9 million under the
agreement. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Under the
transaction, Symantec recorded approximately $5.0 million for in-process
research and development acquired from Intel, $10.7 million for capitalized
software technology and $0.8 million for certain intangible assets. The amount
of in-process research and development acquired from Intel was established by an
independent valuation specialist based on management's estimates. The
capitalized software is being amortized over a 5-year period. As of September
30, 1998, the Company has not yet recorded amortization expense related to
capitalized software.

NOTE 10.  ADOPTION OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

On August 11, 1998, Symantec's Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights
plan designed to ensure orderly consideration of any future unsolicited
acquisition attempt to ensure fair value of the Company for its stockholders.

In connection with the plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred
share purchase right for each share of the company's common stock outstanding on
August 21, 1998 (the "Record Date"). The Board further directed the issuance of
one such right with respect to each share of the Company's common stock that is
issued after the Record Date, except in certain circumstances. The rights will
expire on August 12, 2008.

The rights are initially attached to the Company's common stock and will not
trade separately. If a person or a group (an "Acquiring Person") acquires 20% or
more of the Company's common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender
offer for 20% or more of the Company's common stock, the rights will be
distributed and will thereafter trade separately from the common stock. Each
right will be exercisable for 1/1000th of a share of a newly designated Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $150.00. The
preferred stock has been structured so that the value of 1/1000th of a share of
such preferred stock will approximate the value of one share of common stock.
Upon a person becoming an Acquiring Person, holders of the rights (other than
the Acquiring Person) will have the right to acquire shares of the company's
common stock at a substantially discounted price.

If a person becomes an Acquiring Person and the company is acquired in a merger
or other business combination, or 50% or more of its assets are sold to an
Acquiring Person, the holder of rights (other than the Acquiring Person) will
have the right to receive shares of common stock of the acquiring corporation at
a substantially discounted price. After a person has become an Acquiring Person,
the Company's Board of Directors may, at its option, require the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED


exchange of outstanding rights (other than those held by the Acquiring Person)
for common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of the company's common stock
per right.

The Board may redeem outstanding rights at any time prior to a person becoming
an Acquiring Person at a price of $0.001 per right. Prior to such time, the
terms of the rights may be amended by the Board. In addition, the Board also
amended the Company's bylaws to: permit only the Chairman, President or the
Board to call a special meeting of the stockholders; require that the Board be
given prior notice of a stockholder proposal to take action by written consent
so that a record date for such action can be established; require advance notice
to the Board of stockholder-sponsored proposals for consideration at annual
meetings and for stockholder nominations for the election of directors; permit
the Board to meet on one- rather than two-day advance notice; and conform the
bylaws to applicable provisions of Delaware law regarding the inspection of
elections at stockholder meetings.

NOTE 11.  LEASED BUILDINGS

In fiscal 1997, Symantec entered into lease agreements for two existing office
buildings (Cupertino City Center One or "CCC1" and World Head Quarters or
"WHQ"), one parcel of land and one office building under construction (Cupertino
City Center Five or "CCC5") in Cupertino, California. In connection with these
leases, the Company is required to maintain a restricted cash balance invested
in U.S. treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three years. In
accordance with the lease terms, these funds are not available to meet operating
cash requirements.

On September 22, 1998, an agreement was entered into, subject to certain closing
conditions that have not yet been met, whereby the landlord intends to exchange
CCC5 for another leased building (Cupertino City Center Two or "CCC2") both
located in Cupertino, California. If this transaction is consummated, Symantec
would move both personnel and equipment into CCC2 once certain tenant
improvements are completed. In conjunction, Symantec would be relieved of
responsibility for its lease of WHQ.

As of November 13, 1998, the parties are conducting due diligence which is
scheduled to end on November 20, 1998. During this period, either party may
decide not to go forward with the deal at such party's sole discretion without
penalty.

NOTE 12.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as
derivatives) and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 will be effective for Symantec
at the beginning of the June 2000 quarter for both annual and interim reporting
periods. Symantec is evaluating the potential impact of this accounting
pronouncement on required disclosures and accounting practices.

NOTE 13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On October 15, 1998, Symantec announced it signed a definitive merger agreement
to acquire Quarterdeck Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Symantec
has commenced a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Quarterdeck
common stock at a price of $0.52 per share. The aggregate purchase price to be 
allocated to acquired assets and liabilities is expected to be approximately 
$70 to $75 million which includes common stock and equivalents, acquisition 
related costs and any negative tangible net worth at the time of closing, if 
the tender offer is accepted. The Boards of Directors of both companies have 
approved the transaction.

<PAGE>   16


SYMANTEC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED


Completion of the tender offer is subject to certain conditions, including the
tender of a majority of the Quarterdeck shares, receipt of government approvals
and the expiration of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act. Effective as of November 3, 1998, the Department of Justice has granted
early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
allowing Symantec to proceed with its acquisition of Quarterdeck Corporation.
Quarterdeck's revenue for the twelve months ended June 1998 was approximately
$57.0 million. (See Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 15, 1998, among
Symantec, Purchaser, and Quarterdeck Corporation filed with Symantec's Form SC
14D1 on October 19, 1998).

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS


FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These forward-looking statements
are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those identified
in the section "Factors That May Affect Future Results" and in the Company's
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 1998, that may cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements within this Form 10-Q are typically
identified by words such as "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "intends,"
"may" and other similar expressions, and include the statements of future
estimates under "Year 2000 - Product Liability" and "Year 2000 - Corporate
Systems" below. However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying
such statements. In addition, any statements which refer to expectations,
projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are
forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly
release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements which
may be made to reflect events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the
filing of this Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers
are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the
Company in this report and in the Company's other reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K, that attempt to
advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect the Company's
business.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE. Due to the factors
noted below, the Company's earnings and stock price have been and may continue
to be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis.
Symantec has previously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from
levels expected by securities analysts and investors, which has had an immediate
and significant adverse affect on the trading price of the Company's common
stock. This may occur again in the future.

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT RISKS. The Company participates in a
highly dynamic industry characterized by rapid change and uncertainty related to
new and emerging technologies and markets. The recent trend toward server-based
applications in networks and applications distributed over the Internet could
have a material adverse affect on sales of the Company's products. Future
technology or market changes may cause certain of Symantec's products to become
obsolete more quickly than expected.

The use of a Web browser (running on either a PC or network computer) to access
client/server systems is emerging as an alternative to the traditional desktop
access through operating systems which are resident on personal computers.
Should the functionality associated with such system access reduce the need for
Symantec's products, the Company's future net revenues and operating results may
be adversely affected.

OPERATING SYSTEM. The release and subsequent customer acceptance of current or
enhanced operating systems are particularly important events that increase the
uncertainty and volatility of Symantec's results. Should the Company be unable
to successfully and timely develop products that operate under existing or new
operating systems, or should pending or actual release of the new operating
systems delay the purchase of Symantec's products, the Company's future net
revenues and operating results would be materially adversely affected.

Microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities including telecommunications,
facsimile and data recovery utilities in Windows 95 and has included additional
product features in Windows 98, including enhanced disk repair, defragmentation,
system file maintenance, ISDN support and PPTP virtual private networking, that
may decrease the demand for certain of the Company's products, including those
currently under development. Fax capabilities were dropped from Windows 98.
Microsoft may also include additional features in new versions of Windows 2000
(formerly known as Windows NT 5.0) that could decrease demand for certain of the
Company's products intended for Windows 2000, including those currently under
development.





                                       17

<PAGE>   18

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


Additionally, as hardware vendors incorporate additional server-based network
management and security tools into network operating systems, the demand may
decrease for certain of the Company's products, including those currently under
development. In addition, functionality previously provided only by software may
be incorporated directly into hardware, potentially reducing demand for
Symantec's products. Also, Symantec's competitors may license certain of their
products to Microsoft and OEMs for inclusion with their operating systems,
add-on products or hardware, which may also reduce the demand for certain of the
Company's products.

PERSONAL COMPUTERS, HARDWARE AND MICROSOFT WINDOWS 98. Fluctuations in customer
spending from software to hardware as the result of technological advancements
in hardware or price reductions of hardware have in the past, and may in the
future, result in reduced revenues which have had and would have a material
adverse affect on operating results.

Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system was introduced during the June 1998
quarter. The Company's ability to generate revenue from many of its current
products, and products currently under development, could be less than
anticipated in future periods due to reported incompatibilities by end-users,
and delays in the purchase of Symantec's products as end-users first deploy
Windows 98. The Company believes that weak retail software sales during the June
and September 1998 quarters compared to the March 1998 quarter were due, in
part, to the release of Windows 98 at the end of the June 1998 quarter. This
weakness could continue. In addition, the Company may face declining sales
following Microsoft's introduction of Windows 2000 (formally known as Windows NT
5.0) currently scheduled for 1999.

Symantec's stock price declined significantly within approximately 6 months
after the releases of Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, which in some cases also
caused the additional requirement for hardware upgrades. While there were a
variety of reasons for these declines in the stock price, Symantec's recent
stock price decline may have been due, in part, to the release of Windows 98.
Symantec could face additional stock price declines following the introduction
of Windows 2000 by Microsoft.

CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY. Consolidation in the software industry continues
to occur, with competing companies merging or acquiring other companies, in
order to capture market share or expand product lines. As this consolidation
occurs, the nature of the market may change as a result of fewer players
dominating particular markets, potentially providing consumers with fewer
choices. Also, certain of these companies offer a broader range of products,
ranging from desktop to enterprise solutions, than Symantec, and Symantec may
not be able to compete effectively against certain competitors. Any or all of
these changes may have a significant adverse affect on Symantec's future
revenues and operating results.

DEPENDENCE ON THE INTERNET. Critical issues concerning the commercial use of the
Internet, including security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility,
quality of service, or potential tax or other government regulation, remain
unresolved and may affect the use of the Internet as a medium to support the
functionality of certain of the Company's products, or to distribute software.
Should the Company be unable to incorporate changes in the Internet environment
into its business operations and product development successfully or in a timely
manner, the Company's future net revenues and operating results could be
adversely affected.

PRICE COMPETITION. Price competition is often intense in the microcomputer
software market, especially in regards to utility and anti-virus products, and
may continue to increase and become even more significant in the future,
resulting in reduced profit margins. Should competitive pressures in the
industry continue to increase in regards to utility and anti-virus products,
Symantec may be required to reduce prices and/or increase its spending on sales,
marketing and research and development of these products as a percentage of net
revenues, resulting in lower profit margins. These actions may not be sufficient
to offset the impact of price competition as it has done in the past, on the
Company's business and net revenues, resulting in adverse impacts on revenue,
income and cash flow.

Many of the Company's competitors have significantly reduced the price of
utility and anti-virus products. These practices may have a material adverse
impact on revenue in future periods.




                                       18
<PAGE>   19

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



The Company has raised prices on some of its products in the past and may do so
in the future. These actions, however, may not have a positive impact on the
Company's net revenues, income and cash flow.

INTEGRATED SUITES. Symantec and its competitors are now providing integrated
suites of utility products. With the shift to integrated utility suites, price
competition is likely to be intense, and cannibalization of Symantec's existing
utility and anti-virus products may occur. The price of integrated utility
suites is significantly less than the total price of individual products
included in these utility suites when such products are sold separately. As a
result, there may be a negative impact to Symantec's revenue and operating
income from selling integrated utility suites rather than individual products,
as the lower price of integrated utility suites may not be offset by increases
in the total volume of utility suites sold. Additionally, the Company's products
may not compete effectively with competitors' products or integrated utility
suites introduced in the future.

QUARTERLY BUYING PATTERNS; ABSENCE OF BACKLOG. Most retail customers tend to
make a majority of their purchases at the end of the fiscal quarter, in part
because they are able, or believe that they are able, to negotiate lower prices
and more favorable terms. This is also true of corporate customers that
negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter. This end-of-period buying
pattern means that forecasts of quarterly and annual financial results are
particularly vulnerable to the risk that they will not be achieved, either
because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on
less favorable terms to the Company.

In recent quarters, the Company has noted that a growing proportion of revenues
are generated during the last month of the quarter. The reliance on a large
proportion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and an increase in the
dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of the quarter result in
increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues, and increase the chances
that the Company's results could diverge from the expectations of investors and
analysts.

The Company operates with relatively little backlog; therefore, if near-term
demand for the Company's products weakens in a given quarter, there could be an
immediate, material adverse effect on net revenues and on the Company's
operating results, which would likely result in a significant and precipitous
drop in the Company's stock price.

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL. A large portion of the Company's sales are made
through the retail distribution channel, which is subject to events that create
unpredictable fluctuations in consumer demand. Sales through the distribution
channel declined unexpectedly during the first six months of fiscal 1999 and had
an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations for that period. The
Company's retail distribution customers also carry the products of Symantec's
competitors. These retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in
inventory, and their decisions to purchase the Company's products is partly a
function of pricing, terms and special promotions offered by Symantec, as well
as by its competitors over which the Company has no control and which it cannot
predict.

Agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by
either party without cause. Certain distributors and resellers have experienced
financial difficulties in the past. Distributors that account for significant
sales of the Company may experience financial difficulties in the future, which
could lead to reduced sales or write-offs and could adversely affect operating
results of the Company. When this has occurred in the past, the Company has
successfully moved these inventories to other distributors. The Company may not
be able to do so in the future.

NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. Symantec may not be able to develop an effective
method of distributing its software products utilizing each of the rapidly
evolving software distribution channels, including the Internet. The presence of
new channels could adversely impact existing channels and/or product pricing,
which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future revenues and
profitability. Symantec currently offers a broad range of products and services
over the Internet.

<PAGE>   20

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



SITE LICENSES. Symantec sells volume license programs (corporate site licenses)
through the distribution channel and through corporate resellers. Average site
license revenue per unit is typically lower than the average revenue per unit
from retail versions shipped through the retail distribution channel.

RELIANCE ON JOINT BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS. Symantec has entered into various
development or joint business arrangements for the purpose of: developing new
software products and enhancements to existing software products; gaining
presence in new markets, and Symantec may continue to do so in the future.
Depending on the nature of each such arrangement, the development, distribution,
sale or marketing of the resulting product may be controlled either by Symantec
or its business partner. Products resulting from joint business arrangements may
not be technologically successful, may not achieve market acceptance and may not
be able to compete with products either currently in the market or introduced in
the future.

Symantec distributes certain of its products through value-added resellers
("VARs") and independent software vendors ("ISVs") whereby Symantec's products
are included with hardware products prior to sale through retail channels. These
licensing agreements are generally non-exclusive and do not require the VAR or
ISV to make minimum purchases. If the Company is not successful in maintaining
its current relationships and securing license agreements with additional VARs
and ISVs, or if the Company's VAR and ISV customers are not successful in
selling their products, the Company's future net revenues and operating results
may be adversely affected.

ACQUISITIONS. Symantec has completed a number of acquisitions and may acquire
other companies and technology in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of
special risks, including the diversion of management's attention to integrate
the operations and personnel of the acquired companies in an efficient and
timely manner, the retention of key employees, the burden of presenting a
unified corporate image, the integration of acquired products and of research
and development and sales efforts. In addition, because the employees of
acquired companies have frequently remained in their existing, geographically
diverse locations, the Company has not achieved certain economies of scale that
might otherwise have been realized.

On October 15, 1998, Symantec announced it signed a definitive merger agreement
to acquire Quarterdeck Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Symantec
will commence a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Quarterdeck
common stock at a price of $0.52 per share. The aggregate purchase price to be
allocated to acquired assets and liabilities is expected to be approximately $70
to $75 million which includes common stock and equivalents, acquisition related
costs and any negative tangible net worth at the time of closing, if the tender
offer is accepted. The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the
transaction. Completion of the tender offer is subject to certain conditions,
including the tender of a majority of the Quarterdeck shares, receipt of
government approvals and the expiration of applicable waiting periods under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Effective as of November 3, 1998, the Department of
Justice has granted early termination of the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, allowing Symantec to proceed with its acquisition of
Quarterdeck Corporation. Quarterdeck's revenue for the twelve months ended June
1998 was approximately $57 million.

Symantec typically incurs significant expenses in connection with its
acquisitions, which have a significant adverse impact on the Company's
profitability and financial resources. Future acquisitions may have a
significant adverse impact on the Company's future profitability and financial
resources.

CHANNEL FILL. The Company's pattern of net revenues and earnings may be affected
by "channel fill." Distributors may fill their distribution channels in
anticipation of price increases, sales promotions or incentives. Distributor
inventories may be decreased between the date Symantec announces a new version
or new product and the date of release, because distributors, dealers and end
users often delay purchases, cancel orders or return products in anticipation of
the availability of the new version or new product. The impact of channel fill
is somewhat mitigated by the Company's deferral of revenue associated with
distributor and reseller inventories estimated to be in excess of appropriate
levels; however, net revenues may still be materially affected favorably or
adversely by the effects of channel fill, particularly in periods where a large
number of new products are simultaneously introduced.



                                       20
<PAGE>   21

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



Channels may also become filled simply because the distributors do not sell
their inventories to retail distribution or retailers to end users as
anticipated. If sell-through does not occur at a sufficient rate, distributors
will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases
in order to reduce their inventories.

While such order delays or cancellations can cause fluctuations in net revenues
from one quarter to the next, the impact is substantially mitigated by the
Company's deferral of revenue associated with inventories estimated to be in
excess of appropriate levels in the distribution and retail channels. A material
adverse impact on revenue, however, can occur.

PRODUCT RETURNS. Product returns can occur when the Company introduces upgrades
and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess
inventories. Symantec's return policy allows its distributors, subject to
certain limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products
or for credit towards future purchases. End users may return products through
dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of purchase
for a full refund, and retailers may return older versions of the Company's
products. The Company estimates and maintains reserves for product returns.
However, future returns could exceed the reserves established by the Company,
which could have a material adverse affect on the operating results of the
Company.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS. A significant portion of Symantec's revenues, manufacturing
costs and operating expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. As a result,
the Company's results may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, as well as increases in duty rates, exchange or
price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies. The Company expects
that its non-U.S. dollar denominated sales activities may increase in the
future. Continued fluctuations in the currency markets could materially and
adversely impact Symantec's revenues.

The Company's international operations are subject to certain risks common to
international operations, such as government regulations, import restrictions,
currency fluctuations, economic volatility, repatriation restrictions and, in
certain jurisdictions, reduced protection for the Company's copyrights and
trademarks. Symantec utilizes natural hedging to mitigate Symantec's foreign
currency transaction exposure and hedges certain residual balance sheet
positions through the use of one-month forward contracts. These strategies may
not continue to be effective, and the Company may not be successful in
accurately forecasting transaction gains or losses.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT. Consistent with many companies in the software industry,
technical support costs comprise a significant portion of the Company's
operating costs and expenses. The Company's technical support levels are based,
in a large part, on projections of future sales levels. Over the short term, the
Company may not be able to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for
support services or modify the format of the Company's support services to
compete with changes in support services provided by competitors. While the
Company performs extensive quality control review over its technical support
services provided by corporate personnel and, to a lesser extent, over support
services outsourced to third-party vendors, customer satisfaction with the
services rendered may not be favorable. In the event of customer
dissatisfaction, future product and upgrade sales to that customer base may be
negatively impacted. Fee-based technical support services did not generate
material revenues in any fiscal period presented and are not expected to
generate material revenues in the near future.

UNCERTAINTY OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. Symantec believes significant
research and development expenditures will be necessary in order to remain
competitive. While the Company performs extensive usability and beta testing of
new products, any products currently being developed by Symantec may not be
technologically successful, resulting products may not achieve market
acceptance, and the Company's products may not compete effectively with
competitors' products either currently in the market or introduced in the
future.

LENGTH OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLE. The length of Symantec's product
development cycle has generally been greater than Symantec originally expected.
Although such delays have undoubtedly had a material adverse affect on
Symantec's business, Symantec is not able to quantify the magnitude of net
revenues that were deferred or lost as a result of any particular delay because
Symantec is not able to predict the amount of net revenues that would have

        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



been obtained had the original development expectations been met. Delays in
future product development are likely to occur and could have a material adverse
affect on the amount and timing of future revenues. Due to the inherent
uncertainties of software development projects, Symantec does not generally
disclose or announce the specific expected shipment dates of the Company's
product introductions.

OPERATING LEVERAGE. Consistent with the experience of many companies in the
software industry, Symantec's employee and facility related expenditures
comprise a significant portion of the Company's operating expenses. The
Company's expense levels are based, in a large part, on projections of future
revenue levels. Given the fixed nature of these expenses over the short term, if
revenue levels fall below expectations, Symantec's operating results are likely
to be significantly and adversely affected.

MANAGEMENT OF EXPANDING OPERATIONS. Symantec continually evaluates its product
and corporate strategy and has in the past and will in the future undertake
organizational changes, product and marketing strategy modifications which are
designed to maximize market penetration, maximize use of limited corporate
resources and develop new products and product channels. These organizational
changes increase the risk that objectives will not be met due to the allocation
of valuable limited resources to implement changes. Further, due to the
uncertain nature of any of these undertakings, these efforts may not be
successful, and the Company may not realize any benefit from these efforts.

EMPLOYEE RISK. Competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is
intense. Symantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its
ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and technical
personnel. Symantec believes that it must provide personnel with a competitive
compensation package, which necessitates the continued availability of stock
options which, in turn, requires ongoing stockholder approval.

BUSINESS DISRUPTION. A disruption in communications between the Company's
geographically dispersed order entry and product shipping centers, particularly
at the end of a fiscal quarter, would likely result in an unexpected shortfall
in net revenues and could result in an adverse impact on operating results.
Disruptions in communications and Internet connectivity may also cause delays in
customer access to Symantec's Internet-based services or product sales. A
business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the
interruption in service by communications carriers, and may cause delays in
product development that could adversely impact future net revenues of the
Company.

LITIGATION. Symantec is involved in a number of judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. The Company intends to defend and/or
pursue all of these lawsuits vigorously and, although an unfavorable outcome
could occur in one or more of the cases, the final resolution of these lawsuits,
individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse
affect on the financial position of the Company. However, depending on the
amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible
that the Company's future results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected in a particular period. (See Note 6 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q).

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Symantec regards its software as proprietary and
relies on a combination of copyright, patent and trademark laws, non-disclosure
agreements and license agreements in an attempt to protect its rights. Despite
these precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy
aspects of Symantec's products or to obtain and use information that Symantec
regards as proprietary. All of Symantec's products are protected by copyright,
and Symantec has a number of patents and patent applications pending. However,
existing patent and copyright laws afford limited practical protection. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect Symantec's
proprietary rights in its products to the same extent as do the laws of the
United States. Symantec's products are not copy protected.

        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


As the number of software products in the industry increases and the
functionality of these products further overlap, Symantec believes that software
developers will become increasingly subject to infringement claims. This risk is
potentially greater for companies, such as Symantec, that obtain certain of
their products through publishing agreements or acquisitions, since they have
less direct control over the development of those products.

In addition, an increasing number of patents are being issued that are
potentially applicable to software, and allegations of patent infringement are
becoming increasingly common in the software industry. It is impossible to
ascertain all possible patent infringement claims because new patents are being
issued continually, the subject of patent applications is confidential until a
patent is issued, and it may not be apparent even from a patent that has already
been issued whether it is potentially applicable to a particular software
product. This increases the risk that Symantec's products may be subject to
claims of patent infringement. Although such claims may ultimately prove to be
without merit, they are time consuming and expensive to defend. Symantec has
been involved in disputes claiming patent infringement in the past, is currently
involved in a number of such disputes and litigation, and may be involved in the
future in such disputes and/or litigation. If Symantec is alleged to infringe
one or more patents, it may choose to litigate the claim and/or seek an
appropriate license. If litigation were to commence and a license were not
available on reasonable terms or if another party were found to have a valid
patent claim against Symantec, such a result could have a material adverse
affect on Symantec's business, operating results and financial condition (See
Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q).

SOFTWARE DEFECTS AND PRODUCT LIABILITY. Software products frequently contain
errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or
enhancements are released. In the past, for example, Symantec's anti-virus
software products have incorrectly detected viruses which do not exist. Although
the Company has not experienced any material adverse effects resulting from any
such defects or errors to date, defects and errors could be found in current
versions, future upgrades to current products or newly developed and released
products, despite testing prior to release. Software defects could result in
delays in market acceptance or unexpected reprogramming costs, which could have
a material adverse affect on the Company's operating results. While Symantec has
not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to impede the
performance of the Company's products, such viruses could be created and
deployed against Symantec's products in the future.

Most of the Company's license agreements with its customers contain provisions
designed to limit the exposure to potential product liability claims. It is
possible, however, that the limitation of liability provisions contained in such
license agreements may not be valid as a result of federal, state, local or
foreign laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. A successful
product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on the Company's
business, operating results and financial condition.

EUROCURRENCY CONVERSION. Symantec conducts business and maintains operations in
Europe. Symantec will be affected by the introduction of a single European
currency, the euro. Symantec has a task force in place that is reviewing the
impact of this event on its systems, business and operations and expects to
implement the system and business modifications necessary to be euro-compliant
by January 4, 1999, Symantec's first day of the fiscal period for which
compliance is required. The financial impact on Symantec is not expected to be
material. It is uncertain when the appropriate European entities will change
their functional currency to the euro.

From a tax perspective, the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a
material impact for Symantec. In addition, our current programs related to
hedging transaction risk or using derivatives are not likely to change or be
impacted by the conversion to euro.

It is not possible to fully assess the impact of the single currency on our
European sales or whether changes being made by Symantec will be successful. As
a result, changes in the European market as a result of the introduction of the
euro and/or Symantec's response to the introduction of the euro may have an
adverse impact on revenues and results from operations.

YEAR 2000 - PRODUCT LIABILITY. While the Company believes that most of its
currently developed and actively marketed products are Year 2000 compliant for
significantly all functionality, these software products could contain errors or
defects related to the Year 2000. Versions of the Company's products that are
not the most currently released or that are not currently being developed may
not be Year 2000 compliant. The Company sells some of its older product lines,
which are not being actively developed and updated, and such products are also
not necessarily Year 2000 compliant. Symantec is currently party to a lawsuit
related to the alleged inability of pre-version 4.0 Norton AntiVirus products to
function properly in respect to Year 2000. Symantec believes that this lawsuit
has no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. The final resolution of
this lawsuit is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the results of
operations and financial condition of the Company, although it is not possible
to estimate the possible loss. Depending, however, on the amount and timing of
an unfavorable resolution of this lawsuit, it is possible that the Company's
future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely
affected in a particular period (See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Form 10-Q).

YEAR 2000 - CORPORATE SYSTEMS. The Company has recently completed a major
evaluation of its applications systems and databases and is modifying or
replacing portions of its hardware and associated software to enable its
operational systems and networks to function properly with respect to dates
leading up to January 1, 2000 and thereafter. The Company continues to evaluate
system interfaces with third-party systems, such as those of key suppliers,
distributors and financial institutions, for Year 2000 functionality. The
Company expects the process of evaluating third-party Year 2000 compliance to be
an ongoing process through the Year 2000. The Company is evaluating Year 2000
exposures of its key suppliers, as well as those of company buildings and
related facilities. The costs to complete the Year 2000 project are expected to
be approximately $2 million and will be expensed as incurred.

The year 2000 Project is divided into several phases:
     Assessment, where the vulnerability of the hardware, software, process or
     service element is identified. Remediation Planning, where corrective
     action is determined for each vulnerable element. Remediation and Unit
     Testing, where the corrective action is taken and initial testing is
     performed. Limited System Testing, where related elements are tested
     together, using dates in the vulnerable range.

Project progress is tracked on a sub-project level as noted below. The following
table summarizes the completion status and currently expected completion date
for each phase for each sub-project. The expected completion dates are
forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties of
locating and correcting errors in complex computer systems, and actual dates of
completion may vary significantly.

The Company believes that, with its conversions to new software and
modifications to existing computer hardware and software, the Year 2000 issue
will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems.
However, if remaining modifications and conversions are not made, or are not
completed in a timely manner, the Year 2000 issue could have a material adverse
impact on the operations of the Company.

Additionally, the systems of other companies with which Symantec does business
may not address Year 2000 problems on a timely basis, which could have an
adverse effect on Symantec's systems or business transactions.

As testing of Year 2000 functionality of the Company's systems must occur in a
simulated environment, the Company will not be able to test fully all Year 2000
interfaces and capabilities prior to Year 2000. The Company believes that its
exposure on Year 2000 issues is not material to its business as a whole and has
not deferred any other information systems projects as a result of its focus on
Year 2000 compliance issues. Periodic updates regarding the Year 2000 status are
provided to both the Executive staff and Board of Directors.

If certain key suppliers or distributors should suffer business interruptions
due to Year 2000 problems, the Company could be forced to delay product
shipments. If there should be significant periods of electric power or telephone
service interruptions, some of the Company's facilities might be unable to
operate. The Company maintains Business Recovery Plans for its major locations,
to provide for orderly response to various disaster scenarios. These will be
reviewed and augmented to provide contingency plans for potential Year 2000
related problems, both internal and external. Completion of the analysis and the
associated contingency plans is scheduled for June 1999.

OVERVIEW
Symantec develops utility software for business and personal computing.
Symantec's business strategy is to satisfy customer needs by developing and
marketing products across multiple operating platforms that make customers
productive and keep their computers safe and reliable - anywhere, anytime.

Founded in 1982, the Company has offices in the United States, Canada, Mexico,
Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Africa and South America.

Symantec has a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. The six months ended September
30, 1998 comprised 26 weeks of revenue and expense activity, while the
comparable prior year period comprised 27 weeks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
During the September 1998 quarter, the Company acquired certain assets of Intel
Corporation ("Intel") (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in this Form 10-Q). During the June 1998 quarter, the Company acquired certain
assets of International Business Machines ("IBM") and Binary Research Limited
("Binary") (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this
Form 10-Q). The results of operations from these have been included in
Symantec's results of operations since the date of acquisition.

The following table sets forth each item from the consolidated statements of
operations as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the
total amount of each item for the periods indicated.

        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


NET REVENUES.

Net revenues increased 1% to approximately $140 million in the September 1998
quarter from $139 million in the September 1997 quarter.

Net revenues increased 7% to $293 million in the six month period ended
September 30, 1998 from $274 million in the six month period ended September 30,
1997. The increase in total revenues between the six month comparable periods
was due primarily to increases in OEM and site license revenues from
transactions that closed at the end of the June 1998 quarter (See further
discussion in Item 2: Factors That May Affect Future Results: Quarterly Buying
Patterns).

Revenues from retail sales were somewhat lower in the September and June 1998
quarters compared to the September and June 1997 quarters and also significantly
less than in the March 1998 quarter. Revenues from retail sales were lower in
the June 1998 and September 1998 quarters as compared with the March 1998
quarter primarily due to a general softness in the retail markets in the United
States and due to the economic situations in our international markets with the
exception of Europe. Net revenues were also lower in the September 1998 quarter
than expected due to: a power outage in the Company's Dublin facility on the
last day of the September 1998 quarter, recent economic changes in Latin
America, and a significant OEM contract that did not materialize in the
Company's Internet Tools division (See Item 2: Factors That May Affect Future
Results: Business Disruption; Foreign Operations; and Quarterly Buying
Patterns).

BUSINESS UNITS.

The Security and Assistance business unit is dedicated to assisting in
customers' daily use of computers by increasing productivity and keeping
computers safe and reliable. The Security and Assistance business unit comprised
approximately 52% and 48% of net revenues in the quarters ended September 30,
1998 and 1997, respectively. The Security and Assistance business unit comprised
approximately 49% and 48% of net revenues in the six month periods ended
September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Increased net revenues for the
business unit in the comparable three and six month periods were primarily
related to increased revenues for two new products, Norton Ghost and the new
utility suite, Norton SystemWorks, and increases in sales of Norton Antivirus
for multi-platform workstations and Norton Antivirus for the Macintosh partially
offset by decreases in Norton Utilities for Windows. In addition, revenues from
the Company's Norton Uninstall Deluxe product were less than expected due to the
removal of the product from the market (See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q). The Norton Ghost product was acquired
as part of the purchase of certain assets of Binary in the June 1998 quarter
(See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q).

The Remote Productivity Solutions business unit helps remote professionals
remain productive and work reliably, anywhere, anytime. The Remote Productivity
Solutions business unit comprised approximately 38% and 39% of the Company's net
revenues for the quarters ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and
net revenues in absolute dollars were relatively flat. Revenues increased for
pcANYWHERE for Windows 95 and a new product, pcTelecommute, which was offset by
decreases in revenues for ACT! for Windows, WinFax PRO and WinFax Lite. The
Remote Productivity Solutions business unit comprised approximately 37% and 38%
of net revenues for the six month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The absolute dollar increase for the six month comparable
September periods was primarily due to increased revenues for pcANYWHERE for
Windows 95 partially offset by decreased revenues for WinFax PRO for Windows 95,
WinFax Lite and WinFax PRO.

Internet Tools, Royalties and Other, which includes products providing an easy
to use Java development environment, as well as revenue streams from the sale of
certain of the Company's other software product lines and technologies, and
revenues from products nearing the end of their life cycles, comprised
approximately 10% and 13% of the Company's net revenues in the quarters ended
September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively and 14% for each of the six month
periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997. The business unit's net revenues
decreased in the quarter ended September 30, 1998 over the quarter ended
September 30, 1997 primarily due to reductions in



                                       27

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



revenues from products in Internet Tools and reductions in revenues from
products nearing the end of their life cycles. The business unit's net revenues
increased in the comparable six month September periods due to increased product
sales in Internet Tools, which included $6 million of revenue from a contract
with a single customer, and increased royalties, partially offset by decreased
revenues from products nearing the end of their life cycles.

Included in Internet Tools, Royalties and Other are royalties and other revenue
of approximately $10 million and $13 million recorded in the quarters ended
September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and $26 million and $27 million in
the six month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. These
royalties and other revenues primarily related to the sale of certain software
products, technologies and tangible assets to JetForm Corporation ("JetForm")
and the Hewlett-Packard Company ("Hewlett-Packard") during fiscal 1997.
Royalties from Hewlett-Packard will end in the December 1998 quarter.

Payments from JetForm were higher in the three and six month periods ended
September 30, 1998 over the three and six month periods ended September 30, 1997
primarily due to a past amendment to the JetForm agreement accelerating the
payment schedule . JetForm has the option to tender payment in either cash or in
registered JetForm common stock, within a contractually defined quantity
threshold. Due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate collectibility of these
installments, Symantec is recognizing the revenue as payments are due and
collectibility is assured from JetForm. In addition, JetForm payments were lower
in the three month period ended September 30, 1998 as compared to the three
month period ended June 30, 1998, and payments are expected to decline in future
periods through the June 2000 quarter.

INTERNATIONAL. Net revenues from international sales outside of North America
were $46 million and $41 million and represented 33% and 30% of total net
revenues in the quarters ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The
increase in net revenues was the result of sales growth in Europe, Middle East
and Africa ("EMEA") partially offset by decreases in Latin America due to their
economic slowdown.

Net revenues from international sales outside of North America were $95 million
and $82 million and represented 32% and 30% of net revenues in the six month
periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997. The increase in net revenues was the
result of sales growth in EMEA and Japan.

Foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the three and six month periods ended
September 30, 1998 compared to the three and six month periods ended September
30, 1997 did not materially affect revenue for either period.

GROSS MARGIN.
Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
consists primarily of manufacturing expenses, costs of producing manuals,
packaging costs, royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and
amortization and write-off of capitalized software.

Gross margin increased to 85% of net revenues in the three month period ended
September 1998 from 84% in the three month period ended September 1997. Gross
margin increased to 86% from 84% in the six month periods ended September 30,
1998 and 1997, respectively.

Factors contributing to an increase in gross margin percentage during the
comparable three and six month September periods include a reduction in royalty
expense, partially offset by increases in capitalized software amortization from
acquisitions. In addition, for the six month comparable September periods, there
was a product mix favoring the Company's higher margin site license and OEM
business.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE. During the September 1998 quarter, Symantec capitalized
approximately $11 million of software technology acquired as part of the
Company's acquisition of certain assets of Intel (See Note 8 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q). During the June 1998
quarter, Symantec capitalized approximately $14 million of software technology
acquired as part of the Company's acquisition of certain assets of Binary (See
Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q).

<PAGE>   29

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



Amortization of capitalized software, including amortization and write-off of
both purchased product rights and capitalized software development expenses,
totaled approximately $1 million and less than $1 million in the three month
periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. In addition,
amortization of capitalized software, including amortization and write-off of
both purchased product rights and capitalized software development expenses,
totaled approximately $2 million and less than $1 million for the six month
periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Symantec expects
capitalized software amortization to increase in future periods. Symantec is
expected to record approximately $1 million of capitalized software amortization
per quarter, over the next 11 quarters, related to amounts capitalized as part
of the acquisition of certain assets of Binary. In addition, Symantec is
expected to record less than $1 million of capitalized software amortization per
quarter, over the next 20 quarters, related to amounts capitalized as part of
the acquisition of certain assets of Intel.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.

Research and development expenses were 18% and 17% of net revenues for the three
month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 and 17% and 16% of net revenues
for the six month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997. Research and
development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

Research and development expenses increased 9% to $26 million in the September
1998 quarter from $24 million in the September 1997 quarter primarily due to
growth in legal expenses related to product claims and employee related
expenses. Research and development expenses increased 12% to $51 million in the
six month period ended September 30, 1998 from $45 million in the six month
period ended September 30, 1997 primarily due to growth in employee related
expenses and legal expenses related to product claims.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES.

Sales and marketing expenses were 50% and 44% of net revenues in the three month
periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 and 48% and 45% of net revenues in the
six month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997. The increase in sales and
marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the comparable three and six
month September periods is abnormally high due to actual revenue coming in below
estimates partially due to the general softness in the retail market. The
absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses in both the three and
six month comparable September periods is due to increases in employee related
expenses and advertising and promotion expenditures. The increase in advertising
expenditures for the six month comparable September periods primarily related to
the Company's Security and Assistance business unit.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

General and administrative expenses increased approximately 14% to $10 million
in the three month period ended September 30, 1998 from $9 million in the three
month period ended September 30, 1997. General and administrative expenses
increased 8% to $19 million in the six month period ended September 30, 1998
from $18 million in the six month period ended September 30, 1997. The absolute
dollar increase for both the three and six month comparable September periods
primarily related to expenses incurred as a result of the termination of a
management consulting contract during the September 1998 quarter. General and
administrative expenses were 7% of net revenues during both the comparable three
and six month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997.

ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.

Acquired in-process research and development expenses were approximately $5
million in the three month period ended September 30, 1998 in connection with
the acquisition of certain assets of Intel (See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q). Acquired in-process research and
development expenses were approximately $34 million in the six month period
ended September 30, 1998. In addition to the

<PAGE>   30

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



approximately $5 million recorded in connection with the acquisition of certain
assets of Intel, Symantec recognized acquired in-process research and
development expenses of $16 million and $13 million, respectively, related to
the acquisition of certain assets of IBM and Binary in the June 1998 quarter
(See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q).
There were no acquired in-process research and development expenses recognized
in the three and six month periods ended September 30, 1997.

LITIGATION JUDGMENT.

There were no litigation judgment expenses recorded in the three months ended
September 30, 1998. Litigation judgment expenses totaled approximately $6
million in the six month period ended September 30, 1998. These expenses related
to a judgment by a Canadian court on a decade-old copyright action assumed by
Symantec when it purchased Delrina Corporation (See Note 6 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q). There were no litigation
judgment expenses recorded in the three and six month periods ended September
30, 1997.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES.

Restructuring and other expenses consisted of the following:

</TABLE>


During the quarter ended September 30, 1998, the Company made a decision to
restructure its operations and outsource its domestic manufacturing operations.
As a result, it recorded an approximately $4 million charge for personnel
severance to reduce the workforce by approximately 5% in both domestic and
international operations and an approximately $1 million charge for the planned
abandonment of a manufacturing facility lease. As of September 30, 1998,
approximately $1 million of the $5 million has been incurred. These activities
will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 1999.

As of September 30, 1998, total accrued acquisition, restructuring and other
expenses were approximately $6 million and include approximately $2 million for
the elimination of duplicative and excess facilities, $2 million for personnel
severance and $2 million for other expenses.

INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.

Interest income was approximately $4 million and $3 million in the three months
ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Interest income increased 22%
in the three months ended September 30, 1998 over the three months ended
September 30, 1997 primarily due to a higher average invested cash balance and
gains on the sale of investments.

Interest income was approximately $8 million and $6 million in the six month
periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Interest income
increased 38% in the six month period ended September 30, 1998 over the six
month period ended September 30, 1997 primarily due to a higher average invested
cash balance, gains on the sale of investments and interest income received with
income tax refunds.

<PAGE>   31

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED



Interest expense was approximately $0.3 million for each of the three month
periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, and $0.7 million and $0.6 million for
the six month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Interest
expense principally relates to Symantec's convertible subordinated debentures.

Other income (expense), net was approximately ($0.5) million and $1 million in
the three month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and $2
million and $0.7 million in the six month periods ended September 30, 1998 and
1997, respectively. Other income (expense) decreased in the three month period
ended September 30, 1998 compared to the three month period ended September 30,
1997 due to foreign currency exchange losses from fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Other income (expense) increased in the six month period ended
September 30, 1998 compared to the six month period ended September 30, 1997
primarily due to a foreign exchange gain realized during the June 1998 quarter,
as a result of the paydown of an intercompany loan.

INCOME TAX PROVISION.

The effective tax rate on income before income taxes, excluding charges for
acquired in-process research and development expenses, for the three and six
months ended September 30, 1998 was 32%. This rate is lower than the U.S.
federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate on the
Company's Irish operations. The effective tax rate for the three and six months
ended September 30, 1997 was 23%.

The tax provision for the six months ended September 30, 1998 consists of two
items: a $13 million (or 32% effective tax rate) provision on income before
income taxes of $40 million. The $40 million excludes a $34 million charge for
acquired in-process research and development expenses. In addition, the $13
million tax provision is partially offset by a $5 million tax benefit on the $34
million charge for acquired in-process research and development. A valuation
allowance has been established for the portion of the deferred tax asset
attributable to the acquired in-process research and development charges that is
not expected to be realized within five years.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

Cash, short-term investments and long-term investments decreased $53 million to
$207 million at September 30, 1998 from $260 million at March 31, 1998. This
decrease was largely due to the repurchase of 1.7 million shares of Symantec
common stock for approximately $40 million during the September 1998 quarter. In
addition, portions of the decrease were due to the acquisition of certain assets
of Binary for $27.5 million and an $8 million payment to IBM during the quarter
ended June 30, 1998 related to the acquisition of certain assets (See Note 8 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q).

In addition to cash, short-term investments and long-term investments of $207
million, the Company has $67 million of restricted investments related to
collateral requirements under certain lease agreements entered into during
fiscal 1997. Symantec is obligated under these lease agreements for two existing
office buildings (Cupertino City Center One or "CCC1" and World Head Quarters or
"WHQ"), one parcel of land and one office building (Cupertino City Center Five
or "CCC5") under construction in Cupertino, California to maintain a restricted
cash balance invested in U.S. treasury securities with maturities not to exceed
three years. In accordance with the lease terms, these funds are not available
to meet operating cash requirements.

On September 22, 1998, an agreement was entered into, subject to certain closing
conditions that have not yet been met, whereby the landlord intends to exchange
CCC5 for another leased building (Cupertino City Center Two or "CCC2") both
located in Cupertino, California. If this transaction is consummated, Symantec
would move both personnel and equipment into CCC2 once certain tenant
improvements are completed. In conjunction, Symantec would be relieved of
responsibility for its lease of WHQ. As of November 13, 1998, the parties are
conducting due diligence which is scheduled to end on November 20, 1998. During
this period, either party may decide not to go forward with the deal at such
party's sole discretion without penalty.

On October 15, 1998, Symantec announced it signed a definitive merger agreement
to acquire Quarterdeck Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Symantec
will commence a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Quarterdeck
common stock at a price of $0.52 per share. The aggregate purchase price to be
allocated to acquired assets and liabilities is expected to be approximately $70
to $75 million which includes common stock and equivalents, acquisition related
costs and any negative tangible net worth at the time of closing, if the tender
offer is accepted. The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the
transaction. Completion of the tender offer is subject to certain conditions,
including the tender of a majority of the Quarterdeck shares, receipt of
government approvals and the expiration of applicable waiting periods under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Effective as of November 3, 1998, the Department of
Justice has granted early termination of the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, allowing Symantec to proceed with its acquisition of
Quarterdeck Corporation. Quarterdeck's revenue for the twelve months ended June
1998 was approximately $57 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $43 million for the
six months ended September 30, 1998 and was comprised of the Company's net loss
of approximately $3 million, offset by non-cash related expenses of
approximately $45 million and a net decrease in assets and liabilities,
excluding effects of acquisitions, of approximately $1 million.

Net trade accounts receivable increased $2 million to $67 million at September
30, 1998 from $65 million at March 31, 1998. Days sales outstanding was 43 days
at September 30, 1998 and 38 days at March 31, 1998. The increase in days sales
outstanding is due to a greater amount of revenue booked in the month of
September 1998 versus the month of March 1998.

On June 9, 1998, the Board of Directors of Symantec authorized the repurchase of
up to 5% of Symantec's outstanding common stock before December 31, 1998. Among
other purposes, the shares will be used for employee stock purchase programs and
option grants. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the June 1998
quarter. The Company repurchased 1.7 million shares at prices ranging from
$17.13 to $27.21 for an aggregate amount of approximately $40 million during the
September 1998 quarter. Of the $40 million, approximately $18 million was
charged to retained earnings after appropriate amounts were deducted from common
stock and capital in excess of par. Subsequent to September 30, 1998 and through
October 30, 1998, the Company completed the repurchase and has now repurchased a
total of 2.875 million shares at prices ranging from $13.10 to $27.21, for an
aggregate amount of approximately $56 million.

The Company recently renewed its $10 million line of credit which expires in May
2000. The Company was in compliance with the debt covenants for this line of
credit as of September 30, 1998. At September 30, 1998, there were no borrowings
and less than $1 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this
line. Future acquisitions by the Company may cause the Company to be in
violation of the line of credit covenants. However, the Company believes that if
the line of credit were canceled or amounts were not available under the line,
there would not be a material adverse impact on the financial results, liquidity
or capital resources of the Company.

If Symantec were to sustain significant losses, the Company could be required to
reduce operating expenses, which could result in product delays; reassess
acquisition opportunities, which could negatively impact the Company's growth
objectives; and/or pursue further financing options. The Company believes
existing cash and short-term investments and cash generated from operating
results will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year.

                                  CONTINGENCIES

5.1. EFFECT OF CONDITIONS GENERALLY. The Closings and the parties' obligations
with respect to each Property shall be contingent upon the satisfaction (or
deemed satisfaction as specifically set forth in each Section herein) or waiver
by TST or Symantec of all of the conditions that are expressly stated to be in
favor of each as set forth in this Article and the Conditions to Closing as set
forth in Schedule "3" hereof, within the time limits specified in each Section
of this Article and such Schedule.

   5.1.1. FAILURE OF CONDITIONS. In the event that any such condition is neither
   satisfied within the time limits specified in each such Section nor waived in
   writing by the Party specifically stated to be benefited by such Section,
   such condition shall be deemed to have failed and the Party specifically
   stated to be benefited by such failed condition, may elect to terminate this
   Agreement by notice to the other Party and to Escrow Holder given before such
   failed condition has been satisfied. In the event of any termination pursuant
   to this Article, TST and Symantec shall be released from their respective
   obligations to exchange, purchase or sell under this Agreement and shall have
   no further rights or remedies regarding exchange, purchase or sale against
   the other as a result of such termination, except for (a) the return to TST
   of TST's Deposit (if applicable) with interest actually earned thereon
   pursuant to Section 4.2.3.1 and the payment of 50% of any escrow cancellation
   fees, and (b) the return to Symantec of Symantec's Deposit (if applicable)

   Holder to evidence such termination.

   5.1.2. CONDITIONS ARE NOT COVENANTS. Conditions specified in this ARTICLE 5
   or in Schedule "3" as being for the benefit of TST or Symantec are NOT also
   to be considered as "covenants" of TST or Symantec unless such conditions are
   also listed 

                                       16
<PAGE>   17

   as either "TST's Covenants" or "Symantec's Covenants" in ARTICLE 5 or in 
   Schedule "3."

5.2. CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO BOTH PARTIES. The following conditions shall be
for the benefit of each Party:

   5.2.1. FEASIBILITY STUDIES. This Agreement is contingent on each Party's
   approval of any and all investigations, studies or analyses for the Property
   deemed appropriate by a Party to aid such Party in determining whether to
   consummate the transaction ("Feasibility Studies"). Either Party may elect in
   such Party's sole and unreviewable discretion, at any time prior to the end
   of the Feasibility Period to terminate this Agreement.

   Upon such election to terminate, the Deposit together with interest earned
   thereon shall be returned to the Party making such Deposit.

   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall have the
   right to have prepared and to evaluate, both at the requesting Party's sole
   expense, during the Feasibility Period, including, but not limited to, the
   following:

      5.2.1.1. LEASES.  The Leases, if any, for each Property;

      5.2.1.2. SITE APPRAISAL.  An appraisal of the Property;

      5.2.1.3. SURVEY. An ALTA survey, and Symantec agrees that as soon as
      reasonably possible following the Agreement Date, Symantec shall obtain at
      Symantec's sole cost and expense, and deliver to TST an ALTA "As Built"
      survey showing the location on the CCC5 Property of Building CCC5;

      5.2.1.4. SITE IMPROVEMENTS. An inspection of any existing site
      improvements (including, without limitation, location and availability of
      utilities and a consultant's analysis of the buildings and other
      improvements on the Property);

      5.2.1.5. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOIL, AND GROUND WATER CONDITIONS. Environmental,
      soil and groundwater conditions concerning, without limitation, (i) the
      stability and load bearing capacity of the soil, and (ii) the presence of
      Hazardous Material on or under the Property or the potential for migration
      of Hazardous Material onto or under the Property from other property;
      provided, however, each Party agrees not to perform any drilling without
      giving the other Party notice at least two (2) business days in advance;

      5.2.1.6. ENTITLEMENTS AND APPROVALS. An analysis of governmental approvals
      and entitlements for the Projects;

      5.2.1.7. SERVICE CONTRACTS.  The Service Contracts, if any, for each 
      Property; and

      5.2.1.8. WITH RESPECT TO CCC2. Without limiting the generality of Section
      5.2.1, TST specifically acknowledges that, in addition to the general
      rights available to 


                                       17
<PAGE>   18

      both Symantec and TST to terminate this Agreement for any reason prior to 
      the end of the Feasibility Period, Symantec may decline to give its 
      Election to Proceed as to CCC2 unless both of the following have occurred 
      within the Feasibility Period:

         5.2.1.8.1 FINANCING. TST is aware that CCC5 and WHQ are owned by
         Sumitomo Bank Leasing and Finance, Inc. and leased to Symantec in an
         "off balance sheet" financing transaction known as a "Synthetic Lease."
         Symantec intends to utilize a Synthetic Lease financing structure to
         acquire CCC2 in exchange for CCC5, and commitments satisfactory to
         Symantec from sources acceptable to Symantec to provide such a
         structure as of the First Closing shall have been obtained by Symantec
         prior to the end of the Feasibility Period.

         5.2.1.8.2 APPLE LEASE TERMINATION. CCC2 is currently occupied by Apple
         Computer as "Tenant" pursuant to a lease (the "Apple Lease") that has
         an expiration date of October 31, 2000 and a right of renewal for an
         additional two (2) years. Symantec intends during the Feasibility
         Period to seek a commitment from Apple Computer pursuant to which
         commitment Apple Computer agrees to terminate the Apple Lease and
         vacate CCC2 not later than a date satisfactory to Symantec, and such a
         commitment in form and content satisfactory to Symantec should have
         been obtained prior to the end of the Feasibility Period. Symantec
         covenants and agrees that it shall not have any meetings or discussions
         with representatives of Apple Computer (nor shall Symantec send Apple
         Computer any written proposals) without first notifying TST and
         affording TST the right to be present at such meetings or discussions
         or to first review and approve (in its sole and absolute discretion)
         any such written proposals. No agreement between Symantec and Apple
         Computer shall bind TST or Travelers or otherwise affect Building CCC2,
         and any such agreement shall be expressly conditioned upon Symantec
         having acquired CCC2 at the First Closing.

         In the event a termination agreement is reached with Apple that is
         conditioned upon a termination payment being made to Apple, Symantec
         and TST agree to contribute at the First Closing up to Two Hundred
         Thousand Dollars ($200,000) each toward such termination payment.

   5.2.2.  CONDITION OF TITLE.

      5.2.2.1. TITLE REVIEW; RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH PARTY. The Parties agree
      that all matters regarding title with respect to all Properties shall be
      resolved during the Feasibility Period. Each Party shall be responsible
      for evaluating the condition of title for the Property(ies) to be acquired
      by such Party. The Election to Proceed required to be given pursuant to
      Section 5.2.3 with respect to each Property requires that the Party giving
      the Election to Proceed identify a Title Pro Forma that such Party will
      accept as a condition to the Closing for such Property. During the
      Feasibility Period, each Party shall be responsible for obtaining from the
      Title Insurer such title information as each Party shall deem appropriate
      and to obtain the binding commitment of the Title Insurer as to the form
      of Title Policy including endorsements that the Title Insurer will deliver
      at Closing which commitment shall 


                                       18
<PAGE>   19

         only be subject to the effect of encumbrances to title occurring
         subsequent to the date of such Title Pro Forma.

      5.2.2.2. PROCEDURES FOR TITLE OBJECTIONS.

         5.2.2.2.1 DURING FEASIBILITY PERIOD. During the Feasibility Period, if
         either Party objects to an exception to title with respect to a
         Property controlled by the other Party, such objecting Party may
         identify such title objection and make written request that the other
         Party cure such title objection. Such other Party may, but shall not be
         obligated to respond to such request, provided, however, that the
         Transferor must agree to remove any voluntary monetary liens or
         encumbrances created or suffered by Transferor. If such title
         objections are not cured prior to the end of the Feasibility Period,
         but such other Party has agreed in writing given prior to the end of
         the Feasibility Period to use its best efforts to cure such title
         objection prior to the Closing, then the Election to Proceed may be
         conditioned upon the issuance by the Title Insurer of a Title Policy in
         the form of the Title Policy Pro Forma subject only to the cure of such
         title objection as a condition to Closing. If a Party requests that the
         other Party agree to cure a title objection and such other Party either
         does not respond to such request prior to the end of the Feasibility
         Period or declines to cure such title objection, then such Party making
         such request may either terminate this Agreement with respect to the
         Property which is the subject of such request or give its Election to
         Proceed with respect to such Property, in which latter event such
         requesting Party shall have agreed to accept such Property at the
         Closing without a cure of such title objection and in accordance with
         the Title Policy Pro Forma identified in its Election to Proceed.

         5.2.2.2.2 SUBSEQUENT ENCUMBRANCES. If a Title Pro Forma is amended (an
         "Amendment") to reflect the existence of any exceptions to title
         arising subsequent to the Feasibility Period with respect to a
         particular Property, the Transferee Party shall have three (3) business
         days from the date of Transferee Party's receipt of such Amendment in
         which to approve, in writing, any such easements, encumbrances, or
         other exceptions or requirements shown thereon which were not disclosed
         by the applicable Title Pro Forma or a previous Amendment (the
         "Additional Encumbrances"). If such Transferee does not approve such
         Amendment within such three (3) business day period, such Additional
         Encumbrances shall be deemed disapproved. If such Transferee Party
         approves the Additional Encumbrances within such time period, then the
         Additional Encumbrances shall be deemed Permitted Exceptions and the
         Title Pro Forma identified on Exhibit L for the Property affected shall
         be deemed amended to incorporate the Amendment. If the Additional
         Encumbrances are not approved, then, except with respect to monetary
         liens or encumbrances voluntarily created by the Transferor Party, such
         Transferor Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in
         accordance with the provisions of the Section hereof entitled "Non
         Default Termination" unless Transferor Party has elected (i) in the
         next succeeding sentence. Transferor Party, within three (3) business
         days after Transferee Party's written or deemed disapproval, shall, in


                                       19
<PAGE>   20

         Transferor Party's sole discretion: (i) notify Transferee Party in
         writing that Transferor Party will eliminate the Additional
         Encumbrances before the Closing; or (ii) notify Transferee Party that
         unless Transferee Party waives its disapproval of the Additional
         Encumbrances within three (3) business days after receipt of Transferor
         Party's notice, Transferor Party shall cancel this Agreement; provided,
         however, that the Transferor must agree to remove any monetary liens or
         encumbrances voluntarily created or suffered by Transferor. If
         Transferor Party elects (i) above, Transferor Party shall eliminate the
         Additional Encumbrances prior to the Closing. If Transferor Party
         elects (ii) above, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon
         the expiration of the 3-day period referenced therein unless Transferee
         Party notifies Transferor Party that it waives Transferee Party's
         disapproval of the Additional Encumbrances, in which case the
         Additional Encumbrances shall be deemed Permitted Exceptions and the
         Title Pro Forma identified on Exhibit L for the Property affected shall
         be deemed amended to incorporate the Amendment.

         5.2.2.2.3     COST OF TITLE INSURANCE.

         Each Transferee Party shall bear all costs of the title insurance
         required as a condition of the First Closing. With respect to the
         Second Closing as to WHQ, Symantec shall be responsible for the costs
         of a CLTA owner's policy and TST shall be responsible for any costs of
         title insurance in excess thereof; provided, however, if any Title Pro
         Forma includes a mechanics lien endorsement, the Transferor Party with
         respect to the Closing in which such a Title Pro Forma is required
         shall be responsible for providing such indemnities as may be required
         by the Title Insurer as a condition to providing such endorsement.

   5.2.3. ELECTION TO PROCEED. By giving an Election to Proceed with respect to
   a Property or Properties, the Party giving such Election to Proceed shall be
   deemed to have agreed at the Closing with respect to the Property covered by
   such Election to Proceed as follows: (i) to accept such Property in its then
   "As Is" condition except for such representations are warranties given by the
   Transferor Party and are intended to survive the Closing and (ii) to accept
   title to such Property in the condition specified in the Title Pro Forma
   specified in such Election to Proceed. The Title Pro Forma specified in the
   Election to Proceed shall be incorporated into the Condition of Title at
   Closing on Exhibit L with respect to the applicable Property.

5.3. CONDITIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SYMANTEC. In addition to any other conditions
to Symantec's obligations contained in this Agreement, the following shall
constitute conditions to Symantec's obligation (i) to transfer CCC5 to TST in

      with legal counsel, is fully aware of its consequences, and that Symantec
      and TST are hereby granting the releases set forth in Section 2.02 of
      Schedule 2.

      6.2.5.3. WAIVER OF SECTION 1542. WITH RESPECT TO THE MATTERS SET FORTH IN
      THIS SECTION 6.2.5 AND SECTION 2.02 OF SCHEDULE "2," EACH OF SYMANTEC AND
      TST WAIVE THE PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH IS
      SET FORTH BELOW:

               "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
               does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
               executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
               affected his settlement with the debtor."

      6.2.5.4. INDEFINITE SURVIVAL. This Section 6.2.5 shall survive the Closing
      indefinitely.

      6.2.5.5. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. SYMANTEC AND TST'S INITIALS BENEATH THIS SECTION
      CONSTITUTE SYMANTEC AND TST'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT EACH OF SYMANTEC AND TST
      HAVE READ AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS SECTION 6.2.5 AND
      SECTION 2.02 OF SCHEDULE "2" AND THAT EACH OF SYMANTEC AND TST HAVE HAD
      THE CHANCE TO CONSULT ITS COUNSEL ABOUT ITS MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE AND

Even though the First Closing will occur some time after the occurrence of
Substantial Completion of Building CCC5, TST acknowledges that in most cases the
time period for any warranties given by the Building CCC5 Contractor or any of
the subcontractors or contractors will commence to run upon the date of
Substantial Completion set forth in the Certificate of Substantial Completion.

6.4. SURVIVABILITY. Except where a longer or shorter period is specified
elsewhere in this Agreement, each Party's representations, warranties and
indemnities (if any) shall survive the Closing and the delivery of the Grant
Deed, but shall terminate on the date which is one (1) year after each Closing
except as to claims and matters as to which either Party has given specific
notice to the other within such one (1) year period. Any claim against a Party
with respect to any breach of such Party's representations, warranties and
indemnities (if any) as to which notice has been given to a Party within such
one (1) year period and which has not been satisfied shall be deemed discharged


                                       27

unless the party making such claim shall have pursued such claim pursuant within
six (6) months following the end of such one (1) year period.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                                    COVENANTS

7.1. INSPECTION RIGHTS. Subject to the rights of Apple Computer pursuant to the
terms and provisions of the Apple Lease, each Party and its agents and
contractors shall have the right to enter on the Property ("Access") to inspect
it and conduct tests and each Party hereby agrees to indemnify the other Party
and the fee owners of the Property from any liability, loss, cost or damage
resulting from physical damage caused by a Party or its agents during such entry
or inspection; provided, however, each Party agrees not to perform any drilling
without giving the other Party reasonable notice of not less than one (1) full
business day. Either Party may contact any federal, state or local governmental
authority or agency to investigate any matters relating to the Property. With
respect to the rights of Apple Computer pursuant to the Apple Lease, TST agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Apple Computer to permit
inspections by Symantec and its agents as contemplated above.

7.2. DISCOVERIES. Each Party acknowledges that it may discover Hazardous
Materials on, under or about the Property or some other fact or condition
pertaining to the Property which a Party believes may negatively impact the
value or development potential of the Property in some manner (the "Discovery").
If either Party makes any such Discovery prior to Closing but nevertheless
completes the acquisition of a particular Property, the Party acquiring such
Property further covenants and agrees to refrain from bringing any claim for
damages, causes of action, or lawsuit against other Party or the other Party's
Related Parties, or their successors, heirs, contractors, engineers and/or
attorneys which in any way alleges that the other Party failed to disclose the
existence of such Hazardous Materials or other fact or condition which was
discovered prior to Closing by the Party completing such acquisition. The
foregoing shall not limit a Party's right to seek legal or equitable remedies
against the other Party for such other Party's breach of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement unless the Party completing
such acquisition had actual knowledge of the material facts relating to such
breach prior to Closing.

   7.2.1. TERMINATION UPON CERTAIN DISCOVERIES. Each Party acknowledges that
   during the Feasibility Period, it will have sufficient time to make such
   investigations with respect to the Property as it deems appropriate. Once a
   Party gives such Party's Election to Proceed pursuant to Section 5.3.1.1 with
   respect to a particular Property, any failure by such Party to close on
   account of a later Discovery shall constitute a default by such Party and the
   provisions of Section 8.5 shall apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
   either Party fails to close following its Election to Proceed on account of a
   Discovery of a "Material Hazardous Material Problem" which was not disclosed
   (and could not reasonably have been discovered upon the performance of
   customary environmental due diligence during the Feasibility Period), such
   failure to close shall constitute a non-default termination pursuant to
   Section 8.8. As used herein, "Material Hazardous Material Problem" shall
   exist only if a Party gives written notice to the 

                                       28
<PAGE>   29

   other Party signed by an officer of the Party giving the notice at the
   level of Vice President or Senior Managing Director or above which
   notice states that subsequent to the end of the Feasibility Period, (i)
   such Party has Discovered that there exists with respect to the Property
   a Hazardous Material issue that such Party believes will materially
   impact such Party's business operations if such Party completes the
   acquisition of the Property pursuant to this Agreement and (ii)
   describes such Hazardous Material issue with particularity.

7.3. OPERATION OF THE PROJECTS. The Parties hereby covenant and agree that from
the Agreement Date until either the Closing with respect to a particular
Property occurs or this Agreement is terminated, that the Properties will be
maintained and operated as set forth below:

   7.3.1. CCC5. Symantec shall continue to manage the construction of the
   Building CCC5 as Sumitomo Bank Leasing and Finance, Inc.'s construction agent
   and build-to-suit lessee under the Building CCC5 General Contract in
   accordance with Symantec's current practices with a view toward achieving
   Substantial Completion of Building CCC5 in accordance with the Building CCC5
   Plans as soon as practicable. So long as this Agreement has not been
   terminated with respect to CCC5, Symantec agrees that without the prior
   written consent of TST: (i) it shall not cause any leases to be executed with
   respect to any portion of Building CCC5 and (ii) it shall not construct or
   install any improvements, in the nature of "tenant improvements" or
   otherwise, or install any furniture or fixtures, except as shown on the
   Building CCC5 Plans. Without TST's prior approval (which approval shall not
   be unreasonably withheld or delayed) Symantec shall not make any changes to
   the Building CCC5 Plans or amend or modify the Building CCC5 Architectural
   Contract or the Building CCC5 General Contract if any single such change will
   result in an increase or decrease in the cost of construction of Building
   CCC5 by $100,000 or if all such changes cumulatively will exceed $250,000.

   7.3.2. CCC2. TST shall continue to manage CCC2 in accordance with TST's
   current practices as Traveler's managing agent as an office building occupied
   entirely by Apple Computer. So long as this Agreement has not been
   terminated, TST agrees (but subject to the rights of Travelers as the fee
   owner of the Property as to which TST shall have no liability of
   responsibility) that without the prior written consent of Symantec: (i) it
   shall not amend, extend or modify in any material way the Apple Lease, (ii)
   it shall not enter into any new leases with respect to any portion of CCC2,
   (iii) except as necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Apple Lease or
   as reasonably prudent in the judgment of TST as the property manager for a
   first class office building, it shall not construct any improvements or
   modify the building in any way.

   7.3.3. WHQ. Symantec shall continue to manage WHQ as an office building
   housing its business operations in accordance with Symantec's current
   practices and agrees to manage to completion, at its sole cost and expense,
   the WHQ Exterior Lighting Contract provided that without TST's written
   consent, Symantec shall not enter into any leases or occupancy agreements for
   any space within WHQ.

                                       29
<PAGE>   30


   7.3.4. ALL PROPERTIES; SERVICE CONTRACTS. Without limiting the generality of
   the foregoing, each Party agrees that from and after the date of this
   Agreement that with respect to the Properties controlled by each Party (but
   subject to the rights of Travelers as the fee owner of the CCC2 as to which
   TST shall have no liability or responsibility), each Party will not enter
   into new service or other contracts or amendments to existing service or
   other contracts unless such new or amended service or other contracts contain
   clauses permitting cancellation of such contracts on not more than thirty
   (30) days notice without a termination fee.

      7.3.4.1. DURING FEASIBILITY PERIOD; EXISTING SERVICE CONTRACTS. During the
      Feasibility Period, if either Party objects to an existing service
      contract with respect to a Property controlled by the other Party, such
      objecting Party may identify such service contract and make written
      request that the other Party terminate such service contract as of the
      Closing applicable to such Property. Such other Party may, but shall not
      be obligated to respond to such request. If such service contracts are not
      terminated prior to the end of the Feasibility Period, but such other
      Party has agreed in writing given prior to the end of the Feasibility
      Period to use its best efforts to terminate such service contracts prior
      to the Closing, then the Election to Proceed may be conditioned upon the
      termination of such service contracts as a condition to Closing. If a
      Party requests that the other Party agree to terminate a service contract
      and such other Party either does not respond to such request prior to the
      end of the Feasibility Period or declines to terminate such service
      contracts, then such Party making such request may either terminate this
      Agreement with respect to the Property which is the subject of such
      request or give its Election to Proceed with respect to such Property, in
      which latter event such requesting Party shall have agreed to accept such
      Property at the Closing without a termination of such service contracts.

7.4.    OTHER COVENANTS. Each Party hereby further covenants and agrees as 
        follows:

   7.4.1. COVENANTS OF BOTH PARTIES. Both Parties covenant and agree as follows:

      7.4.1.1. PROPERTY INSPECTION AND DOCUMENTS. To reasonably cooperate with
      the other Party in the inspection of the Property and the Property
      Documents. Within ten (10) days after the Agreement Date, each Party shall
      deliver to the other Party all Property Documents that, to the best of the
      delivering Party's actual knowledge, are in the delivering Party's
      possession or are under the delivering Party's control, including all
      third-party inspection reports.

   7.4.2. SYMANTEC'S COVENANTS. Symantec hereby further covenants and agrees to
   execute and deliver at the First Closing and the Second Closing, as
   applicable, the documents described as conditions in Sections 5.4.2.3,
   5.4.2.4, 5.4.2.6, 5.4.3.1, and 5.4.3.2.

   5.3.2.2.4, and 5.3.2.2.6.

8.9. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each Party shall have the right to specific
performance of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 9

9.2. INCORPORATION OF EXHIBITS. All schedules and exhibits attached hereto and

9.3. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AND RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER. If, and only if, TST or

completes the Second Closing and acquires WHQ, then with respect to each of CCC2
and CCC1, TST shall have the following special rights:

        9.3.1. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. TST shall have a "Right of First Refusal"
        to acquire CCC2 and CCC1 for a period ending at the end of 3 (three)
        years following the First Closing as to CCC2.

        9.3.2. RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER. TST shall have a "Right of First Offer" for
        a period ending at the end of 5 (five) years following the time when the
        Right of First Refusal granted pursuant to Section 9.3.1 has ended.

        9.3.3. PROCEDURES FOR RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AND RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER.
        TRIGGERING EVENT. For purposes of this Section 9.3.3, a "Triggering
        Event" shall mean: (i) in the case of the Right of First Refusal, the
        receipt by Symantec of a bona fide written offer (a "Purchase Offer") to
        purchase either or both CCC1 or CCC2 (each an "Affected Property" and
        collectively, the "Affected Properties") and (ii) in the case of the
        Right of First Offer, thirty (30) days before Symantec 

                                       35
<PAGE>   36

        gives written notice to parties other than TST of Symantec's intent to
        sell (an "Intent to Sell") either or both Affected Properties.

        9.3.3.2. TRIGGERING EVENT OFFER NOTICE. Within ten (10) days following
        the occurrence of a Triggering Event, Symantec shall give notice to TST
        (the "Triggering Event Offer Notice") listing the principal terms (the
        "Triggering Event Terms") of the Intent to Sell or including a copy of
        the Purchase Offer, as the case may be.

        9.3.3.3. TRIGGERING EVENT PURCHASE NOTICE. TST shall have ten (10)
        business days following the Triggering Event Offer Notice within which
        to notify Symantec that TST desires to purchase the Affected Property
        upon the Triggering Event Terms (the "Triggering Event Purchase
        Notice").

        9.3.3.4. NO TST PURCHASE. If TST either notifies Symantec that TST
        declines to purchase the Affected Property upon the Triggering Event
        Terms or fails to give Symantec a Triggering Event Purchase Notice,
        Symantec shall be free to enter into and complete a sale of the Affected
        Property upon the Triggering Event Terms without any further notice to
        TST. In such event, TST shall have no further Right of First Refusal or
        Right of First Offer with respect to the Affected Property (but such
        rights shall continue with respect to the other Property) so long as:

         (a)   within six (6) months following the Triggering Event Offer
               Notice, Symantec enters into a binding agreement with a third
               party for the purchase and sale of the Affected Property
               substantially in accordance with the Triggering Event Terms and
               otherwise upon "net economic terms"(as hereinafter defined) of
               not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the net economic terms
               offered to TST in the Triggering Event Offer Notice (the "Third
               Party Agreement), and

         (b)   thereafter such sale closes pursuant to the terms of the Third
               Party Agreement;

         (c)   provided, however, if the purchase and sale of the Affected
               Property does not close pursuant to the terms of the Third Party
               Agreement within a reasonable time following the date for closing
               set forth in the Third Party Agreement and/or if the Third Party
               Agreement is terminated, the Affected Property shall again be
               subject to the Right of First Refusal and the Right of First
               Offer;

         (d)   provided, further, if the Triggering Event Terms did not include
               seller financing, and if Symantec later offers seller financing,
               it shall be deemed that the Third Party Agreement is not
               substantially in accordance with the Triggering Event Terms;

        (e)     for purposes of this Section 9.3.3.4, "net economic terms' shall
                mean the purchase price reduced by the monetary value of (i) any
                credits or offsets 

                                       36
<PAGE>   37

                to be given to the buyer at closing, (ii) the present value
                (calculated using a discount rate of ten percent (10%)) of any
                rents or other amounts to be paid by Symantec to the buyer
                following the closing, and (iii) if seller financing is part of
                the Triggering Event Terms, the present value (calculated using
                a discount rate of ten percent (10%)) of the amount by which the
                periodic payments to be made pursuant to the financing terms
                which are part of the Triggering Event Terms are less than the
                actual financing terms set for in the Third Party Agreement.

      9.3.3.5. YES TST PURCHASE. If TST gives a Triggering Event Purchase
      Notice, but either of the following occur, such Affected Property shall no
      longer be subject to either the Right of First Refusal or the Right of
      First Offer:

         (a) within sixty (60) days following such Triggering Event Purchase
             Notice, and despite the parties' good faith commercially reasonable
             efforts, Symantec and TST have not executed a mutually acceptable
             binding agreement which (except for the specific terms set forth in
             the Triggering Event Offer Notice) shall be on substantially the
             same terms, conditions, representations and warranties as set forth
             in this Agreement (the "Affected Property Agreement") providing for
             the purchase by TST of the Affected Property; provided, however, if
             the parties have not executed the Affected Property Agreement
             within such sixty (60) day period but are continuing to use good
             faith commercially reasonable efforts to do so, either party may,
             by notice to the other party given prior to the end of such sixty
             (60) day period, assert that such party believes that with the
             continuation of such good faith commercially reasonable efforts,
             the parties are likely to execute the Affected Property Agreement
             within an additional thirty (30) days, in which event such sixty
             (60) day period shall be so extended for an additional thirty (30)
             days;

         (b) Symantec and TST enter into an Affected Property Agreement, but the
             purchase and sale of the Affected Property does not close pursuant
             to the terms of the Affected Property Agreement within a reasonable
             time following the date for closing set forth in the Affected
             property Agreement and/or if the Affected property Agreement is
             terminated for reasons other than the breach or default of
             Symantec.

      9.3.3.6. RIGHT TO ASSIGN. The provisions of Section 3.4 shall apply to the
      exercise by TST of the rights set forth in this Section 9.3.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                      LOSS OR CONDEMNATION PRIOR TO CLOSING

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act, the
parties hereto agree that if a loss to all or any portion of the Property occurs
prior to Closing from any cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, due
to a casualty or a taking under the power of eminent domain, the following
provisions will apply:

                                       37
<PAGE>   38

10.1. LOSS DOES NOT EXCEED MATERIALITY LIMIT. In the event of any condemnation
or taking of the Property, or loss or damage by fire or other casualty to the
Property prior to the Closing which does not exceed the Materiality Limit, the
Closing shall occur just as if such condemnation, loss or damage had not
occurred, and the Transferor Party shall assign to the Transferee Party all of
Transferor Party's interest in any condemnation actions and proceeds, or deliver
to Transferee Party any and all proceeds paid to Transferor Party by Transferee
Party's insurer with respect to such fire or other casualty (together with the
amount of any deductible); provided, however, that Transferor Party shall be
entitled to retain an amount of such insurance proceeds equal to Transferor
Party's reasonable expenses, if any, incurred in repairing the damage caused by
fire or other casualty (together with the amount of any deductible). Each Party
shall maintain "all risk" replacement value insurance coverage in place on the
Property at all times prior to the Closing. During the Feasibility Period, each
Party has reviewed the other Party's current insurance policies for the Property
(or the relevant portions thereof) and agrees that such policies, if continued
through Closing, will satisfy such requirements for "all risk" replacement value
insurance coverage within the meaning of the preceding sentence. At Closing, in
the case of a fire or other casualty, Transferor Party shall give Transferee
Party a credit on the Purchase Price equal to the lesser of the estimated cost
of restoration or the amount of the deductible.

10.2. LOSS EXCEEDS MATERIALITY LIMIT. In the event of any condemnation of all or
a part of the Property, or loss or damage by fire or other casualty to the
Property prior to the Closing which exceeds the Materiality Limit, at Transferee
Party's sole option, either:

   10.2.1. TERMINATE AGREEMENT. Elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance
   with the Section 8.8 if Transferee Party shall so notify Transferor Party in
   writing within ten (10) days of Transferee Party having actual knowledge of
   the casualty or condemnation; or

   10.2.2. CLOSE. If Transferee Party shall not have timely notified Transferor
   Party of its election to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
   Subsection (a) above, the Closing shall occur just as if such condemnation,
   loss, or damage had not occurred, without reduction in the Purchase Price,
   and Transferor Party shall assign to Transferee Party all of Transferor
   Party's interest in any condemnation actions and proceeds or deliver to
   Transferee Party any and all proceeds paid to Transferor Party by Transferor
   Party's insurer with respect to such fire or other casualty; provided,
   however, that Transferor Party shall be entitled to retain an amount of such
   insurance proceeds equal to Transferor Party's reasonable expenses, if any,
   incurred in repairing the damage caused by such fire or other casualty. At
   Closing, in the case of a fire or other casualty, Transferor Party shall give
   Transferee Party a credit on the Purchase Price equal to the lesser of the
   estimated cost of restoration or the amount of the deductible.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

2.01    Transferor Party's Representations and Warranties. Each Transferor Party
        hereby makes the following representations and warranties to each
        Transferee Party, except as set forth in Schedule 2A and except to the
        extent that Transferee Party makes any Discovery:

(1)     Unqualified Representations and Warranties. The representations and
        warranties set forth below in this Section 2.01(1) are given by
        Transferor Party without qualification pursuant to their terms:

        (a)     Other Agreements. Neither this Agreement, nor anything provided
                to be done hereunder, violates or shall violate any contract,
                agreement or instrument to which Transferor Party is a party, or
                to the best of Transferor Party's actual knowledge, which
                affects Transferor Party's Property or any portion thereof;

        (b)     Organization and Standing. Transferor Party is an entity of the
                type described in the opening paragraph of the Agreement, duly
                organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
                of the State of its formation, has, or with respect to TST, as

                transaction contemplated hereunder;

        (c)     No Other Sales. Transferor Party has not entered into, and has
                no legal notice of any claim relating to, any other contracts
                for the sale of all, any portion of, or any interest in
                Transferor Party's Property, and Transferor Party has not
                granted, and has no legal notice of any claim relating to, any
                rights of first refusal or options to purchase the all, any
                portion of, or any interest in Transferor Party's Property;

        (d)     Approvals. Transferor Party has not received written notice (or,
                if any such notice has been received the violation described in
                such notice has been cured) that any consent, authorization,
                variance, license, permit, or approval (collectively, the
                "Approvals") relating to or required for the operation or
                occupancy of Transferor Party's Property and required in order
                for Transferor Party to carry out the transactions contemplated
                hereby has not been validly and unconditionally obtained (or, if
                there existed any condition with respect thereto, such condition
                has been satisfied) or is not in full force and effect.
                Materially true, accurate, and complete copies of all Approvals
                in Transferor Party's possession have been, or will be,
                delivered to the Transferee Party prior to the Closing as part
                of the Property Documents. All fees, charges, and other payments
                in connection with the Approvals have been paid in full. Without
                the prior 




                                       43
<PAGE>   44

                written approval of Transferee Party, as of the Closing Date,
                except in the ordinary course of business, there will be no
                application for any Approval which is pending. Transferor Party
                shall have no liability with respect to this Subsection (d) to
                the extent of information that was readily available to
                Transferee Party from public records on the date on which
                Transferee Party conducted its due diligence;

        (e)     Tenant Agreements. Other than the Leases and the Permitted
                Encumbrances, there are no other lease amendments or agreements
                between Transferor Party and any tenant. Transferor Party has
                made no other agreements (whether written or oral) in the nature
                of a lease affecting Transferor Party's Property that has not
                expired or terminated or will not expire or terminate as of the
                Closing;

        (f)     No Continuing Employees. There are no persons employed in
                connection with the use, operation, maintenance or management of
                Transferor Party's Property whom the Transferee Party would be
                obligated to retain or compensate or provide benefits for after
                the Closing, unless Transferee Party obligates itself to do so
                by a separate written agreement;

        (g)     Personal Property. A materially true and accurate list of the
                personal property of material value used in connection with the
                operations of Transferor Party's Property shall be attached as
                Exhibit K hereto within thirty (30) days of the Agreement Date,
                and a true and accurate list of such personal property of
                material value, not materially varying from the attached, will
                be updated as of the Closing Date and will be attached to the
                Bill of Sale delivered to Transferee Party at Closing. All of
                such personal property of material value is owned by Transferor
                Party in its own name. As of the Closing, none of such personal
                property of material value will be leased or be subject to any
                liens or conditional sales contracts (personal property
                complying with such representations and warranties is referred
                to herein as the "Personal Property");

(2)     Qualified Representations and Warranties. The representations and
        warranties set forth below in this Section 2.01(2) are given by
        Transferor Party pursuant to their terms and to the best knowledge of
        Transferor Party:

        (a)     Leases. To the best of Transferor Party's knowledge, the
                schedule of the leases, the separate schedule of security
                deposits and a separate delinquency report for the Property
                (collectively, the "Lease Reports"), all attached as Schedules
                to Exhibit H hereto, are materially true and accurate as of the
                Agreement Date. New Lease Reports, all updated as of the Closing
                Date will be delivered to Transferee Party at Closing, and will
                be materially true and accurate to the best of Transferor
                Party's knowledge. Except as otherwise expressly disclosed on
                the Lease Reports and updated Lease Reports to be delivered at
                Closing, to the best of Transferor Party's knowledge: (a) no

        (a)     Execution. The execution and delivery of the Agreement will not

                                   SCHEDULE 2A
             EXCEPTIONS TO SYMANTEC'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


A.      CCC5.

        -       At the time of the acquisition of the CCC5 Property by
        Symantec's designee in 1997, the Property was used as a surface parking
        area by users within Cupertino City Center.

        -       As a condition to the acquisition of the Property, Symantec made
        various commitments to other owners or property within Cupertino City
        Center (and certain of their lenders) to provide extra parking
        facilities within the parking structure to be built on the Property as
        part of the Building CCC5 project to accommodate the parking needs of
        such other owners and users.

        -       Among other documents evidencing the right of such other owners
        and users, is that certain Parking Easement and Relocation Agreement
        recorded February 5, 1997 as Document #13602281 in the Official Records
        and Santa Clara County (the "Parking Easement and Relocation
        Agreement").

        -       In addition, to the Parking Easement and Relocation Agreement,
        certain parking rights have been granted pursuant to recorded easements
        in favor of the apartment project located across the entry driveway to
        Building CCC5 and in favor of the WHQ Property.

        -       In order to accommodate the various parking requirements, the
        parking structure was expanded below ground beyond the parcel boundaries
        for the Property. Various easements and other agreements were obtained
        from affected parties in order to authorize such expansion of the
        parking structure and the installation and maintenance of (i) electrical
        and communications infrastucture within such expanded area and (ii)
        landscaping treatments.

        -       In order to facilitate the construction process, a "tie-back
        easement" was obtained from a neighboring property owner.

        -       The foregoing is not intended to be a comprehensive list or to
        serve as substitute for TST's thorough investigation of title and all
        other matters relating to the CCC5 Property.

A.      WHQ.


                The following statements describe relevant information relating
        to WHQ of which TST should be aware as TST conducts its investigations
        during the Feasibility Period:

        -       3rd Floor, South Wing has several roof leaks

        -       3rd Floor, North Wing A/C system has a large pressure drop



                                       49

        -       Building carpets need replacing

        -       Parking lot stall lines need repainting

                                   SCHEDULE 2B
               EXCEPTIONS TO TST'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        Cupertino City Center Buildings ("Buildings") and its affiliates own
certain properties within the, Cupertino City Center, and is effectively by
succession the Declarant under that certain Declaration of Covenants, Conditions
and Restrictions and Grant of Easements for Cupertino City Center dated October
2, 1985 (the "Original Declaration").

        Pursuant to the terms of the Original Declaration a Parking Structure
was designated for Lot 3 of Tract 7734, to contain 1,232 spaces, to be used by
the owners of Lots 1, 2, and 4. CCC2 is located on Lot 2. The original
Declaration also provided that the owner of each Lot would be allocated a
non-exclusive easement for the use of "such a number of parking spaces therein
as are reasonably necessary to satisfy the Minimum Parking Ratio applicable to
each such Lot." TST believes that the contemplated number of parking spaces in
the Original Declaration is not sufficient to satisfy the Minimum Parking Ratio
for the building to be built on Lots 1, 2, and 4 at such time as all three Lots
are fully developed. As of the Agreement Date, Lot 4 remains undeveloped. A
Parking Structure has been built on Lot 3, which contains approximately 1,265
spaces.

        On February 2, 1987, through a recorded Deed of Trust, Buildings granted
to the Travelers Insurance Company ("Travelers"), the present fee owner of CCC2,
a non-exclusive easement to park 494 automobiles in the Parking Structure. In
that Deed of Trust, Buildings warranted and represented that it would not grant
easements for the benefit of other properties for parking in the Parking
Structure that would overburden the Parking Structure or would violate
applicable zoning laws.

        On April 15, 1987, Buildings granted to the owner of Lot I in Tract 7734
a non-exclusive easement for parking 580 automobiles in the Parking Structure
pursuant to an Agreement and Grant of Permanent Easement, Thereafter, on August
28, 1987, the Original Declaration was amended by a First Amendment to
Declaration (the "First Amendment") to incorporate nine additional Lots in the
adjoining Tract 7953 into the Cupertino City Center complex. The First Amendment
restricted the Declarant's right to grant further parking rights in the Parking
Structure without the consent of the owners and mortgagees of Lots 1 and 2 of
Tract 7734, which would include Travelers as the then mortgagee of Lot 2.

        On November 1, 1989, in a Deed of Trust for the benefit of Teachers
Insurance & Annuity Association of America ("TIAA"), Buildings granted a
non-exclusive easement for parking 193 automobiles within the Parking Structure
for the benefit of Lots 2 and 3 of Tract 7953 This increased the parking
allocation within the Parking Structure to 1,267 spaces. The subject TIAA Deed
of Trust provided in part that the grant of easement had received all necessary
approvals and consents, including the consents of owners and mortgagees of Lots
I and 2 of Tract 7734. TST has no knowledge whether Travelers was consulted or
provided any consent in this regard. 




                                       51
<PAGE>   52

        On or about October 3, 1996, a Parking Easement and Relocation
Agreement (the "Relocation Agreement") was entered into between Buildings, TIAA,
and several other parties (and which was approved and consented to by Symantec
on September 30, 1996), under which certain parking rights benefiting Lots 2 and
3 in Tract 7953 can be temporarily relocated either to the Parking Structure or
to alternate parcels (Lots 1 and 6 in Tract 7953), The Relocation Agreement
relates to parking rights for a total of 255 additional automobiles, The term of
this temporary parking easement is three years from the date that Buildings
sends a notice to the applicable parties designating which area is to be
burdened with temporary additional parking. As of the Agreement Date, TST
believes that Travelers has not received any such notice, so it is presumed that
temporary parking rights in the Parking Structure have not been granted by
Buildings pursuant to the Relocation Agreement.

        TST further believes that Travelers is not aware of any effort to gain
Travelers consent to the Relocation Agreement, as required under the First
Amendment. However, TST is aware that on February 7, 1997, in a document
entitled Second Amendment to Declaration (the "Second Amendment"), Buildings
purported to modify the First Amendment by retroactively providing that the
consent and approval requirements for the granting of additional parking rights
shall not apply to the Relocation Agreement and "any parking temporarily
relocated after the date hereof from Lot 4 of Tract 7734 on terms and conditions
which are similar to those contained in the [Relocation Agreement.]"

        TST believes that Travelers was not consulted and did not consent to the
Second Amendment. While the original Declaration specifies that Buildings (as
the Class B member) has the sole right to amend the Declaration, it also states
that any amendment that would have a materially adverse effect on any mortgagee
requires the consent of such mortgagee. TST is not aware of mortgagee consent to
the Second Amendment. Moreover, according to the Declaration, in the event a
mortgagee succeeds to the ownership interest of any so-called Class B member's
voting rights, then that Mortgagee also succeeds to the Class B member's voting
rights. Accordingly, Travelers, upon its foreclosure of CCC2 arguably succeeded
to the Class B member voting rights of the original owner of Lot 2. Travelers
was not given the opportunity to vote in connection with the Second Amendment.

        TST HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE PURCHASER
OF LOT 2 AND CCC2 WILL HOLD AN IRREVOCABLE EASEMENT TO PARK 494 AUTOMOBILES
WITHIN THE PARKING STRUCTURE OR ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE PARKING
STRUCTURE IS ADEQUATE TO SATISFY THE MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH LOT
WITH RIGHTS TO PARK THEREIN.

3.03    Prorations. All items of revenue and expense from the Projects shall be
        prorated as of the Closing Date. Without limiting the foregoing:

        (a)     All prorations shall be based on a 30-day month and a 360-day
                year. All items of income and expense for the date on which
                Closing occurs shall be allocated to Transferee Party.

        (b)     Real property taxes and assessments shall be prorated between
                Transferee Party and Transferor Party based on the latest
                available tax information. In the event any supplemental tax
                bill is issued following the Closing Date, Transferor Party
                shall pay to Transferee Party all additional amounts applicable
                to the time prior to the Closing Date upon written request of
                Transferee Party.

        (c)     The present insurance coverage on the Property shall be
                terminated as of the Closing Date and final bills shall be
                issued as of the Closing Date for all public utility services on
                the Property and there shall be no proration of insurance
                premiums or public utility bills. Any deposits on utilities paid
                by Transferor Party shall be returned to Transferor Party.
                Transferee Party shall cause all utilities to be placed in
                Transferee Party's name on and after the Close of Escrow.

        (d)     Rental income actually received from the Property shall be
                prorated as of the Closing Date. Past due rentals shall be
                handled as follows: Transferor Party shall retain the right to
                collect receivables from former tenants who are no longer in
                residence at the Property as of the Closing Date, but Transferee
                Party shall have the right to collect and retain all receivables
                from tenants still in residence on the Closing Date. Transferor
                Party shall receive a credit from Transferee Party at Closing
                for: (1) 100% of receivables less than thirty (30) days past due
                from Tenants that are still in residency at the Property as of
                the Closing Date; and (2) 60% of receivables less than sixty
                (60) days but thirty (30) or more days past due from Tenants
                that are still in residency at the Property as of the Closing
                Date. The amount of all security deposits shall be deducted from
                Transferor Party's account at Closing. By execution of the
                Closing Statement, Transferor Party shall be deemed to have
                represented and warranted that the amount of security deposits
                so deducted from Transferor Party's accounts constitutes the
                entire amount of security deposits from tenants in the Property.

3.04    Costs of Escrow.

        (a)     Transferor Party shall pay the documentary transfer tax and;

<PAGE>   56

                (ii)    [Intentionally Omitted];

                (iii)   The cost of any of Transferor Party's other obligations
                        hereunder.

        (b)     Transferee Party shall pay:

                (i)     All costs not specifically referenced herein customarily
                        allocated to Transferee Party in the County;

                (ii)    The cost of title coverage for the Property being
                        acquired by such Transferee Party pursuant to Section
                        5.2.2.2.3 of the Agreements;

                (iii)   The cost of any of Transferee Party's other obligations
                        hereunder.

3.05    Escrow Cancellation Charges. In the event that any Closing shall fail to
        occur by reason of the default of either party, the defaulting party
        shall be liable for all escrow cancellation charges. In the event that
        any Closing shall fail to occur for any other reason, Transferee Party
        and Transferor Party shall each be liable for one-half of any escrow
        cancellation charges.

3.06    Default. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE in this Agreement and if Transferee
        Party or Transferor Party (the "Defaulting Party") fails to deposit any
        of the amounts due pursuant to this Agreement, or to perform any other
        act when due, then the other party (the "Non-Defaulting Party") may give
        notice to the Defaulting Party demanding that such failed performance be
        completed and if such failed performance has not been completed within
        five (5) days following such notice, the Non-Defaulting Party may
        terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to the Defaulting Party
        and Escrow Holder at which time Escrow Holder shall cancel this escrow
        and the Non-Defaulting Party shall thereupon be released from its
        obligations under this Agreement except for any liability under any
        indemnity in the Agreement which expressly survives termination of this
        Agreement and Transferee Party's liability for Transferee Party's Work
        Product (if, and only if, Transferee Party was the Defaulting Party).

3.07    Additional Escrow Instructions. If required by Escrow Holder, Transferee
        Party and Transferor Party shall execute Escrow Holder's usual form of
        supplemental escrow instructions for transactions of this type,
        provided, however, that (a) in the event that any portion of such
        additional escrow instructions shall be inconsistent with the provisions
        of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail to the
        extent of any such inconsistency; and (b) no provision thereof shall
        have the effect of modifying this Agreement unless it is expressly so
        stated and such express statement is initialed by Transferee Party and
        Transferor Party.

4.01    No Brokers. Except for a Broker identified in the Specific Terms as a

        the subject matter of this transaction, through any real estate broker
        or other person who can claim a right to a commission or finder's fee.
        If any broker or finder makes a claim for a commission or finder's fee
        based upon a contact, dealings, or communications, the party through
        whom the broker or finder makes this claim shall indemnify, defend with
        counsel of the indemnifying party's choice (subject to the reasonable
        approval of the indemnified party), and hold the indemnified party
        harmless from all expense, loss, damage, liability and claims, including
        the indemnified party's attorneys' fees, if necessary, arising out of

4.02    Attorneys' Fees. In any legal proceeding between the parties to this
        Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys fees

        party to receive such notice as specified in the Agreement. Delivery of
        any notice shall be deemed made on the date of actual delivery thereof
        to the address of the addressee, if personally delivered, and on the

        delivery or first attempted delivery to the address of the addressee, if
        sent by mail or courier. Notice may also be given by telecopier to any
        party having a telecopier machine compatible with the telecopier machine
        of the party sending the notice. Any notice given by telecopier shall be
        deemed delivered when received by the party to whom the telecopy was
        addressed. Any party may change its address or telecopier number for
        notice purposes by giving notice to the other party and to Escrow
        Holder.

        elsewhere specified, this Agreement shall not be assignable without the

        accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be binding upon the
        parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors or
        representatives. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this Agreement,
        any permitted assignment shall not relieve the assignor of assignor's

        Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

4.11    Waiver. The waiver of any breach of any provision hereunder by
        Transferee Party or Transferor Party shall not be deemed to be a waiver
        of any preceding or subsequent breach hereunder. No failure or delay of
        any party in the exercise of any right given hereunder shall constitute
        a waiver thereof nor shall any partial exercise of any right preclude
        further exercise thereof.

4.12    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
        counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which shall

        recordation of such a memorandum is a condition to release of any of the

        Agreement. If such a memorandum is so recorded, Transferee Party agrees
        to execute for recording a release of such memorandum upon demand by

       EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES IN THE AGREEMENT, ASSIGNOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS
TO THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY OR THE ASSIGNED PROPERTIES OR THE
SUITABILITY THEREOF FOR ANY PURPOSE THAT ASSIGNEE MAY DESIRE TO USE IT. ASSIGNOR
