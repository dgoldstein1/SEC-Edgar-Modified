The condensed consolidated financial statements of Symantec Corporation
("Symantec" or the "Company") as of June 30, 2000, and for the three months
ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management,
contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items necessary for
the fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for
the interim periods. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto
included in Symantec's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
2000. The results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2000 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation format.

Symantec has a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as
of and for the periods ended June 30, 2000, March 31, 2000 and June 30, 1999
reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended June 30, 2000, March 31, 2000

NOTE 5. LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

Over the past few years, it has become common for software companies, including
Symantec, to receive claims of patent infringement. Symantec is currently
evaluating claims of patent infringement asserted by several parties, with
respect to certain of the Company's products. While the Company believes that it
has valid defenses to these claims, the outcome of any related litigation or
negotiation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future results
of operations or cash flows.

Symantec is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. The


                                       7

Company intends to defend all of the aforementioned pending lawsuits vigorously,
and although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or more of the
cases, the final resolution of these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate,
is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the financial condition of
the Company, although it is not possible to estimate the possible loss or losses
from each of these cases. Depending, however, on the amount and timing of an
unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's
future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely
affected in a particular period. The Company has accrued certain estimated legal
fees and expenses related to certain of these matters; however, actual amounts
may differ materially from those estimated amounts. For further information on
these cases refer to the Company's previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended March 31, 2000.

NOTE 6. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES

During the March 2000 quarter, Symantec reduced operations in its Melville and
Toronto sites, thereby reducing its workforce by 96 employees. Each of these
employees either received a separation package or accepted offers to move to
other Symantec offices. As a result, the facility in Melville was vacated and
the Company is reducing the space occupied in Toronto. The Company recorded
approximately $3.4 million for employee severance, outplacement and abandonment
of certain facilities and equipment during the March 2000 quarter. In addition,
approximately $0.7 million was provided for costs of severance, related benefits
and outplacement services for two members of senior management due to the
realignment of Symantec's business units and their resulting departures during
the March 2000 quarter.

During the December 1999 quarter, management reduced its Internet Tools business
unit's workforce and reduced its Sales workforce. There were 48 employees in the
Internet Tools business unit affected, resulting in approximately $1.8 million
of severance, related benefits and outplacement services being accrued during
the December 1999 quarter. The Sales workforce reduction affected 10 employees,
resulting in approximately $0.4 million of severance, related benefits and
outplacement services being accrued in the December 1999 quarter.

During the September 1999 quarter, Symantec provided approximately $0.7 million
for costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services for two
members of senior management due to the realignment of its business units and
their resulting departures. The Company also accrued approximately $2.7 million
for certain costs related to an agreement reached with its former CEO in the
June 1999 quarter. These costs were comprised of severance and acceleration of
unvested stock options.

Details of the fiscal 2000 restructuring charges are as follows:

</TABLE>


During the September 1998 quarter, Symantec made a decision to restructure its
operations and outsource domestic manufacturing operations. As a result,
management originally recorded a $3.8 million charge for personnel severance to
reduce the workforce by approximately 5% in both domestic and international
operations and a $1.3 million charge for the planned abandonment of a
manufacturing facility lease. These estimates were subsequently revised in the
September 1999 quarter, resulting in a reduction in the personnel severance and
outplacement accruals by approximately $0.7 million.

NOTE 7. STOCK REPURCHASE

On March 22, 1999, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Symantec authorized
the repurchase of up to $75 million of Symantec's outstanding common stock for
up to $20.00 per share. As of June 30, 2000, the Company has repurchased
1,000,000 shares at prices ranging from $17.90 to $19.90, for an aggregate
amount of $18.7 million. All of these shares were purchased in the June 1999
quarter.


NOTE 8.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. In June 2000, the SEC released SAB
No. 101B, which defers reporting the effects of the adoption of SAB No. 101
until our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2001. We are currently evaluating the
potential impact of SAB No. 101 on our required disclosures and accounting
practices.

In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation
No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an
interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. This Interpretation clarifies the
application of Opinion No. 25 for certain issues including: (a) the definition
of an employee for purposes of applying Opinion No. 25, (b) the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the
accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. In general, this Interpretation
is effective July 1, 2000. Management does not expect the adoption of
Interpretation No. 44 to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On July 27, 2000, the Company signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the
outstanding shares of AXENT Technologies, Inc. Upon obtaining necessary
regulatory and stockholder approvals, the Company plans to exchange one share of
Symantec common stock for every two shares of AXENT Technologies, Inc. common
stock outstanding. The Company expects to issue approximately 15.3 million
shares in the transaction.

        OF OPERATIONS


BUSINESS RISK FACTORS

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
factors include, among others things, those risk factors set forth in this
section and elsewhere in this report. We identify forward-looking statements by
words such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue"
or similar terms that refer to the future. We cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements.

OUR INCREASED SALES OF ENTERPRISE-WIDE SITE LICENSES MAY INCREASE FLUCTUATIONS
IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. Sales of enterprise-wide site licenses through our
Enterprise Solutions segment are a major and expanding portion of our business.
This enterprise market has significantly different characteristics than the
consumer market and requires different skills and resources to penetrate.
Licensing arrangements tend to involve a longer sales cycle than sales through
other distribution channels, require greater investment of resources in
establishing the enterprise relationship and can sometimes result in lower
operating margins. The timing of the execution of volume licenses, or their
nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers, could cause our results of
operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations.

WE RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED OUR INTERNAL FOCUS AND OPERATIONS AND WE COULD INCUR
ADVERSE OPERATING CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES. In fiscal 2000, we
restructured our operations on the basis of a customer segment orientation
rather than a product structure. We also divested two product lines that did not
fit with our future focus. Changes of this nature inevitably cause disruptions
within an organization that may adversely affect results as the changes are
being absorbed, and these changes may not achieve their desired long-term
benefits. Overseeing these changes requires significant attention from our
senior management and may detract from management's ability to focus on other
important opportunities or problems that might confront us. We have lost
personnel, including management, and we may continue to do so as a consequence
of these types of changes. In addition, we may not be able to introduce new
products that are as beneficial to us as those that we divested.

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND WEB SITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTENTIONAL DISRUPTION.
Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional
disruptions, such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the
performance of our products, we expect to be an ongoing target of such
disruptions. Similarly, experienced computer programmers, or hackers, may
attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services.
Our activities could be substantially disrupted and our reputation, and future
sales, harmed if these efforts are successful.

OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THIS COMPETITION. Our markets are
intensely competitive. This competition could adversely affect our operating
results by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products. In
the past, many of our competitors have significantly reduced the price of
utility and anti-virus products and future price reductions could occur for
these or other of our products, which would likely have a negative affect on our
margins and could reduce our sales. Our ability to remain competitive depends on
our ability to enhance our products or produce new products that are compatible
with new products introduced by the major hardware and operating system
providers. We have no control, and sometimes limited visibility, into the
development efforts of these third parties and we may not be able to respond
effectively or timely to their new products and enhancements. In addition, we
have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to how to best
allocate our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets. We may
from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop
as rapidly or fully as we expect. We may fail to allocate resources to third
party products or to markets that are more successful than we anticipate.

INTRODUCTION OF NEW OPERATING SYSTEMS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS
AND STOCK PRICE. The inclusion of security or anti-virus tools in new operating
systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales. For example, the
inclusion of features by Microsoft in the upcoming release of Windows 2000
Millennium Edition, which directly compete with our products,


                                       11

<PAGE>   12

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products, including those
currently under development and products specifically intended for Windows 2000
ME. Additionally, as hardware vendors incorporate additional server-based
network management and security tools into network operating systems, the demand
may decrease for some of our products, including those currently under
development.

Our financial results and our stock price declined significantly within
approximately six months after the releases of Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and
Windows 98, which in some cases caused hardware upgrades that resulted in shifts
in customer spending from software to hardware. The consumer/desktop oriented
Millennium Edition of Windows 2000 is expected to be released in the September
2000 quarter, and, as a result, we could face adverse financial results and
additional stock price declines.

With the rise of Linux-based operating systems, we may lose market share if we
are unable to significantly penetrate the Linux-based market timely and
effectively.

OUR EARNINGS AND STOCK PRICE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. Due to the
factors noted throughout this section, our earnings and stock price have been
and may continue to be subject to significant volatility. There have been
previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and
earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors, which have
had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our
common stock. This may occur again in the future.

OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. While
our diverse product lines have tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net
revenues, these fluctuations have occurred in the past, and may occur in the
future. Fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors, including:

     o    the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions
          of our products and product upgrades;

     o    the introduction of competitive products by existing or new
          competitors;

     o    reduced demand for any given product;

     o    seasonality in the end-of-period buying patterns of foreign and
          domestic software markets; and

     o    the market's transition between operating systems.

A significant portion of our net revenues have historically been generated
during the last month of a fiscal quarter. Most resellers tend to make a
majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter. In addition, many
enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter. In
part, this is because these two groups are able, or believe that they are able,
to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time. Our reliance on
a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase
in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can
result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues. Due to this
end-of-period buying pattern, forecasts may not be achieved, either because
expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms
that are less favorable to us. In addition, these factors increase the chances
that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. A significant portion of
our net revenues, manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from
transactions outside of the United States, often in foreign currencies. As a
result, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates and general uncertainty with each
country's political and economic structure. In addition, the laws of some other
countries do not protect intellectual property rights as effectively as is the
case in the United States and we may be subject to a greater risk of
unauthorized use of our products.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY ADAPT TO CHANGES IN THE DYNAMIC TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT.
We are increasingly focused on the Internet security market, which in turn is
dependent on further acceptance of the Internet. The following critical issues
concerning the use of the Internet remain unresolved and may affect the market
for our products and the use of the Internet as a medium to distribute or
support our software products and the functionality of some of our products:


                                       12

        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


     o    security;

     o    reliability;

     o    cost;

     o    ease of use;

     o    accessibility;

     o    quality of service; or

     o    potential tax or other government regulations.

In addition, new technologies, such as non PC-based Internet access devices and
handheld organizers, are gaining acceptance. We must adapt to these changing
technological demands. If we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought
about by the Internet and non PC-based environments, our future net revenues and
operating results could be adversely affected.

THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE UNCERTAIN. We believe
that we will need to incur significant research and development expenditures to
remain competitive. The products we are currently developing or may develop in
the future may not be technologically successful. In addition, the length of our
product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally
expected. We are likely to experience delays in future product development. If
they are not technologically successful, our resulting products may not achieve
market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors.

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON CERTAIN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. A large portion of our
sales is made through the retail distribution channel, which is subject to
events that create unpredictability in consumer demand. This increases the risk
that we may not plan effectively for the future, which could result in adverse
operating results in future periods. Our retail distribution customers also
carry our competitors' products. These retail distributors may have limited
capital to invest in inventory. Their decisions to purchase our products are
partly a function of pricing, terms and special promotions offered by our
competitors and other factors that we do not control nor can we predict. Our
agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be
terminated by them or by us without cause. We would be adversely affected if
companies in our chain of distributors chose to increase purchases from our
competition relative to the amount they buy from us.

Some distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the
past and some are currently experiencing financial difficulties. If these
distributors do experience financial difficulties and we are unable to move
their inventories to other distributors, we may experience reduced sales or
increased write-offs, which would adversely affect our operating results.

WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN UTILIZING NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. We currently
offer a broad range of products and services over the Internet, which is a
relatively new distribution channel for our business. We may not be able to
effectively adapt our existing, or adopt new, methods of distributing our
software products utilizing the rapidly evolving Internet and related
technologies. The adoption of new channels may adversely impact existing
channels and/or product pricing, which may reduce our future revenues and
profitability.

CHANNEL FILL AND PRODUCT RETURNS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES. Our
pattern of net revenues and earnings may be affected by "channel fill."
Distributors may fill their distribution channels in anticipation of price
increases, sales promotions or incentives. Channels may also become filled
simply because the distributors do not sell their inventories to retailers as
anticipated. If sales to retailers or end-users do not occur at a sufficient
rate, distributors will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or
return prior purchases in order to reduce their inventories.


                                       13

<PAGE>   14

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


Product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of
products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories. Our return
policy allows distributors, subject to various limitations, to return purchased
products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases.
End-users may return our products through dealers and distributors within a
reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full refund. In addition,
subject to limitations, retailers may return older versions of our products. We
estimate and maintain reserves for product returns. Future returns could,
however, exceed the reserves we have established, which could have a material
adverse affect on our operating results.

THE TRANSITION TO INTEGRATED SUITES OF UTILITIES MAY RESULT IN REDUCED CONSUMER
REVENUES. We and our competitors sell integrated suites of utility products for
prices significantly less than the aggregate price of the stand-alone products
that are included in these suites when sold separately. As a result of the shift
to integrated utility suites, price competition is intense in the consumer
market and we have experienced cannibalization of our stand-alone products that
are included within the suite. Additionally, our products may not compete
effectively with competitors' integrated suites introduced in the future.

WE DEPEND ON OUR INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE DISRUPTED. Our
order entry and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed. A
business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the
interruption in service by communications carriers. If our communications
between these centers are disrupted, particularly at the end of a fiscal
quarter, we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting
adverse impact on our operating results. Communications and Internet
connectivity disruptions may also cause delays in customer access to our
Internet-based services or product sales.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION,
WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. From time to time, we may be
subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of
others, that our products were not Year 2000 compliant or other product
liability claims, or other claims incidental to our business. We are currently
involved in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings. For a
discussion of our current litigation, see Note 5 of Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q and our previously filed
Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2000. We intend to defend all of these
lawsuits vigorously. We may suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of
these cases. Depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions
of these lawsuits, our future results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected in a particular period.

Although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, they are
expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from
day-to-day operations. If a third party alleges that we have infringed their
intellectual property rights, we may choose to litigate the claim and/or seek an
appropriate license from the third party. If we engage in litigation and the
third party is found to have a valid claim against us and a license is not
available on reasonable terms, our business, operating results and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected.

Defects and errors could be found in current versions of our products, future
upgrades to current products or newly developed and released products. Software
defects could result in delays in market acceptance or unexpected reprogramming
costs, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. Most of
our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our
exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible, however, that
these provisions limiting our liability may not be valid as a result of federal,
state, local or foreign laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE
EFFECTIVELY. Consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry
as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and broader
arrays of software solutions. Changes resulting from this consolidation may
negatively impact our competitive condition. In addition, to the extent that we
seek to expand our product lines, and skills and


                                       14

<PAGE>   15

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


capacity through acquisitions, the trend toward consolidation may result in our
encountering competition, and paying higher prices, for acquired businesses.

WE HAVE GROWN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO GROW THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, WHICH GIVE RISE TO
A NUMBER OF RISKS THAT COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR FUTURE OPERATING
RESULTS. We have made seven acquisitions within the last two fiscal years and
have recently announced our agreement to acquire AXENT Technologies, Inc. We
may also complete material acquisitions in the future. Integrating acquired
businesses into our existing business may distract our management focus from
other opportunities and challenges. Our past acquisitions have given rise to,
and future acquisitions may result in, substantial levels of goodwill and other
intangible assets that will be amortized in future years and our future
operating results will be adversely affected if we do not achieve benefits from
these acquisitions commensurate with these charges. In addition, a number of our
recent acquisitions have resulted in our incurring substantial write-offs of
acquired in-process research and development costs and this also may occur as a
result of future acquisitions. We may issue equity, or incur debt financing, for
future acquisitions that are dilutive to our existing stockholders.

In July 2000, we entered into an agreement to acquire AXENT Technologies, Inc.
We expect this transaction to be consummated during our third quarter of fiscal
2001. This agreement is subject to typical closing conditions. If these
conditions are not satisfied, the acquisition may not be consummated.

WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL WHILE COMPETITION FOR PERSONNEL IN OUR
INDUSTRY IS INTENSE. We believe that our future success will depend in part on
our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and
technical personnel, particularly as we focus on enterprise-wide applications.
Competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense. To
accomplish this, we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive
compensation package, including stock options, which requires ongoing
stockholder approval. Such approval may not be forthcoming and, as a result, we
may be impaired in our efforts to attract necessary personnel.

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED
FROM ALL UNAUTHORIZED USES. We regard our software as proprietary and underlying
technology as proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a
combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright, patent, trademark and
trade secret laws. Third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise
obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop
similar technology independently. All of our products are protected by copyright
and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending. We may not
achieve the desired protection from, and third parties may design around, our
patents, as new technologies are making piracy easier to achieve. In addition,
existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection. Furthermore, the
laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
proprietary rights as the laws of the United States. Any legal action that we
may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract
management from day-to-day operations.

NET REVENUES

Net revenues increased 9% from approximately $175 million in the June 1999
quarter to $191 million in the June 2000 quarter. Revenue growth in the June
2000 quarter compared to the June 1999 quarter was attributable to growth in our
Enterprise and e-Support segments, offset by a decline in our Other segment's
revenues. The revenue increase in the Enterprise and e-Support segments was due
to strong corporate growth. The revenue decline in our Other segment was due
primarily to our divestiture of the ACT! and Visual Cafe product lines in the
December 1999 quarter, which revenues had been included in the June 1999
quarter.

        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


SEGMENTS

The Consumer and Small Business segment provides solutions to individual
consumers, home offices and small businesses. The segment's charter is to ensure
that consumers and their information are secure and protected in a connected
world. The Consumer and Small Business segment comprised approximately 40% and
43% of net revenues in the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Absolute revenues did not change significantly during the quarter ended June 30,
2000, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 1999.

The Enterprise Solutions segment provides a broad range of security solutions
for our enterprise customers. Our corporate customers need to protect their
businesses from the threats associated with the use of the Internet. The
Enterprise Solutions segment comprised approximately 25% and 20% of net revenues
in the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenues increased
primarily due to strong demand for our Norton AntiVirus solutions.

The e-Support segment offers products that enable companies to be more effective
and efficient within their IT departments. Remote management solutions help
remote professionals to remain productive while providing companies access to
information, applications and data from any location. The e-Support segment
comprised approximately 31% and 28% of total net revenues in the quarters ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The growth in e-Support was driven by
strong growth of its two primary products, pcANYWHERE and Ghost.

The Professional Services segment provides fee-based technical support and
consulting services to enterprise customers to assist them with the planning,
design and implementation of enterprise security solutions in the anti-virus and
Internet content filtering technologies. The Professional Services segment
comprised approximately 4% and 2% of total net revenues for the quarters ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The growth in Professional Services is
attributable to our increased efforts in providing additional technical support
to our customers.

The Other segment is comprised of sunset products, products nearing the end of
their life cycle, and operations of the ACT! and Visual Cafe product lines that
we divested in the December 1999 quarter. The Other segment comprised
approximately 0% and 7% of net revenues in the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and
1999, respectively. The segment's net revenues are lower in the quarter ended
June 30, 2000 over the quarter ended June 30, 1999, due to our divestiture of
the ACT! and Visual Cafe product lines in the December 1999 quarter, which
revenues had been included in the June 1999 quarter.

INTERNATIONAL

Net revenues from sales outside of North America were approximately $83 million
and $68 million and represented 44% and 39% of total net revenues in the
quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in
international net revenues was the result of sales growth in our Europe, Middle
East and Africa and Japan regions. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the
quarter ended June 30, 2000 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 1999 did not
materially affect quarterly revenue.

GROSS MARGIN

Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
consists primarily of manufacturing expenses, costs for producing manuals,
packaging costs, royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and
amortization and write-off of capitalized software, or acquired product rights.

Gross margins increased to 85% of net revenues in the June 2000 quarter from 83%
in the June 1999 quarter. Factors contributing to the increase in gross margin
percentage include a change in product mix from consumer products to our
corporate business. Gross margin was also improved by decreased royalty expense
as a result of a shift in sales in the June 2000 quarter to products with lower
royalty rates than those sold in the June 1999 quarter. In addition, technical
support costs related to corporate sales increased as the mix of corporate sales
increased.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


These factors were partially offset by increases in obsolescence expense, as we
prepare for the release of Windows 2000 Millennium Edition in the September 2000
quarter. Amortization and write-off of acquired product rights totaled
approximately $2.7 million and $2.3 million for the June 2000 and 1999 quarters,
respectively. The increase is due to our acquisitions in fiscal 2000.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

Research and development expenses decreased 7% from approximately $28 million in
the June 1999 quarter to $26 million in the June 2000 quarter primarily due to a
drop in headcount following our divestitures of ACT! and Visual Cafe.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES

Sales and marketing expenses increased 5% from approximately $74 million in the
June 1999 quarter to $77 million in the June 2000 quarter. The increase in sales
and marketing expenses primarily relates to growth in headcount in our
Professional Services segment, and related expenses. This increase was offset by
reduced marketing costs associated with our divested ACT! product line.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

General and administrative expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of
total revenues, while absolute dollars increased approximately 14% from $9
million in the June 1999 quarter to $10 million in the June 2000 quarter. This
increase in absolute dollars was due to increased headcount and related
expenses.

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased approximately $1.3
million from $4.1 million in June 1999 to $5.4 million in the June 2000 quarter.
The increase is due to amortization of additional goodwill and other intangibles
from the acquisitions we made during fiscal 2000.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES

Restructuring and other expenses amounted to approximately $2.8 million for the
quarter ended June 1999, for certain costs related to an agreement reached with
our former CEO. These costs were comprised of severance and acceleration of
unvested stock options. There were no restructuring and other expenses in the
June 2000 quarter. See Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Form 10-Q.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME

Interest income was approximately $6.8 million and $2.2 million in the quarters
ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Interest income increased 200% in
the quarter ended June 30, 2000 over the quarter ended June 30, 1999, primarily
due to higher average invested cash balances of approximately $534 million for
the June 2000 quarter compared to $228 million for the June 1999 quarter.

Other income was relatively flat at approximately $0.3 million and $0.6 million
in the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

INCOME, NET OF EXPENSE, FROM SALE OF TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCT LINES

Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines increased
from approximately $4.9 million in June 1999 quarter to $5.9 million in the June
2000 quarter. This increase is due to approximately $5.5 million in royalties
and other transition fees received in the June 2000 quarter as a result of our
sale of the ACT! and Visual Cafe product lines. The payment from JetForm in the
June 2000 quarter of approximately $0.4 million was lower than the $4.9 million
payment in the June 1999 quarter as we received the last JetForm payment in
accordance with our agreement in the June 2000 quarter.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS, CONTINUED


INCOME TAX PROVISION

Excluding the impact of amortization of goodwill and restructuring charges, the
effective tax rate on income before income taxes for the quarters ended June
2000 and 1999 was 32%. This rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax
rate primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate on our Irish operations.

The tax provision for the quarter ended June 2000 consists of a 32% tax rate
applied to income before amortization of goodwill of $63.5 million and a $0.4
million tax benefit on the $5.2 million charge for amortization of goodwill.
Similarly, the tax provision for the quarter ended June 1999 consists of two
items: a $13.5 million (or 32% effective tax rate) provision on income before
income taxes and restructuring charges of $42.2 million, a $1.3 million tax
benefit from amortization of goodwill of $3.9 million and a $0.5 million tax
benefit on the $2.8 million of restructuring charges. The benefit of the
restructuring charges is less than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to
uncertainty of the realization of a tax benefit from certain severance benefits.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased approximately $91
million to $523 million at June 30, 2000 from $432 million at March 31, 2000.
This increase is largely due to cash provided from operating activities and net
proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the Stock Option Plans and the
sales of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, offset by cash
paid for capital expenditures and for our acquisition of 20/20 Software.

In addition to cash and short-term investments, we have $71 million of
restricted investments related to collateral requirements under certain lease
agreements. We are obligated under these lease agreements for two existing
office buildings in Cupertino, California, to maintain a restricted cash balance
invested in U.S. Treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three years.
In accordance with the lease terms, these funds are not available to meet our
operating cash requirements. In addition, we are obligated to comply with
certain financial covenants. Future acquisitions may cause us to be in violation
of these financial covenants.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $93 million and was comprised of
net income of $38 million, non-cash related expenses of $15 million and a net
decrease in net assets and liabilities of $40 million.

Net trade accounts receivable increased $5 million to $52 million at June 30,
2000 from $47 million at March 31, 2000, primarily due to growth in our net
revenues.

On March 22, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $75
million of our outstanding common stock, with no expiration date for up to
$20.00 per share. As of June 30, 2000, we purchased 1,000,000 shares at prices
ranging from $17.90 to $19.90, for an aggregate amount of $18.7 million. All of
these shares were purchased in the June 1999 quarter.

We have a $10 million line of credit, which expires in May 2001. We were in
compliance with the debt covenants for this line of credit as of June 30, 2000.
As of June 30, 2000, there were no borrowings and less than $1 million of
standby letters of credit outstanding under this line. Future acquisitions may
cause us to be in violation of the line of credit covenants. However, we believe
that if the line of credit is canceled or amounts are not available under the
line, there would not be a material adverse impact on our financial results,
liquidity or capital resources.

If we were to sustain significant losses, we could be required to reduce
operating expenses, which could result in product delays and could cause us to
reassess acquisition opportunities, which could negatively impact our growth
objectives and/or pursue further financing options. We believe existing cash and
short-term investments and cash generated from operating activities will be
sufficient to fund operations for the next year.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of our portfolio
of equity securities. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the
market exposure on our securities. As of March 31, 2000, these securities
consisted of approximately 600,000 shares of Interact Commerce Corporation, a
publicly traded company (Nasdaq symbol "IACT"), with a market value of
approximately $16.9 million. Since April 2000, many high-technology stocks
experienced increased volatility and a significant decrease in value, including
these shares. If these securities had been valued using prices as of August 1,
2000, the value of these securities would have decreased by approximately $9.9
million as compared to the March 31, 2000 value. The value of these securities
may vary over time and the value as of August 1, 2000 of approximately $7.0
million is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We believe there has been no other significant change in our market risk
exposures as what was previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended
March 31, 2000.

          2.1  Vesting of Right to Exercise Option. This Option shall become
exercisable as to portions of the Shares as follows: (a) this Option shall not
be exercisable with respect to any of the Shares until one year after the Date

Terminated on or before the First Vesting Date, then on the First Vesting Date
this Option shall become vested and exercisable as to 25% of the Shares; and (c)
thereafter, so long as Participant continuously provides services to the Company
or any Subsidiary, Parent or Affiliate of the Company and is not Terminated, at
the end of each full succeeding month the Option will become vested and
exercisable as to 2.08333% of the Shares until the Shares are vested with
respect to 100% of the Shares.

          2.2  Expiration. This Option shall expire on the Expiration Date set
forth above and must be exercised, if at all, on or before the earlier of the
Expiration Date or the date on which this Option is earlier terminated in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.

     3.   TERMINATION.

          3.1  Termination by the Company without Cause. If Participant is
Terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined below) other than by
Participant's death or Disability, this Option shall become vested and
exercisable as to 100% of the Shares by Participant on the date of such
Termination and may be exercised by Participant no later than three (3) months
after the date of such Termination, but in any event no later than the
Expiration Date.

          3.2  Termination Because of Death or Disability. If Participant is
Terminated because of death or Disability of Participant, then this Option, to
the extent that it is exercisable by Participant on the Termination Date, may be
exercised by Participant (or Participant's legal representative) no later than
twelve (12) months after the Termination Date, but in any event no later than
the Expiration Date.

          3.3  Termination by the Company for Cause. If the Participant is
Terminated for Cause, then this Option, to the extent (and only to the extent)
that it would have been exercisable by Participant on the date of Termination,
may be exercised by Participant no later than three (3) months after the date of
Termination, but in any event no later than the Expiration Date. For purposes of
this Agreement, "CAUSE" means Termination because of (i) any willful, material
violation by the Participant of any law or regulation applicable to the business
of the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, the Participant's
conviction for, or guilty plea to, a felony or a crime involving moral
turpitude, or any willful perpetration by the Participant of a common law fraud,
(ii) the Participant's commission of an act of personal dishonesty which
involves personal profit in connection with the Company or any other entity
having a business relationship with the Company, (iii) the willful and continued
failure or refusal of the Participant to perform the material duties required of
such Participant as an employee, officer or consultant of the Company or a
Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, other than as a result of having a
Disability, or a breach of any applicable invention assignment agreement or a
material breach of a confidentiality agreement or similar agreement between the
Company or a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company and the Participant, (iv)
Participant's disregard of the policies of the Company or any Parent or
Subsidiary of the Company so as to cause material loss, damage or injury to the
property, reputation or employees of the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary of
the Company, or (v) any other misconduct by the Participant which is materially


                                       2

injurious to the financial condition or business reputation of, or is otherwise
materially injurious to, the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary of the Company.

          3.4  No Obligation to Employ. Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement
shall confer on Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or other
relationship with, the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate of the
Company, or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary
or Affiliate of the Company to terminate Participant's employment or other
relationship at any time, with or without cause.

     4.   MANNER OF EXERCISE.

          4.1  Stock Option Exercise Agreement. To exercise this Option,
Participant (or in the case of exercise after Participant's death, Participant's
executor, administrator, heir or legatee, as the case may be) must deliver to
the Company an executed stock option exercise agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A, or in such other form as may be approved by the Company
from time to time (the "EXERCISE AGREEMENT"), which shall set forth, inter alia,
Participant's election to exercise this Option, the number of Shares being
purchased, any restrictions imposed on the Shares and any representations,
warranties and agreements regarding Participant's investment intent and access
to information as may be required by the Company to comply with applicable
securities laws. If someone other than Participant exercises this Option, then
such person must submit documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company that
such person has the right to exercise this Option.

          4.2  Limitations on Exercise. This Option may not be exercised unless
such exercise is in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities
laws, as they are in effect on the date of exercise.

          4.3  Payment. The Exercise Agreement shall be accompanied by full
payment of the Exercise Price for the Shares being purchased in cash (by check),
or where permitted by law:

               (a)  by cancellation of indebtedness of the Company to the
Participant;

               (b)  by surrender of shares of the Company's Common Stock that
either: (1) have been owned by Participant for more than six (6) months and have
been paid for within the meaning of SEC Rule 144 (and, if such shares were
purchased from the Company by use of a promissory note, such note has been fully
paid with respect to such shares); or (2) were obtained by Participant in the
open public market; and (3) are clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances or
security interests;

               (c)  by waiver of compensation due or accrued to Participant for
services rendered;


                                       3

<PAGE>   4

               (d)  provided that a public market for the Company's stock
exists: (1) through a "same day sale" commitment from Participant and a
broker-dealer that is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers
(an "NASD DEALER") whereby Participant irrevocably elects to exercise this
Option and to sell a portion of the Shares so purchased to pay for the exercise
price and whereby the NASD Dealer irrevocably commits upon receipt of such
Shares to forward the exercise price directly to the Company; or (2) through a
"margin" commitment -- from Participant and a NASD Dealer whereby Participant
irrevocably elects to exercise this Option and to pledge the Shares so purchased
to the NASD Dealer in a margin account as security for a loan from the NASD
Dealer in the amount of the exercise price, and whereby the NASD Dealer
irrevocably commits upon receipt of such Shares to forward the exercise price
directly to the Company; or

               (e)  by any combination of the foregoing where approved by the
Committee, or its designee, in its sole discretion.

          4.4  Tax Withholding. Prior to the issuance of the Shares upon
exercise of this Option, Participant must pay or provide for any applicable
federal or state withholding obligations of the Company.

          4.5  Issuance of Shares. Provided that the Exercise Agreement and
payment are in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Company, the
Company shall issue the Shares registered in the name of Participant,
Participant's authorized assignee, or Participant's legal representative, and
shall deliver certificates representing the Shares with the appropriate legends
affixed thereto.

     5.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. The exercise of this Option and
the issuance and transfer of Shares shall be subject to compliance by the
Company and Participant with all applicable requirements of federal and state
securities laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock exchange on
which the Company's Common Stock may be listed at the time of such issuance or
transfer. Participant understands that the Company is under no obligation to
register or qualify the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, any
state securities commission or any stock exchange to effect such compliance.

     6.   NONTRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION. This Option may not be transferred in
any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or as
determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, within the limits permitted
under the Form S-8 Registration Statement relating to Shares thereto and set
forth in the Stock Option Agreement. The terms of this Option shall be binding
upon the executors, administrators, successors and assigns of Participant.

     7.   TAX CONSEQUENCES. Set forth below is a brief summary as of the Date of
Grant of some of the federal and California tax consequences of exercise of this
Option and disposition of the Shares. THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE,
AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. PARTICIPANT SHOULD
CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR BEFORE EXERCISING THE OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.

          7.1  Exercise of Nonqualified Stock Option. There may be a regular
federal and California income tax liability upon the exercise of this Option.
Participant will be treated as having received compensation income (taxable at
ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value
of the Shares on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price. The Company will
be required to withhold from Participant's compensation or collect from
Participant and pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount equal to a
percentage of this compensation income at the time of exercise.

          7.2  Disposition of Shares. If the Shares are held for more than
twelve (12) months after the date of the transfer of the Shares pursuant to the
exercise of a nonqualified stock option, any gain realized on disposition of the
Shares will be treated as capital gain.

     8.   PRIVILEGES OF STOCK OWNERSHIP. Participant shall not have any of the
rights of a shareholder with respect to any Shares until Participant exercises
this Option and pays the Exercise Price.

     9.   INTERPRETATION. Any dispute regarding the interpretation of this
Agreement shall be submitted by Participant or the Company to the Committee for
review. The resolution of such a dispute by the Committee shall be final and
binding on the Company and Participant.

     10.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. This
Agreement and the Plan and the Exercise Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior understandings and agreements with respect
to such subject matter.

     11.  NOTICES. Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Company
under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the
Corporate Secretary of the Company at its principal corporate offices. Any
notice required to be given or delivered to Participant shall be in writing and
addressed to Participant at the address indicated above or to such other address
as such party may designate in writing from time to time to the Company. All
notices shall be deemed to have been given or delivered upon: personal delivery;
three (3) days after deposit in the United States mail by certified or
registered mail (return receipt requested); one (1) business day after deposit
with any return receipt express courier (prepaid); or one (1) business day after
transmission by rapifax or telecopier.

     12.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The Company may assign any of its rights under
this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the successors


                                       5

<PAGE>   6

and assigns of the Company. Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth
herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon Participant and Participant's
heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns.

     13.  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to
that body of law pertaining to choice of law or conflict of law. If any
provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of law to be illegal or
unenforceable, then such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
possible and the other provisions will remain fully effective and enforceable.

     14.  ACCEPTANCE. Participant hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the
Plan and this Agreement. Participant has read and understands the terms and
provisions thereof, and accepts this Option subject to all the terms and
conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. Participant acknowledges that there
may be adverse tax consequences upon exercise of this Option or disposition of
the Shares and that the Company has advised Participant to consult a tax advisor
prior to such exercise or disposition.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed in
duplicate by its duly authorized representative and Participant has executed
this Agreement in duplicate as of the Date of Grant.

                                                                January 31, 2000


Mr. Ron Moritz
3757 Starr King Circle
Palo Alto, CA 94306

Dear Ron,

On behalf of Symantec Corporation, I am pleased to offer you employment as Vice
President and Chief Technical Officer. In this position you will report directly
to John Thompson, CEO, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors. This
position will be located in our Cupertino offices. Your starting base salary
will be $240,000 annually, and you will be eligible for an annual focal review.
At this rate of compensation, you would be eligible, at 100% of company and
individual performance, to an additional 60% of annual base salary, which would
bring your total target annual cash to $384,000. Symantec will also reimburse
you or your current employer, upon production of proper documentation, up to
$17,000 of moving expenses currently owed to your former employer.

Symantec will pay you a one-time hire-on bonus in the amount of $15,000 net
(less withholding allowances) payable within thirty (30) days after you begin
employment with us. If you voluntarily terminate employment with Symantec prior
to completing one year of service, you will be required to reimburse Symantec a
prorated share of the total hire-on bonus.

You also will be entitled to Tax preparation service and Non-qualified deferred
compensation plan (NQDCP).

As a member of Symantec's Executive Staff, you will be eligible to participate
in a wide variety of Executive Staff benefit plans including the Executive Staff
Variable Compensation Plan, 423 Stock Purchase Plan, matching 401(k) savings and
investment plan, health insurance and many other benefits.

We will recommend to the Board of Directors that you be granted an option to
purchase 50,000 shares of Symantec's common stock under our 1996 Stock Option
Plan. The price of the stock will be the closing price of the Company's Common
Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the last trading day prior to the option
grant date, as reported in the Wall Street Journal. The option will vest over a
four-year period starting from your date of hire, at the rate of 25% of the
option at the end of your first year of employment and on a monthly basis
thereafter.

Attached is an Employment Agreement that must be signed and returned with your
signed offer letter. This Agreement must be signed before you start work at
Symantec. It requires that you hold in confidence any proprietary information
received as an employee of Symantec and to assign to us any inventions that you
make while employed by Symantec. We wish to impress upon you that we do not wish
you to bring with you any confidential or proprietary material of any former
employer or to violate any other obligation to your former employers, and that
the Agreement that you will be asked to sign contains a representation by you
that you have not brought nor will you use any such material at Symantec.

This letter does not constitute a contract of employment for any specific period
of time but will create an "employment at will" relationship. This means that
the employment relationship may be terminated by either party for any reason at
any time. Any statements or representation to the contrary (and, indeed any
statements contradicting any provisions of this letter) should be regarded by
you as ineffective. Participation in any of Symantec's stock option or benefit
programs is not to be regarded as assurance of continued employment for any
particular period of time.

Please note that to comply with regulations adopted in the Immigration Reform
and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), we require that you present documentation
demonstrating that you have the authorization to work in the United States on
your first working day. If you have any questions about this requirement, which
applies to U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens alike, please contact me.

Please confirm your acceptance of this offer by signing this letter in the space
indicated and returning it to my attention in the enclosed envelope and faxing
your acceptance to fax no. (408) 864-2485.

Ron, I believe that Symantec will continue to be a leading force in the software
industry and I sincerely hope that you will accept this offer and join us in
building the future. I know that you would be a great addition to the team!

Sincerely,



John W. Thompson
CEO, President, and Chairman of the Board of Directors

Dear Gail,

As per our earlier discussion with John Thompson, here is the promised letter.

eligible for an annual focal review, provided that this base salary may not be

prior to completing one year of service, you will be required to reimburse
Symantec a prorated share of the total hire-on bonus.

Symantec will also rent for you a furnished apartment within driving distance of
the Cupertino offices. This apartment will be of the same standard as was rented
for John Thompson when he relocated to the area, and will be provided to you
throughout the term of your employment. Symantec will also pay reasonable moving
expenses that you incur as a result of moving to this apartment.

Symantec will also lease for you a new automobile, of up to $75,000 in value, on

amount specified above is conditioned upon your signing and returning a release
