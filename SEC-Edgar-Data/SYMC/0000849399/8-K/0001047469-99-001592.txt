Item 5:     OTHER EVENTS

     On January 6, 1999, the Registrant received a comment letter from the 
Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to its Form 10-K for the 
fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 
2, 1998.  The comment letter included questions related to accounting for 
certain acquisitions, including questions relating to the write-off of 
associated in-process research and development costs.  The Registrant is in 
the process of re-evaluating these transactions and the related in-process 
research and development costs as well as the other questions raised in the 
comment letter.  As a result, final operating results for the quarters ended 
July 3, 1998, October 2, 1998 and January 1, 1999 and the related 
year-to-date amounts may be subject to change.
