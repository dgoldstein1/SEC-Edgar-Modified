Directors Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Directors Plan").  During fiscal 1995,
Mr. Boesenberg, who was an executive officer of Symantec until December 31,
1994, and continues to provide consulting services to Symantec, was granted
an incentive stock option to purchase 9,302 shares of Symantec's Common Stock
at an exercise price of $10.75 and non-qualified stock options to purchase an
aggregate of 54,698 shares of Symantec's Common Stock at a weighted average
exercise price of $12.99 under Symantec's 1988 Employees Stock Option Plan,

options for 11,250 shares of Symantec's Common Stock to each continuing
non-employee director other than the Chairman, and 20,000 shares of
Symantec's Common Stock to the Chairman.  Effective in September 1994, the
1993 Directors Plan was amended to reduce the initial grant to new directors
from 30,000 to 16,000 shares, to reduce the annual grant for continuing
non-employee directors other than the Chairman from 11,250 to 6,000 shares,
and to reduce the total number of shares authorized for issuance from 600,000
to 450,000 shares.  The annual grant to the Chairman remains as 20,000 shares.

COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION 16(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires Symantec's directors and officers,
and persons who own more that 10% of Symantec's Common Stock to file initial
reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC and the
Nasdaq National Market.  Such persons are required by SEC regulation to
furnish Symantec with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.

Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms furnished to Symantec
and written representation from the executive officers and directors,
Symantec believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met in
fiscal 1995.

OPTION GRANTS IN FISCAL 1995

The following table sets forth further information regarding individual
grants of options to purchase Symantec's Common Stock during the fiscal year
ended March 31, 1995 to each of the executive officers named in the Summary
Compensation Table above. All grants were made pursuant to Symantec's 1988
Employees Stock Option Plan.  In accordance with the rules of the SEC, the
table sets forth the hypothetical gains or "option spreads" that would exist
for the options at the end of their respective ten-year terms based on
assumed annualized rates of compound stock price appreciation of 5% and 10%
from the dates the options were granted to the end of the respective option
terms.  Actual gains, if any, on option exercises are dependent on the future
performance of Symantec's Common Stock and overall market conditions.  There
can be no assurances that the potential realizable values shown in this table
will be achieved.

     over the succeeding three years.  Options lapse after ten years or, if
     earlier, 90 days after termination of employment.

(2)  Symantec granted options on a a total of 2,969,966 shares to employees
     and consultants in fiscal 1995.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

In March 1989, Symantec sold 45,000 shares of Symantec Common Stock to Gordon
E. Eubanks, Jr., at a per share price of $2.67. Mr. Eubanks paid for the
shares with a $120,000, 9% promissory note payable in four years.  On
March 23, 1993, the promissory note representing this indebtedness became
due and was replaced with a new nine-year promissory note, bearing interest
at 6%.  So as long as Mr. Eubanks remains employed by Symantec, accrued
interest on the note will be forgiven annually and Symantec will pay
Mr. Eubanks the amount of his tax liability on such forgiveness.  As of
March 31, 1995, the outstanding principal balance on this note was $120,000.

In August 1989, Symantec entered into a Housing Assistance Agreement with
John C. Laing, whereby Symantec agreed to pay Mr. Laing $2,194 per month
towards the mortgage on his residence until July 1, 1996, unless certain
events occur, including the sale of the residence or Mr. Laing's termination
of employment with Symantec.  If the residence is sold, Mr. Laing must pay
Symantec approximately 20% of any gain on such sale, and, if the residence is
not sold by July 1, 1996, Mr. Laing must pay Symantec approximately 20% of
any appreciation in the value of the residence as of that date.

In connection with the merger of Peter Norton Computing, Inc. with and into
Symantec, (the "Norton Merger"), Symantec and Peter Norton, who was a member
of the Board until September 1994, entered into a Publicity Agreement
pursuant to which Mr. Norton has granted to Symantec a perpetual, exclusive
license to use his name and image for computer software products for a
royalty equal to the greater of 1% of net sales of products bearing Mr.
Norton's name or 0.4% of the suggested retail price of such products.  Mr.
Norton also has agreed to make himself available until August 31, 1995 for
certain personal appearances, press conferences and other public appearances.
 Mr. Norton may terminate the agreement if Symantec fails to pay Mr. Norton
an average of at least $30,000 of royalties in any three consecutive years.
For the fiscal years ended April 2, 1993, April 1, 1994 and March 31, 1995
the amount of these royalties payable to Mr. Norton was approximately $1.4
million, $1.6 million and 1.9 million, respectively.

As a condition of the Norton Merger, Symantec amended its present
Registration Rights Agreement, to include Mr. Norton as a holder
(collectively, the "Holders"), thereby extending to Mr. Norton certain rights
to register the shares of Symantec Common Stock received in the Norton Merger
under the Securities Act.  The Registration Rights Agreement entitles the
Holders, whenever Symantec proposes to register any of its securities under
the Securities Act, either for its own account or the accounts of its
security holders, to notice of such registration and to include shares of
such Common Stock therein, subject to certain conditions and limitations.
The Holders of a majority of the shares with registration rights may require
Symantec, on not more than two occasions with respect to registration on
forms other than Form S-3 (Mr. Norton being only allowed to make one such
demand) and on an unlimited number of occasions with respect to registrations
on Form S-3, to register all or a part of their registrable shares under the
Securities Act, and Symantec is required to use its best efforts to effect
such registration, subject to certain conditions and limitations.  Generally,
Symantec is required to bear the expense of all such registrations (other
than those on Form S-3) except for underwriting discounts and commissions.
The foregoing registration rights under the amended Registration Rights
Agreement will terminate on January 1, 2000.  Accordingly, Mr. Norton has the
right to cause Symantec to use its best efforts to register some or all of
his shares for resale.

Symantec has adopted provisions in its certificate of incorporation and
by-laws that limit the liability of its directors and provide for
indemnification of its officers and directors to the full extent permitted
under Delaware law.  Under Symantec's Certificate of Incorporation, and as
permitted under the DGCL, directors are not liable to Symantec or its
stockholders for monetary damages arising from a breach of their fiduciary
duty of care as directors, including such conduct during a merger or tender
offer.  In addition, Symantec has entered into separate indemnification
agreements with its directors and officers that could require Symantec, among
other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by
reason of their status or service as directors or officers.  Such provisions
do not, however, affect liability for any breach of a director's duty of
loyalty to Symantec or its stockholders, liability for acts or omissions not
in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violations of
law, liability for transactions in which the director derived an improper

from the necessity of complying with, federal or state securities laws or

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS, TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
 ARRANGEMENTS

In December 1991, Symantec entered into agreements with each of Robert R.B.
Dykes, its Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations and Chief Financial
Officer, and John C. Laing, its Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales
providing for certain benefits to such executives in the event their
employment is terminated without cause within one year after the occurrence
of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction that results in a change in
control of Symantec.  "Change of control" includes (a) any consolidation or
merger of Symantec with or into any other corporation or corporations in
which the stockholders of Symantec immediately prior to the consolidation or
merger do not retain a majority of the voting power of the surviving
corporation, (b) a change in the majority of the Board resulting from any
cash tender offer, exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sale
of assets or contested election, or combination of the foregoing, or any sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of Symantec.  If, within one year
after a change in control, Messrs. Dykes' or Laing's employment is terminated
other than for cause or disability, Messrs. Dykes and/or Laing, as the case
may be, would be entitled to receive severance pay equal to his base salary
as of the date of such termination in accordance with Symantec's normal
payroll practices for a period of one year, to have all unvested stock
options become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with their terms
notwithstanding any vesting schedule in such options to the contrary, and to
have benefits provided to him as of the date of such termination under
Symantec's health, dental, life, disability and other benefit plans continued
for a period of one year.  In addition, if any such payments would be subject
to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the U.S. Code, Messrs. Dykes and Laing
would be entitled to receive additional amounts such that the net amount of
the payments and benefits, after deduction of taxes, would be equal to the
total aggregate original amount of the payments and benefits payable.

On June 1, 1994, Symantec entered into an Employment and Consulting Agreement
with Charles M. Boesenberg (the "Employment Agreement") in connection with
the acquisition by Symantec of Central Point, which was subsequently amended
in December 1994. The Employment Agreement, as amended, provided for an
employment period which began June 1, 1994 and continued to December 31, 1994
(the "Initial Employment Period"), and a period during which Mr. Boesenberg
would act as a consultant to Symantec, beginning with the termination of his
employment and continuing until January 1, 1996 (the "Consulting Period").
Mr. Boesenberg's base compensation during the Initial Employment Period was
$235,000 per year; the base compensation during the Consulting Period is
$360,000 per year.  Mr. Boesenberg's compensation for the Consulting Period
reflects compensation that would otherwise have been payable to Mr.
Boesenberg under a pre-existing agreement with Central Point Software, Inc.
due to the change in control of Central Point that was effected by Symantec's
acquisition of Central Point.  Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Boesenberg
waived all rights to receive compensation under that pre-existing agreement.
In addition to base compensation, the Employment Agreement provided for Mr.
Boesenberg to receive bonuses in the Initial Employment Period based on
targets of $31,250 per quarter, and adjusted upward or downward based on a
formula relating to the revenue and expenses of Symantec's Central Point
business unit.  The Employment Agreement provided for an additional bonus of
either $25,000 or $100,000 if Symantec's Central Point business unit fully
met its revenue goals for at least three quarters during the Initial
Employment Period. Bonuses paid under the Employment Agreement were in lieu
of bonuses that Mr. Boesenberg would otherwise have been eligible for under
Symantec's management bonus plan.  Mr. Boesenberg also received an option to
purchase 50,000 shares of Symantec Common Stock, with an exercise price based
on the fair market value on the date of grant, which vested as to 33,333
shares based upon the attainment of certain financial goals in each of the
quarters ending September 30, 1994 and December 30, 1994.  The Employment
Agreement also provided that each outstanding option previously granted to
Mr. Boesenberg by Central Point was immediately exercisable for an additional
number of shares equal to that number of shares for which each such option
would have become exercisable during the two years after the date of the
acquisition.  Mr. Boesenberg also received an option to purchase 16,000
shares of Symantec Common Stock in January 1995 under the CompanyOs 1988
Employees Stock Option Plan, and an option to purchase 14,000 shares of
Symantec Common Stock under Symantec's 1993 Directors Stock Option Plan.
Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Boesenberg was also reimbursed for
relocation expenses of approximately $134,000 incurred in moving from the
Portland, Oregon area to Saratoga, California, and allowed to keep certain
office equipment used by him.  This reimbursement was in lieu of a comparable
reimbursement that would have been provided pursuant to the pre-existing
agreement referred to

                                     13

above.  The Employment Agreement also provides that Mr. Boesenberg may not
compete, directly or indirectly, with Symantec in the area of computer
utility software for a period of four years.
