(1)  The consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended March

                              BROADCOM CORPORATION

         NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                 MARCH 31, 2000

1. Basis of Presentation

         The condensed financial statements included herein are unaudited;
however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments which, in
the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the consolidated
financial position of Broadcom Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Company") at March 31, 2000 and the consolidated results of its operations
and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 1999. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. It should be
understood that accounting measurements at interim dates inherently involve
greater reliance on estimates than at year-end. The results of operations for
the three months ended March 31, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.

         The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include footnotes and certain financial presentations normally required
under generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, these financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 1999, included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") on March 30, 2000.

2. Business Combinations

Pooling-of-Interests Transactions

         On February 29 and March 1, 2000 the Company completed the acquisitions
of Digital Furnace Corporation (Digital Furnace), BlueSteel Networks, Inc.
(BlueSteel), and Stellar Semiconductor, Inc. (Stellar). Digital Furnace develops
communications algorithms and software that increase the capacity of existing
broadband networks for interactive services, BlueSteel develops high-performance
Internet security processors for e-commerce and VPN (Virtual Private Network)
applications, and Stellar develops 3D graphics technology.

    The Company issued in aggregate 2,015,307 shares of its Class B common stock
in exchange for all shares of the acquired companies' preferred stock and common
stock and reserved an additional 330,294 shares of its Class B common stock for
issuance upon exercise of employee stock options and other rights assumed by the
Company.

         Each of the three acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, the Company's consolidated financial statements have
been restated to include the pooled operations of Digital Furnace, BlueSteel and
Stellar as if they had combined with the Company at the beginning of the first
period presented. The restated consolidated financial statements also include
the pooled operations of the Company's prior acquisitions.

         None of the three acquired companies had revenue in the three months
ended March 31, 2000 and 1999. Included in net income for the three months ended
March 31, 2000 were net losses of $3.2 million from Digital Furnace, BlueSteel
and Stellar incurred prior to February 29 and March 1, 2000.

Merger-Related Costs

         In connection with the acquisitions of Digital Furnace, BlueSteel and
Stellar, the Company recorded approximately $2.9 million in charges in the three
months ended March 31, 2000 for direct and other merger-related costs and
certain restructuring programs.

         Merger transaction costs of approximately $2.1 million consisted
primarily of fees of attorneys, accountants and other related charges.
Restructuring costs of approximately $0.8 million included the disposal of
assets and adjustments to conform the accounting policies of Digital Furnace,
BlueSteel and Stellar to those of the Company.

6. Shareholders' Equity

         On February 11, 2000 the Company effected a two-for-one stock split of
its Class A common stock and Class B common stock in the form of a 100% stock
dividend. All share numbers and per share amounts contained in these notes and
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively
restated to reflect this change in the Company's capital structure.

7. Litigation

         In July 1997 the Company commenced an action against Sarnoff
Corporation and Sarnoff Digital Communications, Inc., now known as NxtWave
Communications, Inc. (collectively, "Sarnoff") in the California Superior Court
alleging breach of contract, fraud, misappropriation of trade secrets, false
advertising, trade libel, intentional interference with prospective economic
advantage and unfair competition. The claims center on Sarnoff's violation of a
non-disclosure agreement entered into with the Company with respect to limited
use of certain of the Company's technology and on inaccurate comparisons that
the Company believes Sarnoff has made in its product advertising and in
statements to potential customers and others. This action was removed to the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, and was
stayed pending resolution of an action Sarnoff had brought against the Company
in April 1997 in New Jersey Superior Court. Following the decision in the New
Jersey action in the Company's favor in early 1999, Sarnoff filed a motion for
summary judgment in the California case on the basis that the issues therein had
been or should have been previously litigated in the New Jersey action under the
New Jersey "entire controversy" doctrine. Following oral argument in August
1999, the District Court granted Sarnoff's motion and dismissed the Company's
claims on the grounds that they should have been brought as part of the New
Jersey action. The Company believes that the California action involves facts,
circumstances and claims unrelated to those at issue in the New Jersey action,
and has filed an appeal of the District Court's ruling. The Company filed its
opening brief in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2000. On May 8,
2000, Sarnoff filed its opposing brief, and the Company will submit its reply
brief shortly.

         In March 2000 Intel Corporation and its subsidiary Level One
Communications, Inc. (collectively, "Intel") filed a complaint in California
Superior Court asserting claims against the Company for misappropriation of
trade secrets, unfair competition, and tortious interference with existing
contractual relations by the Company in connection with its recent hiring of
three former Intel employees. The complaint sought injunctive relief, an
accounting, damages, exemplary damages and attorneys' fees. Intel filed a first
amended complaint on April 28, 2000 seeking additional relief and containing
certain additional allegations, but asserting the same causes of action as the
original complaint. The litigation is in its early stages. A preliminary
injunction hearing in the matter is expected to conclude on or about May 24,
2000. The Company has denied any wrongdoing or liability and has instructed its
attorneys to vigorously defend the action.

         In September 1998 Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") filed a complaint in
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against AltoCom,
Inc. ("AltoCom") (and co-defendant, PC-Tel, Inc.), asserting that (i) AltoCom's
V.34 and V.90 compliant software modem technology infringes several patents
owned by Motorola, (ii) AltoCom induces its V.34 and V.90 licensees to infringe
such patents, and (iii) AltoCom contributorily infringes such patents. The
complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against AltoCom as well
as the recovery of monetary damages, including treble damages for willful
infringement. In October 1998 Motorola affirmatively dismissed its case in the
District of Massachusetts and filed a substantially similar complaint in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware. AltoCom has filed an
answer and affirmative defenses to the District of Delaware complaint. AltoCom
has also asserted a counterclaim requesting declaratory relief that AltoCom has
not infringed the Motorola patents and that such patents are invalid and/or
unenforceable as well as a counterclaim requesting declaratory and injunctive
relief based on breach of contract theory. AltoCom believes that it has strong
defenses to Motorola's claims on invalidity, noninfringement and inequitable
conduct grounds. In May 2000 Motorola filed an amended complaint alleging that
AltoCom's technology infringes an additional Motorola patent. The parties are
currently engaged in discovery in the action. A hearing on patent claims
construction is scheduled to commence in December 2000 and a three-week trial is
scheduled to begin in June 2001. AltoCom became a subsidiary of the Company on
August 31, 1999. In September 1999 PC-Tel, Inc., the co-defendant in the case,
reached a settlement with Motorola.

         Although AltoCom believes that it has strong defenses and is defending
the action vigorously, a finding of infringement by AltoCom as to at least one
of the patents in this action could lead to liability for monetary damages
(which could be trebled in the event that the infringement were found to have
been willful), the issuance of an injunction requiring that AltoCom withdraw
various products from the market, and indemnification claims by AltoCom's
customers or strategic partners, each of which events could have a material
adverse effect on AltoCom's, and possibly the Company's, business, results of
operations and financial condition.

         The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in other legal
proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

         The pending lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and law and
could require the expenditure of significant costs and diversion of resources to
defend. Although management currently believes the outcome of outstanding legal
proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's business,


                                       8

results of operations or financial condition, the results of litigation are
inherently uncertain, and an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible.
The Company is unable to estimate the range of possible loss from outstanding
litigation, and no amounts have been provided for such matters in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

8. Subsequent Event

         In April 2000 the Shareholders approved an increase in the number of
authorized shares of Class A common stock from 400,000,000 to 800,000,000 and in
the number of authorized shares of Class B common stock from 200,000,000 to
400,000,000, and approved an amendment to the Company's 1998 Stock Incentive
Plan, as amended, to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock
reserved for issuance under the plan by 15,000,000 shares.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT

         You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction
with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto contained
elsewhere in this Report. The information in this Report is not a complete
description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in our
common stock. We urge you to carefully review and consider the various
disclosures made by us in this Report and in our other reports filed with the
SEC, including our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999 and our reports on Forms 10-Q and
8-K, that discuss our business in greater details.

         The section entitled "Risk Factors" set forth in this Form 10-Q and
similar discussions in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1999, in our recent Current Reports on Form 8-K, and in our other
SEC filings, discuss some of the important risk factors that may affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully
consider those risks, in addition to the other information in this Report and in
our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our company or to
maintain or increase your investment.

         This Report contains forward-looking statements which include, but are
not limited to, statements concerning projected revenues, expenses, gross profit
and income, the need for additional capital, Year 2000 compliance, market
acceptance of our products, our ability to consummate acquisitions and integrate
their operations successfully, our ability to achieve further product
integration, the status of evolving technologies and their growth potential, our
production capacity, our ability to migrate to smaller process geometries, and
the success of pending litigation. These forward-looking statements are based on
our current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry,
management's beliefs, and certain assumptions made by us. Words such as
"anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates,"
"may," "will" and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer
to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or
circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various
factors.  We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any
forward-looking statements for any reason.

         In this Report, all share numbers and per share amounts have been
retroactively adjusted to reflect our 2-for-1 stock splits, each in the form of
a 100% stock dividend, effective February 17, 1999 and February 11, 2000,
respectively.

OVERVIEW

         We are the leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that
enable broadband digital transmission of voice, video and data to and throughout
the home and within the business enterprise. These integrated circuits permit
the cost-effective delivery of high-speed, high-bandwidth networking using
existing communications infrastructures that were not originally designed for
the transmission of broadband digital content. Using proprietary technologies
and advanced design methodologies, we design, develop and supply integrated


                                       10
<PAGE>   13
circuits for a number of the most significant broadband communications markets,
including the markets for digital cable set-top boxes, cable modems, high-speed
office networks, home networking, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),
residential broadband gateways, direct broadcast satellite and terrestrial
digital broadcast, and digital subscriber line (xDSL). From our inception in
1991 through 1994, we were primarily engaged in product development and the
establishment of strategic customer and foundry relationships. During that
period, we generated the majority of our revenue from development work performed
for key customers. We began shipping our products in 1994, and subsequently our
revenue has grown predominately through sales of our semiconductor products. We
intend to continue to enter into development contracts with key customers, but
expect that development revenue will constitute a decreasing percentage of our
total revenue. We also generate a small percentage of our product revenue from
sales of software and software support and sales of system-level reference
designs.

         We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment. Provision is
concurrently made for estimated product returns, which historically have been
immaterial. Our products typically carry a one-year warranty. We recognize
development revenue when earned. Revenue from licensed software is recognized at
the time of shipment, provided that we have vendor-specific objective evidence
of the fair value of each element of the software offering. Revenue from
post-contract customer support and any other future deliverables is deferred and
earned over the support period or as contract elements are delivered.

         From time to time, our key customers have placed large orders causing
our quarterly revenue to fluctuate significantly. We expect these fluctuations
will continue in the future. Sales to our five largest customers, including
sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors, decreased to
approximately 64.6% of our revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2000, as
compared to 81.6% in the three months ended March 31, 1999. We expect that our
key customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue
for 2000 and in the future.

         Our gross margin has been affected in the past, and may continue to be
affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the
following:

         o  our product mix;

         o  the position of our products in their respective life cycles;

         o  competitive pricing strategies;

         o  the mix of product revenue and development revenue; and

         o  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies.

         For example, newly-introduced products generally have higher average
selling prices and gross margins, both of which typically decline over product
life cycles due to competitive pressures and volume pricing agreements. Our
gross margin and operating results in the future may continue to fluctuate as a
result of these and other factors.

         The sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range
from three to six months or more, with an additional three to six months or more
before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our
products. Due to these


                                       11
<PAGE>   14
lengthy sales cycles, we may experience a significant delay between increasing
expenses for research and development and selling, general and administrative
efforts, and the generation of corresponding revenue, if any. Furthermore,
during 2000 and thereafter, we intend to continue to increase our investment in
research and development, selling, general and administrative functions and
inventory as we expand our operations through indigenous growth and
acquisitions. We anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly
from month to month. Consequently, if anticipated sales and shipments in any
quarter do not occur when expected, expenses and inventory levels could be
disproportionately high, and our operating results for that quarter and,
potentially for future quarters, would be materially and adversely affected.

(1)  Restated to give retroactive effect to acquisitions accounted for using the
     pooling-of-interests method.

         Effects of Pooling-of-Interests Transactions. On February 29 and March
1, 2000 we completed the acquisitions of Digital Furnace Corporation, BlueSteel
Networks, Inc., and Stellar Semiconductor, Inc. (collectively, the "Acquired
Companies"). Each of the acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, our historical consolidated financial statements and the
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for
prior periods have been restated to include the pooled operations of these three
companies as if they had combined with our company at the beginning of the first
period presented. The restated historical consolidated financial statements also
include the pooled operations of our prior acquisitions. Each of the Acquired
Companies was in the development stage, and none had material revenue in 1999 or
in the three months ended March 31, 2000. Included in net income for the three
months ended March 31, 1999 were net losses of $0.8 million from the Acquired
Companies. Included in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2000 were
net losses of $3.2 million from the Acquired Companies incurred prior to
February 29 and March 1, 2000.


                                       12
<PAGE>   15

         Revenue. Revenue consists of product revenue generated principally by
sales of our semiconductor products, and to a lesser extent, from sales of
software and software support and development revenue generated under
development contracts with our customers. Revenue for the three months ended
March 31, 2000 was $191.3 million, an increase of $91.4 million or 91.4% from
revenue of $100.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 1999. This growth
in revenue resulted mainly from increases in volume shipments of our
semiconductor products for the high-speed networking market, digital cable
set-top boxes and cable modems.

         Gross Profit. Gross profit represents revenue less the cost of revenue.
Cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers
processed by independent foundries, and costs associated with assembly, test and
quality assurance for those products, as well as costs of personnel and
equipment associated with manufacturing support and contracted development work.
Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2000 was $112.4 million or
58.7% of revenue, an increase of $53.2 million as compared with gross profit of
$59.2 million or 59.2% of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 1999. The
increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in
the volume of semiconductor product shipments. The decrease in gross profit as a
percentage of revenue was largely driven by volume-pricing agreements and
competitive pricing strategies on certain high volume products. We expect that
gross profit as a percentage of revenue will continue to decline in future
periods due to higher anticipated silicon wafer costs and as volume-pricing
agreements and competitive pricing strategies continue to take effect. In
addition, our gross profit may be affected by the future introduction of certain
lower margin products.

         Research and Development Expense. Research and development expense
consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in
research, design and development activities, costs related to engineering design
tools, and subcontracting costs. Research and development expense for the three
months ended March 31, 2000 was $42.3 million or 22.1% of revenue, an increase
of $18.9 million or 80.6% as compared with research and development expense of
$23.4 million or 23.4% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 1999. The
increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars was primarily
due to the addition of personnel and the investment in design tools for the
development of new products and the enhancement of existing products. The
decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of revenue
reflected the significant increase in revenue in the three months ended March
30, 2000 as compared to the respective prior year period. We expect that
research and development expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase
for the foreseeable future as a result of indigenous growth and acquisitions.

         Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and
administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses,
professional fees, trade show expenses and facilities expenses. Selling, general
and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2000 was $18.3
million or 9.6% of revenue, an increase of $4.9 million or 36.2% as compared
with selling, general and administrative expense of $13.5 million or 13.5% of
revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2000. The increase in absolute
dollars


                                       13
<PAGE>   16
reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and
marketing personnel, senior management and administrative personnel, and
increased occupancy, legal and other professional fees. The decline in selling,
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue reflected the
significant increase in revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2000 as
compared with the respective prior year period. We expect that selling, general
and administrative expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase for the
foreseeable future to support the planned continued expansion of our operations
through indigenous growth and acquisitions and as a result of periodic changes
in our infrastructure to support increased headcount, acquisition and
integration activities, and international operations.

         Merger-Related Costs. Merger-related costs consist primarily of
transaction costs, such as fees for attorneys, accountants and other related
fees and expenses, and certain restructuring costs related to the disposal of
assets and the write-down of unutilized assets. Merger-related costs of
approximately $2.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2000 were
incurred in connection with the acquisitions of Digital Furnace Corporation,
BlueSteel Networks, Inc., and Stellar Semiconductor, Inc. No comparable
merger-related costs were incurred in the year-earlier period.

         Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net reflects
interest earned on average cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, less
interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Interest and other
income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2000 was $3.4 million, an
increase of $1.7 million as compared with $1.7 million in the three months ended
March 31, 1999. The increase was principally due to higher cash balances
available to invest resulting from cash generated by operations.

         Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the
three months ended March 31, 2000 and 35% for the three months ended March 31,
1999. The primary reasons for the reduction in our effective tax rate for the
three months ended March 31, 2000 as compared with the prior period were
increased research and development tax credits and benefits related to the tax
rate differential on foreign earnings. For the three months ended March 31, 1999
our effective tax rate was increased by our inability to recognize the tax
benefits of net operating losses incurred during that period by two subsidiaries
acquired in May 1999.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         Since our inception, we have financed our operations through a
combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations. At
March 31, 2000 we had $387.6 million in working capital, and $326.1 million in
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. At December 31, 1999 we had
$308.4 million in working capital, $265.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments, and $9.4 million in long-term investments.

         Operating activities provided cash in the amount of $7.3 million and
$22.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 1999 respectively.
This was primarily the result of net income, the non-cash impact of depreciation
and amortization, and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by
increases in accounts receivable, inventory, deferred tax assets, and prepaid
expenses and other assets.


                                       14
<PAGE>   17

         In the three months ended March 31, 2000, our investing activities used
$6.9 million in cash for the purchase of capital equipment to support our
expanding operations and provided $4.7 million in cash from the sale of
held-to-maturity securities. In the three months ended March 31, 1999 our
investing activities used $8.0 million in cash for the purchase of capital
equipment and $15.3 million for the purchase of held-to-maturity investments.

         Cash provided by financing activities was $50.7 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2000, primarily from $27.5 million in tax benefits
related to stock option exercises and $24.3 million in proceeds from the
issuance of common stock, partially offset by $1.3 million in payments on
long-term obligations of acquired companies. Financing activities provided cash
of $18.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 1999, primarily from $7.0
million in tax benefits related to stock option exercises and $13.3 million in
proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by $1.9 million in
payments on long-term obligations of acquired companies.

         We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments on
hand, together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations, will be
sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months.
However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our
activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other
businesses, products or technologies. We could raise such funds by selling more
stock to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money. In
addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to
sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons.
We may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable
to our shareholders and us, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing
additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of
existing shareholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt
securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to
those of the holders of our common stock.

         We had commitments totaling approximately $4.6 million as of March 31,
2000 primarily for the purchase of engineering design tools, computer hardware
and information systems infrastructure. During 1999 we spent $32.4 million on
capital equipment to support our expanding operations. We expect that we will
spend more than that amount during 2000 to purchase additional engineering
design tools, computer hardware, test equipment, information systems and
leasehold improvements, as our operations continue to expand and as we integrate
and upgrade the capital equipment and facilities of acquired companies. We may
finance these purchases from our cash and cash equivalents and investments on
hand, cash generated from our operations, borrowings, equity offerings, or a
combination thereof.

         Although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities
for at least the next twelve months, our future capital requirements may vary
materially from those now planned. The amount of capital that we will need in
the future will depend on many factors, including:

         o  the market acceptance of our products;

         o  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to
            launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive
            position in the marketplace;

         o  volume price discounts;

         o  our business, product, capital expenditure and research and
            development plans and product and technology roadmaps;


                                       15
<PAGE>   18
         o  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain;

         o  capital improvements to new and existing facilities;

         o  technological advances;

         o  our competitors' response to our products; and

         o  our relationships with suppliers and customers.

         In addition, we may require additional capital to accommodate planned
growth, hiring, infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions
of other businesses, products or technologies.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

         To date we have not experienced any known material Year 2000 problems
in our products, our internal systems or facilities, or the products, systems
and services of third parties. We will continue to monitor our mission critical
computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year
2000 to ensure that any latent Year 2000 matters that may arise are addressed
promptly. We did not incur material costs to identify and address specific Year
2000 compliance issues. We could however incur additional costs in addressing
any residual Year 2000 issues, which could have a material and adverse effect on
our business.

RISK FACTORS

         BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMPANY OR TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE
YOUR INVESTMENT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW, IN
ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR OTHER
FILINGS WITH THE SEC, INCLUDING OUR SUBSEQUENT REPORTS ON FORMS 10-Q AND 8-K.
THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING OUR
COMPANY. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE
CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF
THESE RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THAT EVENT, THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR
CLASS A COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR
INVESTMENT.

OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. AS A RESULT, WE MAY
FAIL TO MEET OR EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS,
WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.

         Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated
significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due
to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our
operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or
may be due to a number of factors, including the following:

         o  the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume
            sales;

         o  the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer
            orders;

         o  the gain or loss of a key customer;


                                       16
<PAGE>   19

         o  the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products
            and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of
            our products;

         o  silicon wafer pricing and the availability of foundry and assembly
            capacity and raw materials;

         o  our ability to specify, develop or acquire, complete, introduce,
            market and transition to volume production new products and
            technologies in a timely manner;

         o  the timing of customer-industry qualification and certification of
            our products and the risks of non-qualification or
            non-certification;

         o  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users
            adopt Broadcom technologies in our target markets;

         o  the rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards in our
            target markets;

         o  the effects of new and emerging technologies;

         o  intellectual property disputes and customer indemnification claims;

         o  the risks inherent in our acquisitions of technologies and
            businesses, including the timing and successful completion of
            technology and product development through volume production,
            integration issues, costs and unanticipated expenditures, changing
            relationships with customers, suppliers and strategic partners,
            potential contractual, intellectual property or employment issues,
            accounting treatment and charges, and the risks that the acquisition
            cannot be completed successfully or that anticipated benefits are
            not realized;

         o  the effectiveness of our product cost reduction efforts;

         o  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our semiconductor
            foundries and other problems or delays in the fabrication, assembly,
            testing or delivery of our products;

         o  the risks of producing products with new suppliers and at new
            fabrication and assembly facilities;

         o  the risks and uncertainties associated with our international
            operations;

         o  problems or delays that we may face in shifting our products to
            smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels
            of design integration;

         o  our ability to retain and hire key executives, technical personnel
            and other employees in the numbers, with the capabilities, and at
            the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and
            product plans;

         o  changes in our product or customer mix;

         o  the quality of our products and any remediation costs;

         o  the effects of natural disasters and other events beyond our
            control;

         o  the level of orders received that we can ship in a fiscal
            quarter;

         o  potential business disruptions, claims, expenses and other
            difficulties resulting from residual "Year 2000" problems in
            computer-based systems used by us, our suppliers or our customers;

         o  economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the
            broadband communications markets; and

         o  general economic and market conditions.

         We intend to continue to increase our operating expenses in 2000 and in
the future. A large portion of our operating expenses, including rent, salaries
and capital lease expenditures, is fixed and difficult to reduce or change.
Accordingly, if our total revenue does not meet our expectations, we probably
would not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the
shortfall in revenue. In that event, our business, financial condition and
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.

         Due to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in
this report, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our
operating results as an indication of future performance.

BECAUSE WE DEPEND ON A FEW SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF
OUR REVENUES, THE LOSS OF A KEY CUSTOMER COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. IN
ADDITION, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO SELL EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCTS TO OUR
KEY CUSTOMERS IN SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OR TO ATTRACT NEW SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS,
OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

         We have derived a substantial portion of our revenues in the past from
sales to a relatively small number of customers. As a result, the loss of any
significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. Sales to General Instrument (which was
acquired by Motorola in January 2000), 3Com, and Cisco including sales to their
respective manufacturing subcontractors, accounted for approximately 24.2%,
18.5% and 11.6%, respectively, of our revenue in the three months ended March
31, 2000. Sales to our five largest customers, including sales to their
respective manufacturing subcontractors, decreased to approximately 64.6% of our
revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2000 as compared to 81.6% in the
three months ended March 31, 1999. We expect that our key customers will
continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for 2000 and in
the future. Accordingly, our future operating results will continue to depend on
the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new
products to these customers in significant quantities.

         We may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key
customers for a variety of reasons, including the following:

         o  Most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their
            own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no
            penalty.

         o  Our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to
            purchase a minimum amount of our products.

         o  Many of our customers have pre-existing relationships with our
            current or potential competitors that may affect their decision to
            purchase our products.

         o  Our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that
            do not use our products.

         o  Some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with
            our products.

         o  Our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may
            also deter other potential customers who compete with these
            customers from buying our products.


                                       18
<PAGE>   21

         In addition, in order to attract new customers or retain existing
customers, we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products. If
these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers, we would
have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have
contractual "most favored nation" pricing arrangements. In that event, our
average selling prices and gross margins would decline. The loss of a key
customer, a reduction in our sales to any key customer or our inability to
attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS AND
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE IN EXISTING MARKETS
AND AFFECT OUR ENTRY INTO NEW MARKETS.

         The broadband communications markets and semiconductor industry are
intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase in the
future as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter
our target markets. We currently compete with a number of major domestic and
international suppliers of integrated circuits in the markets for digital cable
set-top boxes, cable modems, high-speed office networks, home networking, Voice
over Internet Protocol (VoIP), residential broadband gateways, direct broadcast
satellite and terrestrial digital satellite, and digital subscriber lines. This
competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling
prices for our products. In all of our target markets, we also may face
competition from newly established competitors and suppliers of products based
on new or emerging technologies. We also expect to encounter further
consolidation in the markets in which we compete.

         Many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and
have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name
recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales
and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than
we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new
or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be
able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. In
addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish
financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or
potential customers, resellers or other third parties. Accordingly, it is
possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and
rapidly acquire significant market share. Existing or new competitors may also
develop technologies in the future that more effectively address the
transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures or
through new digital infrastructures at lower costs than our technologies.
Increased competition has in the past and is likely to continue to result in
price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that
competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY MAY REQUIRE US TO UNDERTAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL
INFUSIONS, BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS, AND RESULT IN DIFFICULTIES
IN ASSIMILATING AND INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS, PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGIES,
PRODUCTS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES.

         A key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the
acquisition of businesses, products or technologies that allow us to complement
our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our
engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. Since January
1999 we have acquired Maverick Networks, Epigram, Inc., Armedia, Inc., HotHaus
Technologies Inc., AltoCom, Inc., Digital Furnace Corporation, BlueSteel
Networks, Inc. and Stellar Semiconductor, Inc. We plan to continue to pursue
acquisition opportunities in 2000 and in the future. Acquisitions may require
significant capital infusions, typically entail many risks and could result in
difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel,
technologies, products and information systems of the acquired company. We may
also encounter delays in the timing and successful completion of the acquired
company's technology and product development through volume production, costs
and unanticipated expenditures, changing relationships with customers, suppliers
and strategic partners, or contractual, intellectual property or employment
issues. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to
work for us. The acquisition of another company or its products and technologies
may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we
have little or no prior experience. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing
business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In
addition, acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of
operations because they may require large one-time write-offs, increased debt or
contingent liabilities, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation
charges or the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible
assets. We may seek to account for acquisitions under the pooling-of-interests
accounting method, but that method may not be available. Any of these events
could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. Furthermore, if we
issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition,
as in the case of our recent acquisitions, the issuance may be dilutive to our
existing shareholders. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we may
issue could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the
holders of our common stock. Thus, for example, as a consequence of the
pooling-of-interest rules, the securities issued in each of the eight
acquisitions described above were Class B common stock, which has voting rights
superior to our publicly-traded Class A common stock.

         We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or
future acquisitions or that we will realize the benefits anticipated from these
acquisitions. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable
acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations. Even if
we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to consummate
the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms. Moreover, due to our limited
acquisition experience, it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate any
acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel, which could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

WE MUST KEEP PACE WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY
AND BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.

         Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt
to changes in technology and industry standards. We will also need to continue
to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers'
changing demands. Substantially all of our product revenue in recent fiscal
quarters has been derived from sales of products for the high-speed office
network, digital cable set-top box and cable modem markets. These markets are
characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards,
frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles. In addition,
these markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation. A significant
slowdown in any of these markets or other broadband communications markets could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to
develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband
communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully.
The broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent
or in the timeframes that we anticipate. If new markets do not develop as we
anticipate, or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these
markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

IF WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT TO EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS IN THE
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS, OUR PRODUCTS COULD
BECOME OBSOLETE AND WE COULD LOSE MARKET SHARE.

         Products for broadband communications applications generally are based
on industry standards that are continually evolving. If new industry standards
emerge, our products or our customers' products could become unmarketable or
obsolete. We may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply
with these new standards. Our past sales and profitability have resulted, to a
large extent, from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry
standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our ability to
adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards, and the rate of
adoption and acceptance of those standards, will be a significant factor in
maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth. We
have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that
did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected. Our inability to
anticipate the evolving standards in the semiconductor industry and, in
particular the broadband communications markets, or to develop and introduce new
products successfully into these markets could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY AND IN A
COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY MANNER OR TO ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW
PRODUCTS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

         Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new silicon
solutions for existing and new markets, introduce these products in a
cost-effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to
select these products for design into their own


                                       21
<PAGE>   24

new products. Our quarterly results in the past have been, and are expected in
the future to continue to be, dependent on the introduction of a relatively
small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those
products to customers. The development of new silicon devices is highly complex,
and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development
and introduction of new products. Our ability to develop and deliver new
products successfully will depend on various factors, including our ability to:

         o  accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry
            standards;

         o  accurately define new products;

         o  timely complete and introduce new product designs;

         o  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of
            our products and our customers' products into which our products
            will be incorporated;

         o  obtain sufficient foundry capacity;

         o  achieve high manufacturing yields; and

         o  gain market acceptance of our products and our customers' products.

         If we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully
and in a cost-effective and timely manner, our business, financial condition and
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.

         Our new products generally are incorporated into our customers'
products at the design stage. We have often incurred significant expenditures on
the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment
manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product. The value
of our products largely depends on the commercial success of our customers'
products and on the extent to which those products accommodate components
manufactured by our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will continue to
achieve design wins. In addition, the equipment that incorporates our products
may never become commercially successful.

WE DEPEND ON TWO INDEPENDENT FOUNDRIES TO MANUFACTURE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR
CURRENT PRODUCTS, AND ANY FAILURE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FOUNDRY CAPACITY COULD
MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

         We do not own or operate a fabrication facility. Two outside foundries,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, in Taiwan and Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing, or Chartered, in Singapore, currently manufacture
substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production. In
September 1999 TSMC's principal facility was affected by a significant
earthquake in Taiwan. As a consequence of this earthquake, TSMC suffered power
outages and equipment damage that impaired TSMC's wafer deliveries and, together
with strong demand, could result in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing
industrywide.

                                       22


<PAGE>   25

         Because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity, we face
several significant risks, including:

         o  a lack of ensured wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and
            higher wafer prices;

         o  limited control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and
            control, manufacturing yields and production costs; and

         o  the unavailability of or potential delays in obtaining access to key
            process technologies.

         In addition, the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex
and technologically demanding process. Although we work closely with our
foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, our
foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated
manufacturing yields. This often occurs during the production of new products or
the installation and start-up of new process technologies.

         The ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is
limited by its available capacity. Although we have entered into contractual
commitments to supply specified levels of products to certain of our customers,
we do not have a long-term volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of
production capacity with either TSMC or Chartered. Foundry capacity may not be
available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Availability of foundry
capacity has recently been reduced due to strong demand. We place our orders on
the basis of our customers' purchase orders, and TSMC and Chartered can allocate
capacity to the production of other companies' products and reduce deliveries to
us on short notice. It is possible that foundry customers that are larger and
better financed than we are, or that have long-term agreements with TSMC or
Chartered, may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them. Such a
reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we
need. Although we primarily use two independent foundries, most of our
components are not manufactured at both foundries at any given time and some of
our products may be designed to be manufactured at only one. Accordingly, if one
of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed, we could
experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those
components. Any of these delays would likely materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if either
TSMC or Chartered experiences financial difficulties, if either foundry suffers
any damage to its facilities or in the event of any other disruption of foundry
capacity, we may not be able to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely
manner. Even our current foundries would need to have new manufacturing
processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process. If we
choose to use a new foundry or process, it would typically take us several
months to qualify the new foundry or process before we can begin shipping
products from it. If we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner,
we may still experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected
products. We cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries would
be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields.
Furthermore, our foundries may not be able to deliver enough semiconductor
devices to us on a timely basis, or at reasonable prices.

         Certain of our acquired companies have established relationships with
foundries other than TSMC and


                                       23
<PAGE>   26

Chartered, and we are using these other foundries to produce the initial
products of these acquired companies. We may utilize such foundries for other
products in the future. In using these new foundries, we will be subject to all
of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to TSMC and
Chartered.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY TECHNICAL AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND
ATTRACT ADDITIONAL KEY EMPLOYEES, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

         Our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued
service of our key technical and senior management personnel, in particular, our
co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III,
and our co-founder, Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Technical
Officer, Dr. Henry Samueli. We do not have employment agreements with these
executives or any other key employees that govern the length of their service.
The loss of the services of Dr. Nicholas or Dr. Samueli, or certain other key
employees, would likely materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Our future success also depends on our
ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel,
particularly digital circuit designers, mixed-signal circuit designers and
systems applications engineers. Competition for these employees is intense. Our
inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

OUR INABILITY TO MANAGE OUR SIGNIFICANT RECENT AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE GROWTH
COULD STRAIN OUR MANAGERIAL, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AND COULD
MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

         During the past year, we have continued to significantly increase the
scope of our operations and expand our workforce, growing from 708 employees in
March 31, 1999 to 1,213 employees as of March 31, 2000, including contract and
temporary employees and employees who joined us as the result of acquisitions.
This growth has placed, and our anticipated future growth of operations is
expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel,
systems and resources. We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of
new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls,
including the ongoing improvement of our accounting and other internal
management systems. We also will need to continue to expand, train, manage and
motivate our workforce. All of these endeavors will require substantial
management effort. In the future, we may need to expand our facilities or
relocate some or all of our employees or operations from time to time to support
our growth. These relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our
operations or a diversion of management's attention and resources. If we are
unable to effectively manage expanding operations, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

THE LOSS OF ANY OF THE THREE THIRD-PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS THAT ASSEMBLE AND TEST
SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS COULD DISRUPT OUR SHIPMENTS, HARM OUR
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET SALES.

         Three third-party subcontractors, ASAT Ltd. in Hong Kong, ST Assembly
Test Services, STATS, in Singapore, and Amkor Technology in the Philippines and
South Korea, assemble and test almost all of our current products. Because we
rely on third-party subcontractors to


                                       24
<PAGE>   27

assemble and test our products, we cannot directly control our product delivery
schedules and quality assurance and control. This lack of control has in the
past, and could in the future, result in product shortages or quality assurance
problems that could increase our manufacturing, assembly or testing costs. We do
not have long-term agreements with ASAT, STATS or Amkor. We typically procure
services from these suppliers on a per order basis. If either ASAT, STATS or
Amkor experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, if any
subcontractor suffers any damage to its facilities or in the event of any other
disruption of assembly and testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain
alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner. Due to the amount
of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could
experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find
alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may
encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

         We are continuing to develop relationships with additional third-party
subcontractors to assemble and test our products. In using these new
subcontractors, we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the
foregoing paragraph with respect to ASAT, STATS and Amkor.

AS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS EXPANDS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF LEGAL, BUSINESS AND
ECONOMIC RISKS SPECIFIC TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

         We currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing, assembly
and testing services from suppliers located outside of the United States. In
addition, approximately 19.4% of our revenue in the three months ended March 31,
2000 was derived from sales to independent customers outside the United States.
We also frequently ship products to our domestic customers' international
manufacturing divisions and subcontractors. In 1999 we established an
international distribution center in Singapore and a design center in The
Netherlands. As a result of our acquisition of HotHaus in August 1999, we now
undertake design, development and marketing activities in Canada. Furthermore,
as a result of our acquisition of Armedia in May 1999, we also undertake design
and development activities in India. In the future, we intend to continue to
expand these international business activities and also to open other design and
operational centers abroad. International operations are subject to many
inherent risks, including:

         o  political, social and economic instability;

         o  trade restrictions;

         o  the imposition of governmental controls;

         o  exposure to different legal standards, particularly with respect to
            intellectual property;

         o  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;

         o  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the
            United States and each other country in which we operate;

         o  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

         o  foreign technical standards;

<PAGE>   28
         o  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

         o  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

         o  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities; and

         o  potentially adverse tax consequences.

VARIOUS EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, THE SEASONALITY OF INTERNATIONAL SALES OR
AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD
MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OR REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR CURRENT
BUSINESS PRACTICES SIGNIFICANTLY.

         Various government export regulations apply to the encryption or other
features contained in some of our products. We have applied for and received
several export licenses under these regulations, but we cannot assure you that
we will obtain any licenses for which we have currently applied or any licenses
that we may apply for in the future. If we do not receive the required licenses,
we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at our foreign foundries
or to ship these products to certain customers located outside the United
States. Moreover, the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions
in our primary overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our
products abroad. All of our international sales to date have been denominated in
U.S. dollars. Accordingly, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international
markets. Any one or more of the foregoing factors could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or require us
to modify our current business practices significantly. We anticipate that these
factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our
international business activities.

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN SIGNIFICANT PART ON STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH
CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IF WE CANNOT MAINTAIN THESE RELATIONSHIPS OR IF THESE
CUSTOMERS DEVELOP THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS OR ADOPT A COMPETITOR'S SOLUTIONS INSTEAD
OF BUYING OUR PRODUCTS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

         In the past, we have relied on our strategic relationships with certain
customers who are technology leaders in our target markets. We intend to pursue
and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future. These
relationships often require us to develop new products that typically involve
significant technological challenges. Our partners frequently place considerable
pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules. Accordingly, we may
have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic
relationships, which could detract from or delay our completion of other
important development projects. Delays in development could impair our
relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the
products under development. Moreover, it is possible that our customers may
develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor's solution for products that
they currently buy from us. If that happens, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.


                                       26

WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSITIONING TO SMALLER GEOMETRY PROCESS
TECHNOLOGIES OR IN ACHIEVING HIGHER LEVELS OF DESIGN INTEGRATION AND THAT MAY
RESULT IN REDUCED MANUFACTURING YIELDS, DELAYS IN PRODUCT DELIVERIES AND
INCREASED EXPENSES.

         In order to remain competitive, we expect to transition our products to
increasingly smaller geometries. This transition will require us to redesign
certain products and modify the manufacturing processes for our products. We
continually evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating
to smaller geometry process technologies in order to reduce our costs, and we
have begun shifting certain products from .50 micron to .35 micron, .22 micron
and smaller geometry processes. In the past, we have experienced some
difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new
manufacturing processes. These difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing
yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar
difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to
smaller geometry processes. We are dependent on our relationships with our
foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot
assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition
or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries. If our
foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to
efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller
geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to integrate greater levels
of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property,
into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of
design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at
all.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

         Our success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our
ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent,
copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements
and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is
possible that certain of our competitors or other parties may obtain, use or
disclose our technologies and processes. We currently hold 11 issued United
States patents and have filed over 250 United States patent applications. We
cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued. Even if a new
patent is issued, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect
our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be
challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, any rights granted under
these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. If our patents do
not adequately protect our technology, then our competitors may be able to offer
products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar
technology independently or design around our patents. Moreover, because we have
participated in developing various industry standards, we may be required to
license some of our technology and patents to others, including competitors, who
develop products based on the adopted standards.

         We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees
and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our
technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these
efforts, parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products,
services or technology without our authorization. As a result, our technologies
and processes may be misappropriated, particularly in foreign countries where
laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.

                                       27


<PAGE>   30

         In addition, some of our customers have entered into agreements with us
that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to
fulfill our obligations under those agreements, including product supply
obligations, and do not correct this failure within a specified time period.
Moreover, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic
customers into our own designs, and have certain obligations not to use or
disclose their intellectual property without their authorization. We cannot
assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of
our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will
succeed. In the future, we may have to engage in litigation to enforce our
intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the
validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, including our customers.
This litigation may be very expensive, divert management's attention and
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER CLAIMS AGAINST US COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, REQUIRE US TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCTS OR SEEK LICENSES FROM
THIRD PARTIES AND SERIOUSLY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

         Companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and
pursue their intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received,
and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed
upon, misappropriated or misused other parties' proprietary rights. In March
2000 Intel Corporation and its subsidiary Level One Communications, Inc. filed a
lawsuit against us alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair
competition and tortious interference with existing contractual relations
related to our recent hiring of three former Intel employees. In 1999 we settled
litigation with Stanford Telecommunications, Inc. that related to the alleged
infringement of one of Stanford's patents by several of our cable modem
products. In 1999 we prevailed in litigation with Sarnoff Corporation and
NxtWave Communications, Inc., formerly Sarnoff Digital Communications, Inc.,
which alleged that we misappropriated and misused certain of their trade secrets
in connection with our hiring of five former Sarnoff employees. Our subsidiary,
AltoCom, is the defendant in patent litigation brought by Motorola, Inc.
relating to software modem technology. Although we are defending the pending
litigation vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or
future lawsuits. In addition, we may be sued in the future by other parties who
claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their
trade secrets, or who may seek to invalidate one of our patents. Any of these
claims may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. For example, in a patent or trade secret action, a court
could issue an injunction against us that would require us to withdraw or recall
certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale
or under development. In addition, we may be liable for damages for past
infringement and royalties for future use of the technology. We may also have to
indemnify certain customers and strategic partners under our agreements with
such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have infringed
upon, misappropriated or misused another party's proprietary rights. Even if
claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted, these claims could
result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel
resources to defend. In that event, our business, financial condition and
results of operations would likely be materially and


                                       28
<PAGE>   31

adversely affected. If any claims or actions are asserted against us, we may
seek to obtain a license under a third party's intellectual property rights.
However, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all.

OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY HAVE LENGTHY SALES CYCLES. A CUSTOMER MAY DECIDE TO
CANCEL OR CHANGE ITS PRODUCT PLANS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE ANTICIPATED
SALES. IN ADDITION, OUR AVERAGE PRODUCT CYCLES TEND TO BE SHORT AND, AS A
RESULT, WE MAY HOLD EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

         After we have developed and delivered a product to a customer, our
customer will often test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own
equipment to incorporate our product. Our customer may need three to six months
or longer to test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months
or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product.
Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we may experience delays from the time we
increase our operating expenses and our investments in inventory until the time
that we generate revenues for these products. It is possible that we may never
generate any revenues from these products after incurring such expenditures.
Even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment, we
have no assurances that such customer will ultimately market and sell their
equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful. The delays
inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will
decide to cancel or change its product plans. Such a cancellation or change in
plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated. In
addition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails, reduces or
delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that
contains our products.

         While our sales cycles are typically long, our average product life
cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology
environment in which we operate. As a result, the resources devoted to product
sales and marketing may not generate material revenues for us, and from time to
time, we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory. If we incur
significant marketing and inventory expenses in the future that we are not able
to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating
results could be adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at
reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions, and we still have higher cost
products in inventory, our operating results would be harmed.

BECAUSE WE ARE SUBJECT TO ORDER AND SHIPMENT UNCERTAINTIES, ANY SIGNIFICANT
CANCELLATIONS OR DEFERRALS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

         We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers
can generally cancel or defer on short notice without incurring a significant
penalty. Any significant cancellations or deferrals could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory,
which could reduce our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our
operations. We recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer. If a
customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these
products, we could incur significant charges against our income. These charges
could materially and adversely affect our operating results.


                                       29
<PAGE>   32

THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN UNFORESEEN DELAYS OR EXPENSES AND
IN UNDETECTED DEFECTS OR BUGS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET
ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH CURRENT OR PROSPECTIVE
CUSTOMERS.

         Highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently
contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are
released. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,
these defects and bugs. If any of our products contain defects or bugs, or have
reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged
and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and
adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new
customers. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to
our customers. In order to alleviate these problems, we may have to invest
significant capital and other resources. Although our products are tested by our
suppliers, our customers and ourselves, we cannot assure you that our new
products will not contain defects or bugs. If any of these problems are not
found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we
may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair
or replacement costs. These problems may also result in claims against us by our
customers or others. In addition, these problems may divert our technical and
other resources from other development efforts. Moreover, we would likely lose,
or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products,
and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THE CYCLICALITY OF THE
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. ANY SUCH VARIATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET
PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

         We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject
to rapid technological change. From time to time, the semiconductor industry has
experienced significant economic downturns, characterized by diminished product
demand, accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity. This
industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity
constraints. Accordingly, our quarterly results may vary significantly as a
result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry.

OUR CALIFORNIA FACILITIES AND THE FACILITIES OF ONE OF THE TWO INDEPENDENT
FOUNDRIES UPON WHICH WE RELY TO MANUFACTURE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CURRENT
PRODUCTS ARE LOCATED IN REGIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER
NATURAL DISASTERS.

         Our California facilities, including our principal executive offices,
are located near major earthquake fault lines. If there is a major earthquake or
any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located,
our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, TSMC, one
of the two outside foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all
of our semiconductor devices, is located in Taiwan, a country that is also
subject to earthquakes. Any earthquake or other natural disaster in Taiwan could
materially disrupt TSMC's production capabilities and could result in our
experiencing a significant delay in delivery, or substantial shortage, of wafers
and possibly in higher wafer prices.


                                       30
<PAGE>   33

CHANGES IN CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THE IMPOSITION OF NEW LAWS
OR REGULATIONS BY THE FCC, OTHER FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES OR FOREIGN
GOVERNMENTS COULD IMPEDE THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE HARM OUR
BUSINESS.

         The Federal Communications Commission has broad jurisdiction over each
of our target markets. Although current FCC regulations and the laws and
regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to
our products, they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are
incorporated. As a result, the effects of regulation on our customers or the
industries in which they operate may, in turn, materially and adversely impact
our business, financial condition and results of operations. FCC regulatory
policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to
offer certain services or other aspects of their business may impede the sale of
our products. For example, in the past we have experienced delays when products
incorporating our chips failed to comply with FCC emissions specifications. We
and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the
United States. Foreign governments may impose tariffs, duties and other import
restrictions on components that we obtain from non-domestic suppliers and may
impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally. These
tariffs, duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in current laws
or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United
States or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business.

CERTAIN OF OUR DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND THEIR AFFILIATES CAN CONTROL
THE OUTCOME OF MATTERS THAT REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND
ACCORDINGLY WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT THEIR
APPROVAL.

         As of April 30, 2000 our directors and executive officers beneficially
owned approximately 34.2% of our outstanding common stock and 68.2% of the total
voting control held by our shareholders. In particular, as of April 30, 2000 our
two founders, Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III and Dr. Henry Samueli, beneficially
owned a total of approximately 32.5% of our outstanding common stock and 65.4%
of the total voting control held by our shareholders. Accordingly, these
shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of
matters that require the approval of our shareholders. These matters include the
election of a majority of our Board of Directors, the issuance of additional
shares of Class B common stock, and the approval of any significant corporate
transaction, including a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of
our assets. In addition, these insiders currently also control the management of
our business. Because of their significant stock ownership, we will not be able
to engage in certain transactions without the approval of these shareholders.
These transactions include proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open market
purchase programs or other purchases of our Class A common stock that could give
our shareholders the opportunity to receive a higher price for their shares than
the prevailing market price at the time of such purchases.

OUR STOCK PRICE IS HIGHLY VOLATILE. ACCORDINGLY, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL
YOUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR THEM.

         The market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated
substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and
subject to wide fluctuations. Since our initial


                                       31
<PAGE>   34

public offering in April 1998, our Class A common stock has traded at prices as
low as $11.75 and as high as $253.00 per share. These fluctuations have occurred
and may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we
cannot control, including:

         o  quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;

         o  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our
            competitors, customers or us;

         o  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and
            telecommunications and data communications equipment markets;

         o  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by
            analysts;

         o  changes in investor perceptions; or

         o  changes in expectations relating to our products, plans and
            strategic position or those of our competitors or customers.

         In addition, the market prices of securities of Internet-related and
other high technology companies have been especially volatile. This volatility
has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology
companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the
specific companies. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of
common stock at or above the price you paid. In the past, companies that have
experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the
subject of securities class action litigation. If we were the object of a
securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial losses and
divert management's attention and resources from other matters.

OUR PRODUCTS AND INTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THE PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS OF
OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS WHO FABRICATE, TEST AND ASSEMBLE OUR
PRODUCTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE PROBLEMS.

         Many existing computer systems, software applications and embedded
computer chips, software and firmware in control devices use only two digits to
identify a year in the date field. These systems, applications and control
devices need to accept four digit entries to distinguish 21st Century dates from
20th Century dates. In addition, they may not correctly process "leap year"
dates or may fail to recognize February 29, 2000 as a leap year date as a result
of an exception to the calculation of leap years that will occur in the Year
2000 and otherwise occurs only once every 400 years. As a result, these systems
and applications had to be upgraded to comply with the Year 2000 requirements or
risk system failure, miscalculations or other disruptions to normal business
activities.

         To date we have not experienced any known material Year 2000 problems
in our products, our internal systems or facilities, or the products, systems
and services of third parties. We will continue to monitor our mission critical
computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year
2000 to ensure that any latent Year 2000 matters that may arise are addressed
promptly. We did not incur material costs to identify and address specific Year
2000 compliance issues. We could however incur additional costs in addressing
any residual Year 2000 issues, which could have a material and adverse effect on
our business.


                                       32
<PAGE>   35

WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF
ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR BY BORROWING MONEY, AND
ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US.

         We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments on
hand, together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations, will be
sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months.
However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our
activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other
businesses, products or technologies. We could raise these funds by selling more
stock to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money. In
addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to
sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons.
We may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail our operations
significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or
others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or
potential markets. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or
convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders
would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may
have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our
common stock.

         It is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially
from those now planned. The amount of capital that we will need in the future
will depend on many factors, including:

         o  the market acceptance of our products;

         o  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to
            launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive
            position in the marketplace;

         o  volume price discounts;

         o  our business, product, capital expenditure and research and
            development plans and product and technology roadmaps;

         o  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain;

         o  capital improvements to new and existing facilities;

         o  technological advances;

         o  our competitors' response to our products; and

         o  our relationships with suppliers and customers.

         In addition, we may require additional capital to accommodate planned
growth, hiring, infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions
of other businesses, products or technologies.

OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS CONTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS THAT
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

         Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may
prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition
would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, we have in the past issued
and will in the future issue shares of


                                       33
<PAGE>   36

Class B common stock in connection with certain acquisitions, upon exercise of
certain stock options, and for other purposes. Class B shares have superior
voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters
that we submit to a shareholder vote (as compared with one vote per share in the
case of our publicly-held Class A common stock). Our Board of Directors also has
the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock
and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote. It is possible that the
provisions in our charter documents, the existence of supervoting rights by
holders of our Class B common stock, our officers' ownership of a majority of
the Class B common stock and the ability of our Board of Directors to issue
preferred stock may prevent parties from acquiring us. In addition, these
factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our Class A common stock
at a premium over the market price for this stock. Finally, these factors may
also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A common
stock, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

         Reference is made to the section titled Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk, in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 1999, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2000.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         In July 1997 the Company commenced an action against Sarnoff
Corporation and Sarnoff Digital Communications, Inc., now known as NxtWave
Communications, Inc. (collectively, "Sarnoff") in the California Superior Court
alleging breach of contract, fraud, misappropriation of trade secrets, false
advertising, trade libel, intentional interference with prospective economic
advantage and unfair competition. The claims center on Sarnoff's violation of a
non-disclosure agreement entered into with the Company with respect to limited
use of certain of the Company's technology and on inaccurate comparisons that
the Company believes Sarnoff has made in its product advertising and in
statements to potential customers and others. This action was removed to the
United States District Court for the Central District of California, and was
stayed pending resolution of an action Sarnoff had brought against the Company
in April 1997 in New Jersey Superior Court. Following the decision in the New
Jersey action in the Company's favor in early 1999, Sarnoff filed a motion for
summary judgment in the California case on the basis that the issues therein had
been or should have been previously litigated in the New Jersey action under the
New Jersey "entire controversy" doctrine. Following oral argument in August
1999, the District Court granted Sarnoff's motion and dismissed the Company's
claims on the grounds that they should have been brought as part of the New
Jersey action. The Company believes that the California action involves facts,
circumstances and claims unrelated to those at issue in the New Jersey action,
and has filed an appeal of the District Court's ruling. The Company filed its
opening brief in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2000. On May 8,
2000, Sarnoff filed its opposing brief, and the Company will submit its reply
brief shortly.

         In March 2000 Intel Corporation and its subsidiary Level One
Communications, Inc. (collectively, "Intel") filed a complaint in California
Superior Court asserting claims against the Company for misappropriation of
trade secrets, unfair competition, and tortious interference with existing
contractual relations by the Company in connection with its recent hiring of
three former Intel employees. The complaint sought injunctive relief, an
accounting, damages, exemplary damages and attorneys' fees. Intel filed a first
amended complaint on April 28, 2000 seeking additional relief and containing
certain additional allegations, but asserting the same causes of action as the
original complaint. The litigation is in its early stages. A preliminary
injunction hearing in the matter is expected to conclude on or about May 24,
2000. The Company has denied any wrongdoing or liability and has instructed its
attorneys to vigorously defend the action.

         In September 1998 Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") filed a complaint in
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against AltoCom,
Inc. ("AltoCom") (and co-defendant, PC-Tel, Inc.),


                                       34
<PAGE>   37

asserting that (i) AltoCom's V.34 and V.90 compliant software modem technology
infringes several patents owned by Motorola, (ii) AltoCom induces its V.34 and
V.90 licensees to infringe such patents, and (iii) AltoCom contributorily
infringes such patents. The complaint sought a preliminary and permanent
injunction against AltoCom as well as the recovery of monetary damages,
including treble damages for willful infringement. In October 1998 Motorola
affirmatively dismissed its case in the District of Massachusetts and filed a
substantially similar complaint in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware. AltoCom has filed an answer and affirmative defenses to
the District of Delaware complaint. AltoCom has also asserted a counterclaim
requesting declaratory relief that AltoCom has not infringed the Motorola
patents and that such patents are invalid and/or unenforceable as well as a
counterclaim requesting declaratory and injunctive relief based on breach of
contract theory. AltoCom believes that it has strong defenses to Motorola's
claims on invalidity, noninfringement and inequitable conduct grounds. In May
2000 Motorola filed an amended complaint alleging that AltoCom's technology
infringes an additional Motorola patent. The parties are currently engaged in
discovery in the action. A hearing on patent claims construction is scheduled to
commence in December 2000 and a three-week trial is scheduled to begin in June
2001. AltoCom became a subsidiary of the Company on August 31, 1999. In
September 1999 PC-Tel, Inc., the co-defendant in the case, reached a settlement
with Motorola.

         Although AltoCom believes that it has strong defenses and is defending
the action vigorously, a finding of infringement by AltoCom as to at least one
of the patents in this action could lead to liability for monetary damages
(which could be trebled in the event that the infringement were found to have
been willful), the issuance of an injunction requiring that AltoCom withdraw
various products from the market, and indemnification claims by AltoCom's
customers or strategic partners, each of which events could have a material
adverse effect on AltoCom's, and possibly the Company's, business, results of
operations and financial condition.

         The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in other legal
proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

         The pending lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and law and
could require the expenditure of significant costs and diversion of resources to
defend. Although management currently believes the outcome of outstanding legal
proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's business,

results of operations or financial condition, the results of litigation are
inherently uncertain, and an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible.
The Company is unable to estimate the range of possible loss from outstanding
litigation, and no amounts have been provided for such matters in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. CHANGES IN SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

         (d) Use of Proceeds from Sales of Registered Securities. On April 21,
1998, the Company completed an initial public offering (the "Offering") of its
Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value. The shares of Class A common stock sold
in the Offering were registered under the Securities Act of 1993, as amended, on
a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the "Registration Statement") (Reg. No.
333-45619) that was declared effective by the SEC on April 16, 1998. Of the
total shares sold, 12,480,000 shares were sold by the Company (including
1,420,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the Underwriters'
over-allotment option), 3,620,000 shares were sold by selling shareholders
(including 680,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the Underwriters'
over-allotment option) and 2,000,000 shares were sold by the Company to Cisco
Systems in a concurrent registered offering that was not underwritten. The
purchase price for the underwritten shares was $6.00 per share and the purchase
price of the shares sold to Cisco Systems was $5.58 per share. The aggregate
price of the Offering amount registered was approximately $107.8 million.

         In connection with the Offering, the Company paid an aggregate of
approximately $5.2 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and paid
other expenses of approximately $1.6 million. After deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and other expenses, the Company received net aggregate
proceeds from the Offering and sale of shares to Cisco Systems of approximately
$79.2 million. Through March 31, 2000, the Company has used all of the proceeds
for repayment of debt, purchase of capital equipment, lease of engineering
design tools, payment of merger-related costs and for payment of litigation
settlement costs. None of the Company's net proceeds of the Offering were paid
directly or indirectly to any director, officer, general partner of the Company
or their associates, persons owning 10 percent or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company, or an affiliate of the Company.
