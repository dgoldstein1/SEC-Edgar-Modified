       EMC  ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF CrosStor  SOFTWARE,  INC.

HOPKINTON, Mass. - November 1, 2000 -- EMC Corporation
(NYSE:EMC), the world leader in information storage, announced
today that it has acquired privately held CrosStor Software, Inc.
in a pooling-of-interests transaction. EMC issued approximately
$300 million in stock at the closing of this transaction in
exchange for all of CrosStor's outstanding capital stock.
CrosStor is a leader in high-performance software for networked
storage systems. The acquisition will enhance EMC's portfolio of
networked storage technology and expertise.

     Joe Tucci, EMC's President and Chief Operating Officer,
said, "The networking of storage is one of today's most important
IT trends, one that underlines both the increasingly strategic
role of intelligent storage and the peripheralization of
traditional general-purpose servers. EMC has led this trend from
its outset, and more than 25% of the storage we sell is now
connected directly to a network. CrosStor brings EMC some of the
world's most advanced software technology for networked storage
as well as an impressive and deep team of experienced developers
with rich heritage in open systems. We look forward to welcoming
CrosStor to the EMC family."
