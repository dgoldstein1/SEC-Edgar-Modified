Item 5.  OTHER EVENTS.
         ------------

     EMC Corporation ("EMC"), a Massachusetts corporation, Emerald Merger
Corporation ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of EMC, and Data General Corporation ("DG"), a Delaware corporation, have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 6, 1999 (the
"Merger Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub would
merge with and into DG with DG as the surviving corporation (the "Merger").  At
the effective time of the Merger, each share of DG common stock issued and
outstanding (other than shares held by DG, EMC or any wholly owned subsidiary of
EMC), will be converted into the right to receive .3262 of a share of EMC common
stock, subject to certain adjustments; provided, however, that in the event the
average of the mean high and low per share trading prices on the New York Stock
Exchange of shares of EMC common stock for each of the 20 consecutive trading
days ending on the fifth day prior to the meeting of the stockholders of DG to
consider approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the merger (the "Pre-
Closing Average Price") is greater than $66.0625, then the exchange ratio shall
be adjusted so that each share of DG common stock is converted into the right to
receive a number of shares of EMC common stock equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) $21.55 by (B) the Pre-Closing Average Price.  Simultaneously with
the execution of the Merger Agreement, EMC and DG entered into a stock option
agreement (the "Stock Option Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things,
DG granted to EMC a contingent irrevocable option to purchase up to 10,177,850
shares (the "Option Shares") of DG common stock, including any associated rights
to purchase shares of DG common stock pursuant to the Renewed and Restated
Rights Agreement between DG and The Bank of New York, at a price of $19.58 per
Option Share, subject to certain adjustments.  Completion of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement is subject
to the approval of DG stockholders and appropriate regulatory review, and is
expected to occur before the end of 1999.

     The merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and as a "pooling of interests" in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial
accounting purposes.

     Copies of the Merger Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement are attached
hereto as Exhibits 2.1 and 10.1, respectively, and are incorporated herein by
reference.  A copy of a press release issued by EMC and DG announcing the
execution of the Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is also
incorporated herein by reference.

"Agreement"), by and among EMC Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation
("Parent"), Emerald Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Data General Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").


          WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests
of their respective stockholders that Parent acquire the Company pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and, in furtherance of such acquisition,
such Boards of Directors have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware ("DGCL");

          WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and the Company have entered into a Stock Option
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, the form of which is attached as Exhibit
A hereto (the "Stock Option Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company has
granted Parent an option to purchase shares of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock");

          WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that
this Agreement shall be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code; and

          WHEREAS, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
be accounted for as a pooling of interests;

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and in the
Stock Option Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
     holder of a Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
     any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of
     Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), any dividends or other
     distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of
     fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), all to be issued or
     paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in
     accordance with Section 2.2, without interest (collectively, the "Merger
     Consideration").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exchange Ratio shall
     be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock

                                       3

     split, reverse split, reclassification, stock dividend (including any
     dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common
     Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect
     to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date
     hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

          (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.  All shares
              -----------------------------------------------------
     of Company Common Stock that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares
     or (ii) owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below)
     of Parent, shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no
     securities of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
     therefor.  As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with
     respect to any party, any corporation or other organization, whether
     incorporated or unincorporated, of which (A) such party or any other
     Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the
     general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary
     of such party do not have a majority of the voting interest in such
     partnership), (B) such party or any Subsidiary of such party owns in excess
     of a majority of the outstanding equity or voting securities or (C) at
     least a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
     functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is
     directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party or by any one or
     more of its Subsidiaries.

          (c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of common stock, par
              ---------------------------
     value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
     and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
     value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

          (d) Stock Options.  Outstanding options to purchase shares of Company
              -------------
     Common Stock shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.13
     hereof.

          (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.  In the event the average of the
              -----------------------------
     mean high and low per share trading prices on the New York Stock Exchange
     (the "NYSE") of shares of Parent Common Stock (as reported for the NYSE
     Composite Transactions in the Wall Street Journal) for each of the 20
     consecutive trading days ending on the fifth day prior to the Company
     Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 3.21) to consider approval and
     adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the "Pre-Closing Average Price")
     is greater than $66.0625, then the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted such
     that each share of Company Common Stock is converted into the right to
     receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient
     obtained

                                       4
<PAGE>

     by dividing (A) $21.55 by (B) the Pre-Closing Average Price.

     SECTION 2.2  Exchange of Certificates.
                  -------------------------

          (a)  Exchange Agent.  Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
     designate a bank or trust company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the
     "Exchange Agent").  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
     shall deposit with or for the account of the Exchange Agent stock
     certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
     issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of
     Company Common Stock, which shares of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed
     to have been issued at the Effective Time.  From time to time, Parent shall
     make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash to make all cash
     payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(d). (b)
     Exchange Procedures.  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
     Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
     a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
     represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
     that were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive
     shares of Parent Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
     specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
     Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
     the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
     as Parent may reasonably specify that are not inconsistent with the terms
     of this Agreement), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
     surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
     Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
     together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
     customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
     holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
     therefor (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole shares of Parent
     Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with
     Section 2.1(a) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
     evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any dividends or other distributions to
     which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and (C) any cash
     in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
     holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d), after giving effect to any
     tax withholdings, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
     canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
     Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company
     as of the Effective Time, a certificate representing the proper number of
     shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
     Certificate evidencing such Company Common Stock is presented to the
     Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
     effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) and

                                       5
<PAGE>

     by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
     so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective
     Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed from and
     after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to represent only the
     right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing shares of Parent
     Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
     Section 2.2(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
     Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

          (c) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Parent Shares.  No
              -------------------------------------------------------
     dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
     Stock for which the record date is after the Effective Time shall be paid
     to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
     of Parent Common Stock they are entitled to receive until the holder of
     such Certificate surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable law,
     following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
     record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent
     Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of
     such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
     record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
     whole shares of Parent Common Stock. Promptly following the date which is
     six months after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to
     the Surviving Corporation all cash, certificates and other documents in its
     possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and
     any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
     this Article II shall look thereafter only to the Surviving Corporation for
     the shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions thereon,
     and any cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof to which they are
     entitled pursuant to this Article II.

          (d)  No Fractional Shares.
               --------------------

               (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
          Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
          certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
          pursuant to this Article II; no dividend, stock split or other change
          in the capital structure of Acquiror shall relate to any fractional
          security; and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner
          thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder.

               (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the
          Exchange Agent will determine the excess of (A) the number of whole
          shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by
          Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) over (B) the aggre-

                                       6
<PAGE>

          gate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed
          to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (such
          excess being herein called the "Excess Shares"). Following the
          Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will, on behalf of former
          stockholders of the Company, sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing
          prices on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE"), all in the
          manner provided in Section 2.2(d)(iii).

               (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent will be
          executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and
          will be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.  The
          Exchange Agent will use reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the
          Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in the
          Exchange Agent's sole judgment, is practicable consistent with
          obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing
          market conditions.  Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have
          been distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock, the Exchange
          Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the former holders of
          Company Common Stock (the "Common Shares Trust").  The Surviving
          Corporation will pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-
          pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of
          the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess
          Shares.  The Exchange Agent will determine the portion of the Common
          Shares Trust to which each former holder of Company Common Stock is
          entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
          proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the
          numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to
          which such former holder of Company Common Stock is entitled (after
          taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
          Effective Time by such holder) and the denominator of which is the
          aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of
          Company Common Stock are entitled.  For purposes of this Section
          2.2(d), shares of Company Common Stock of any former holder
          represented by two or more certificates may be aggregated and in no
          event shall any holder be paid an amount of cash in respect of more
          than one share of Parent Common Stock.

               (iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount
          of cash, if any, to be paid to the former holders of Company Common
          Stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange
          Agent will hold such cash amounts for the benefit of, and pay such
          cash amounts to, such former holders of Company Common Stock subject
          to and in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2(b).

                                       7
<PAGE>

          (e)  Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent
               ----------------------
     Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
     Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
     condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will
     be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
     person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
     designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
     issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name
     other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
     have established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by
     it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

          (f)  No Liability. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be
               ------------
     liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the
     case may be, for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
     thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
     abandoned property, escheat or similar law following the passage of time
     specified therein.

          (g)  Withholding Rights.  Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
               ------------------
     entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
     payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock
     such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
     withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
     provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
     are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
     shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
     the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of which such
     deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

          (h)  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. At the Effective
               ---------------------------------------------
     Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
     thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
     transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
     Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to such time.
     If, after such time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
     Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
     provided in this Article II.

          (i)  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
               --------------------------------------
     Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
     shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates,
     upon the

                                       8
<PAGE>

     making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of
     Parent Common Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.1(a) as well
     as the other Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II; provided,
                                                                       --------
     however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
     -------
     the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
     Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
     satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably
     direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or
     the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
     lost, stolen or destroyed.

          (j)  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of Parent,
               ------------------------------------------
     Merger Sub and the Company will take all such reasonable and lawful action
     as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in
     accordance with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time
     after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable
     to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
     Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
     rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub,
     the officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub immediately prior
     to the Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective
     corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and
     necessary action.

     SECTION 2.3. Material Adverse Effect.
                  -----------------------

          (a) The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change,
     effect or circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all
     other such similar or related changes, effects or circumstances that have
     occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the
     Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) is materially adverse to the business,
     assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or results of

     or circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all other
     such similar or related changes, effects or circumstances that have

     Material Adverse Effect, (i) is materially adverse to the business, assets
     (including intangible assets), financial condition or results of operations
     of Parent or (ii) is reasonably likely to materially delay or prevent the

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except
as set forth in the written disclosure schedule prepared by the Company which is
dated as of the date hereof that is arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the
numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and previously
delivered to Parent in connection herewith (the "Disclosure Schedule")
(disclosure in any paragraph of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify only the

except where another date is specified:

     SECTION 3.1.  Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.  The
                   --------------------------------------------
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority necessary to
own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted or presently proposed to
be conducted.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing that could not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  A true, complete and correct list of all of
the Company's Subsidiar-

                                       10

ies, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary, the

does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity, excluding securities in any publicly traded
company held for investment by the Company and comprising less than one percent
of the outstanding stock of such company.

     SECTION 3.2. Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.  The Company has

equivalent organizational documents), as amended to date, of each of its
Subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Documents").  Such Company Charter, Company By-
Laws and Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect.  Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Charter, Company By-Laws or Subsidiary Documents, as the case may be.

                  --------------

<PAGE>

     specified above, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
     instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized,
     validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No material change in such

     authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and all such
     shares (other than directors' qualifying shares in the case of foreign
     Subsidiaries) are owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company free

     set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no equity
     securities of any class of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
     security exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity securities,
     issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.  Except as described under
     Section 3.2(a) of this Agreement or as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the
     Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights,

     SECTION 3.13 Employee Benefit Plans, Options and Employment Agreements.

         (a) Section 3.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all material
     employee benefit plans of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any trade or
     business (as "ERISA Affiliates") whether or not incorporated, that together
     with the Company would be deemed a single employer within the meaning of
     Section 4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
     amended ("ERISA"), including without limitation any employment agreements
     or any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, bonus, stock option, incentive,
     deferred compensation, severance, termination pay, welfare or other plan,
     contract, arrangement or practice in which one or more employees
     (including, without limitation, former employees or beneficiaries of
     employees or former employees) of the Company or a Subsidiary participates
     or is eligible to participate (the "Plans").  For these purposes, such
     Plans shall include, without limitation, any employee benefit plan (as such
     term is described in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any plan, practice or
     arrangement that constitutes a "fringe benefit" plan, vacation plan or
     policy, sick leave program, medical, disability or life insurance plan
     (including, without limitation, those employment or other agreements that
     contain "golden parachute" provisions).  Neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has established or maintains any plan, program or arrangement
     to provide post-retirement medical benefits to any employee, former
     employee or beneficiary of any employee or former

                                       17
<PAGE>

     employee, other than coverage mandated by applicable law. Each Plan has
     been administered in compliance with its terms and is in compliance with
     ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder (to the extent
     applicable), as well as with all other applicable federal, state and local
     statutes and regulations except as disclosed on Section 3.13(a) of the
     Disclosure Schedule.

         (b) Each Plan that is intended to qualify (the "Qualified Plans") under
     Section 401(a) of the Code have been determined by the Internal Revenue
     Service (the "IRS") to be so qualified.  Except as disclosed in Section
     3.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, all reports and other documents
     required by law or contract to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
     distributed to plan participants or beneficiaries have been timely filed or
     distributed.  Copies of the Plans and any amendments or trusts related
     thereto, Form 5500 (including financial audits and schedules thereto as
     required by law) for the immediately preceding three years, summary plan
     descriptions, and the most recent determination letters or determination
     letter requests have been made available to Parent.  Neither the Company
     nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Plan has engaged in any transaction
     prohibited under the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406
     of ERISA.  No Plan has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency, as
     defined in Section 412(a) of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA, and neither
     the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any resulting
     liability for excise tax under Sections 4975 or 4976 of the Code or penalty
     pursuant to Sections 409 or 502(i) of ERISA due to the IRS or the Pension
     Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC").  The Company further represents
     that:

          (1)  there has been no termination, partial termination or
               discontinuance of contributions to any Qualified Plan without
               notice to and approval by the IRS, except as disclosed in Section
               3.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule;

          (2)  no Qualified Plan which is subject to the provisions of Title IV
               of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan") has been terminated;

          (3)  there have been no "reportable events" (as such phrase is defined
               in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Qualified Plan
               except as disclosed in Section 3.13(a) of the Disclosure
               Schedule; and

          (4)  the Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred and do not
               expect to incur any liability under Section 4062 of ERISA or with
               respect to any "multi-employer plan" (as such term is defined in
               Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

     complete and correct list of (i) all employment or consulting agreements
     with employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries obligating the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make annual cash payments in an
     amount exceeding $100,000; (ii) all employees of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries who have executed a non-competition agreement with the Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) all severance agreements, programs and
     policies of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its
     employees, in each case with outstanding commitments exceeding $100,000,
     excluding programs and policies required to be maintained by law; and (iv)
     all plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of the Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees which contain
     change in control provisions.  True, complete and correct copies of each of
     the foregoing agreements to which the chief executive officer of the
     Company is a party have been made available to Parent.

          (d) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been
     incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied
     in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the
     Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than
     liability for premiums due the PBGC (which premiums have been paid when
     due).

          (e) With respect to each Title IV Plan, the present value of accrued
     benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for
     funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such
     plan's actuary with respect to such plan did not exceed, as of its latest
     valuation date, the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable
     to such accrued benefits.

          (f) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Plan on
     or prior to the Effective Time have been timely made or are reflected on
     the Company's balance sheet.  There are no pending, threatened or
     anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or
     beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or otherwise involving any such
     Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

          (g) Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(g) of the Disclosure Schedule,
     the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
     not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
     current or former employee or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary to
     severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as
     expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of
     pay-

                                       19

     ment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
     employee or officer. Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(g) of the
     Disclosure Schedule, there is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement,
     including but not limited to the provisions of this Agreement, covering any
     employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
     individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
     that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G or 162(m) of the
     Code.

     SECTION 3.14 Labor Matters.  (a)  There are no controversies pending or, to
                  -------------
the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened, between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective employees,
consultants or independent contractors, which controversies have or could
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (b) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, nor does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
know of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such
employees; and (c) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
knowledge of any labor disputes, strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts,
or threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees of, or consultants or
independent contractors to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 3.15 Properties; Encumbrances.  The Company and each of its
                  ------------------------
Subsidiaries have good, valid and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, all the properties and assets which it purports to own or lease
(real, personal and mixed, tangible and intangible), including, without
limitation, all the properties and assets reflected in the Company Balance Sheet
(except for personal property sold since the date of the Company Balance Sheet
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), except as

properties and assets reflected in the Company Balance Sheet are free and clear
of all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Company Balance Sheet and Liens
for current taxes not yet due and other Liens that do not materially detract
from the value or impair the use of the property or assets subject thereto.

     SECTION 3.16 Taxes.
                  -----

          (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean taxes,

          (b) Other than as disclosed in Section 3.16(b) of the Disclosure
     Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries have filed with the appropriate
     taxing authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by them, except
     where the failure to file such Tax Returns would not have a Company
     Material Adverse Effect.  All Taxes due and owing by the Company and its
     Subsidiaries have been paid or adequately reserved for, except to the
     extent any failure to pay or reserve would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or except to the extent
     such Taxes are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings (to
     the extent that any such proceedings are required).  There are no Tax Liens
     on any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof other than liens
     relating to Taxes not yet due and payable.  Neither the Company nor any of

          (a) Parent has timely filed and made available to the Company all
     forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be
     filed by Parent with the SEC since December 31, 1998 (collectively, the

     required to be stated in such Parent SEC Reports or necessary in order to

     operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
     unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
     recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
     material in amount.  The unaudited balance sheet of Parent as of March 31,
     1999 is referred to herein as the "Parent Balance Sheet."

<PAGE>

     SECTION 4.6  Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Since the date of the
                  ------------------------------------
Parent Balance Sheet and except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, Parent
has conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and, since such date, there has not occurred: (i) any change, development, event
or other circumstance, situation or state of affairs that has had or may be
reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any
amendments to or changes in the Parent Charter or Parent By-Laws, except for the
amendment to the Parent Charter approved by the stockholders of Parent on May 5,

its Subsidiaries (whether or not covered by insurance) that could reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iv) any material change by

                  ---------------------

pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any properties or assets of
Parent or of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any properties or
assets of Parent or of any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, which claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations could reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.8  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  The
                  --------------------------------------------------
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Registration Statement shall
not at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.  The information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be sent to the stockholders of
the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, shall not, on
the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of
the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or shall omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made therein not false or misleading; or omit to
state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company
Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading.  If at any time prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting any event relating to Parent or any of its
respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Parent
which

                                       33
<PAGE>

should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall promptly inform the
Company. The Registration Statement shall comply in all material respects as to
form and substance with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by
the Company which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

                  -------

Parent) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

     SECTION 4.10 Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities.  As of the date
                  --------------------------------------------

incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and except for this Agreement and
any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by this Agreement, Merger Sub
has not and will not have incurred, directly or indirectly, any obligations or
liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever

                  --------------------
affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action or failed to take any action
that would prevent (a) Parent from accounting for the business combination to be
effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests or (b) the Merger from
constituting a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Without limiting the effect of a breach of any other representation or warranty
set forth in this Agreement, the failure of this representation to be true and
correct shall, if as a result the Merger is not able to be accounted for as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, constitute a
breach of this Agreement by Parent for purposes of Section 8.1(f).

customers, suppliers and other persons with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has significant business relations. By way of amplification and not

     case may be, would not be satisfied.

     SECTION 5.2. Advice of Changes.  Parent and the Company shall promptly
                  -----------------
advise the other party orally and in writing to the extent it has knowledge of
(i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made
by Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement or the Stock Option Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect where the failure of such
representation to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), individually or in the aggregate,
has had or is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, (ii) the failure by it (and,
in the case of Parent, by Merger Sub) to comply in any material respect with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or the Stock Option
Agreement and (iii) any change or event having, or which is reasonably likely to
have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as

affect in any manner the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or any matter set forth in the

     SECTION 6.1. Access to Information; Confidentiality.  The Company shall
                  --------------------------------------
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to) afford to Parent and to Parent's
officers, employees, financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants, consultants
and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to all of its books and
records (other than privileged documents) and its properties, plants and
personnel and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent
a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it
pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws, provided that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall affect any representations or
warranties made herein or the conditions to the obligations of the respective
parties to consummate the Merger.  Unless otherwise required by law, each party
agrees that it (and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives) shall hold in confidence all non-public information acquired in
accordance with the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement dated June 30, 1999
between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

     SECTION 6.2  No Solicitation.
                  ---------------

          (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and affiliates shall not,
     directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
     representative or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and it
     shall use

                                       38
<PAGE>

     reasonable efforts to cause such officers, directors, employees,
     representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly), (i) solicit,
     initiate, facilitate or encourage any inquiries or proposals that
     constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
     Proposal (as herein defined) or (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions
     concerning, or provide any non-public information to any person or entity
     relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if, at any
                                            --------  -------
     time prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "Applicable
     Period"), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
     after consultation with outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in
     order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders
     under applicable law, the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal
     (as defined in Section 6.2(b)) which was not solicited by it or which did
     not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.2(a), and subject to
     providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action to
     Parent (a "Section 6.2 Notice") and compliance with Section 6.2(c), (x)
     furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any
     person making an Superior Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
     containing terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality
     Agreement and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
     Superior Proposal.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
     means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct
     or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or
     more of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity
     securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or
     exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
     owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
     of its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
     recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
     the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b)  Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither the
     Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
     withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
     adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
     Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve
     or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
     Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
     agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
     related to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during
     the Applicable Period, in response to a Superior Proposal which was not
     solicited by the Company and which did not otherwise result from a breach
     of Section 6.2(a), the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to
     this and the following

                                       39
<PAGE>

     sentences) terminate this Agreement, but only at a time that is during the
     Applicable Period and is after the fifth business day following Parent's
     receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of
     the Company is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, specifying the
     material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
     person making such Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a
     "Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a third party to acquire,
     directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange
     offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
     liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration
     consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the combined voting
     power of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding or all or
     substantially all the assets of the Company and otherwise on terms which
     the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment
     (based on the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
     reputation) to be more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the
     Merger and for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed
     or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
     Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.

          (c)  The Company agrees that as of the date hereof, it, its
     Subsidiaries and affiliates (and their respective officers, directors,
     employees, representatives and agents) shall immediately cease and cause to
     be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
     person (other than Parent or its representatives) conducted heretofore with
     respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent
     immediately after receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of any
     Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection
     with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or
     records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any person or entity
     that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an
     Acquisition Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in
     writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror
     and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. The
     Company shall keep Parent informed of all material developments and the
     status of any Acquisition Proposal, any negotiations or discussions with
     respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
     information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or for access to
     the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
     by any person or entity that is considering making, or has made, an
     Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of all
     documents received from or delivered or sent to any person or entity that
     is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal.

          (d)  Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company
     from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
     Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
     disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
     the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside
     counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
     under applicable law; provided, however, that neither the Company nor its
     Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or
     propose publicly to withdraw of modify, its position with respect to this
     Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
     approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.


     SECTION 6.3  Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement.
                  --------------------------------------------------

          (a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement,
     Parent and the Company shall in consultation with each other prepare, and
     the Company shall file with the SEC, preliminary proxy materials which
     shall constitute the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  As promptly as
     practicable after comments are received from the SEC thereon and after the
     furnishing by the Company and Parent of all information required to be
     contained therein, (i) the Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy
     Statement/Prospectus and (ii) Parent shall file with the SEC the
     Registration Statement.  The Company and Parent shall use all reasonable
     efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as soon
     thereafter as practicable.

          (b) The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to mail the Proxy
     Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company as soon as
     practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
     SEC.  Subject to the Company's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
     to Section 6.2(b), the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the
     recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the
     Merger.

          (c) The Company shall furnish Parent with all information concerning
     the Company and the holders of its capital stock and shall take such other
     action as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Registration
     Statement and the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock.  If at any
     time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the
     Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates,
     officers or directors should be discovered by such party which should be
     set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or
     Proxy Statement/Prospectus, such party shall promptly inform the other
     thereof and take appropriate action in respect thereof.

                                       41
<PAGE>

          (d) The Company and Parent shall make any necessary filing with

     rules and regulations thereunder.

     SECTION 6.4  Company Stockholders Meeting.
                  ----------------------------

          (a) The Company shall, subject to and in accordance with applicable
     law and the Company Charter and Company By-Laws, promptly and duly call,
     give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting to be
     held as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the
     Registration Statement becomes effective for the purpose of voting on the
     Merger and this Agreement.  Subject to its right to terminate this
     Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(b), the Company will, through its Board
     of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval and adoption of
     this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby
     and will use its best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
     favor of the Merger and this Agreement.

          (b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
     certificate of its Corporate Secretary setting forth the voting results
     from the Company Stockholders Meeting.

     SECTION 6.5  Legal Conditions to Merger.  Each of Parent and, subject to
                  --------------------------
Section 6.2, the Company will use all reasonable best efforts to comply promptly
with all legal requirements which may be imposed with respect to the Merger
(which actions shall include, without limitation, furnishing all information
required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or filings with
any other Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with and furnish
information to each other in connection with any such requirements imposed upon
any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger.  Each of
Parent and the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, take all
reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by Parent, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or taking of
any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.6  Agreements with Respect to Affiliates.  The Company will cause
                  -------------------------------------
each person who is identified in Section 3.30 of the Disclosure Schedule and any
other person who may be or become an "affiliate" of the Company as of the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145") to deliver to Parent, as soon as practicable but not
later than thirty days preceding the Effective Time, a written agreement (an
"Affiliate Agreement") in connection with restrictions on affiliates under Rule
145 and pooling of interests ac-

                                       42
<PAGE>

counting treatment, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto. The Company
shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any such other person who may be or
become an "affiliate" of the Company as of the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting who is not identified in Section 3.30 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 6.7  Tax-Free Reorganization.  Parent and the Company intend that
                  -----------------------
the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.  Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to so qualify.  The parties agree and acknowledge that if
(i) Parent has, not later than three days prior to the Effective Time, provided
written notice to the Company of its intention to merge the Surviving
Corporation with and into Parent with Parent surviving the merger (the "Upstream
Merger"), and (ii) the Company consents to the Upstream Merger, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, then the Upstream Merger shall occur
immediately following the Effective Time.  Neither Parent nor the Company shall
knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, that would be
reasonably likely to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

     SECTION 6.8  Pooling Accounting.  Parent and the Company shall each use its
                  ------------------
reasonable best efforts to cause the business combination to be effected by the
Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes.
Neither Parent nor the Company shall knowingly take any action, or knowingly
fail to take any action, that would be reasonably likely to jeopardize the
treatment of the Merger as a pooling of interests for accounting purposes.  Each
of Parent and the Company agrees to take such action as may be reasonably
required to negate the impact of any past actions which to its knowledge could
be reasonably likely to jeopardize the treatment of the Merger as a pooling of
interests for accounting purposes.

     SECTION 6.9  Letters of Accountants.
                  ----------------------

          (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
     delivered to the Company (i) a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
     Parent's independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before
     the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and
     addressed to the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
     the Company and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by
     independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
     similar to the Registration Statement, which letter shall be brought down
     to the Effective Time, and (ii) the letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
     referred to in Section 7.2(d).

          (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be
     delivered to Parent (i) a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the
     Com-

                                       43
<PAGE>

     pany's independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before
     the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and
     addressed to Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
     Parent and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by
     independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
     similar to the Registration Statement, which letter shall be brought down
     to the Effective Time, and (ii) the letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
     referred to in Section 7.2(d).

     SECTION 6.10 Public Announcements.  Parent and the Company shall consult
                  --------------------
with each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of
the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue
such press release or make such public statement as may upon the advice of
counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE if it has
used all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party prior thereto.

     SECTION 6.11 Listing of Parent Shares.  Parent shall use its reasonable
                  ------------------------
best efforts to have authorized for listing on the NYSE, upon official notice of
issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

     SECTION 6.12 Employee Benefits; 401(k) Plan.
                  ------------------------------

          (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
     Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or
     its Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of
     the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection with all
     employee benefit plans of Parent or its affiliates in which Company
     Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for
     purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for
     purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan).  From
     and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
     Corporation to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
     eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
     affiliates to be waived with respect to Company Employees and their
     eligible dependents and (ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan
     year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and
     annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective
     Time.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Parent
     and its Subsidiaries agree to honor in accordance with their terms and not
     contest all benefits accrued or vested as of the Effective Time under the
     employee benefit plans and agreements of the Com-

                                       44
<PAGE>

     pany and its Subsidiaries (including those set forth in Section 3.13 of the
     Disclosure Schedule), including, without limitation, any rights or benefits
     arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
     (either alone or in combination with any other event); it being understood
     that for purposes of all such plans and agreements, the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement are, or will be deemed to be, a "change of
     control".

          (b)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions
     as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation
     to effect as of the Effective Time such actions relating to the Data
     General Corporation Savings and Investment Plan (the "401(k) Plan") as
     Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, subject to the terms of the
     401(k) Plan and applicable law and provided that such action does not
     preclude the immediate participation of the Company Employees in any
     successor plan.


     SECTION 6.13 Stock Plans.
                  -----------

          (a) Each option granted to a Company employee to acquire shares of
     Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") that is issued under a
     Company Stock Option Plan (other than the Company Qualified Employee Stock
     Purchase Plan) and which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall, effective as of the
     Effective Time, become and represent an option to acquire the number of
     shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Substitute Option") determined by
     multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
     Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the
     Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise
     price per share of Parent Common Stock (increased to the nearest whole
     cent) equal to the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option
     divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any
                                    --------  -------
     Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of
     its qualification as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the
     Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted if necessary to comply with
     Section 424(a) of the Code.  After the Effective Time, except as provided
     above in this Section 6.13, each Substitute Option shall be exercisable
     upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related
     Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                                       45
<PAGE>

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) obtain any
     consents from holders of Company Stock Options and (ii) amend the terms of
     its equity incentive plans or arrangements, in each case as is necessary to
     give effect to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 6.13.

     SECTION 6.14 Consents.  The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts
                  --------
to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of the
Company's material agreements, contracts, licenses or leases in connection with
the Merger, including without limitation each of the consents listed in Section
6.14 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     SECTION 6.15 Rights Plan.  So long as this Agreement shall not have been
                  -----------
terminated pursuant to Article 8, the Company shall not redeem the Company
Rights, or amend or modify (other than to delay the Distribution Date (as
defined in the Company Rights Agreement) or to render the Rights inapplicable to
the Merger or any action permitted under this Agreement) or terminate the
Company Rights Agreement (including any such redemption, amendment, modification
or termination which would make the Company Rights Agreement or Rights
inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal, prior to the Effective Time).  The
Company shall take all action necessary so that none of Parent or Merger Sub
will be an "Acquiring Person" under the Company Rights Agreement and to ensure
that neither the Company Rights Agreement nor the Rights will apply to Parent or
Merger Sub as a result of this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

     SECTION 6.16 Indemnification and Insurance.
                  -----------------------------

          (a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of litigation expenses
     and limitation of personal liability existing in favor of the directors,
     officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
     provisions existing on the date hereof in the Company Charter or Company
     By-Laws shall, with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior
     to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement), survive the Effective Time, and, as of the Effective Time,
     Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all obligations of the
     Company in respect thereof as to any claim or claims asserted prior to or
     within a four-year period immediately after the Effective Time.

          (b) For a period of four years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
     Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
     directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
     the

                                       46
<PAGE>

     Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
     therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
     terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to former officers and
     directors of the Company) only with respect to claims arising from facts or
     events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided, however,
     that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
     pursuant to this Section 6.16(b) more than an aggregate amount equal to
     150% of current aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for such
     insurance (the "Maximum Amount") (which premiums the Company represents and
     warrants to be $108,000 in the aggregate).  If the amount of the aggregate
     annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
     exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation during such four-year
     period shall maintain or procure as much coverage as possible for aggregate
     annual premiums not to exceed the Maximum Amount.

     SECTION 6.17 Company 6% Convertible Subordinated Notes.  Effective at the
                  -----------------------------------------
Effective Time, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture under the
Indenture dated as of May 21, 1997 between the Company and the Bank of New York,
as Trustee (the "Indenture"), providing for the Company's 6% Convertible
Subordinated Notes after the Effective Time to be convertible into shares of
Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 15.6 of the Indenture.

     SECTION 6.18 Additional Agreements; Reasonable Best Efforts.  Subject to
                  ----------------------------------------------
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
all reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     or approval, or dedication, filing or expiration of any waiting period) of
     any Governmental Entity shall have expired or been terminated, as the case
     may be, and any requirements of other jurisdictions applicable to the
     consummation of the Merger shall have been satisfied, unless the failure of
     such requirements to be satisfied does not constitute a Company Material
     Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect;

          (d) No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality.  No temporary
              ----------------------------------------

     approval referred to in Section 7.1(b), unless further stockholder approval

     this Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
     hereby shall have been obtained and made by the Company except where the
     failure to obtain such consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
     orders or to make such filings, in the aggregate shall not be or have a
     Company Material Adverse Effect;

          (d) Opinion of Accountants.  Parent shall have received letters from

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated a date within two business days of the

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated a date within two business days of the
     Proxy Statement/Prospectus and within two business days of the Closing Date
     and addressed to the Company, stating that neither the Company nor any of

     combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests
     transaction under generally accepted accounting principles; and

     representations speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as

     SECTION 8.1  Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time
                  -----------
prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding approval thereof by the
stockholders of the Company:


          (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of
     Directors of Parent and the Company;

          (b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been

     Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party
     whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
     cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before
     such date);

          (c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent
     jurisdiction or governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or

     or taken any other action having the effect of permanently restraining,
     enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger (provided that the party
     seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall have complied

<PAGE>

     Merger shall not have been obtained;

          (e) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform
     any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
     contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would cause
     the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) to not be satisfied
     and which breach shall not have been cured within 10 business days
     following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach from
     Parent;

          (f) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform
     any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
     contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would cause
     the conditions set forth in Sections 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), to not be satisfied
     and which breach shall not have been cured within 10 business days
     following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach from the
     Company;

          (g) by the Company in accordance with the provisions of Section
     6.2(b); provided that the termination described in this clause (g) shall
     not be effective unless and until the Company shall have paid to Parent in
     full the fee and expense reimbursement described in Section 8.3; or

          (h) by Parent (i) if the Company or any of its officers or directors
     participate in discussions or negotiations in breach of Section 6.2; (ii)
     if the Company or any of its officers or directors are otherwise in
     material breach of Section 6.2; or (iii) in the event of a breach of

     SECTION 8.2  Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination of
                  ---------------------
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto or any of
its affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders except (i) that the
provisions of Sections 3.29, 4.9, 8.3, this Section 8.2 and Article IX hereof
shall survive termination and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any willful breach hereof.  The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive termination of this Agreement as provided therein.

     SECTION 8.3  Fees and Expenses.
                  -----------------

     (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated; provided, however, that Parent and the Company shall share equally
all fees and expenses, other than attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred in
connection with the printing and filing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(including any preliminary

                                       52
<PAGE>

materials related thereto), the Registration Statement (including financial
statements and exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto and filings
under the HSR Act.

     (b) The Company shall reimburse Parent for all fees and expenses of Parent
actually incurred relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
prior to termination (including without limitation fees and expenses of Parent's
counsel, accountants and financial advisors), upon the termination of this
Agreement (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), (ii) by
Parent pursuant to Sections 8.1(e) or 8.1(h) or (iii) by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(g).

     (c) The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $44,630,000 upon the
earliest to occur of the following events (each, a "Termination Event"):

               (i) the entry by the Company into an agreement with respect to,
          or the consummation of, any Acquisition Proposal or the acquisition by
          any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the equity or
          voting interests of the Company in any such case within one year of
          the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(b) or
          8.1(d) if prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have
          been publicly announced or otherwise become publicly known or any
          person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
          conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal;

               (ii) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
          Section 8.1(h); or

               (iii)  the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant
          to Section 8.1(g).

          (d) The expenses and fees, if applicable, payable pursuant to Sections
     8.3(b) and 8.3(c) shall be paid promptly, but in no event later than the
     date of the first to occur of the events described in Sections 8.3(b)(i),
     (ii) or (iii) or 8.3(c)(i), (ii) or (iii); provided, that in no event shall
     the Company be required to pay the expenses and fees of Parent, if,
     immediately prior to the termination of this Agreement, Parent was in
     material breach of its obligations under this Agreement.  The Company
     acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.3(c) are an
     integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
     without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
     accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant
     to Section 8.3(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
     suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth
     in Section 8.3(c), the Company shall pay to

                                       53
<PAGE>

     Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
     connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee
     at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
     required to be made.

and agreements contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE I

                               THE STOCK OPTION


     SECTION 1.1  Grant of Stock Option.  Dragon hereby grants to Emerald an
                  ---------------------
irrevocable option (the "Stock Option") to purchase up to 10,177,850 shares (the
"Option Shares") of Dragon Common Stock, including the associated rights (the
"Dragon Rights") to purchase shares of Dragon capital stock pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, Renewed and Restated as of October 19, 1996, between Dragon
and The Bank of New York, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), in the
manner set forth below and at a price of $19.58 per Option Share, as adjusted in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1.5 hereof (such price, as adjusted if
applicable, the "Purchase Price"); provided, however, that in no event
                                   --------  -------
(including any adjustment under Section 1.5 hereof) shall the number of shares
of Dragon Common Stock for which this Stock Option is exercisable exceed 19.9%
of Dragon's issued and outstanding shares of Dragon Common Stock without giving
effect to any Option
<PAGE>

Shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Stock Option. All references in this
Agreement to shares of Dragon Common Stock issued to Emerald hereunder shall be
deemed to include the Dragon Rights associated therewith. Capitalized terms used
herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

     SECTION 1.2  Exercise of Stock Option.
                  ------------------------

          (a)  Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
     Section 1.3 hereof, the Stock Option may be exercised by Emerald, in whole
     or in part, at any time or from time to time after the occurrence of an
     Exercise Event (as defined below) and prior to the Termination Date (as
     defined below).

          (b)  An "Exercise Event" shall occur for purposes of this Agreement
     upon the occurrence of any event or circumstance which, pursuant to the
     terms of Section 8.3(c) of the Merger Agreement, would entitle Emerald to
     payment of the termination fee specified in Section 8.3(c) of the Merger
     Agreement.

          (c)  The "Termination Date" shall occur for purposes of this Agreement
     upon the first to occur of any of the following:

               (i)    the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement);

               (ii)   the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated
          pursuant to Section 8.1 thereof, unless on or after such termination
          Emerald may have the right to receive the termination fee described in
          Section 8.3(c) of the Merger Agreement, including upon the occurrence
          of certain events; or

               (iii)  the date which is one year after the date on which the
          Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 thereof, if on
          or after such termination Emerald may be entitled to receive the
          termination fee described in Section 8.3(c) of the Merger Agreement,
          including upon the occurrence of certain events;

     provided that, with respect to clause (iii) above, if the Stock Option
     cannot be exercised as of such date by reason of any applicable judgment,
     decree, law, regulation or order, or by reason of the waiting period under
     the HSR Act,

                                       2
<PAGE>

     then the Termination Date shall be extended until fifteen days after such
     impediment has been removed or such waiting period has expired.

          (d)  Dragon shall notify Emerald in writing as promptly as
     practicable, and in any event within 24 hours, of the occurrence of any
     Exercise Event, it being understood that the giving of such notice by
     Dragon shall not be a condition to the right of Emerald to exercise the
     Stock Option or for an Exercise Event to have occurred.

          (e)  In the event Emerald is entitled to and wishes to exercise the
     Stock Option, Emerald shall send a written notice (an "Exercise Notice") to
     Dragon specifying the total number of Option Shares Emerald wishes to
     purchase, the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing
     such Option Shares which Emerald wishes to receive, a date (a "Closing
     Date"), which shall be a business day which is at least five business days
     after delivery of such notice, and place for the closing of such purchase
     (a "Closing").

          (f)  Upon receipt of an Exercise Notice, Dragon shall be obligated to
     deliver to Emerald the number of Option Shares specified therein, in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the later of (i) the
     Closing Date and (ii) the first business day on which the conditions
     specified in Section 1.3 hereof shall be satisfied.

          (g) If, at any time during the period commencing on an Exercise Event
     and ending on the Termination Date, Emerald sends to Dragon an Exercise
     Notice indicating Emerald's election to exercise its right (the "Cash-Out
     Right") pursuant to this Section 1.2(g), then Dragon shall pay to Emerald,
     on the Closing Date, in exchange for the cancellation of the Option with
     respect to such number of Option Shares subject thereto as Emerald
     specifies in the Exercise Notice, an amount in cash equal to such number of
     Option Shares multiplied by the difference between (i) the higher of (A)
     the average closing price, for the 10 trading days commencing on the 12th
     trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date, per share of Dragon
     Common Stock as reported on The New York Stock Exchange (or, if not listed
     on The New York Stock Exchange, as reported on any other national
     securities exchange or national securities quotation system on which Dragon
     Common Stock is listed or quoted, as reported in The Wall Street Journal
                                                      -----------------------
     (Northeast edition), or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative
     source) and (B) the highest price per share of Dragon Common Stock paid
     pursuant to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
     or proposed to be

                                       3
<PAGE>

     paid pursuant to any agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal and (ii)
     the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the termination of the Stock Option,
     Emerald will be entitled to exercise its rights under this Section 1.2(g)
     if it has exercised such rights in accordance with the terms hereof prior
     to the termination of the Stock Option.

          (h)  (i)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
          any provision of the Merger Agreement, in no event shall the sum of
          (x) the Total Option Profit (as hereinafter defined) and (y) the
          termination fee payable under Section 8.3(c) of the Merger Agreement
          (the "Termination Fee") exceed in the aggregate $61,363,000 and, if
          the total amount that otherwise would be received by Emerald would
          exceed such amount, Emerald, at its sole election, shall either (a)
          reduce the number of shares of Dragon Common Stock subject to the
          Option, (b) deliver to Dragon for cancellation shares of Dragon Common
          Stock previously purchased by Emerald, (c) pay cash to Dragon or (d)
          take any action representing any combination of the preceding clauses
          (a), (b) and (c), so that Emerald's actually realized Total Option
          Profit, when aggregated with such Termination Fee so paid to Emerald,
          shall not exceed $61,363,000 after taking into account the foregoing
          actions.

               (ii)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
          any provision of the Merger Agreement, this Stock Option may not be
          exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise,
          result in a Notional Total Option Profit (as hereinafter defined)
          which, together with any Termination Fee theretofore paid to Emerald,
          would exceed in the aggregate $61,363,000; provided, however, that
          nothing in this clause (ii) shall restrict any exercise of the Option
          permitted hereby on any subsequent date if exercise at such time would
          otherwise be permitted by this clause (ii).

               (iii)  As used herein, the term "Total Option Profit" shall mean
          the aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following:  (A) the amount
          received by Emerald pursuant to Section 1.2(g), (B)(x) the amount
          received by Emerald pursuant to the sale of Option Shares to any
          unaffiliated party (including pursuant to Section 3.2(e)), valuing any
          non-cash consideration at its fair market value, less (y) Emerald's
          purchase price for such Option Shares, and (C) any equivalent amount
          resulting from the adjustments contemplated under Section 1.5.

                                       4
<PAGE>

               (iv)   As used herein, the term "Notional Total Option Profit"
          with respect to any number of shares of Dragon Common Stock as to
          which Emerald has delivered an Exercise Notice shall be the Total
          Option Profit determined as of the date of deliver of such Exercise
          Notice assuming that the Stock Option were exercised on such date for
          such number of shares of Dragon Common Stock and assuming that such
          shares, together with all other Option Shares held by Emerald and its
          affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market
          price for the Dragon Common Stock as of the close of business on the
          preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions or
          underwriting discounts).

     SECTION 1.3  Conditions to Delivery of Option Shares.  The obligation of
                  ---------------------------------------
Dragon to deliver Option Shares upon any exercise of the Stock Option is subject
to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

               (a)    All waiting periods, if any, under the HSR Act applicable
          to the issuance of Option Shares hereunder shall have expired or been
          terminated; and

               (b)    There shall be no preliminary or permanent injunction or
          other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction preventing
          or prohibiting such exercise of the Stock Option or the delivery of
          the Option Shares in respect of such exercise.

     SECTION 1.4  Closings.  At each Closing, simultaneously with the delivery
                  --------
by Emerald of the aggregate Purchase Price for Option Shares being acquired,
Dragon will deliver to Emerald a certificate or certificates evidencing the
number of Option Shares specified in Emerald's Exercise Notice, registered in
the name of Emerald or its nominee, and, if the Stock Option should be exercised
in part only, a new Stock Option evidencing the rights of Emerald thereof to
purchase the balance of the shares (or other securities) purchasable hereunder.
All payments made by Emerald to Dragon pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall be
made, at the option of Emerald, (a) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, or (b) by delivery to Dragon of a certified or bank check or checks
payable to or to the order of Dragon.

     SECTION 1.5  Adjustments Upon Share Issuances, Changes in Capitalization,
                  ------------------------------------------------------------
etc.
- ---

               (a)    In the event of any change in Dragon Common Stock or in
          the number of outstanding shares of Dragon Common Stock by

                                       5
<PAGE>

          reason of a stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, combination,
          exchange of shares or similar transaction or any other change in the
          corporate or capital structure of Dragon (including, without
          limitation, the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend of
          cash, securities or other property), the type and number of shares or
          securities to be issued by Dragon upon exercise of the Stock Option,
          and the Purchase Price thereof, shall be adjusted appropriately, and
          proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing such
          transaction or change, so that Emerald shall receive upon exercise of
          the Stock Option the number and class of shares or other securities or
          property that Emerald would have received in respect to Dragon Common
          Stock if the Stock Option had been exercised immediately prior to such
          transaction or change, or the record date therefor, as applicable.

               (b)    In the event that Dragon shall enter into an agreement (i)
          to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Emerald or
          one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving
          corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any
          person, other than Emerald or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into
          Dragon and Dragon shall be the continuing or surviving corporation,
          but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of
          Dragon Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or
          other securities of Dragon or any other person or cash or any other
          property, or then outstanding shares of Dragon Common Stock shall
          after such merger represent less than 5% of the outstanding shares and
          share equivalents of the surviving corporation or (iii) to sell or
          otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any
          person, other than Emerald or one of its Subsidiaries, then, in each
          such case, proper provision shall be made in the agreements governing
          such transaction so that Emerald shall receive upon exercise of the
          Stock Option the number and class of shares or other securities or
          property that Emerald would have received in respect of Dragon Common
          Stock if the Stock Option had been exercised immediately prior to such
          transaction, or the record date therefor, as applicable.

               (c)    No adjustment made in accordance with this Section 1.5
          shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any breach of any of
          Dragon's representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
          obligations contained in the Merger Agreement.

                                       6
<PAGE>

               (d)    The provisions of this Agreement, including, without
          limitation, Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 and 3.2 shall apply with
          appropriate adjustments to any securities for which the Stock Option
          becomes exercisable pursuant to this Section 1.5.

     SECTION 1.6  Restrictive Legend.  Each certificate representing Option
                  ------------------
Shares issued to Emerald hereunder shall include a legend in substantially the
following form:

     THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE REOFFERED OR SOLD ONLY
IF SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE.

     SECTION 2.1  Representations and Warranties of Dragon.  Dragon represents
                  ----------------------------------------
and warrants to Emerald that (a) Dragon is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the execution
and delivery by Dragon of this Agreement and the consummation by Dragon of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Dragon, (c) this Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Dragon and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Dragon, enforceable against Dragon in accordance with its terms,
(d) Dragon has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and
permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the
Termination Date shall have reserved, all the Option Shares issuable pursuant to
this Agreement, and Dragon will take all necessary corporate action to authorize
and reserve and permit it to issue all additional shares of Dragon Common Stock
or other securities which may be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof, all of
which, upon their issuance and delivery in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, shall be delivered free and clear of all security interests,
liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements,
limitations on Emerald's voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any
nature whatsoever (other than this Agreement) and shall not be subject to any
preemptive rights, and (e) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Dragon does not, and

                                       7
<PAGE>

the consummation by Dragon of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended to date, or Bylaws, as
amended to date, of Dragon, (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
or loss of any benefit) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument
or obligation to which the Dragon or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or (iii)
conflict or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order,
decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Dragon or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or assets, except in the
case of (ii) and (iii) for any such violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or conflicts which would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) on Dragon and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or impair the
ability of Dragon to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware will not, prior to the termination of this Agreement, apply to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Dragon has taken, and will in
the future take, all steps necessary to irrevocably exempt the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from any other applicable state takeover law and
from any applicable charter or contractual provision containing change of
control or anti-takeover provisions. Dragon has taken all action so that the
entering into of this Agreement, the acquisition of shares of Dragon Common
Stock hereunder and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not result in the grant of any rights to any person under the Rights Agreement
or enable or require the Dragon Rights to be exercised, distributed or
triggered.

                              COVENANTS OF DRAGON


     SECTION 3.1  Listing; Other Action.
                  ---------------------

               (a)    Dragon shall, at its expense, use reasonable best efforts
          to cause the Option Shares to be authorized for listing on the New
          York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), upon official notice of issuance, as
          promptly as practicable following an Exercise Event, and will provide
          prompt notice to the NYSE of the issuance of each Option Share, unless
          the delivery of the Option Shares is satisfied with shares of Dragon
          Common Stock held in treasury by Dragon then listed on the NYSE.

               (b)    Dragon shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
          cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be
          done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws
          and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
          contemplated hereunder, including, without limitation, using its
          reasonable best efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents,
          approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of governmental
          entities.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Dragon
          shall when required in order to effect the transactions contemplated
          hereunder make all filings and submissions under the HSR Act as
          promptly as practicable.

     SECTION 3.2  Registration.
                  ------------

               (a)    As used in this Agreement, "Registrable Securities" means
          each of the Option Shares issued to Emerald hereunder and any other
          securities issued in exchange for, or issued as dividends or otherwise
          on or in respect of, any of such Option Shares.

               (b)    At any time or from time to time within three years of the
          first Closing, Emerald may make a written request to Dragon for
          registration under and in accordance with the provisions of the
          Securities Act with respect to all or any part of the Registrable
          Securities (a "Demand Registration").  A Demand Registration may

                                       9
<PAGE>

          be, at the option of Emerald, a shelf registration or a registration
          involving an underwritten offering. As soon as reasonably practicable
          after Emerald's request for a Demand Registration, Dragon shall file
          one or more registration statements on any appropriate form with
          respect to all of the Registrable Securities requested to be so
          registered; provided that Dragon will not be required to file any such
          registration statement during any period of time (not to exceed 60
          days after such request in the case of clause (i) below or 90 days in
          the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) below) when (i) Dragon is in
          possession of material non-public information which it reasonably
          believes would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, in the
          written opinion of outside counsel to Dragon, such information would
          have to be disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that
          time, (ii) Dragon is required under the Securities Act to include
          audited financial statements for any period in such registration
          statement that are not yet available for inclusion therein, or (iii)
          Dragon determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration
          would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other material
          transaction involving Dragon or any of its affiliates. Dragon shall
          use its best efforts to have the Demand Registration declared
          effective as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing and to
          keep the Demand Registration continuously effective for a period of at
          least ninety days following the date on which the Demand Registration
          is declared effective, in the case of an underwritten offering, or at
          least six months following the date on which the Demand Registration
          is declared effective, in the case of a shelf registration; provided
          that, if for any reason the effectiveness of any Demand Registration
          is suspended, the required period of effectiveness shall be extended
          by the aggregate number of days of each such suspension; and provided,
          further, that the effectiveness of any Demand Registration may be
          terminated if and when all of the Registrable Securities covered
          thereby shall have been sold. Emerald shall be entitled to two Demand
          Registrations. If any Demand Registration involves an underwritten
          offering, (i) Emerald shall have the right to select the managing
          underwriter, which shall be reasonably acceptable to Dragon (it being
          agreed by Dragon that Lehman Brothers Inc. would be acceptable to
          Dragon) and (ii) Dragon shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
          customary form.

               (c)    If at any time within three years of the first Closing,
          Dragon proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities
          Act with respect to any shares of any class of its equity securities
          to

                                       10
<PAGE>

          be sold for the account of Dragon (other than a registration
          statement on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor form), and the
          registration form to be used may be used for the registration of
          Registrable Securities, then Dragon shall in each case give written
          notice of such proposed filing to Emerald at least twenty days before
          the anticipated filing date, and Emerald shall have the right to
          include in such registration such number of Registrable Securities a
          Emerald may request (such request to be made by written notice to
          Dragon within fifteen days following Emerald's receipt from Dragon of
          such notice of proposed filing).  Dragon shall use its best efforts to
          cause the managing underwriter of any proposed underwritten offering
          to permit Emerald to include in such offering all Registrable
          Securities requested by Emerald to be included in the registration for
          such offering on the same terms and conditions as any similar
          securities of Dragon included therein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
          if the managing underwriter of such offering advises Emerald that, in
          the reasonable opinion of such underwriter, the amount of Registrable
          Securities which Emerald requests to be included in such offering
          would materially and adversely affect the success of such offering,
          then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered shall be
          reduced to the extent necessary to reduce the total amount of
          securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended
          by such underwriter; provided, however, that if the amount of
          Registrable Securities shall be so reduced, Dragon shall not be
          permitted to include in such registration any securities of Dragon
          other than securities to be issued by Dragon and Registrable
          Securities.

               (d)    In the event that Registrable Securities are included in a
          "piggyback" registration statement pursuant to Section 3.2(c) hereof,
          Emerald agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of the
          issue being registered or a similar security of Dragon, or any
          securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
          securities, including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
          Act, during the ten business days prior to, and during the 90-day
          period beginning on, the effective date of such registration statement
          (except as part of such registration), if and to the extent timely
          notified in writing by Dragon, in the case of a non-underwritten
          public offering, or by the managing underwriter, in the case of an
          underwritten public offering.  In the event that Emerald requests a
          Demand Registration or if Registrable Securities are included in a

                                       11
<PAGE>

          "piggyback" registration pursuant to Section 3.2(c) hereof, Dragon
          agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of the issue
          being registered or a similar security of Dragon, or any securities
          convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities,
          during the period from such request until 90 days after the effective
          date of such registration statement (except as part of such
          registration or pursuant to a registration of securities on Form S-4
          or Form S-8 or any successor form).

               (e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
          in the event that Emerald requests a Demand Registration or a
          "piggyback" registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section
          3.2(b) or 3.2(c) hereof, respectively, Dragon shall have the right to
          purchase all, but not less than all, of the Registrable Securities
          requested to be so registered, upon the terms and subject to the
          conditions set forth in this Section 3.2(e). If Dragon wishes to
          exercise such purchase right, then within two business days following
          receipt of a request for a Demand Registration or a "piggyback"
          registration, Dragon shall send a written notice (a "Repurchase
          Notice") to Emerald specifying that Dragon wishes to exercise such
          purchase right, a date for the closing of such purchase, which shall
          not be more than five business days after delivery of such Repurchase
          Notice, and a place for the closing of such purchase (a "Repurchase
          Closing"). Upon delivery of a Repurchase Notice, a binding agreement
          shall be deemed to exist between Emerald and Dragon providing for the
          purchase by Dragon of the Registrable Securities requested to be
          registered by Emerald, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
          set forth in this Section 3.2(e). The purchase price per share or
          other unit of Registrable Securities (the "Repurchase Price") shall
          equal the average per share or per unit closing price as quoted on the
          NYSE (or if not then quoted thereon, on such other exchange or
          quotation system on which the Registrable Securities are quoted) for
          the period of five trading days ending on the trading day immediately
          prior to the day on which Emerald requests a Demand Registration or a
          "piggyback" registration of the Registrable Securities which Dragon
          subsequently elects to purchase. Emerald's obligation to deliver any
          Registrable Securities at a Repurchasing Closing shall be subject to
          the condition that, at such Repurchase Closing, Dragon shall have
          delivered to Emerald a certificate signed on behalf of Dragon by
          Dragon's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, which
          certificate shall be satisfactory in form and substance to Emerald, to


                                       12
<PAGE>

          the effect that the purchase by Dragon of such Registrable Securities
          (i) is permitted under applicable Delaware corporate law and under the
          fraudulent conveyance provisions of the federal bankruptcy code and
          (ii) does not violate any material agreement to which Dragon or any of
          its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties or
          assets is bound. At any Repurchase Closing, Dragon shall pay to
          Emerald the aggregate Repurchase Price for the Registrable Securities
          being purchased by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by
          delivering to Emerald a certified or bank check payable to or on the
          order of Emerald in an amount equal to such aggregate Repurchase
          Price, and Emerald will surrender to Dragon a certificate or
          certificates evidencing such Registrable Securities. No purchase of
          Registrable Securities by Dragon pursuant to this Section 3.2(e) shall
          reduce or otherwise modify Dragon's registration obligations under
          this Section 3.2 (including, without limitation, the number of Demand
          Registrations which Dragon is obligated to effect) with respect to any
          Registrable Securities held by Emerald following such purchase.

               (f)    The registrations effected under this Section 3.2 shall be
          effected at Dragon's expense except for underwriting commissions
          allocable to the Registrable Securities.  Dragon shall indemnify and
          hold harmless Emerald, its affiliates and controlling persons and
          their respective officers, directors, agents and representatives from
          and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
          expenses (including, without limitation, all out-of-pocket expenses,
          investigation expenses, expenses incurred with respect to any judgment
          and fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants) arising out of
          or based upon any statements contained in, or omissions or alleged
          omissions from, each registration statement (and related prospectus)
          filed pursuant to this Section 3.2; provided, however, that Dragon
                                              --------  -------
          shall not be liable in any such case to Emerald or any affiliate or
          controlling person of Emerald or any of their respective officers,
          directors, agents or representatives to the extent that any such loss,
          claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof)
          or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
          omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement or
          prospectus in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written
          information furnished to Dragon specifically for use in the
          preparation thereof by Emerald such affiliate, controlling person,
          officer, director, agent or representative, as the case may be.

                          EMC TO ACQUIRE DATA GENERAL

    Accretive Transaction Will Enable EMC to Penetrate New Storage Markets


HOPKINTON, Mass. - August 9, 1999 - EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC), the world's
leading provider of enterprise storage systems, software, and services, and Data
General Corporation (NYSE:DGN) today announced that they have entered into a
definitive agreement for the acquisition of Data General by EMC.  Under the
terms of the agreement, EMC will issue 0.3262 of a share of EMC common stock for
each share of Data General common stock, subject to certain adjustments. Based
upon the August 6, 1999, closing price of EMC common stock, the transaction is
valued at approximately $19.58 per Data General share, for a total consideration
of approximately $1.1 billion. Completion of the transaction is subject to
approval of Data General stockholders and appropriate regulatory review, and is
expected to occur before the end of 1999. EMC expects the acquisition to be
accretive to its fiscal year 2000 earnings and significantly accretive to fiscal
year 2001 earnings.

     This acquisition will enable EMC to address customer requirements in the
rapidly growing midrange storage market, an approximately $10 billion market in
1998.  Data General's CLARiiON storage products are recognized as among the most
advanced midrange storage systems in the world. When combined with EMC's
industry-leading software, distribution and services capabilities, these
products will emerge as the world's most advanced midrange storage solutions and
enable EMC to fully address all of its customers' online storage needs in both
new and existing markets.

     Data General's AViiON server business will operate as a separate unit of
EMC, with continued focus on the NUMA (non-uniform memory access) architecture,
enterprise Windows NT, and serving the computing needs of the worldwide health
care market. EMC also plans to leverage Data General's core research and
development expertise in Intel-based processor systems and high-performance
operating systems across EMC's existing range of products.  These technologies
also will be highly valuable in developing network-attached storage solutions
for the future.

     Michael C. Ruettgers, EMC President and CEO, said, "This acquisition
delivers on our long-stated objective of constantly expanding our market
opportunities.  Data General's products

have proven technology leadership in the midrange storage market, particularly
in the Windows NT and UNIX environments, but have lacked the global distribution
and support needed to achieve their full market potential. We believe they will
provide an excellent complement to our high-end Symmetrix Enterprise Storage
family and will enable us to serve this growing market segment."

     Ronald L. Skates, Data General President and CEO, said, "As a technology
and market leader with an unmatched track record of execution, EMC is the ideal
company to continue the hard work and innovation of Data General into the next
millennium.  We look forward to the opportunity for our technologies and our
people to thrive as part of EMC."

     EMC's Ruettgers continued, "This acquisition also represents the union of
two of the largest Massachusetts-based technology companies, Data General with
its origins in the early years of the computer industry and EMC at the forefront
of the current explosion in demand for intelligent storage. The fact that we are
neighbors, with headquarters just a few miles apart, gives us even greater
confidence in our ability to maximize synergies and achieve the most efficient
integration possible."

     The transaction is intended to qualify as a pooling-of-interests for
accounting purposes and as a tax-free exchange of shares under IRS regulations.

     Data General, based in Westboro, Massachusetts, is a major supplier of
storage and enterprise computing solutions for customers worldwide. The
company's products include CLARiiON Fibre Channel storage systems, high-end
Windows NT and UNIX AViiON servers, and related software and services. The
company reported fiscal 1998 revenues of $1.5 billion. Additional information on
the company, its products, and services is available on the Internet at
