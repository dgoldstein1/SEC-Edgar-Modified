ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

	EMC Corporation and its subsidiaries ("EMC" or the "Company") design, 
manufacture, market and support high performance storage products and provide 
related services for mainframe and midrange computer systems manufactured 
primarily by International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Unisys 
Corporation ("Unisys") and Compagnie des Machines Bull S.A. ("Bull").  The 
Company recently announced a family of products aimed at the open systems 
storage marketplace.  The Company develops its products by integrating 
technologically advanced industry standard components and devices with 
Company designed proprietary controller technology to produce storage 
products that enhance the performance, reliability, availability and 
functionality of computer systems.

	The Company's principal products are based on Integrated Cached Disk Array 
("ICDA")  technology which combines high-speed semiconductor cache memory with 
an array of industry standard disk drives. ICDA-based products represented 
approximately 93% of the Company's revenues in 1994, 91% in 1993 and 74% in 
1992.  These products include the Symmetrix series of high speed ICDA-based
storage systems for the IBM and IBM-compatible, Unisys and Bull mainframe 
computer markets.  In November 1992, the Symmetrix product line was expanded
to include the Model 5500 which features storage capacities of up to 360 
gigabytes ("GB's"), hardware and channel redundancy, full system battery 
backup, nondisruptive component upgrade and replacement, and remote 
diagnostic features.  In May 1994, the Company introduced an expanded version
of the Model 5500, extending its capacity to over one terabyte of storage.  
The Company also markets the Harmonix series of high speed ICDA-based storage
systems for the IBM AS/400 midrange computer market.  In November 1994, the 
Company introduced its Centriplex family of ICDA products for the developing
open systems storage marketplace.  

	Additionally, the Company provides solid-state disk ("SSD") devices, main 
memory products and tape back-up systems.

	The customers for these products are located worldwide and represent a cross 
section of industries and government agencies that range in size from Fortune 
500 companies to small businesses.  The Company markets its products in North
and South America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region through its direct 
sales force, distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs").  All
products sold directly to end-users are maintained and serviced by the 
Company or third party providers.  Products sold through distributors or OEMs
are normally maintained by the reseller.

	EMC, a Massachusetts corporation incorporated in 1979, has its corporate 
headquarters located at 171 South Street, Hopkinton, Massachusetts.

Company Strategy 

	The Company's objective is to be a leading provider of high performance, high 
reliability storage systems to selected mainframe and midrange computer 
markets as well as the open systems storage market.  Over the past decade the
technological advances made in central processing units ("CPUs") have far 
exceeded advances made in the area of data storage systems.  These CPU 
advances have created an input/output bottleneck which limits the performance
of computer systems running applications that require frequent and high speed
access to data.  The Company's products have been designed to significantly 
reduce this performance bottleneck.  The major elements of the Company's 
strategy are set forth below.
   
Innovative Architectural Design

	The Company has developed a common product architecture, called 
MOSAIC:2000, on which its principal products are based.  This architectural 
framework is based upon a modular design and industry standard interfaces that
allows new technologies to be incorporated more rapidly than with traditional
architectures and enhances portability to non-IBM environments.  This 
facilitates upgrades and enhancements that can extend the useful life of the
Company's storage systems and also extend the useful life of the customer's 
CPU.

Proprietary Software Technology

	The Company's products achieve high performance levels due in part to 
proprietary software and microcode controller technology.  This proprietary 
controller technology, combined with large amounts of high speed cache memory
and arrays of industry standard disk drives, creates storage devices that 
provide computer systems with enhanced performance, reliability and 
functionality.

Multi-Channel Distribution Focus

	The Company's strategy is to continue to expand in four distinct product 
markets:  the IBM and IBM-compatible mainframe market, the IBM AS/400 
midrange market, the OEM market and the open systems storage market.  To 
access these markets the Company has adopted a multi-channel distribution 
approach.  The Company utilizes a direct sales force in the U.S., Canada, 
Europe and Japan.  The Company also utilizes third party distributors and 
OEMs.  

Mainframe Market

	The mainframe storage market is estimated to be a multibillion dollar market 
which the Company has penetrated with its ICDA-based products.  The Company 
believes that it is currently the leading manufacturer of storage systems that
allow users to bridge the gap between the speed at which the CPU can process
data and the traditional storage device's ability to provide the data to the
CPU.

                                   4
<PAGE>

	Product sales to the mainframe storage market represented approximately 88%, 
82% and 70%, respectively, of EMC's 1994, 1993 and 1992 product revenue.  In 
September 1990, EMC introduced the Symmetrix series of ICDA-based products for 
IBM and IBM-compatible mainframe computers.  Symmetrix was the first 
commercially available disk storage system for the IBM mainframe marketplace 
that utilized arrays of smaller, industry standard 5 1/4"  disk drives as an 
alternative to the larger more expensive disk drives that traditionally had 
been used with mainframe computers.  By combining these smaller disk drives 
with an integrated control unit, large amounts of cache memory and battery 
backup, Symmetrix provides the user with what the Company believes to be the
highest performing disk storage product available in the marketplace today.
As a result of this integrated design, Symmetrix also occupies a smaller 
footprint and has lower operating costs than data storage systems based on 
conventional technology.  

	Since the introduction of the first Symmetrix model, the Model 4400 with a 
maximum capacity of 24 GB's, EMC has added additional models that are both 
smaller (the Model 4200 with a capacity of up to 16 GB's) and larger (the 
Model 4800 with a capacity of up to 90 GB's) than the original.  In November
1992, EMC introduced a new series of Symmetrix products called the Model 5500
(with a capacity of up to 360 GB's).  The Model 5500 has many built-in 
redundancy features allowing for continuous operation of the disk storage 
system.  This is particularly attractive to users whose data storage 
requirements are dependent upon high performance and continuously available 
data for mission critical applications.  Each Model 5500 contains EMC's Auto 
Call feature, which automatically generates a diagnostic phone call from the 
unit to EMC's 24 hour Remote Support Facility if the unit detects a possible
problem.  The Company has continually enhanced the Symmetrix family of 
products with additional features and improved performance through a 
combination of hardware and microcode enhancements.  For example, in 
September 1993, EMC announced the Model 4208-2S which increased the capacity
of the Symmetrix Model 4200 from 8 GB's to 16 GB's by using 3 1/2" disk 
technology. In May 1994, the Company introduced an expanded version of the 
Model 5500, extending its capacity to over one terabyte of storage.  The 
5200 series was also introduced in May 1994 with capacities ranging from 32 
GB's to 272 GB's.  The wide range of Symmetrix models allows EMC to broaden 
its marketing efforts to address the storage needs of virtually all sizes of
IBM mainframe computer users.

	EMC also designs and manufactures plug compatible main memory products for 
IBM air cooled model 9121 mainframe computers and  provides plug-in storage 
modules for IBM 3990-3 cache control units.

Midrange Market
	
	The Company believes that there is a large portion of the IBM AS/400 midrange 
storage market that has not been penetrated by the Company's ICDA-based 
products.

	Midrange revenues grew modestly during 1994, with product sales to the 
midrange storage market representing approximately 10%, 15% and 28%, 
respectively, of EMC's product revenue in 1994, 1993 and 1992.   In 1992, the

                                    5
<PAGE>

Company introduced the first ICDA-based storage systems for the IBM AS/400
midrange computer market.  This series of products, called Harmonix, uses 
both 5 1/4" and 3 1/2" disk drives integrated with cache memory to provide 
high performance, high capacity storage solutions for the AS/400 user.  
During 1994, the Company expanded the Harmonix product line to allow the 
Company to reach new users by including models featuring high capacity at a 
lower cost as well as other models emphasizing high availability. 

	EMC also offers the Champion line of 8 millimeter ("mm") based Intelligent 
Cached Tape Subsystems, which provides AS/400 users with high capacity, high 
performance and unattended backup.  These products feature an advanced 
controller design and cache buffer combined with the ability to interleave 
data to up to four 8 mm tape transports simultaneously, greatly improving the
speed of the backup operations. EMC's August 1993 acquisition of Magna Computer
Corporation ("Magna") augmented the Champion line of tape products by adding
4 mm and additional 8 mm and reel to reel tape products to the Company's 
product portfolio. 

	The Company also provides main memory upgrades for selected AS/400 CPU 
models.

OEM Market

	The MOSAIC:2000 framework and the inherent flexibility of its open system 
make EMC's products well suited to be sold by strategic OEMs in partnership
with the Company.
	
	Since January 15, 1992, EMC has had an OEM agreement with Unisys for the 
sale of Unisys-compatible Symmetrix products.  This agreement currently extends 
through December 31, 1998.  As of December 1994, a Unisys-compatible version of 
the Company's Modarray I product was added to this agreement.  Unisys maintains 
worldwide marketing rights to both the Symmetrix and Modarray I products for 
use with Unisys systems under certain terms and conditions.
	
	On February 11, 1993, the Company entered into a three-year OEM agreement 
with Bull.  Pursuant to the agreement, EMC granted Bull exclusive worldwide 
marketing rights, with the exception of Japan, to EMC's Symmetrix 4800 series
of ICDA-based storage products for Bull mainframe computers, provided that Bull 
purchases all of its requirements for high speed cached disk array storage 
devices from EMC and meets certain minimum purchase requirements.

Open Systems Storage Market

	In May 1993, the Company formed a Client/Server Division to develop storage 
products for the growing open systems storage market.  In November 1994, this 
division became known as the Open Storage Group.  The Company believes that 
this market requires sophisticated data management technology to allow for 
sharing of information while maintaining data integrity and reliability.  The
Company's efforts are currently focused on further refining and developing a

                                   6
<PAGE>

marketing strategy and business plan for selling products into the open 
systems storage market.  In November 1994, the Open Storage Group introduced
the Centriplex family of ICDA products aimed at the open systems storage 
marketplace.  Centriplex connects up to eight heterogeneous open systems 
platforms to a single scalable storage device.  In 1993 and 1994, revenues
from the Company's Open Storage Group were immaterial.


Marketing and Customers

	EMC markets its products through multiple distribution channels, including its 
direct sales force, selected distributors and OEMs.  The Company has a direct 
sales presence throughout North America and Europe, and in parts of the Asia
Pacific region and uses distributors as its primary distribution channel in the
rest of the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East, Africa and South America.  
Over the past two years, the Company has expanded its North American and 
European sales and marketing organizations significantly and currently is 
expanding its sales and marketing organizations in the Asia Pacific region.
In this regard, in January 1994, the Company and its existing Japanese 
distributor jointly formed a company in Japan, in which the Company held a 
60% interest.  Through this entity, during 1994, the Company acquired and 
expanded its direct sales force in Japan.  In December 1994, EMC purchased 
an additional 35% of this venture from the Japanese distributor, thereby 
making EMC the owner of 95% of the joint venture company.  

	During 1994, the Company derived 63% of its product revenue from shipments 
into North and South America, 32% from shipments into Europe, the Middle East 
and Africa, and 5% from shipments into the Asia Pacific region.  EMC's 
marketing and sales personnel are organized into mainframe, midrange and open
storage customer groups to ensure that the necessary expertise is available 
to understand the customer's requirements and properly apply the Company's 
product solutions.  In addition, the Company has dedicated personnel to 
support the needs of its distributors and OEM customers, both domestically 
and internationally.

Operations

	EMC's products utilize the Company's engineering designs, with industry 
standard and semi-custom components and subsystems.  The majority of EMC's 
products are manufactured and tested at the Company's facilities in Hopkinton, 
Massachusetts and Cork, Ireland.  Products manufactured by subcontractors in 
the U.S. and Europe are assembled in accordance with production standards and
quality controls established by EMC.  The Company discontinued board assembly
at its Canovanas, Puerto Rico facility in February 1994 and such assembly is
now being performed by existing subcontractors.  The Company believes its
present level of manufacturing capacity, along with its current plans for 
expansion, will be sufficient to accommodate its requirements.  

	 The Company purchases certain components and products from suppliers who 
the Company believes are currently the only suppliers of those components or
products that meet the Company's requirements.  Among the most important 

                                    7
<PAGE>

components that the Company uses are high density memory components ("DRAMs")
and 5 1/4" and 3 1/2" disk drives, which the Company purchases from a small 
number of qualified suppliers.  In some instances there is only a single 
source for such components.  A failure by any supplier of high density DRAMs 
or disk drives to meet the Company's requirements for an extended period of 
time could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  From time to time
during 1994, because of high industry demand and/or the inability of certain
vendors to consistently meet on a timely basis the Company's component 
quality standards, the Company experienced delays in deliveries of high 
density DRAMs and disk drives needed to satisfy orders for ICDA products. 
During the latter part of 1994, the Company experienced difficulties in the 
performance of certain disk drives, which required the Company to take 
certain remedial measures, including mirroring of drives in selected systems.
The Company is currently working with the vendor to correct these problems 
and is also seeking alternative sources of supply.  If such shortages and/or
performance problems were to intensify, the Company could lose some time-
sensitive customer orders and this could affect quarterly revenues.

	The Company has implemented a Total Quality Management philosophy to ensure
the quality of its designs, manufacturing process and suppliers.  

	The Company's U.S. operation currently holds an ISO 9001 Certificate of 
Registration from National Quality Assurance, Ltd.  This internationally 
recognized endorsement of ongoing quality management represents the highest
level of certification available.  The Company's Irish manufacturing 
operation also holds ISO 9002 certification.  The Company's principal 
manufacturing operation in Hopkinton has also been awarded Class A MRP II 
status by an independent evaluation organization.

Manufacturing Risks

	The Company's products operate near the limits of electronic and physical 
performance and are designed and manufactured with relatively small performance 
margins.  If flaws in design or production occur, the Company could experience
a rate of failure in its products that would result in substantial costs for
the repair or replacement of defective products and potential damage to the
Company's reputation.  Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, 
control of supplier quality and manufacturing costs will be critical factors
in the future growth of the Company.  The Company frequently revises and 
updates manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component
changes to its products and evaluates the reallocation of manufacturing 
resources among its facilities.  The Company's failure to monitor, develop 
and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for its products, 
especially the Symmetrix and Harmonix series, could have substantial adverse 
effects on the Company's operations and ultimately on its financial results.

Competition

	EMC competes primarily with IBM in the sale of storage products in the IBM 
and IBM-compatible mainframe and midrange marketplaces. The Company believes 
that it has a number of competitive advantages over IBM, especially in the 

                                    8
<PAGE>

areas of product performance, cost of ownership, and time-to-market. While 
the Company believes that its ICDA technology provides a significant 
technological advantage, competition in this area has begun and may increase
significantly in the future, which could adversely affect the Company's 
profitability.  The Company also realizes that IBM has certain competitive 
advantages including significantly greater financial and technological 
resources, a larger distribution capability, earlier access to customers and 
a greater level of customer loyalty. Other important elements of competition in
the computer storage industry are product reliability and quality, continuing
technological improvements, marketing and customer service, and product design. 

	There are also a number of independent competitors in each of EMC's markets. 
In the mainframe market those competitors include Hitachi Data Systems, Inc., 
Amdahl Corporation and Storage Technology Corporation ("STK").  In the 
midrange market, competition has historically come from smaller companies, as
well as IBM and STK.  EMC believes that it has similar advantages over these
midrange competitors, but increased competition from these or future entrants
could adversely affect the Company's profitability.  In the open systems 
market, the Company's major competitors include IBM, Hewlett-Packard Company,
Sun Microsystems, Inc., and AT&T Corporation.

Technological Factors

	The computer data storage industry is characterized by rapidly changing 
technology and user needs which require ongoing technological development and 
introduction of new products.  Recognizing this fact, the Company has developed
a storage system architecture called MOSAIC:2000 to allow the Company to take 
advantage of technological developments.  By employing this architectural 
approach to product development, EMC is able to quickly integrate new 
technologies into its basic design.  The Company works closely with its 
suppliers to understand their technology direction and to plan for the 
integration of this technology into its product architecture.  The Symmetrix
series, the Harmonix series and the Centriplex family of products all use the
MOSAIC:2000 architecture.

	In 1994, sales of the Symmetrix series remained the most significant source of 
revenues for the Company and sales of such products are expected to continue to
be the most significant source of revenues during 1995.  In April 1992, EMC
released a new series of midrange disk storage systems, the Harmonix series,
which have also become a significant source of revenues for the Company.  The
Company expects competition in the sales of ICDA-based products to increase and
there can be no assurance that the Symmetrix series and Harmonix series of 
products will continue to achieve market acceptance.  Significant delays in the
development of ICDA technology for future products or product enhancements 
would be to the advantage of the Company's competitors, many of whom have 
significantly greater resources, and could ultimately affect the Company's 
financial condition.  Furthermore, the continued development of ICDA technology
and its incorporation into the Company's future generations of products cannot
be assured even with significant additional investments.

                                    9
<PAGE>
 
Product Development

	EMC's ability to compete successfully in present and future markets depends 
upon the timely development and introduction of products offering price/
performance or capacity advantages and compatibility with the computer systems
for which they are designed.  Achieving these goals requires that the Company
remain abreast of changing technology and design products that operate within
the architecture of various computer systems and deliver performance or capacity
advantages not offered by the original systems developer or by other storage
competitors.  Moreover, the computer industry is subject to rapid technological
developments.  Consequently, achieving such goals may become more difficult, 
costly and time consuming as a result of technological developments that cannot
now be foreseen.  Research and development costs were $117,922,000, $58,977,000
and $33,591,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1994, January 1, 1994,
and January 2, 1993, respectively.
	
Working Capital  

	It is typical for companies in the computer industry to require significant 
amounts of working capital to finance inventory and receivables.  The Company 
believes that its working capital requirements are in accordance with industry
practices.  In 1994, the Company financed its working capital requirements from
internally generated funds and existing cash and investments.  This also 
includes the net proceeds of $229,600,000 received from the sale in December 
1993 of 41/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2001 (which includes exercise
of the underwriters' over-allotment option).  As of February 1, 1995, the 
Company had available for use its entire $65,000,000 of credit lines and the
Company may elect to borrow capital at any time to fund new growth 
opportunities.  As the Company's product mix shifts to higher cost products with
longer sales cycles, the Company's need for working capital is expected to 
increase.   

Backlog

	The Company manufactures its products on the basis of its forecast of near-term
demand and maintains inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from 
customers.  Orders are generally shipped by the Company shortly after receipt
of the order.  Customers may reschedule orders with little or no penalty.  For
these reasons, the Company's backlog at any particular time is not indicative
of future sales levels.

Employees

	As of February 28, 1995, EMC had approximately 3,375 employees worldwide 
including temporary employees.  Continued growth in the Company's business will 
require the hiring of additional qualified personnel.  Under current market 
conditions, the Company does not expect to encounter any difficulty in hiring
such personnel.  None of the Company's domestic employees is represented by a
labor union, and the Company has never suffered an interruption of business as
a result of a labor dispute.  The Company considers its relations with its 
employees to be good.

                                    10
<PAGE>

Dependence Upon Key Personnel

	The Company's success is highly dependent upon senior management and other 
key employees, the loss of whom could adversely affect the Company.  The 
Company also believes that its future success will depend in large part upon
its ability to attract and retain additional key employees, of which there 
can be no assurance.

Environment

	The Company's manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and 
regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly from wastes 
generated as a result of assembling certain EMC products.  The cost of 
compliance with such regulations has not to date involved a significant 
expense or had a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or 
competitive position of the Company.

Patents

	EMC has twenty-two (22) U.S. patents and has approximately one hundred 
(100) patent applications pending in the U.S. and foreign patent offices 
relating to its products for the mainframe, midrange and open systems storage
markets.  While the Company believes that the pending applications relate to
patentable devices or concepts, there can be no assurance that any patents will
issue or that any patent issued can be successfully defended.  In any case, the
Company believes that patents are of less significance in its industry than 
such factors as innovative skills, technological expertise and the management
ability of its personnel.

Earnings Fluctuations

	Due to (i) customers' tendencies to make purchase decisions late in each fiscal
quarter, (ii) the desire by customers to evaluate new, more expensive products
for longer periods of time, (iii) the timing of product and technology announce-
ments by the Company and its competitors, and (iv) fluctuating currency exchange
rates, the Company's period-to-period revenues and earnings can fluctuate 
significantly.

Recent Developments

Massachusetts.  This facility has been renovated by the Company and is in use
as its customer demonstration center and for certain administrative functions.
In November 1993, the Company transferred certain of its corporate and

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

	On June 10, 1993, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit against 
EMC in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado alleging
that EMC is infringing three patents.  In the complaint, STK seeks injunctive
relief, unspecified damages, including treble damages, plus attorney's fees and
costs.  On July 20, 1993, EMC answered the complaint, denied STK's allegations
and counterclaimed.  In the counterclaims, EMC seeks unspecified damages, 
attorney's fees, costs and interest.  In a court hearing on October 12, 1994,
STK's claims on two of the three patents were dismissed with prejudice.  
Discovery on the sole remaining patent in the matter is currently in process.
The originally scheduled trial date of October 24, 1994 has been postponed.

	On September 23, 1994, EMC filed suit against STK in the United States 
District Court for Delaware alleging that STK is infringing one EMC patent.

Unisys mainframe markets were $1,177,014,000 in 1994, $620,178,000 in 1993 and
$235,720,000 in 1992, representing an increase in 1994 from 1993 of 
$556,836,000 or 90%.  Revenues from the Harmonix series were $110,717,000 in
1994, $92,672,000 in 1993 and $49,147,000 in 1992.  In 1994, the Company 
generated approximately 94% of its revenue from sales of ICDA-based products

                                        21

versus approximately 91% and 74% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  It is expected
that revenues from ICDA-based products will continue to be the most significant
component of the Company's revenues in 1995.  While the Company expects revenue
to continue to grow in 1995, such growth may not, on a percentage basis,
continue at the level experienced in 1994.

	Revenues on sales into the markets of North and South America increased by 
$346,750,000, or 67%, to $865,687,000 in 1994 from $518,937,000 in 1993 due 
primarily to increased unit sales of the Symmetrix series of products, including
the Symmetrix 5500 series and the Symmetrix 5200 series which was introduced 
in 1994, both in the IBM mainframe storage market.  Revenues on sales into the
markets of North and South America from the Symmetrix series of products were
$732,883,000 in 1994, or 85% of revenues in this region and $400,933,000 in 
1993 or 77% of revenues in this region.

	Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, the Middle East and Africa 
increased by $213,291,000, or 94%, to $439,524,000 in 1994 from $226,233,000
in 1993 due primarily to continued growth in unit sales of the Symmetrix series
of products in the IBM, Bull and Unisys mainframe storage markets.

	Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region increased by 
$34,830,000, or 93%, to $72,281,000 in 1994 from $37,451,000 in 1993 due 
primarily to the growth in unit sales of the Symmetrix series of products in the
IBM mainframe storage market.  The Company strengthened its sales presence in 
the Asia Pacific region with the formation of EMC Japan K.K. in January 1994.

	Worldwide revenue data presented in the segment footnote shows revenues on 
shipments originating from each area as follows.  Revenues on shipments from the
North and South American region were $871,048,000 and $526,771,000 in 1994 and
1993, respectively. Revenues on shipments from the Europe, Middle East and 
Africa region were $449,467,000 and $251,363,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Revenues on shipments from the Asia Pacific Region were $56,977,000 and 
$4,487,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

	The Company has Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") agreements with Bull 
and Unisys.  The Company's OEM agreement for the sale of the Company's mainframe
products as Unisys-compatible products to Unisys extends through December 31,
1998.  In February 1993, the Company entered into a three-year OEM agreement 
with Bull.  Pursuant to this agreement, EMC grants Bull the exclusive worldwide
marketing rights, with the exception of Japan, to EMC's Symmetrix 4800 series
of ICDA-based storage products for Bull mainframe computers, provided that Bull
purchases all of its requirements for high speed cached disk array storage 
devices from EMC.  Failure by Bull in the future to purchase at least 45% of
forecasted purchases at designated times, on a cumulative basis, may result in
loss of exclusivity to Bull.
 
                                     22
<PAGE>

ITEM 7 continued. . . .

	Historically, the Company has competed with OEM manufacturers and other 
independent suppliers on the basis of product performance, quality and price.
The Company expects that there will be performance and pricing pressures with
respect to the sale of its products throughout 1995.  See also "Cost of Sales
and Service".
	
	The Company purchases certain components and products from suppliers who 
the Company believes are currently the only suppliers of those components or 
products that meet the Company's requirements.  Among the most important 
components that the Company uses are high density memory components ("DRAMs")
and 5 1/4" and 3 1/2" disk drives, which the Company purchases from a small 
number of qualified suppliers.  In some instances there is only a single source
for such components.  A failure by any supplier of high density DRAMs or disk
drives to meet the Company's requirements for an extended period of time could
have a material adverse effect on the Company.  From time to time during 1994,
because of high industry demand and/or the inability of certain vendors to 
consistently meet on a timely basis the Company's component quality standards,
the Company experienced delays in deliveries of high density DRAMs and disk 
drives needed to satisfy orders for ICDA products.  During the latter part of
1994, the Company experienced difficulties in the performance of certain disk
drives, which required the Company to take certain remedial measures, including
mirroring of drives in selected systems. The Company is currently working with
the vendor to correct these problems and is also seeking alternative sources of 
supply.  If such shortages and/or performance problems were to intensify, the 
Company could lose some time-sensitive customer orders and this could affect
quarterly revenues.

Cost of Sales and Service

	As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales amounted to 47.9% in 1994, 48.7% in 
1993 and 53.7% in 1992.  The improvement in the cost of sales percentage in 
1994 and 1993 over 1992 was due primarily to continuing increased sales of the
higher margin Symmetrix series of products through the Company's direct sales
force. During 1994, the Company experienced some gross margin pressure in the
mainframe and midrange product markets primarily due to competitive pricing 
pressures and the increased material costs associated with the need to 
specially configure selected systems on a mirrored basis.  The Company expects
that pricing pressures are likely to continue.  Gross margins may be affected
so long as pricing pressures continue and/or the Company maintains its disk 
mirroring program.

Research and Development

	Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $117,922,000, $58,977,000, 
and $33,591,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  As a percentage of
revenue, such expenses were 8.6%, 7.5% and 8.7% in 1994, 1993 and 1992, 
respectively.  Increases in R&D spending in 1994 and 1993 reflect additional 
purchases of state-of-the-art CAE/CAD design tools and the cost of additional 
technical staff and other costs associated with the Company's Open Systems 
Storage Group and the Centriplex product.  Increases in R&D

                                   23
<PAGE>

ITEM 7 continued...

spending in 1994 over 1993 also reflect the costs of the Company's R&D 
facilities at Epoch beginning in the third quarter of 1993, and at Copernique,
Array and at EMC's subsidiary in Israel beginning in the first quarter of 1994.
The Company expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D in 1995.

Selling, General and Administrative

	Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased by $86,543,000,
or 53% in 1994, $66,200,000, or 69% in 1993 and $19,567,000, or 26%, in 1992.  
As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 18.1%, 20.8% and 25.0% in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

	The dollar increases in all three years were due primarily to costs associated
with additional sales and support personnel, and related overhead costs, both 
domestically and internationally, required to support the increased revenue
levels and the Company's initiative to expand its OEM and international 
distribution programs.  SG&A expenses are expected to increase in dollar terms
in 1995, approximately in proportion to growth in revenues.

Investment Income and Interest Expense

	Investment income increased to $21,619,000 in 1994 from $7,988,000 in 1993 and 
$3,830,000 in 1992.  Income was earned from investments in cash equivalents and
long-term investments and from sales-type leases of the Company's products.
Investment income in 1994 increased due to higher average cash and investment
balances caused primarily by the availability of funds from the issuance of 
the 4 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2001 (the "Notes") in December 
1993 and January 1994.  Investment income in 1993 increased due to higher 
average cash and investment balances caused primarily by the proceeds received
from the sale of the Notes in December 1993, the offering of EMC common stock,
$.01 par value (the "Common Stock") in March 1993, and a full year's 
availability of funds from the issuance of the 6 1/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2002 (the "Debentures") in March 1992.  

	Interest expense increased to $15,311,000 in 1994 from $6,043,000 in 1993 and 
$4,865,000 in 1992.  The increase of $9,268,000 in 1994 from 1993 levels was 
due primarily to the provision for interest payments due on the Notes 
throughout 1994.

Provision for Taxes

	The provision for income taxes was $104,716,000 in 1994, $52,534,000 in 1993 
and $13,567,000 in 1992, which resulted in effective tax rates of 29.5%, 29% 
and 32% in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The increase in the effective tax
rate in 1994 from 1993 is mainly attributable to a decrease in tax credits. 
The decrease in the effective tax rate in 1993 from 1992 is mainly attributable
to an increase of tax benefits from the Company's Irish operations.  

                                     24
<PAGE>

ITEM 7 continued... 

	See Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed
analysis of the Company's effective tax rates for 1994, 1993 and 1992.

Earnings Fluctuations

	Due to (i) customers' tendencies to make purchase decisions late in each fiscal
quarter, (ii) the desire by customers to evaluate new, more expensive products 
for longer periods of time, (iii) the timing of product and technology 
announcements by the Company and its competitors, and (iv) fluctuating 
currency exchange rates, the Company's period to period revenues and earnings 
can fluctuate significantly.

Financial Position

	At the end of the fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, cash and cash equivalents
totaled $240,506,000, $345,300,000 and $62,103,000, respectively.  In 1994, 
working capital increased by $83,465,000 from $516,876,000 to $600,341,000.
In 1993, working capital increased by $367,541,000 from $149,335,000 to 
$516,876,000.  

	As of February 1, 1995, the Company had available for use its entire 
$65,000,000 of credit lines.  Based on its current operating and capital 
expenditure forecasts, the Company believes funds currently available, funds
generated from operations and its available lines of credit will be adequate
to finance its operations.
	
	In February 1995, the Company notified holders of its Debentures that the 
Company intends to redeem the Debentures on April 1, 1995, unless the holders
choose to convert on or prior to such date.

	To date, inflation has not had a material impact on the Company's financial 
results.

Cash Flows

	In 1994 cash and cash equivalents decreased by $104,794,000.  Cash provided
by operating activities was $77,406,000.  Balances in receivables, inventory,
payables and accrued expenses increased substantially associated with the 
Company's growth. Net trade and notes receivable increased by $221,708,000 
from 1993 to 1994 and inventory increased by $133,159,000 from 1993 to 1994.
Days Sales Outstanding was 76 at December 31, 1994.  In 1994, $233,762,000 was
used by investing activities principally to fund additions to property, plant
and equipment of $108,968,000 and a net increase in long-term investments of
$125,239,000.  Cash provided by financing activities of $49,069,000 was 
primarily from $29,350,000 in net proceeds from the January 1994 overallotment
of the offering of the Notes, and $9,596,000 from issuances of the Company's
Common Stock.    

	In 1993 cash and cash equivalents increased by $283,197,000, of which  
$56,796,000 was provided by operating activities. Net income was $127,122,000 in
1993, an increase of $97,614,000 or 331% over 1992 and balances in receivables,

                                     25
<PAGE>

ITEM 7 continued...

inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses increased associated with this 
growth. Net trade and notes receivable increased by $73,252,000 and inventory 
increased by $60,937,000.  $79,829,000 was used by investing activities in 1993 
mainly caused by additions to property, plant and equipment of $51,303,000 and
a net increase in long-term investments of $29,100,000.  $305,008,000 was 
provided by financing activities including $194,987,000 net proceeds from the
December 1993 offering of the Notes, and $112,451,000 from issuances of the 
Company's Common Stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
EMC Corporation
	
A.    Company

 	EMC Corporation and its subsidiaries ("EMC" or the "Company") design, 
manufacture, market and support high performance storage products and provide 
related services for mainframe and midrange computer systems manufactured 
primarily by International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Unisys 
Corporation ("Unisys") and Compagnie des Machines Bull S.A. ("Bull").  In 
addition, the Company recently announced a family of products aimed at the 
open systems storage marketplace.

B.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

	Basis of Presentation

	Certain prior year amounts in the financial statements have been reclassified
to conform with the 1994 presentation.  The Company's fiscal year ends on the 
Saturday closest to December 31.  Fiscal 1992 was a 53 week year and fiscal 
1994 and 1993 were 52 week years.

	Principles of Consolidation

	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.

	Acquisitions

	The Company formed a joint venture, EMC Japan K.K. ("EMC Japan"), with a 
Japanese distributor in January 1994 in which the Company's interest was 60%.  
In December 1994, the Company purchased an additional 35% of this venture 
from the Japanese distributor, resulting in goodwill of $8,971,000, which was 
included in other assets, non-current (net of $150,000 of accumulated 
amortization), at December 31, 1994 and is being amortized over five years.

	The Company acquired a 93% interest in Copernique S.A. ("Copernique") in the 
first quarter of 1994.  Copernique specializes in high performance data 
management hardware and software systems.
 
	During the first quarter of 1994, the Company acquired certain assets of 
Colorado-based Array Technology Corporation ("Array"), which specializes in 
RAID ("Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks") technology.  Other assets, 
non-current at December 31, 1994 includes patents acquired in the purchase of

                                     32
<PAGE>

ITEM 8 continued... 

Array of $7,272,000, net of $1,212,000 of accumulated amortization.  These 
assets are being amortized over their estimated useful life of five years.	

	Proforma presentations have not been included as the 1994 acquisitions were
not material to the results of operations of the Company.  

	In August 1993, EMC exchanged 9,443,996 shares of EMC common stock, $.01 
par value (the "Common Stock") for all of the outstanding stock and stock 
options of Epoch Systems, Inc. ("Epoch") and Magna Computer Corp. 
("Magna").  These business combinations were accounted for as poolings of 
interests.  Accordingly, all financial information has been restated as if the 
transactions occurred at the beginning of the first period presented.  Epoch 
was in the business of high performance client/server data management software.
Magna was in the business of IBM compatible AS/400 tape products.
	

	Revenue Recognition

	The Company recognizes revenue from sales when products are shipped provided 
there are no remaining significant vendor obligations and the resulting 
receivable is deemed collectible by management.  Revenue from rentals is 
recorded over the life of the lease.  Revenue from sales-type leases is 
recognized at the net present value of expected future payments, and the 
resulting discount is accreted to investment income over the collection period.
Revenue from service contracts is recognized over the life of the contracts.

	Foreign Currency Translation

	The functional currency of sales operations in Europe, Japan and Australia is
the local currency.  Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period.
The Company's operations in Ireland, Israel and Hong Kong are generally 
dependent on the U.S. dollar.  The assets and liabilities of these operations
are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance 
sheet date except for inventories and property and equipment which are 
translated at historical exchange rates.  Income and expense items are 
translated at average rates for the period except for cost of sales and 
depreciation which are translated at historical exchange rates.  

Consolidated transaction losses included in other expense, net amounted to 
$1,072,000 in 1994, $1,838,000 in 1993 and  $1,093,000 in 1992.  
Accumulated net translation adjustments of $3,716,000 and $1,537,000 are 
included in stockholders' equity at December 31, 1994 and January 1, 1994, 
respectively.

	Cash and Cash Equivalents

	Cash and cash equivalents include $134,954,000 and $310,723,000 of temporary  
cash investments at December 31, 1994 and January 1, 1994, respectively.  
Temporary cash investments consist primarily of money market funds and 
commercial paper stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates 
market.  Short term investments which have a maturity when acquired of ninety 
days or less are considered cash equivalents.

	Long-Term Investments

	The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 
("SFAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 
Securities" in 1994.  The adoption of SFAS 115 had no cumulative effect on net 
income.

	Long-term investments at amortized cost, consisting primarily of intermediate 
term debt instruments, amounted to $175,631,000 and $50,392,000 in 1994 and 
1993, with fair values of $173,245,000 and $50,042,000, respectively.  The 
Company classifies its long-term investments as held to maturity.  The 1994 
balances consisted of:

	The net unrealized loss of $2,386,000 at December 31, 1994 consisted of gross 
unrealized gains of $444,000 and gross unrealized losses of $2,830,000.  The 
contractual maturities of debt securities held at December 31, 1994 are as 
follows:

                                 Amortized           Aggregate

             Total             $175,631,000        $173,245,000


	Investment income consists principally of interest and dividend income,
including interest on notes receivable from sales-type leases.

	Income Taxes

	Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax 
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or
tax returns.  Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are 
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax 
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the 
year in which the differences are expected to reverse (see Note C).

	Tax credits are generally recognized as reductions of income tax provisions in
the year in which the credits arise.  Since 1989, the Company has not provided
for the U.S. income tax liability on earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, 
except for Puerto Rico, as these earnings are considered to be permanently 
reinvested.  Taxes for the Company's foreign subsidiaries are provided for at
applicable statutory rates.  The Company is currently undergoing an examination
of its 1991, 1992 and 1993 tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service.
	
	Net Income Per Share

	Net income per share was computed on the basis of weighted average common 
and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding.  Primary and fully diluted 
weighted average shares outstanding and earnings used in per share computations 
for 1994 and 1993 reflect the dilutive effects of the Notes.  Fully diluted 
weighted average shares outstanding and earnings used in per share computations 
for 1994, 1993 and 1992 reflect the dilutive effects of the Debentures.  Net 
income for computation of earnings per share includes an add back of 
$7,620,000, $2,496,000 and $1,768,000 for fully diluted and $5,855,000, 
$224,000 and $0 for primary, in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, representing 
interest expense, net of its tax effect.  Primary weighted average shares for
net income per share computations amounted to 218,045,666, 196,486,160 and 
171,951,696 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Fully diluted weighted 
average shares were 234,254,640, 217,224,726 and 190,547,980 in 1994, 1993 
and 1992, respectively.  These calculations of weighted average shares have 
been restated to reflect all stock splits to date (see Note J).

laws.  EMC Caribe ceased manufacturing operations in February 1994.  The 
Company's manufacturing facility in Ireland enjoys a 10% tax rate on income 
from manufacturing operations until the year 2000.  The impact of these 
benefits on the Company's earnings per share was $0.10 for the year ended 
December 31, 1994, $0.06 for the year ended January 1, 1994 and $0.01 for the
year ended January 2, 1993.

	The Company increased its domestic deferred tax asset in 1993 as a result of
U.S. legislation enacted during 1993 increasing the federal corporate tax rate
from 34% to 35%.  The components of the current and non-current deferred tax
assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1994 and January 1, 1994 were as

Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of certain favorable tax
attributes in future tax returns, the Company has placed a valuation reserve
against these otherwise recognizable deferred tax assets.  The valuation 
reserve has increased as a result of an increase in the foreign net operating
losses.
	
The Company has net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 1994 which
are summarized as follows:

H.	Employee Compensation Plans 

	In 1983, the Company initiated a profit-sharing plan (the "1983 Plan") for 
employees, whose eligibility to participate is based on certain service 
requirements.  Contributions are made at the discretion of the Board of 
Directors.  

	No profit-sharing contributions were made in 1994 or 1993.  During December 
1992 the Company made a profit-sharing contribution to active employees who 
were employed by the Company on or before January 1, 1992, whose 
compensation was less than $60,000 for 1992 and who did not participate in any 
bonus or incentive program.  The amount of the contribution was $248,000.  

	In July 1985, the Company supplemented the 1983 Plan with a deferred 
compensation program for certain employees.  Under the program, which is 
qualified under Section 401(k) of federal tax laws, the Company has provided a 
matching contribution, as described below.

	Effective January 1, 1993, the Company introduced a new matching formula for 
the 1983 Plan.  The Company intends, at the end of each calendar quarter, to 
make a contribution that matches 100% of the employee's contribution up to a 
maximum of 2% of the employee's quarterly compensation.  Additionally, 
provided that certain quarterly profit goals are attained, the Company in 
succeeding quarters, will provide an additional matching contribution of 1% of 
the employee's quarterly compensation up to a maximum quarterly matching 
contribution not to exceed 5% of compensation.  However, the Company's 
matching contribution per participant has a quarterly limit of $500.  The 
Company's contribution amounted to approximately $2,277,000 in 1994 and 
$1,463,000 in 1993, pursuant to the previous formula.  The Company's 
contribution in 1992 amounted to approximately $889,000.

	In 1994, the Epoch Systems, Inc. and Magna Computer Corporation retirement 
savings plans were merged into the EMC Corporation Retirement Savings and 
Profit Sharing Plan.

	The Company does not offer a postretirement or postemployment benefit plan.

$15,000,000, respectively, at LIBOR plus 45 basis points and 62.5 basis points, 
respectively.  At December 31, 1994 and January 1, 1994, there were no 
borrowings outstanding against these credit lines.  The Company must maintain 
certain minimum financial ratios including a minimum level of working capital 
and tangible net worth under each line of credit.  At December 31, 1994, 
$8,427,000 was borrowed against the Company's overdraft facility at 6.4%.

the Company was granted an additional $1,650,000 from the IDA.  The grants 
are included in long-term obligations and are amortized over periods of 25 
years for funds used in building improvements and seven years for funds used to 
purchase equipment.  Remaining unamortized grants at December 31, 1994 are 
$2,197,000, of which $135,000 is current and $2,062,000 is long-term.

J. Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Stock Options

Common Stock

At the Annual Meetings of the Company in 1993 and 1992, the stockholders 
approved amendments to the Company's Articles of Organization to increase the 
number of shares of authorized Common Stock.  The current authorization is 
330,000,000 shares. 

The following stock splits were effected in the form of stock dividends in the 
following amounts and at the following dates:  a three-for-two stock split 
effective November 24, 1992, for stockholders of record on November 9, 1992, 
a two-for-one stock split effective June 8, 1993, for stockholders of record on 
May 24, 1993, and a two-for-one stock split effective December 10, 1993, for 
stockholders of record on November 26, 1993.

All share and per share data have been restated to reflect these splits.

	Preferred Stock

At the Special Meeting of Stockholders of the Company on November 17, 
1993, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Articles of 
Organization to authorize a new class of capital stock consisting of 25,000,000 
shares of Series Preferred Stock, $.01 par value, which may be issued from 
time to time in one or more series, with such terms as the Board of Directors 
may determine, without further action by the stockholders of the Company, 
except as may be required by applicable law or stock exchange rules.

	Stock Options

The Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the EMC Corporation 1993 
Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Plan") to provide qualified incentive stock
options and nonqualified stock options to key employees.  A total of 
6,000,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under this 
Plan.

Under the terms of the 1993 Plan the exercise price of incentive stock options 
issued must be equal to at least the fair market value of the Common Stock at 
the date of grant.  In the event that nonqualified stock options are granted, 
the exercise price may be less than the fair market value at the time of grant
but not less than par value which is $.01 per share.  In general, options 
become exercisable in equal annual installments over the first five years after
the date of grant.  As of December 31, 1994, options exercisable approximated
73,600.  Shares available for future options as of December 31, 1994 amounted
to 3,062,140.  Activity under the 1993 Plan for the two years ended 
December 31, 1994 is as follows:

The Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the 1985 Stock Option Plan 
(the "1985 Plan") to provide qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified 
stock options to key employees.  At the Annual Meeting of the Company on 
May 13, 1992, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 1985 Plan to 
increase the number of shares available for grant to 36,000,000 from 
27,000,000.

Under the terms of the 1985 Plan the exercise price of incentive stock options 
issued must be equal to at least the fair market value of the Common Stock at 
the date of grant.  In the event that nonqualified stock options are granted,
the exercise price may be less than the fair market value at the time of grant,
but in the case of employees not subject to Section 16 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 ("Section 16") no less than par value which is $.01 per
share, and in the case of employees subject to Section 16, no less than 50% 
of the fair market value at the time of grant.  In general, options become 
exercisable in equal annual installments over the first five years after the
date of grant.  As of December 31, 1994, options exercisable approximated 
1,957,632.  Shares available for future options as of December 31, 1994 
amounted to 330,148.  However, no incentive stock option may be granted under
the 1985 Plan after May 16, 1995, but options theretofore granted may extend
beyond that date.  Activity under the 1985 Plan for the three years ended 
December 31, 1994 is as follows:

In 1994, an employee of the Company was granted non-qualified options to 
purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock under the Company's 1993 Stock Option 
Plan at $9.94 per share, representing 50% of the per share fair market value at 
the date of the grant.  On July 17, 1992, certain executive officers of the 
Company were granted non-qualified options to purchase an aggregate of 
3,900,000 shares of Common Stock under the Company's 1985 Stock Option 
Plan at per share prices ranging from $1.43 to $2.43.  These prices represent 
50% to 85% of the per share fair market value at the date of grant.  Discounts 
from fair market value have been recorded as deferred compensation and are 
being charged to earnings over the five year vesting period of the options.

Generally, when shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock 
options are sold within one year of exercise or within two years from the date
of grant, the Company derives a tax deduction measured by the amount that the 
market value exceeds the option price at the date the options are exercised.

	On January 31, 1989, the Board of Directors adopted the 1989 Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan (the "1989 Plan") which was approved and adopted by the 
stockholders of the Company on May 10, 1989.  Under the 1989 Plan, eligible 
employees of the Company are given the option to purchase shares of Common 
Stock at 85% of fair market value by means of payroll deductions.  At the 
Annual Meeting of the Company on May 12, 1993 the stockholders approved an 
amendment to the 1989 Plan to increase the number of shares available from 
2,700,000 to 3,900,000.  Options are granted twice yearly, on January 1 and 
July 1, and are exercisable on the succeeding June 30 or December 31.  The 
purchase price for shares is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the
stock at the time of grant or 85% of said value at the time of exercise.  In 
1994, 387,218 shares were exercised at $11.48 per share.  In 1993, 190,492 
shares were exercised at $5.05 per share and 152,679 shares were exercised at
$9.19 per share.  In 1992, 292,088 shares were exercised at $1.47 per share,
290,436

                                      47

shares were exercised at $1.79 per share and 248,396 shares were exercised at 
$2.55 per share.

	At the Annual Meeting of the Company on May 12, 1992, the stockholders 
adopted the 1992 EMC Corporation Stock Option Plan for Directors (the 
"Directors Plan").

	A total of 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance 
under the Directors Plan which is administered by the Executive Stock Option 
and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors.  The 
exercise price for each option granted under the Directors Plan will be at a 
price per share determined by the Committee at the time the option is granted,
which price shall not be less than 50% of the fair market value per share of
Common Stock on the date of grant.  Options will be exercisable in increments of
20% for the shares covered thereby on each of the first through fifth 
anniversaries of the grant.

	On May 12, 1993, a director was granted options to purchase 160,000 shares of 
Common Stock at a per share price of $8.25, which represents 100% of the per 
share fair market value at the date of grant.  On May 12, 1992, a director was 
granted options to purchase 240,000 shares of Common Stock at a per share price 
of $1.26, which represents 50% of the per share fair market value at the date
of grant.  The discount from fair market value has been recorded as deferred 
compensation and is being amortized to earnings over the five year vesting 
period of the options.  In 1994, options to purchase 32,000 shares and 48,000
shares were exercised at $8.25 and $1.26, respectively.  In 1993, options to
purchase 48,000 shares were exercised at $1.26 per share.  All stock option 
plans and the employee stock purchase plan are administered by the Committee.

K.	Litigation 

	On June 10, 1993, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit against 
EMC in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado alleging
that EMC is infringing three patents.  In the complaint, STK seeks injunctive
relief, unspecified damages, including treble damages, plus attorney's fees 
and costs.  On July 20, 1993, EMC answered the complaint, denied STK's 
allegations and counterclaimed.  In the counterclaims, EMC seeks unspecified
damages, attorney's fees, costs and interest.  In a court hearing on 
October 12, 1994, STK's claims on two of the three patents were dismissed 
with prejudice. Discovery on the sole remaining patent in the matter is 
currently in process. The originally scheduled trial date of October 24, 
1994 has been postponed.

	On September 23, 1994, EMC filed suit against STK in the United States 
District Court for Delaware alleging that STK is infringing one EMC patent.
In the complaint, EMC seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages, 
including

                                    48   

ITEM 8 continued... 

treble damages, plus attorney's fees and costs. On October 12, 1994, STK
answered the complaint, denied any infringement and counterclaimed.  STK has 
subsequently filed an additional counterclaim.  EMC has denied STK's 
allegations.  Discovery on this case is currently in process.  A trial is 
expected in late 1995.

	The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine and 
incidental to its business.  Management does not expect the results of any of
these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or 
financial condition.

L.	Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk 

	Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
	
The Company enters into forward exchange and foreign currency option 
contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions on a continuing basis for 
periods consistent with its committed exposures.  The Company does not engage
in currency speculation.  The Company's foreign exchange contracts do not 
subject the Company to risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and
losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities
and transactions being hedged.  The foreign currency options are exercisable
at the Company's discretion and therefore do not subject the Company to risk
due to exchange rate movement.  The maximum amount of foreign currency contracts
outstanding during 1994 and 1993 was $96,479,000 and $53,390,000, respectively.
At December 31, 1994 and January 1, 1994, the Company had $89,691,000 and 
$50,354,000 of foreign exchange contracts outstanding, respectively, and 
$10,000,000 of foreign currency options at December 31, 1994.

	Concentrations of Credit Risk

	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, long-term 
investments and trade and notes receivables.  The Company places its temporary 
cash investments and long-term investments in investment grade instruments and 
limits the amount of investment with any one financial institution.

	The credit risk associated with trade receivables is minimal due to the large 
number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries 
and geographic areas.  During 1994 and 1993, no single customer accounted for 
greater than 10% of the Company's revenues. 

M.	Segment Information
 
	The Company is active in one business segment:  designing, manufacturing and 
marketing high performance storage products. Information by geographic area is

                                    49

	presented below with revenue derived from exports shown in their area of 
origin. Sales and marketing operations outside the United States are primarily
conducted through sales subsidiaries and branches located principally in 
Europe and Asia and by direct sales from the parent corporation or its Irish
manufacturing subsidiary.  The United States market amounted to greater than 
95% of the Company's sales, income and identifiable assets in the North/South
America segment.

	Intercompany transfers between geographic areas are accounted for at prices 
which are designed to be representative of unaffiliated party transactions.

                     Exhibit 10.1 1985 Stock Option Plan


                              EMC CORPORATION

            1985 STOCK OPTION PLAN, as amended December 31, 1994

1.	PURPOSE.

	The purpose of the EMC Corporation 1985 Stock Option Plan is to enable EMC 
Corporation to provide a special incentive to a limited number of key employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, who are in a position to have a
significant effect upon the Company's business and earnings.  In order to 
accomplish this purpose, the Plan authorizes the grant to such key employees
of options to purchase Common Stock of the Company.  Increased ownership of
Common Stock will provide such key employees with an additional incentive to
take into account the long-term interests of the Company.

the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members.  Any determination of
the Committee under the Plan may be made without notice or meeting of the

to interpret the terms of the Plan and of options granted under the Plan, to 
adopt, amend and rescind rules and guidelines for the administration of the 
Plan and for its own acts and proceedings and to decide all questions and

	3.3	The decision of the Committee on any matter as to which the Committee 
is given authority under subsection 3.2 shall be final and binding on all 
persons concerned.

Common Stock reacquired by the Company and held in its Treasury.  No 
fractional shares of Common Stock shall be delivered upon the exercise of an
option.

5.	ELIGIBILITY FOR OPTIONS.

	Employees eligible to receive options under the Plan shall be those key 
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, who, in the opinion of
the Committee, are in a position to have a significant effect upon the Company's
business and earnings.  Members of the Board of Directors of the Company or a
Subsidiary who are not employed as regular salaried officers or employees of
the Company or a Subsidiary may not participate in the Plan.

6.	GRANT OF OPTIONS.

	6.1	From time to time while the Plan is in effect the Committee may, in its 
absolute discretion, select from among the persons eligible to receive options
(including persons to whom options were previously granted) those persons to
whom options are to be granted.

	6.2	The Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine the number of 
shares of Common Stock to be subject to each option granted under the Plan.

	6.3	No Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after May 16, 
1995, but options theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.

7.	PROVISIONS OF OPTIONS.

	7.1	Incentive Stock Options or Other Options.  Options granted under the 
Plan may be either Incentive Stock Options or options which do not qualify as
Incentive Stock Options, as the Committee shall determine at the time of each
grant of options hereunder.

	7.2	Stock Option Certificates or Agreements.  Options granted under the Plan
shall be evidenced by certificates or agreements in such form as the Committee 
shall from time to time approve.  Such certificates or agreements shall comply
with the terms and conditions of the Plan and may contain such other provisions
not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan as the Committee 
shall deem advisable.  In the case of options intended to qualify as Incentive
Stock Options, the certificates or agreements shall contain such provisions
relating to exercise and other matters as are required of incentive stock 
options under the Code.

	7.3	Terms and Conditions.  All options granted under the Plan shall be 
subject to the following terms and conditions to the extent applicable and to
such other terms and conditions not inconsistent therewith as the Committee
shall determine:

		7.3.1	Exercise Price.  The exercise price per share of Common Stock 
with respect to each option shall be as determined by the Committee but in the 
case of an Incentive Stock Option not less than 100% (110% in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder) of the Fair 
Market Value per share at the time the option is granted.  In the case of an 
option which does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, the exercise price 
per share of Common Stock shall be not less than par value.  However, for 
those employees subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
the per share exercise price for an option which does not qualify as an 
Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 50% of the Fair Market Value at
the time the option is granted.

		7.3.2	Value of Shares of Common Stock Subject to Incentive Stock 
Options.  Each eligible employee may be granted Incentive Stock Options only 
to the extent that, in the aggregate under this Plan and all incentive stock 
option plans of the Company and any related corporation, such Incentive Stock
Options do not become exercisable for the first time by such employee during
any calendar year in a manner which would entitle the employee to purchase more 
than $100,000 in fair market value (determined at the time the Incentive Stock 
Options were granted) of Common Stock in that year.  Any options granted to 
any employee in excess of such amount will be granted as Non-Qualified 
Options.

		7.3.3	Period of Options.  An option shall be exercisable during such period
of time as the Committee may specify (subject to subsection 7.4 below), but 
in the case of an Incentive Stock Option not after the expiration of ten years 
(five years in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent 
Stockholder) from the date the option is granted.


		7.3.4	Exercise of Options.

		7.3.4.1   Each option shall be made exercisable at such time or 
times as the Committee shall determine.  In the case of an option made 
exercisable in installments, the Committee may later determine to 
accelerate the time at which one or more of such installments may be 
exercised.

		7.3.4.2   Any exercise of an option shall be in writing signed by 
the proper person and delivered or mailed to the General Counsel of the 
Company, accompanied by an option exercise notice and payment in full 
for the number of shares in respect to which the option is exercised.

		7.3.4.3   In the event an option is exercised by the executor or 
administrator of a deceased Participant, or by the person or persons to 
whom the option has been transferred by the Participant's will or the 
applicable laws of descent and distribution, the Company shall be under 
no obligation to deliver stock thereunder until the Company is satisfied 
that the person or persons exercising the option is or are the duly 
appointed executor or administrator of the deceased Participant or the 
person or persons to whom the option has been transferred by the 
Participant's will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution.

		7.3.4.4   The Committee may at the time of grant condition the 
exercise of an option upon agreement by the Participant to subject the 
Common Stock to any restrictions on transfer or repurchase rights in 
effect on the date of exercise, upon representations of continued 
employment and upon other terms not inconsistent with this Plan.  Any 
such conditions shall be set forth in the option certificate or other 
document evidencing the option.	

		7.3.4.5   In the case of an option that is not an Incentive Stock 
Option, the Committee shall have the right to require that the individual 
exercising the option to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to 
satisfy any federal, state, or local withholding tax requirements (or 
makes other arrangements satisfactory to the Company with regard to 
such taxes) prior to the delivery of any Common Stock pursuant to the 
exercise of the option.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, if at the 
time the Incentive Stock Option is exercised the Committee determines 
that under applicable law and regulations the Company could be liable 
for the withholding of any federal or state tax with respect to a 
disposition of the Common Stock received upon exercise, the Committee 
may require as a condition of exercise that the individual exercising the 
Incentive Stock Option agree (i) to inform the Company promptly of any 
disposition (within the meaning of Section 422 (a) (1) of the Code and 
the regulations thereunder) of Common Stock received upon exercise, 
and (ii) to give such security as the Committee deems adequate to meet 
the potential liability of the Company for the withholding of tax, and to 
augment such security from time to time in any amount reasonably 
deemed necessary by the Committee to preserve the adequacy of such 
security.

	7.3.4.6  In the case of an option that is exercised by an individual that is 
subject to taxation in a foreign jurisdiction, the Committee shall have the 
right to require the individual exercising the option to remit to the Company
an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal or withholding requirement of that
foreign jurisdiction (or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company
with regard to such taxes prior to the delivery of any Common Stock pursuant 
to the exercise of the option).

	7.3.5	Payment for and Delivery of Stock.   The shares of stock purchased on
any exercise of an option granted hereunder shall be paid for in full in cash
or, if permitted by the terms of the option, in shares of unrestricted 
Common Stock at the time of such exercise or, if so permitted, a combination 
of such cash and Common Stock.  A Participant shall not have the rights of a 
stockholder with respect to awards under the Plan except as to stock actually 
issued to him.

	7.3.6	Listing of Stock, Withholding and Other Legal Requirements.   
The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any stock until all federal and 
state laws and regulations which the Company may deem applicable have been 
complied with, nor, in the event the outstanding Common Stock is at the time 
listed upon any stock exchange, until the stock to be delivered has been listed
or authorized to be added to the list upon official notice of issuance to such 
exchange.  In addition, if the shares of stock subject to any option have not
been registered in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the 
Company may require the person or persons who wishes or wish to exercise such
option to make such representation or agreement with respect to the sale of 
stock acquired on exercise of the option as will be sufficient, in the opinion
of the Company's counsel, to avoid violation of said Act, and may also require 
that the certificates evidencing said stock bear an appropriate restrictive
legend.

	7.3.7	Non-transferability of Options.   No option may be transferred by the 
Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, 
and during the Participant's lifetime the option may be exercised only by him.

	7.3.8   Death.   If a Participant dies at a time when he is entitled to 
exercise an Incentive Stock Option, then at any time or times within three
years after his death such Incentive Stock Option may be exercised, as to all
or any of the shares which the Participant was entitled to purchase thereunder
immediately prior to his death, by his executor or administrator or the person
or persons to whom the Incentive Stock Option is transferred by will or the
applicable laws of descent and distribution, and except as so exercised such 
Incentive Stock Option shall expire at the end of such three-year period. 
In no event, however, may any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan 
be exercised after the expiration of ten years (five years in the case of an
Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder) from the date 
the Incentive Stock Option was granted.

	7.3.9	Termination of Employment.   If the employment of a Participant 
terminates for any reason other than his death, all options held by the 
Participant shall thereupon expire on the date of termination unless the option 
by its terms, or the Committee by resolution, shall allow the Participant to 
exercise any or all of the options held by him after termination.  In the case
of an Incentive Stock Option, the Incentive Stock Option shall in any event
expire at the end of three months after such termination of employment, or after
the expiration of ten years (five years in the case of an Incentive Stock 
Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder) from the date the Incentive Stock
Option was granted, whichever occurs first.  If the Committee so decides, an
option may provide that a leave of absence granted by the Company or Subsidiary
is not a termination of employment for the purpose of this subsection 7.3.9, 
and in the absence of such a provision the Committee may in any particular case 
determine that such a leave of absence is not a termination of employment for 
such purpose. The Committee shall also determine all other matters relating to 
continuous employment.

7.4	Authority of the Committee.   The Committee shall have the authority, 
either generally or in particular instances, to waive compliance by a 
Participant with any obligation to be performed by him under an option and to
waive any condition or provision of an option, except that the Committee may
not (i) increase the total number of shares covered by any Incentive Stock 
Option (except in accordance with Section 8), (ii) reduce the option price per
share of any Incentive Stock Option (except in accordance with Section 8) or
(iii) extend the term of any Incentive Stock Option to more than ten years, 
subject, however, to the provisions of Section 10.

8.	CHANGES IN STOCK.

	In the event of a stock dividend, stock split or other change in corporate 
structure or capitalization affecting the Common Stock that becomes effective
after the adoption of the Plan by the Board of Directors, the Committee shall
make appropriate adjustments in (i) the number and kind of shares of stock on
which options may thereafter be granted hereunder, (ii) the number and kind of
shares of stock remaining subject to each option outstanding at the time of such
change and (iii) the option price.  The Committee's determination shall be 
binding on all persons concerned.  Subject to any required action by the 
stockholders, if the Company shall be the surviving corporation in any merger
or consolidation (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company 
survives but in which a majority of its outstanding shares are converted into
securities of another corporation or are exchanged for other consideration), any
option granted hereunder shall pertain and apply to the securities which a 
holder of the number of shares of stock of the Company then subject to the 
option would have been entitled to receive, but a dissolution or liquidation of
the Company or a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the 
surviving corporation or in which a majority of its outstanding shares are so
converted or exchanged shall cause every option hereunder to terminate; 
provided that if any such dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation is
contemplated, the Company shall either arrange for any corporation succeeding
to the business and assets of the Company to issue to the Participants 
replacement options (which, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, satisfy,
in the determination of the Committee, the requirements of Section 424 of the
Code) on such corporation's stock which will to the extent possible preserve
the value of the outstanding options or shall make the outstanding options 
fully exercisable at least 20 days before the effective date of any such 
dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation.  The existence of the Plan 
shall not prevent any such change or other transaction and no Participant 
thereunder shall have any right except as herein expressly set forth.

9.	EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.

	Neither the adoption of the Plan nor any grant of options confers upon any 
employee of the Company or a Subsidiary any right to continued employment with
the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, nor does it interfere in any
way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment
of any of its employees at any time.

10.	DISCONTINUANCE, CANCELLATION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.

	The Committee may at any time discontinue granting options under the Plan and,
with the consent of the Participant, may at any time cancel an existing option
in whole or in part and grant another option to the Participant for such number
of shares as the Committee specifies.  The Board of Directors may at any time
or times amend the Plan for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of any 
changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other purpose which may
at the time be permitted by law or may at any time terminate the Plan as to 
any further grants of options, provided that no such amendment shall without
the approval of the stockholders of the Company (a) increase the maximum 
number of shares available under the Plan, (b) change the group of employees
eligible to receive options under the Plan, (c) reduce the exercise price of 
outstanding incentive options or reduce the price at which incentive options 
may be granted, (d) extend the time within which options may be granted, (e)
alter the Plan in such a way that incentive options granted or to be granted
hereunder would not be considered incentive stock options under Section 422 
of the Code, or (f) amend the provisions of this Section 10, and no such 
amendment shall adversely affect the rights of any employee (without his 
consent) under any option previously granted.

11.	EFFECTIVE DATE.

	The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption by the Board of Directors, 
and options may be granted under the Plan from and after the date of such 
adoption; provided, however, that if prior to  May 16, 1986 the stockholders of
the Company have not approved the Plan, the Plan shall terminate to the extent
that it relates to the issuance of Incentive Stock Options and all Incentive
Stock Options theretofore granted shall terminate and cease to be of any 
force or effect. No Incentive Stock Option granted hereunder shall be 
exercisable unless and until the Plan has been so approved.

              Exhibit 10.2 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

						                                                      
                               EMC CORPORATION
                      1989 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

Section 1.  Purpose of Plan

     The EMC Corporation 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan") is 
intended to provide a method by which eligible employees of EMC Corporation 
and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") may use voluntary, systematic
payroll deductions to purchase the Company's common stock, $.01 par value, 
("stock") and thereby acquire an interest in the future of the Company.  For
purposes of the Plan, a subsidiary is any corporation in which the Company owns,
directly or indirectly, stock possessing 50% or more of the total combined 
voting power of all classes of stock unless the Board of Directors determines
that employees of a particular subsidiary shall not be eligible.

Section 2.  Options to Purchase Stock

	Under the Plan as now amended, no more than 3,900,000 shares are available 
for purchase (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 16) pursuant to the
exercise of options ("options") granted under the Plan to employees of the 
Company ("employees").  The stock to be delivered upon exercise of options 
under the Plan may be either shares of the Company's authorized but unissued 
stock, or shares of reacquired stock, as the Board of Directors of the 
Company (the "Board of Directors") shall determine.

Section 3.  Eligible Employees

     Except as otherwise provided in Section 20, each employee who has completed
six months or more of continuous service in the employ of the Company shall be 
eligible to participate in the Plan.

Section 4.  Method of Participation

The periods January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31 of each year shall
be option periods.  Each person who will be an eligible employee on the first 
day of any option period may elect to participate in the Plan by executing and
delivering, at least 15 days prior to such day, a payroll deduction 
authorization in accordance with Section 5.  Such employee shall thereby become
a participant ("participant") on the first day of such option period and shall
remain a participant until his or her participation is terminated as provided
in the Plan.

Section 5.  Payroll Deductions

	The payroll deduction authorization shall request withholding, at a rate of
not less than 2% nor more than 10% from the participant's compensation 
(subject to a maximum of $2,500 per option period), by means of substantially
equal payroll deductions over the option period.  For purposes of the Plan, 
"compensation" shall mean all cash compensation paid to the participant by the
Company.  A participant may change the withholding rate of his or her payroll
deduction authorization by written notice delivered to the Company at least 15
days prior to the first day of the option period as to which the change is to 
be effective.  All amounts withheld in accordance with a participant's payroll 
deduction authorization shall be credited to a withholding account for such 
participant.

Section 6.  Grant of Options

     Each person who is a participant on the first day of an option period shall
as of such day be granted an option for such period.  Such option shall be for
the number of shares of stock to be determined by dividing (a) the balance in
the participant's withholding account on the last day of the option period by
(b) the purchase price per share of the stock determined under Section 7, and
eliminating any fractional share from the quotient.  The Company shall reduce
on a substantially proportionate basis the number of shares of stock receivable
by each participant upon exercise of his or her option for an option period in
the event that the number of shares then available under the Plan is otherwise
insufficient.

Section 7.  Purchase Price

     The purchase price of stock issued pursuant to the exercise of an option
shall be 85% of the fair market value of the stock at (a) the time of grant of
the option or (b) the time at which the option is deemed exercised, whichever 
is less.  Fair market value shall be determined in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or 
restated from time to time (the "Code"), or regulations issued thereunder, or,
in the absence of any such provisions or regulations, shall be deemed to be the
last sale price at which the stock is traded on the day in question or the last
prior date on which a trade occurred as reported in The Wall Street Journal; or,
if The Wall Street Journal is not published or does not list the stock, then in
such other appropriate newspaper of general circulation as the Board of 
Directors may prescribe; or, if the last price at which the stock traded is not
generally reported, then the mean between the reported bid and asked prices at
the close of the market on the day in question or the last prior date when such
prices were reported.



Section 8.  Exercise of Options

     If an employee is a participant in the Plan on the last business day of an
option period, he or she shall be deemed to have exercised the option granted
to him or her for that period.  Upon such exercise, the Company shall apply the
balance of the participant's withholding account to the purchase of the number
of whole shares of stock determined under Section 6, and as soon as practicable
thereafter shall issue and deliver certificates for said shares to the 
participant and shall return to him or her the balance, if any, of his or her
withholding account in excess of the total purchase price of the shares so 
issued.  No fractional shares shall be issued hereunder. 

     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be 
obligated to deliver any shares unless and until, in the opinion of the 
Company's counsel, all requirements of applicable federal and state laws and 
regulations (including any requirements as to legends) have been complied with,
nor, if the outstanding stock is at the time listed on any securities exchange,
unless and until the shares to be delivered have been listed (or authorized to
be added to the list upon official notice of issuance) upon such exchange, nor
unless or until all other legal matters in connection with the issuance and 
delivery of shares have been approved by the Company's counsel.

Section 9.  Interest

     No interest will be payable on withholding accounts.

Section 10.  Cancellation and Withdrawal

     A participant who holds an option under the Plan may at any time prior to
exercise thereof under Section 8 cancel all (but not less than all) of his or 
her option by written notice delivered to the Company.  Upon such cancellation,
the balance in his or her withholding account shall be returned to him or her.

     A participant may terminate his or her payroll deduction authorization as
of any date by written notice delivered to the Company and shall thereby cease
to be a participant as of such date.  Any participant who voluntarily terminates
his or her payroll deduction authorization prior to the last business day of an
option period shall be deemed to have cancelled his or her option.

Section 11.   Termination of Employment

     Except as otherwise provided in Section 12, upon the termination of a 
participant's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, he or she
shall cease to be a participant, and any option held by him or her under the 
Plan shall be deemed cancelled, the balance of his or her withholding account
shall be returned to him or her, and he or she shall have no further rights 
under the Plan.  For purposes of this Section 11, a participant's employment 
will not be considered terminated in the case of sick leave or other bona fide
leave of absence approved for purposes of this Plan by the Company or a 
subsidiary or in the case of a transfer to the employment of a subsidiary 
or to the employment of the Company. 

Section 12.  Death or Retirement of Participant

     In the event a participant holds any option hereunder at the time his or
her employment with the Company is terminated (1) by his or her retirement with
the consent of the Company, and such retirement is within three months of the
time such option becomes exercisable, or (2) by his or her death, whenever 
occurring, then such participant (or his or her legal representative), may, by
a writing delivered to the Company on or before the date such option is 
exercisable, elect either (a) to cancel any such option and receive in cash the
balance in his or her withholding account, or (b) to have the balance in his
or her withholding account applied as of the last day of the option period to
the exercise of his or her option pursuant to Section 8.  In the event such 
participant (or his or her legal representative) does not file a written 
election as provided above, any outstanding option shall be treated as if an
election had been filed pursuant to subparagraph 12(a) above.

Section 13.  Participant's Rights Not Transferable, etc.

     All participants granted options under the Plan shall have the same rights
and privileges.  Each participant's rights and privileges under any option 
granted under the Plan shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by
him or her, and shall not be sold, pledged, assigned, or otherwise transferred
in any manner whatsoever except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
In the event any participant violates the terms of this Section, any options
held by him or her may be terminated by the Company and, upon return to the 
participant of the balance of his or her withholding account, all his or her
rights under the Plan shall terminate.

Section 14.  Employment Rights

     Neither the adoption of the Plan nor any of the provisions of the Plan 
shall confer upon any  participant any right to continued employment with the 
Company or a subsidiary or affect in any way the right of the Company to 
terminate the employment of such participant at any time. 

Section 15.  Rights as a Shareholder

     A participant shall have the rights of a shareholder only as to stock 
actually acquired by him or her under the Plan.

Section 16.  Change in Capitalization

     In the event of a stock dividend, stock split or combination of shares, 
recapitalization, merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation or 
other change in the Company's capital stock, the number and kind of shares of
stock or securities of the Company to be subject to the Plan and to options 
then outstanding or to be granted hereunder, the maximum number of shares or 
securities which may be delivered under the Plan, the option price and other 
relevant provisions shall be appropriately adjusted by the Board of Directors,
whose determination shall be binding on all persons.  In the event of a 
consolidation or merger in which the Company is not the surviving corporation
or in the event of the sale or transfer of substantially all the Company's 
assets (other than by the grant of a mortgage or security interest), all 
outstanding options shall thereupon terminate, provided that prior to the 
effective date of any such merger, consolidation or sale of assets, the Board
of Directors shall either (a) return the balance in all withholding accounts
and cancel all outstanding options, or (b) accelerate the exercise date provided
for in Section 8, or (c) if there is a surviving or acquiring corporation, 
arrange to have that corporation or an affiliate of that corporation grant to
the participants replacement options having equivalent terms and conditions as
determined by the Board of Directors.

Section 17.  Administration of Plan

     The Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors.  The Board of 
Directors will have authority, not inconsistent with the express provisions of
the Plan, to take all action necessary or appropriate hereunder, to interpret
its provisions, and to decide all questions and resolve all disputes which may
arise in connection therewith.  Such determinations of the Board of Directors 
shall be conclusive and shall bind all parties.

     The Board may, in its discretion, delegate its powers with respect to the
Plan to an Employee Benefit Plan Committee or any other committee (the 
"Committee"), in which event all references to the Board of Directors hereunder,
including without limitation the references in Section 17, shall be deemed to
refer to the Committee.  A majority of the members of any such Committee shall
constitute a quorum, and all determinations of the Committee shall be made by
a majority of its members.  Any determination of the Committee under the Plan
may be made without notice or meeting of the Committee by a writing signed by
a majority of the Committee members.

Section 18.  Amendment and Termination of Plan

     The Board of Directors may at any time or times amend the Plan or amend 
any outstanding option or options for the purpose of satisfying the requirements
of any changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other purpose which 
may at the time be permitted by law, provided that (except to the extent 
explicitly required or permitted herein) no such amendment will, without the
approval of the shareholders of the Company, (a) increase the maximum number
of shares available under the Plan, (b) reduce the option price of outstanding
options or reduce the price at which options may be granted, (c) change the 
conditions for eligibility under the Plan, or (d) amend the provisions of this
Section 18 of the Plan, and no such amendment will adversely affect the rights
of any participant (without his or her consent) under any option theretofore 
granted. 

     The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board of Directors, but no 
such termination shall adversely affect the rights and privileges of holders of
the outstanding options.

Section 19.  Approval of Shareholders

     The Plan shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders of the
Company, which approval shall be secured within twelve months after the date the
Plan is adopted by the Board of Directors.  Notwithstanding any other provisions
of the Plan, no option shall be exercised prior to the date of such approval.

Section 20.  Limitations on Eligibility

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,  (a)  An employee shall
not be eligible to receive an option pursuant to the Plan if, immediately after
the grant of such option to him or her, he or she would (in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 423 and 425(d) of the Code) own or be deemed to own stock
possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes
of stock of the employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation,
as defined in Section 425 of the Code.

     (b)  No employee shall be granted an option under this Plan that would 
permit his or her rights to purchase shares of stock under this Plan of the 
Company to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 in fair market value of such
stock (determined at the time the option is granted) for each calendar year 
during which any such option granted to such employee is outstanding at any 
time, as provided in Sections 423 and 425 of the Code.

     (c)  No employee shall be granted an option under this Plan that would 
permit him or her to withhold more than $2,500 in each option period or $5,000
per calendar year.

            Exhibit 10.3 1992 Stock Options Plan for Directors


                              EMC CORPORATION

            1992 EMC CORPORATION STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS, 
                        as amended December 31, 1994

1.	PURPOSE

	The purpose of this 1992 Stock Option Plan for Directors (the "Plan") is to 
advance the interests of EMC Corporation (the "Company") by enhancing the 
ability of the Company to attract and retain directors who are in a position to
make significant contributions to the success of the Company and to reward 
directors for such contributions through ownership of shares of the Company's 
Common Stock (the "Stock").

2.	ADMINISTRATION

	The Plan shall be administered by the Executive Compensation and Stock 
Option Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of 
the Company. The Committee shall have authority, not inconsistent with the 
express provisions of the Plan (a) to grant options in accordance with the Plan
to such directors as are eligible to receive options; (b) to prescribe the 
form or forms of instruments evidencing options and any other instruments 
required under the Plan and to change such forms from time to time; (c) to 
adopt, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the administration of the
Plan; and (d) to interpret the Plan and decide any questions and settle all 
controversies and disputes that may arise in connection with the Plan.  Such 
determinations of the Committee shall be conclusive and shall bind all parties.
Subject to Section 7, the Committee shall also have the authority, both 
generally and in particular instances, to waive compliance by a director with
any obligation to be performed by him or her under an option and to waive any
condition or provision of an option.

3.	EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN

	The Plan shall become effective on the date on which the Plan is approved by 
the stockholders of the Company.  No option shall be granted under the Plan 
after the completion of ten years from the date on which the Plan was adopted 
by the Board, but options granted may extend beyond that date.

4.	SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

	(a)	Number of Shares.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c), 
the aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be delivered upon the exercise
of options granted under the Plan shall be 1,800,000.  If any option granted 
under the Plan terminates without having been exercised in full, the number of
shares of Stock as to which such option was not exercised shall be available for
future grants within the limits set forth in this Section 4(a).

	(b)	Shares to be Delivered.  Shares delivered under the Plan shall be 
authorized but unissued Stock or, if the Board so decides in its sole 
discretion, previously issued Stock acquired by the Company and held in 
treasury.  No fractional shares of Sock shall be delivered under the Plan.

	(c)	Changes in Stock.  In the event of a stock dividend, stock split or other 
change in corporate structure or capitalization affecting the Stock, the number
and kind of shares of stock or securities of the Company to be subject to 
options then outstanding or to be granted under the Plan, and the option price,
and other relevant provisions shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee,
whose determination shall be binding on all persons.

5.	ELIGIBILITY FOR OPTIONS 

	Directors eligible to receive options under the Plan ("Eligible Directors")
shall be those directors who (i) are not employees of the Company; and (ii) are
not holders of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Stock or persons 
in control of such holders.

6.	TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS

	(a)	Number of Options.   Eligible Directors who are directors on the date of 
stockholder approval of the Plan shall be awarded options to purchase up to
40,000 shares of Stock.  Following stockholder approval of the plan, each newly
elected Eligible Director shall be awarded options to purchase up to 40,000 
shares of Stock on the date of his or her first election.

	(b)	Exercise Price.  The exercise price of each option shall be at a price per 
share determined by the Committee at the time the option is granted, which price
shall not be less than 50% of the fair market value per share of the Stock at 
the time of the grant.  For this purpose "fair market value" shall mean the 
last sales price of the Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date of the grant (based on The Wall Street Journal report of composite 
transactions) or, if the Stock  is no longer listed on such Exchange, it shall
have the same meaning as it does in the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the "Code") and the regulations thereunder applicable to incentive 
options.

	(c)	Duration of Options.  The latest date on which an option may be exercised
(the "Final Exercise Date") shall be the date which is ten years from the date 
the option was granted.

	(d)	Exercise of Options.

	(1)	Each option shall become exercisable in increments of 20% of the shares 
covered thereby on each of the first through fifth anniversaries of the grant.

	(2)	Any exercise of an option shall be in writing, signed by the proper person
and delivered or mailed to the Company, accompanied by (a) an option exercise 
notice and any other documents required by the Committee; and (b) payment in 
full for the number of shares for which the option is exercised.

	(3)	If any option is exercised by the executor or administrator of a deceased 
director, or by the person or persons to whom the option has been transferred by
the director's will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution, the 
Company shall be under no obligation to deliver Stock pursuant to such exercise
until the Company is satisfied as to the authority of the person or persons 
exercising the option.

	(4)	The Company shall have the right to settle any option, and to terminate 
the rights of the holder thereof, by paying to the option holder the difference
between the fair market value of the Stock at the time of settlement and the
purchase price.

	(e)	Payment for and Delivery of Stock.  Stock purchased under the Plan shall 
be paid for as follows:  (i) in cash or by certified check, bank draft or money
order payable to the order of the Company; (ii) through the delivery of shares
of Stock having a fair market value on the last business day preceding the date
of exercise equal to the purchase price; or (iii) by a combination of cash and
Stock as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

	An option holder shall not have the rights of a stockholder with regard to 
awards under the Plan except as to Stock actually received by him or her under
the Plan.

	The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Stock (a) until,
in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all applicable Federal and state laws
and regulations have been complied with; and (b) if the outstanding Stock is at
the time listed on any stock exchange, until the shares to be delivered have 
been listed or authorized to be listed on such exchange upon official notice
of issuance; and (c) until all other legal matters in connection with the 
issuance and delivery of such shares have been approved by the Company's 
counsel.  If the sale of Stock has not been registered under the Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended, the Company may require, as a condition to exercise 
of the option, such representations or agreements as counsel for the Company
may consider appropriate to avoid violation of such Act and may require that 
the certificates evidencing such Stock bear an appropriate legend restricting 
transfer.

	(f)	Nontransferability  of Options.  No option may be transferred other than 
by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and during a director's 
lifetime an option may be exercised only by him or her.

	(g)	Death.  If a director dies at the time he or she is entitled to exercise
an option, then the portion formerly exercisable by the director may be 
exercised by the director's executor or administrator, or by the person to whom
the option is transferred under the applicable laws of descent and distribution,
within three years of the death of the director, subject to earlier termination
of an option pursuant to Section 6(c).

	(h)	Other Termination of Status of Director.  All previously unexercised 
options terminate and are forfeited automatically upon the termination of the
director's service with the Company, unless the Committee or the Board of 
Directors specifies otherwise.

	(i)	Mergers, etc.  In the event of a dissolution, liquidation, consolidation
or merger in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, all outstanding
options will thereupon terminate, provided at least twenty days prior to the
effective date of any such dissolution, liquidation, consolidation or merger,
the Company will either (i) make all outstanding options immediately exercisable
or (ii) arrange to have the surviving corporation grant replacement options for
the option holders.

7.	EFFECT, DISCONTINUANCE, CANCELLATION, AMENDMENT AND 	TERMINATION

	Neither adoption of the Plan nor the grant of options to a director shall 
affect the Company's right to grant to such director or any director options 
that are not subject to the Plan, to issue to such directors Stock as a bonus or
otherwise, or to adopt other plans or arrangements under which Stock may be
issued to directors.

	The Committee may at any time discontinue granting options under the Plan.   
The Committee may at any time, or times, amend the Plan for the purpose of 
satisfying any changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other
purpose which may at the time be permitted by law, or may at any time terminate
the Plan as to any further grants of options, provided that (except to the 
extent expressly required or permitted herein above) no such amendment shall,
without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, (a) increase the 
maximum number of shares available under the Plan; (b) increase the number of
options to be granted to Eligible Directors; (c) amend the definition of 
Eligible Directors so as to enlarge the group of directors eligible to receive 
options under the Plan; (d) reduce the price at which options may be granted 
other than as permitted in the Plan; or (e) amend the provisions of this 
Section 7.

7.	PROVISIONS OF OPTIONS.

	7.1	Incentive Stock Options or Other Options.  Options granted under the Plan
may be either Incentive Stock Options or options which do not qualify as 
Incentive Stock Options, as the Committee shall determine at the time of each
grant of options hereunder.

	7.2	Stock Option Certificates or Agreements.  Options granted under the Plan
shall be evidenced by certificates or agreements in such form as the Committee 
shall from time to time approve.  Such certificates or agreements shall comply 
with the terms and conditions of the Plan and may contain such other provisions
not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan as the Committee 
shall deem advisable.  In the case of options intended to qualify as Incentive 
Stock Options, the certificates or agreements shall contain such provisions 
relating to exercise and other matters as are required of incentive stock 
options under the Code.

	7.3	Terms and Conditions.  All options granted under the Plan shall be 
subject to the following terms and conditions to the extent applicable and to
such other terms and conditions not inconsistent therewith as the Committee 
shall determine:

		7.3.1	Exercise Price.  The exercise price per share of Common Stock with 
respect to each option shall be as determined by the Committee but in the 
case of an Incentive Stock Option not less than 100% (110% in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder) of the Fair 
Market Value per share at the time the option is granted.  In the case of an 
option which does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, the exercise price 
per share of Common Stock shall be not less than par value.  

		7.3.2	Value of Shares of Common Stock Subject to Incentive Stock Options.  
Each eligible employee may be granted Incentive Stock Options only to the 
extent that, in the aggregate under this Plan and all incentive stock option 
plans of the Company and any related corporation, such Incentive Stock Options 
do not become exercisable for the first time by such employee during any 
calendar year in a manner which would entitle the employee to purchase more 
than $100,000 in fair market value (determined at the time the Incentive Stock 
Options were granted) of Common Stock in that year.  Any options granted to 
an employee in excess of such amount will be granted as Non-Qualified 
Options.

		7.3.3	Period of Options.  An option shall be exercisable during such period
of time as the Committee may specify (subject to subsection 7.4 below), but 
in the case of an Incentive Stock Option not after the expiration of ten years 
(five years in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent 
Stockholder) from the date the option is granted.

		7.3.4	Exercise of Options.

		7.3.4.1   Each option shall be made exercisable at such time or 
times as the Committee shall determine.  In the case of an option made 
exercisable in installments, the Committee may later determine to 
accelerate the time at which one or more of such installments may be 
exercised.

		7.3.4.2   Any exercise of an option shall be in writing signed by 
the proper person and delivered or mailed to the General Counsel of the 
Company, accompanied by an option exercise notice and payment in full 
for the number of shares in respect to which the option is exercised.

		7.3.4.3   In the event an option is exercised by the executor or 
administrator of a deceased Participant, or by the person or persons to 
whom the option has been transferred by the Participant's will or the 
applicable laws of descent and distribution, the Company shall be under 
no obligation to deliver stock thereunder until the Company is satisfied 
that the person or persons exercising the option is or are the duly 
appointed executor or administrator of the deceased Participant or the 
person or persons to whom the option has been transferred by the 
Participant's will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution.

		7.3.4.4   The Committee may at the time of grant condition the 
exercise of an option upon agreement by the Participant to subject the 
Common Stock to any restrictions on transfer or repurchase rights in 
effect on the date of exercise, upon representations of continued 
employment and upon other terms not inconsistent with this Plan.  Any 
such conditions shall be set forth in the option certificate or other 
document evidencing the option.	

	            7.3.4.5   In the case of an option that is not an Incentive Stock 
Option, the Committee shall have the right to require that the individual 
exercising the option to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to 
satisfy any federal, state, or local withholding tax requirements (or 
makes other arrangements satisfactory to the Company with regard to 
such taxes) prior to the delivery of any Common Stock pursuant to the 
exercise of the option.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, if at the 
time the Incentive Stock Option is exercised the Committee determines 
that under applicable law and regulations the Company could be liable 
for the withholding of any federal or state tax with respect to a 
disposition of the Common Stock received upon exercise, the Committee 
may require as a condition of exercise that the individual exercising the 
Incentive Stock Option agree (i) to inform the Company promptly of any 
disposition (within the meaning of Section 422 (a) (1) of the Code and 
the regulations thereunder) of Common Stock received upon exercise, 
and (ii) to give such security as the Committee deems adequate to meet 
the potential liability of the Company for the withholding of tax, and to 
augment such security from time to time in any amount reasonably 
deemed necessary by the Committee to preserve the adequacy of such 
security.

	          7.3.4.6  In the case of an option that is exercised by an individual 
that is subject to taxation in a foreign jurisdiction, the Committee shall 
have the right to require the individual exercising the option to remit to 
the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal or withholding 
requirement of that foreign jurisdiction (or make other arrangements 
satisfactory to the Company with regard to such taxes prior to the 
delivery of any Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of the option).

	7.3.5	Payment for and Delivery of Stock.   The shares of stock purchased on 
any exercise of an option granted hereunder shall be paid for in full in cash
or, if permitted by the terms of the option, in shares of unrestricted Common
 Stock at the time of such exercise or, if so permitted, a combination 
of such cash and Common Stock.  A Participant shall not have the rights of a 
stockholder with respect to awards under the Plan except as to stock actually 
issued to him.

	7.3.6	Listing of Stock, Withholding and Other Legal Requirements.   
The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any stock until all federal and 
state laws and regulations which the Company may deem applicable have been 
complied with, nor, in the event the outstanding Common Stock is at the time 
listed upon any stock exchange, until the stock to be delivered has been listed
or authorized to be added to the list upon official notice of issuance to such 
exchange.  In addition, if the shares of stock subject to any option have not
been registered in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the 
Company may require the person or persons who wishes or wish to exercise such
option to make such representation or agreement with respect to the sale of 
stock acquired on exercise of the option as will be sufficient, in the opinion
of the Company's counsel, to avoid violation of said Act, and may also require 
that the certificates evidencing said stock bear an appropriate restrictive
legend.

	7.3.7	Non-transferability of Options.   No option may be transferred by the 
Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, 
and during the Participant's lifetime the option may be exercised only by him.

	7.3.8   Death.   If a Participant dies at a time when he is entitled to 
exercise an Incentive Stock Option, then at any time or times within three 
years after his death such Incentive Stock Option may be exercised, as to all 
or any of the shares which the Participant was entitled to purchase thereunder
immediately prior to his death, by his executor or administrator or the person
or persons to whom the Incentive Stock Option is transferred by will or the 
applicable laws of descent and distribution, and except as so exercised such
Incentive Stock Option shall expire at the end of such three-year period.  In
no event, however, may any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan be 
exercised after the expiration of ten years (five years in the case of an
Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder) from the date the
Incentive Stock Option was granted.

	7.3.9	Termination of Employment.   If the employment of a Participant 
terminates for any reason other than his death, all options held by the 
Participant shall thereupon expire on the date of termination unless the option 
by its terms, or the Committee by resolution, shall allow the Participant to 
exercise any or all of the options held by him after termination.  In the case
of an Incentive Stock Option, the Incentive Stock Option shall in any event 
expire at the end of three months after such termination of employment, or after
the expiration of ten years (five years in the case of an Incentive Stock 
Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder) from the date the Incentive Stock
Option was granted, whichever occurs first.  If the Committee so decides, an 
option may  provide that a leave of absence granted by the Company or Subsidiary
is not a termination of employment for the purpose of this subsection 7.3.9, and
in the absence of such a provision the Committee may in any particular case 
determine that such a leave of absence is not a termination of employment for 
such purpose. The Committee shall also determine all other matters relating to 
continuous employment.

7.4	Authority of the Committee.   The Committee shall have the authority, either
generally or in particular instances, to waive compliance by a Participant with 
any obligation to be performed by him under an option and to waive any condition
or provision of an option, except that the Committee may not (i) increase the 
total number of shares covered by any Incentive Stock Option (except in 
accordance with Section 8), (ii) reduce the option price per share of any 
Incentive Stock Option (except in accordance with Section 8) or (iii) extend
the term of any Incentive Stock Option to more than ten years, subject, 
however, to the provisions of Section 10.

8.	CHANGES IN STOCK.

	In the event of a stock dividend, stock split or other change in corporate 
structure or capitalization affecting the Common Stock that becomes effective
after the adoption of the Plan by the Board of Directors, the Committee shall
make appropriate adjustments in (i) the number and kind of shares of stock on
which options may thereafter be granted hereunder, (ii) the number and kind of
shares of stock remaining subject to each option outstanding at the time of 
such change and (iii) the option price.  The Committee's determination shall
be binding on all persons concerned.  Subject to any required action by the 
stockholders, if the Company shall be the surviving corporation in any merger
or consolidation (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company 
survives but in which a majority of its outstanding shares are converted into
securities of another corporation or are exchanged for other consideration), 
any option granted hereunder shall pertain and apply to the securities which 
a holder of the number of shares of stock of the Company then subject to the 
option would have been entitled to receive, but a dissolution or liquidation of
the Company or a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the 
surviving corporation or in which a majority of its outstanding shares are so 
converted or exchanged shall cause every option hereunder to terminate; provided
that if any such dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation is 
contemplated, the Company shall either arrange for any corporation succeeding 
to the business and assets of the Company to issue to the Participants 
replacement options (which, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, satisfy, 
in the determination of the Committee, the requirements of Section 424 of the
Code) on such corporation's stock which will to the extent possible preserve
the value of the outstanding options or shall make the outstanding options 
fully exercisable at least 20 days before the effective date of any such 
dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation.  The existence of the Plan
shall not prevent any such change or other transaction and no Participant 
thereunder shall have any right except as herein expressly set forth.

9.	EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.

	Neither the adoption of the Plan nor any grant of options confers upon any 
employee of the Company or a Subsidiary any right to continued employment with
the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, nor does it interfere in any
way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment 
of any of its employees at any time.

10.	DISCONTINUANCE, CANCELLATION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.

	The Committee may at any time discontinue granting options under the Plan and,
with the consent of the Participant, may at any time cancel an existing option
in whole or in part and grant another option to the Participant for such number
of shares as the Committee specifies.  The Board of Directors may at any time or
times amend the Plan for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of any 
changes in applicable laws or regulations or for any other purpose which may
at the time be permitted by law or may at any time terminate the Plan as to any
further grants of options, provided that no such amendment shall without the 
approval of the stockholders of the Company (a) increase the maximum number of
shares available under the Plan, (b) change the group of employees eligible to
receive options under the Plan, (c) reduce the exercise price of outstanding 
incentive options or reduce the price at which incentive options may be 
granted, (d) extend the time within which options may be granted, (e) alter the
Plan in such a way that incentive options granted or to be granted hereunder 
would not be considered incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code,
or (f) amend the provisions of this Section 10, and no such amendment shall 
adversely affect the rights of any employee (without his consent) under any 
option previously granted.


11.	EFFECTIVE DATE.

The Plan shall become effective immediately upon its approval by the 
stockholders of the Company at the Annual Meeting on May 12, 1993.
