      ACCOUNTING

      The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited
      and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles. These statements include the accounts of EMC and its
      subsidiaries. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
      included in the Company's annual consolidated financial statements have
      been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements,
      in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of
      normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of the results
      for the interim periods ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.

      The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily
      indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the entire
      fiscal year. It is suggested that these interim consolidated financial
      statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
      statements for the year ended December 31, 1997, which are contained in
      the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
      Exchange Commission on March 6, 1998.

5.    ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

      Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." This
      Statement establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive
      income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains and losses) in a full
      set of general-purpose financial statements. This Statement requires the
      classification of items of comprehensive income by their nature in a
      financial statement and the accumulated balance of other comprehensive
      income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in
      the equity section of the balance sheet. Financial statements for prior
      periods must be restated.



      The Company's total comprehensive income was as follows:

                                                    FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED

6.    LITIGATION

      In August 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit against the Company in
      the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
      alleging that the Company is infringing two patents and seeking
      unspecified damages. The Company filed a motion to transfer the case to
      the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and a
      motion to dismiss the suit. The Company's motion to transfer was granted
      with leave for the plaintiff to amend the complaint to overcome the
      grounds for dismissal. In the amended complaint, TM alleged infringement
      only as to one of the two patents originally at issue. A trial is set for
      January 1999. The Company believes TM's claims are without merit.

              (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)


      In December 1997, NewFrame Corporation Ltd. ("NewFrame") filed suit
      against the Company in the United States District Court for the District
      of Massachusetts. The suit contains a variety of allegations relating to
      the Company's use of NewFrame's software developments, including various
      contract claims and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks monetary damages
      relating primarily to lost future profits. The Company filed a motion to
      dismiss the complaint, which was granted in part. The Company believes
      NewFrame's claims are without merit.

      In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit against
      the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District
      of California alleging that the Company is infringing one patent and
      seeking unspecified damages. The Company has answered and counterclaimed.
      A trial date has been set for August 1998. The Company believes STK's
      claims are without merit.

      The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine and
      incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any
      of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
      business, results of operation or financial condition.

7.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

      In April 1998, the Company announced the acquisition of Groupe MCI, a
      French information technology professional services firm ("MCI"). This
      acquisition is part of the Company's strategy to offer professional
      services that help customers better manage, protect and share their
      information through the Company's Enterprise Storage. MCI will operate as
      a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

      In May 1998, the Company announced the expansion of the terms and scope of
      its original reseller agreement with HP. This will enable HP to resell the
      Company's enterprise systems and software for connection to its
      Intel-based HP NetServer Systems, a leading Windows NT platform.

      At the Annual Meeting held on May 6, 1998, the Company's stockholders
      elected John R. Egan, Joseph F. Oliveri and Michael C. Ruettgers to the
      Board of Directors for a three-year term, approved the addition of
      3,500,000 shares of common stock to the Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan
      and approved an amendment to the Company's 1989 Employee Stock Purchase
      Plan as described in the Company's Proxy Statement.

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - First Quarter of 1998 compared to First Quarter of 1997
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REVENUES

The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations ("MD&A") should be read in conjunction with "Factors That May Affect
Future Results" set forth on page 12 and in EMC's other filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. All dollar amounts in the MD&A are in
thousands.

Total revenues for the first quarter of 1998 were $828,351 compared to $618,437
for the first quarter of 1997, an increase of $209,914 or 34%.

Enterprise systems revenues from products sold directly and through OEMs and
resellers were $698,755 in the first quarter of 1998, compared to $530,836 in
the first quarter of 1997, an increase of $167,919 or 32%. The increase was due
to continued strong demand for the Company's Symmetrix series of products in all
geographies. These products address the growing demand for enterprise-wide
storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and protect mission critical
information in mainframe, UNIX and Windows NT environments.

Enterprise software revenues from products sold directly and through OEMs and
resellers were $65,994 in the first quarter of 1998 compared to $26,532 in the
first quarter of 1997, an increase of $39,462 or 149%. Enterprise software
products provide primary and extended functionality for the Company's storage
products.

Revenues from products sold by McDATA Corporation, primarily the ESCON Director
series of products, were $41,184 in the first quarter of 1998, compared to
$43,532 in the first quarter of 1997, a decrease of $2,348 or 5%.

Revenues from service and rental income were $22,418 in the first quarter of
1998, compared to $17,537 in the first quarter of 1997, an increase of $4,881 or
28%.

In February 1998, the Company announced a reseller agreement under which SGI
will resell the Company's enterprise systems and software for connection to
SGI's Origin servers and Onyx2 graphics systems.

In May 1998, the Company announced the expansion of the terms and scope of its
original reseller agreement with HP. This will enable HP to resell the Company's
enterprise systems and software for connection to its Intel-based HP NetServer
Systems, a leading Windows NT platform. Revenues for the first quarter of 1998
and 1997 under this agreement were $156,831 and $107,517, or 19% and 17% of
total revenues, respectively.

Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $481,741 in the first
quarter of 1998 compared to $361,646 in the first quarter of 1997, an increase
of $120,095 or 33%.

Revenues on sales into all markets outside North America were $346,610 in the
first quarter of 1998 compared to $256,791 in the first quarter of 1997. This
represented 42% of total revenues for both periods presented. The Company
expects increases in international sales as a percentage of total revenues in
1998.

                                 EMC CORPORATION

Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, Africa and the Middle East were
$262,082 in the first quarter of 1998 compared to $196,215 in the first quarter
of 1997, an increase of $65,867 or 34%.

Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $77,004 in
the first quarter of 1998 compared to $58,925 in the first quarter of 1997, an
increase of $18,079 or 31%.

Revenues on sales into the markets of South America were $7,524 in the first
quarter of 1998 compared to $1,651 in the first quarter of 1997, an increase of
$5,873 or 356%.

GROSS MARGINS

Gross margins increased to 48.0% of revenues in the first quarter of 1998,
compared to 45.7% of revenues in the first quarter of 1997. This increase is 
primarily attributable to increasing sales of software which have a higher gross
margin than hardware sales. Other factors affecting gross margins to a lesser 
extent in the first quarter of 1998 include the rates of price declines in the 
marketplace and of component cost declines. The Company currently believes that 
price declines will continue.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $65,675 and $48,091 in the first
quarters of 1998 and 1997, respectively, an increase of $17,584 or 37%. R&D
expenses were 7.9% and 7.8% of revenues in the first quarters of 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The dollar increase was partially due to the cost of additional
technical staff to support a variety of projects including both fibre channel
connectivity and enterprise software products. This increase is also
attributable to expenses associated with computer equipment acquired to
facilitate this development. The Company expects to continue to spend
substantial amounts for R&D for the balance of 1998 and thereafter.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $153,496 and $97,624
in the first quarters of 1998 and 1997, respectively, an increase of $55,872 or
57%. SG&A expenses were 18.5% and 15.8% of revenues in the first quarters of
1998 and 1997, respectively. The dollar increase is due primarily to costs
associated with a continued investment in additional worldwide sales and support
personnel and their related overhead costs with the objective of achieving
broader coverage and greater account depth around the world. SG&A expenses are 
expected to increase in dollar terms for the balance of 1998 and thereafter.

INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE

Investment income was $22,507 in the first quarter of 1998 compared with $11,684
in the same period a year ago. Interest income was earned from investments in
cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments. Investment income
increased in the first quarter of 1998 primarily due to higher cash and
investment balances which were derived from operations and the Notes issued in
March 1997.

Interest expense increased by $3,328 to $4,730 in the first quarter of 1998 from
$1,402 in the first quarter of 1997. The increase was attributable to the Notes.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes was $48,705 and $38,248 in the first quarters of
1998 and 1997, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.0% in
the first quarter of 1998 and 25.6% in the first quarter of 1997. The decrease
in the effective tax rate is mainly attributable to the realization of benefits
associated with the continued progress on the Company's various tax strategies.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $1,811,332
and $1,650,633 at March 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, respectively, an
increase of $160,699.

Cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of 1998 was
$226,762, generated primarily from net income and by lower accounts
receivable balances. Cash provided by investing activities was $27,658,
principally from the net maturity of short and long-term investments and offset
by additions to property, plant and equipment. Cash used by financing activities
was $2,188, principally for payments of short and long-term obligations.

At March 31, 1998, the Company had available for use its credit line of $50,000
and may elect to borrow at any time. Based on its current operating and capital
expenditure forecasts, the Company believes that the combination of funds
currently available, funds generated from operations and its available line of
credit will be adequate to finance its ongoing operations.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements as
defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of
certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) a failure by any
supplier of high density DRAMs, disk drives or other components to meet EMC's
requirements for an extended period of time; (ii) the transition to new
products; (iii) the historic and recurring "hockey stick" pattern of the
Company's sales by which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter's total
sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter; (iv) the
"hockey stick" pattern of the Company's sales, making it extremely difficult to
predict near-term demand and adjust production capacity accordingly; (v)
competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures, in the
computer storage market; (vi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (vii) the
relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines; (viii)
termination of the agreements with certain of the Company's OEMs or resellers;
(ix) delays in the development of new technology; (x) Year 2000 issues; (xi)
other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from
time to time in EMC's other filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.

                                OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings

        In August 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit against the Company
        in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
        York alleging that the Company is infringing two patents and seeking
        unspecified damages. The Company filed a motion to transfer the case to
        the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and a
        motion to dismiss the suit. The Company's motion to transfer was granted
        with leave for the plaintiff to amend the complaint to overcome the
        grounds for dismissal. In the amended complaint, TM alleged infringement
        only as to one of the two patents originally at issue. A trial is set
        for January 1999. The Company believes TM's claims are without merit.

        In December 1997, NewFrame Corporation Ltd. ("NewFrame") filed suit
        against the Company in the United States District Court for the District
        of Massachusetts. The suit contains a variety of allegations relating to
        the Company's use of NewFrame's software developments, including various
        contract claims and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks monetary damages
        relating primarily to lost future profits. The Company filed a motion to
        dismiss the complaint, which was granted in part. The Company believes
        NewFrame's claims are without merit.

        In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit
        against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
        District of California alleging that the Company is infringing one
        patent and seeking unspecified damages. The Company has answered and
        counterclaimed. A trial date has been set for August 1998. The Company
        believes STK's claims are without merit.

        The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine
        and incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results
        of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the
        Company's business, results of operation or financial condition.
