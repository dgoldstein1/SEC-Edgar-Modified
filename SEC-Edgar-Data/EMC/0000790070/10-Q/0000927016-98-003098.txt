4. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
 
  Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." This Statement
establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and
its components (revenues, expenses, gains and losses) in a full set of
general- purpose financial statements. This Statement requires the
classification of items of comprehensive income by their nature in a financial
statement and the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately
from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity section of
the balance sheet. Financial statements for prior periods must be restated.
 
  The Company's total comprehensive income was as follows:

5. LITIGATION
 
  In August 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit against the Company in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
alleging that the Company is infringing two patents and seeking unspecified
damages. The Company filed a motion to transfer the case to the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts and a motion to dismiss the
suit. The Company's motion to transfer was granted with leave for the
plaintiff to amend the complaint to overcome the grounds for dismissal. In the
amended complaint, TM alleged infringement only as to one of the two patents
originally at issue. Fact discovery in this case has concluded. A trial is set
for January 1999. The Company believes TM's claims are without merit.
 
  In December 1997, NewFrame Corporation Ltd. ("NewFrame") filed suit against
the Company in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts. The suit contains a variety of allegations relating to the
Company's use of NewFrame's software developments, including various contract
claims and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks monetary damages relating
primarily to lost future profits. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint, which was granted in part. The Company believes NewFrame's claims
are without merit.
 
  In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit against
the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California alleging that the Company is infringing one patent and seeking
unspecified damages. The Company has answered and counterclaimed. Among other
defenses, the Company has asserted that its activities are covered by a
license agreement between the parties. A trial on the license issue was held
from August 4 to August 6, 1998. A decision from the court is expected
shortly. The Company believes STK's claims are without merit.
 
  The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine and
incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of
these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.

6. ACQUISITION
 
  In April 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Groupe MCI, a French information technology professional services firm, in
exchange for cash and common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. Pro forma presentations have not been included as the acquisition
was not material to the results of operations or financial condition of the
Company.
 
7. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
 
  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities ("FAS 133"). FAS 133 is effective for all fiscal
quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 (January 1, 2000
for the Company). FAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded
on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in either current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part
of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. For fair-
value hedge transactions in which the Company is hedging changes in fair value
of an asset, liability, or firm commitment, changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by
changes in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash-flow hedge
transactions, in which the Company is hedging the variability of cash flows
related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or a forecasted transaction,
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be reported in
other comprehensive income. The gains and losses on the derivative instrument
that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as
earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of
the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges will
be recognized in current earnings.
 
  The Company is assessing the impact of FAS 133, and currently believes it
will not have a material impact on its earnings or statement of financial
position.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 
 The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
 of Operations ("MD&A") should be read in conjunction with "Factors That May
 Affect Future Results" set forth on page 15 and in EMC's other filings with
 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
ALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THE MD&A ARE IN MILLIONS.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--SECOND QUARTER OF 1998 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF
1997
 
 Revenues
 
  Total revenues for the second quarter of 1998 were $952.0 compared to $713.5
for the second quarter of 1997, an increase of $238.5 or 33%.
 
  Enterprise systems revenues from products sold directly and through OEMs and
resellers were $765.8 in the second quarter of 1998, compared to $604.1 in the
second quarter of 1997, an increase of $161.7 or 27%. The increase was due to
continued strong demand for the Company's Symmetrix series of products in all
geographies. These products address the growing demand for enterprise-wide
storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and protect mission critical
information in mainframe, UNIX and Windows NT environments.
 
  Enterprise software revenues from products sold directly and through OEMs
and resellers were $97.9 in the second quarter of 1998 compared to $40.8 in
the second quarter of 1997, an increase of $57.1 or 140%. Enterprise software
products provide primary and extended functionality for the Company's storage
products.
 
  Revenues from products sold by McDATA Corporation, primarily the ESCON
Director series of products, were $55.1 in the second quarter of 1998,
compared to $49.6 in the second quarter of 1997, an increase of $5.5 or 11%.
 
  Revenues from service and rental income were $33.2 in the second quarter of
1998, compared to $19.0 in the second quarter of 1997, an increase of $14.2 or
75%.
 
  In May 1998, the Company announced the expansion of the terms and scope of
its original reseller agreement with HP. This will enable HP to resell the
Company's enterprise systems and software for connection to its Intel-based HP
NetServer Systems, a leading Windows NT platform. Revenues for the second
quarter of 1998 and 1997 under this agreement were $186.2 and $118.6, or 20%
and 17% of total revenues, respectively.
 
  Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $577.2 in the second
quarter of 1998 compared to $400.5 in the second quarter of 1997, an increase
of $176.7 or 44%.
 
  Revenues on sales into all markets outside North America were $374.8 in the
second quarter of 1998 compared to $312.9 in the second quarter of 1997. This
represented 39% and 44% of total revenues, respectively.
 
  Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, Africa and the Middle East
were $295.3 in the second quarter of 1998 compared to $238.8 in the second
quarter of 1997, an increase of $56.5 or 24%.
 
  Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $71.1 in
the second quarter of 1998 compared to $68.2 in the second quarter of 1997, an
increase of $2.9 or 4%.
 
  Revenues on sales into the markets of South America were $8.5 in the second
quarter of 1998 compared to $5.9 in the second quarter of 1997, an increase of
$2.6 or 43%.
 
                                      10
<PAGE>
 
 Gross Margins
 
  Gross margins increased to 50.9% of revenues in the second quarter of 1998,
compared to 46.1% of revenues in the second quarter of 1997. This increase is
primarily attributable to increased licensing of the Company's enterprise
software which has higher gross margins than sales of hardware. Other factors
affecting gross margins in the second quarter of 1998 include the impact of
component cost declines being greater than the impact of price declines. The
Company currently believes that price declines will continue.
 
 Research and Development
 
  Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $74.2 and $53.4 in the second
quarters of 1998 and 1997, respectively, an increase of $20.8 or 38.9%. R&D
expenses were 7.8% and 7.5% of revenues in the second quarters of 1998 and
1997, respectively. The dollar increase was partially due to the cost of
additional technical staff to support a variety of projects including both
fibre channel connectivity and enterprise software products. This increase is
also attributable to expenses associated with computer equipment acquired to
facilitate this development. The Company expects to continue to spend
substantial amounts for R&D for the balance of 1998 and thereafter.
 
 Selling, General and Administrative
 
  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $177.4 and $114.6
in the second quarters of 1998 and 1997, respectively, an increase of $62.8 or
54.7%. SG&A expenses were 18.6% and 16.1% of revenues in the second quarters of
1998 and 1997, respectively. The dollar and percentage increase is due
primarily to costs associated with a continued investment in additional
worldwide sales and support personnel and their related overhead costs with the
objective of achieving broader coverage and greater account depth around the
world. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in dollar terms for the balance
of 1998 and thereafter.
 
 Investment Income and Interest Expense
 
  Investment income was $24.0 in the second quarter of 1998 compared with $17.4
in the same period a year ago. Interest income was earned from investments in
cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments. Investment income
increased in the second quarter of 1998 primarily due to higher cash and
investment balances which were derived from operations.
 
  Interest expense was $5.0 in the second quarter of 1998 as compared to $4.6
in the second quarter of 1997 and relates primarily to the $517.5 of 3 1/4%
convertible subordinated notes due 2002 (the "Notes") issued in March 1997.
 
 Provision for Income Taxes
 
  The provision for income taxes was $63.2 and $44.4 in the second quarters of
1998 and 1997, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.0%
in the second quarter of 1998 and 25.6% in the second quarter of 1997. The
decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly attributable to the realization of
benefits associated with the continued progress on the Company's various tax
strategies.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1998 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS
OF 1997
 
 Revenues
 
  Total revenues for the first six months ended June 30, 1998 were $1,780.4
compared to $1,331.9 for the first six months of 1997, an increase of $448.5
or 34%.
 
  Enterprise systems revenues from products sold directly and through OEMs and
resellers were $1,464.6 in the first six months of 1998, compared to $1,135.0
in the first six months of 1997, an increase of $329.6 or 29%. The increase
was due to continued strong demand for the Company's Symmetrix series of
products in all geographies. These products address the growing demand for
enterprise-wide storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and protect
mission critical information in mainframe, UNIX and Windows NT environments.
 
  Enterprise software revenues from products sold directly and through OEMs
and resellers were $163.9 in the first six months of 1998 compared to $67.4 in
the first six months of 1997, an increase of $96.5 or 143%. Enterprise
software products provide primary and extended functionality for the Company's
storage products.
 
  Revenues from products sold by McDATA Corporation, primarily the ESCON
Director series of products, were $96.3 in the first six months of 1998,
compared to $93.1 in the first six months of 1997, an increase of $3.2 or 3%.
 
  Revenues from service and rental income were $55.6 in the first six months
of 1998, compared to $36.5 in the first six months of 1997, an increase of
$19.1 or 52%.
 
  In February 1998, the Company announced a reseller agreement under which SGI
will resell the Company's enterprise systems and software for connection to
SGI's Origin servers and Onyx2 graphics systems.
 
  In May 1998, the Company announced the expansion of the terms and scope of
its original reseller agreement with HP. This will enable HP to resell the
Company's enterprise systems and software for connection to its Intel-based HP
NetServer Systems, a leading Windows NT platform. Revenues for the first six
months of 1998 and 1997 under this agreement were $343.0 and $226.1, or 19%
and 17% of total revenues, respectively.
 
  Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $1,058.9 in the first
six months of 1998 compared to $762.2 in the first six months of 1997, an
increase of $296.7 or 39%.
 
  Revenues on sales into all markets outside North America were $721.5 in the
first six months of 1998 compared to $569.7 in the first six months of 1997.
This represented 41% and 43% of total revenues, respectively.
 
  Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, Africa and the Middle East
were $557.4 in the first six months of 1998 compared to $435.1 in the first
six months of 1997, an increase of $122.3 or 28%.
 
  Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $148.1 in
the first six months of 1998 compared to $127.1 in the first six months of
1997, an increase of $21.0 or 17%.
 
  Revenues on sales into the markets of South America were $16.0 in the first
six months of 1998 compared to $7.6 in the first six months of 1997, an
increase of $8.4 or 111%.
 
 Gross Margins
 
  Gross margins increased to 49.5% of revenues in the first six months of
1998, compared to 45.9% of revenues in the first six months of 1997. This
increase is primarily attributable to increased licensing of the Company's
enterprise software which has higher gross margins than sales of hardware.
Other factors affecting gross margins in the first six months of 1998 include
the impact of component cost declines being greater than the impact of price
declines. The Company currently believes that price declines will continue.
 
                                      12

 Research and Development
 
  Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $139.9 and $101.5 in the
first six months of 1998 and 1997, respectively, an increase of $38.4 or 38%.
R&D expenses were 7.9% and 7.6% of revenues in the first six months of 1998
and 1997, respectively. The dollar increase was partially due to the cost of
additional technical staff to support a variety of projects including both
fibre channel connectivity and enterprise software products. This increase is
also attributable to expenses associated with computer equipment acquired to
facilitate this development. The Company expects to continue to spend
substantial amounts for R&D for the balance of 1998 and thereafter.
 
 Selling, General and Administrative
 
  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $330.8 and $212.3
in the first six months of 1998 and 1997, respectively, an increase of $118.5
or 56%. SG&A expenses were 18.6% and 15.9% of revenues in the first six months
of 1998 and 1997, respectively. The dollar and percentage increase is due
primarily to costs associated with a continued investment in additional
worldwide sales and support personnel and their related overhead costs with
the objective of achieving broader coverage and greater account depth around
the world. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in dollar terms for the
balance of 1998 and thereafter.
 
 Investment Income and Interest Expense
 
  Investment income was $46.5 in the first six months of 1998 compared with
$29.1 in the same period a year ago. Interest income was earned from
investments in cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments.
Investment income increased in the first six months of 1998 primarily due to
higher cash and investment balances which were derived from operations and the
Notes issued in March 1997.
 
  Interest expense increased by $3.7 to $9.7 in the first six months of 1998
from $6.0 in the first six months of 1997. The increase was attributable to
the Notes.
 
 Provision for Income Taxes
 
  The provision for income taxes was $111.9 and $82.7 in the first six months
of 1998 and 1997, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of
25.0% in the first six months of 1998 and 25.6% in the first six months of
1997. The decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly attributable to the
realization of benefits associated with the continued progress on the
Company's various tax strategies.

 Financial Condition
 
  Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $1,867.6
and $1,650.6 at June 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997, respectively, an increase
of $217.0.
 
  Cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 1998 was
$384.4, generated primarily from net income. Cash used by investing activities
was $372.8, principally from the purchase of short-term and long-term
investments and additions to property, plant and equipment. Additions to
property, plant and equipment include approximately $25.0 accrued for
construction of the manufacturing facility in Franklin, Massachusetts. Cash
provided by financing activities was $18.3, principally from the issuance of
common stock from option exercises.
 
  At June 30, 1998, the Company had available for use its credit line of $50.0
and may elect to borrow at any time. Based on its current operating and
capital expenditure forecasts, the Company presently believes that the
combination of funds currently available, funds generated from operations and
its available line of credit will be adequate to finance its ongoing
operations.
 
 New Accounting Pronouncement
 
  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities ("FAS 133"). FAS 133 is effective for all fiscal
quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 (January 1, 2000
for the Company). FAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded
on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in either current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part
of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. For fair-
value hedge transactions in which the Company is hedging changes in fair value
of an asset, liability, or firm commitment, changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by
changes in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash-flow hedge
transactions, in which the Company is hedging the variability of cash flows
related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or a forecasted transaction,
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be reported in
other comprehensive income. The gains and losses on the derivative instrument
that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as
earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of
the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges will
be recognized in current earnings.
 
  The Company is assessing the impact of FAS 133, and currently believes it
will not have a material impact on its earnings or statement of financial
position.
 
 Year 2000 Issues
 
  The Company uses a significant number of computer software programs and
operating systems in its product development, financial business systems and
administrative functions. To the extent these software applications are unable
to appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year "2000," conversion of
such applications will be necessary. The Company has implemented a program to
determine whether the Company's systems are "Year 2000" compliant, assess the
impact of any non-compliance and make any necessary adjustments. As part of
this program, the Company is in the process of making the necessary
conversions to its internal software. The Company anticipates that its
conversion program will be completed in a timely manner. The Company does not
anticipate that the total cost of such program will have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial
condition.
 
  In addition, the Company has contacted its key suppliers and other key third
parties to determine the potential effect of the "Year 2000" issue on such
parties. To the extent such third parties are materially adversely affected by
the "Year 2000" issue, this could disrupt the Company's operations.
 
                                      14
<PAGE>
 
  There can be no assurance that the conversion of the Company's systems will
be successful or that the Company's key contractors will have successful
conversion programs, and that any such "Year 2000" compliance failures will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of
operations or financial condition.
 
 ECU Conversion
 
  On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European
Union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing
sovereign currencies and the euro. The participating countries have agreed to
adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date. The euro will then
trade on currency exchanges and be available for non-cash transactions. The
participating countries will issue sovereign debt exclusively in euros, and
will redenominate outstanding sovereign debt. At that time, the participating
countries will no longer control their own monetary policies by directing
independent interest rates for the legacy currencies. Instead, the authority
to direct monetary policy, including money supply and official interest rates
for the euro will be exercised by the new European Central Bank.
 
  Following the introduction of the euro, the legacy currencies are scheduled
to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the
euro between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002 (the "transition period").
During the transition period, public and private parties may pay for goods and
services using either the euro or the participating country's legacy currency
on a "no compulsion, no prohibition" basis. However, conversion rates no
longer will be computed directly from one legacy currency to another. Instead,
a triangular process will apply whereby an amount denominated in one legacy
currency will first be converted into the euro. The resultant euro-denominated
amount will then be converted into the second legacy currency.
 
  The Company has a task force assigned to address the business implications
of conversion to the euro, including technical adaptation of information
technology and other systems to accommodate euro-denominated transactions,
long term competitive implications of the conversions and the effect on market
risk with respect to financial instruments. At this time, management is in the
process of evaluating the impact of this conversion on the Company.
 
 Factors That May Affect Future Results
 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements as
defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result
of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) a failure by any
supplier of high density DRAMs, disk drives or other components to meet EMC's
requirements for an extended period of time; (ii) delays in the development of
new technology and the transition to new products; (iii) the historic and
recurring "hockey stick" pattern of the Company's sales by which a
disproportionate percentage of a quarter's total sales occur in the last month
and weeks and days of each quarter; (iv) the "hockey stick" pattern of the
Company's sales, making it extremely difficult to predict near-term demand and
adjust production capacity accordingly; (v) competitive factors, including but
not limited to pricing pressures, in the computer storage market; (vi)
fluctuating currency exchange rates; (vii) the relative and varying rates of
product price and component cost declines; (viii) deterioration or termination
of the agreements with certain of the Company's OEMs or resellers; (ix) risks
associated with acquisitions; (x) Year 2000 issues; (xi) other one-time events
and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in
EMC's other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

                               OTHER INFORMATION
 
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
  In August 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit against the Company in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
alleging that the Company is infringing two patents and seeking unspecified
damages. The Company filed a motion to transfer the case to the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts and a motion to dismiss the
suit. The Company's motion to transfer was granted with leave for the
plaintiff to amend the complaint to overcome the grounds for dismissal. In the
amended complaint, TM alleged infringement only as to one of the two patents
originally at issue. Fact discovery in this case has concluded. A trial is set
for January 1999. The Company believes TM's claims are without merit.
 
  In December 1997, NewFrame Corporation Ltd. ("NewFrame") filed suit against
the Company in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts. The suit contains a variety of allegations relating to the
Company's use of NewFrame's software developments, including various contract
claims and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks monetary damages relating
primarily to lost future profits. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint, which was granted in part. The Company believes NewFrame's claims
are without merit.
 
  In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit against
the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California alleging that the Company is infringing one patent and seeking
unspecified damages. The Company has answered and counterclaimed. Among other
defenses, the Company has asserted that its activities are covered by a
license agreement between the parties. A trial on the license issue was held
from August 4 to August 6, 1998. A decision from the court is expected
shortly. The Company believes STK's claims are without merit.
 
  The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine and
incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of
these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.
 
ITEM 2. CHANGES IN SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
 
  On April 23, 1998, the Company issued 602,702 shares of its common stock,
$.01 par value per share, in connection with the acquisition of the
outstanding common stock of Groupe MCI, a French information technology
professional services firm.
 
  These shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
provided for in Section 4(2) thereunder.
 
  The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act, which became effective on
August 5, 1998 and which permits the resale, on a registered basis, of these
shares from time to time by the securityholders named therein. The Company
also listed these shares of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
  The Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on May 6, 1998. There was no
solicitation in opposition to management's nominees as listed in the Company's
proxy statement and all such nominees were elected as Class II directors for a
three-year term. In addition, the stockholders approved an amendment to the
Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares available
for grant under the plan by 3,500,000, and an amendment to the Company's 1989
Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide that employees whose customary
employment is 20 hours or less per week are ineligible to participate in the
plan. The results of the votes for each of these proposals were as follows:
