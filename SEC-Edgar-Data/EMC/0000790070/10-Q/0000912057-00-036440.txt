    The calculation of earnings per share excludes the Company's 6% convertible
subordinated notes due 2004 (the "6% Notes") as the effect of the conversion
would be antidilutive.

5. EQUITY TRANSACTIONS

CONVERTIBLE NOTES

    In March 1997, the Company sold $517.5 of its 3 1/4% convertible
subordinated notes due 2002 (the "3 1/4% Notes"). On March 15, 2000, all of the
outstanding 3 1/4% Notes were converted into Common Stock. In May 1997, Data
General Corporation sold $212.8 of the 6% Notes, which were assumed by the
Company in connection with the acquisition of Data General in 1999. The 6% Notes
were generally convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of
approximately $41.91 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. As of
June 30, 2000, $212.6 of the 6% Notes were converted into EMC Common Stock. The
Company paid approximately one hundred fifty-five thousand dollars to redeem the
remaining 6% Notes.

STOCK SPLIT

    On May 3, 2000, the Company announced a two-for-one stock split in the form
of a 100% stock dividend with a record date of May 19, 2000 and a distribution
date of June 5, 2000. Share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect
the stock splits for all periods presented.

                    (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

6. LITIGATION

    The Company is a party to certain litigation which it considers routine and
incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of
these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.

7. DERIVATIVES

    The Company uses derivatives to hedge foreign currency cash flows on a
continuing basis for periods consistent with its net asset and forecasted
exposures. Since the Company is using foreign exchange derivative contracts to
hedge foreign exchange exposures, the changes in the value of the derivatives
are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of
the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the derivatives is recognized in
current earnings, which represented immaterial amounts for all periods
presented. The ineffective portion of the derivatives is primarily related to
option premiums and to discounts or premiums on forward contracts. All
derivative contracts generally mature within six months.

    The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a
portion of its forecasted transactions. These derivatives are designated as cash
flow hedges, and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(expense) until the underlying forecasted transaction
occurs. Once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized, the appropriate
gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense) to the income
statement, in revenue and expense, as appropriate. In the event the underlying
forecasted transaction does not occur, the amount recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(expense) will be reclassified to the other
income/(expense) line of the income statement in the then-current period.

    The Company recorded in revenue and expense approximately $1,835 and $8,306
in net gains from cash flow hedges related to items forecasted for the second
quarter and first six months of 2000, respectively. The amount that will be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense) to earnings
over the next twelve months is a loss of approximately $569, net of tax.

8. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

    In January 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Softworks, Inc. by means of a tender offer, whereby all the shares of Softworks
were converted into the right to receive cash. Also in January 2000, the Company
acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Terascape Software, Inc. The
aggregate cost of these transactions was approximately $209 million, net of cash
acquired of approximately $28 million.

    The Company accounted for each acquisition as a purchase transaction. The
consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business
from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to the
Company on either an individual or an aggregate basis.

    The Company calculated amounts allocated to in-process research and
development ("IPRD") using established valuation techniques and expensed such
amounts in the quarter that each acquisition was consummated because
technological feasibility of the in-process technology had not been achieved and
no alternate future use has been established. The Company computed its
valuations of IPRD for

the acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis on the anticipated income
stream to be generated by the purchased technology. During the first quarter,
the Company recorded a $3,300 charge to research and development expense
representing the write-off of IPRD associated with both acquisitions.

    The excess of the purchase price over the estimated value of the net
tangible assets was allocated to various intangible assets, consisting primarily
of developed technology and goodwill, as well as other intangible assets. The
value of developed technology was based upon future discounted cash flows
relating to the existing product's projected income stream. Intangible assets,
including goodwill, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, which is a maximum of five years.

9. RESTRUCTURING, MERGER AND OTHER CHARGES

    During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company approved and implemented a
restructuring program in connection with its acquisition of Data General
Corporation. The restructuring plan, which is expected to be completed by
December 2000, provides for the consolidation of the Company's operations and
elimination of duplicative facilities worldwide. Accordingly, during the fourth
quarter of 1999, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $170.6 million
related to employee termination benefits, facility closure costs, asset
disposals, and other exit costs which the Company has recorded in operating
expenses. The total cash impact of the charge is approximately $140.7 million of
which $52.4 million was paid in 1999 and $43.5 million was paid in 2000.

    The program included a net reduction of the workforce by approximately
1,100, employees approximately 59% of whom are or were based in North America
and 23% of whom are or were based in Europe. The employee separations affect the
majority of business functions and job classes. As of June 30, 2000, employee
separations due to restructuring actions totaled approximately 900.

    During fiscal year 1998, Data General recorded a charge of $82.4 million
related to a restructuring program. The charge included employee termination
benefits, asset write-downs, and other exit costs. The total cash impact of the
restructuring charge is approximately $58.5 million of which $46.0 million was
paid prior to December 31, 1999 and $1.5 million was paid during the first six
months of 2000. As of June 30, 2000, the remaining accruals of $14.3 million
from the 1998 restructuring program are primarily related to excess vacant
rental properties in Europe.

    The amounts charged against the established provisions described above were
as follows:

11. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements"
subsequently updated by SAB 101A and SAB 101B ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 summarizes
certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles
to revenue recognition in financial statements. The Company is required to adopt
SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of SAB 101 on its results of operations and
financial position.

    In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation--an interpretation of APB

Opinion No. 25" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB Opinion
No. 25 and among other issues clarifies the following: the definition of an
employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 25, the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock
options or awards, and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000, but certain
conclusions in FIN 44 cover specific events that occurred after either
December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The Company does not expect FIN 44 to
have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.

    In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments--an amendment of FAS 133" ("Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities"). This statement amends the accounting and

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations should be read in conjunction with "Factors That May Affect Future
Results" set forth on page 22 and in EMC's other filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--SECOND QUARTER OF 2000 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF 1999

    REVENUES

    Total revenues for the second quarter of 2000 were $2,145.9 compared to
$1,647.6 for the second quarter of 1999, representing an increase of $498.3 or
30%.

    Enterprise storage hardware revenues from products sold directly and through
resellers and original equipment manufacturers were $1,340.3 in the second
quarter of 2000, compared to $985.5 in the second quarter of 1999, representing
an increase of $354.8, or 36%. The increase in enterprise systems revenues was
due to increased sales volume resulting from continued strong demand for the
Company's Symmetrix series of products and the successful introduction of new
Symmetrix, Celerra and Connectrix products. These products address the growing
demand for enterprise-wide storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and
protect mission critical information in UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe
environments.

    Enterprise storage software revenues from products sold directly and through
resellers and original equipment manufacturers were $350.3 in the second quarter
of 2000 compared to $178.6 in the second quarter of 1999, representing an
increase of $171.7, or 96%. The increase in software revenues was primarily due
to increased licenses of enterprise storage software on Symmetrix systems both
newly shipped and already installed, and the successful introduction of new and
enhanced software products.

    Revenues from enterprise switching products sold directly by McDATA,
including the ESCON Director series of products, were $37.1 in the second
quarter of 2000 compared to $45.8 in the second quarter of 1999, representing a
decrease of $8.7, or 19%. The decrease was due to the product transition from
ESCON-based to fibre channel-based directors which resulted in a decrease in
ESCON revenues that was partially offset by an increase in fibre channel
revenues. The Company anticipates that revenues from ESCON directors will
continue to decline.

    Revenues from the CLARiiON line of storage products, excluding related
service revenues, were $138.5 in the second quarter of 2000, compared to $105.7
in the second quarter of 1999, representing an increase of $32.8, or 31%. The
increase reflects a significant increase in sales volume from direct sales
channels offset by a decrease in sales volume from indirect channels.

    Total storage product revenues were $1,866.2 in the second quarter of 2000,
compared to $1,315.7 in the second quarter of 1999, representing an increase of
$550.5, or 42%. The increase is due primarily to sales of enterprise storage
hardware and software.

    Revenues from AViiON server products were $69.3 in the second quarter of
2000 compared to $153.9 in the second quarter of 1999, representing a decrease
of $84.6, or 55%. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of reduced
volume due to the refocusing of the AViiON business on the most profitable
product lines combined with the effect of closing certain international sales
offices.

    Overall service revenues were $210.5 in the second quarter of 2000 compared
to $178.0 in the second quarter of 1999, an increase of $32.5 or 18%. Storage
service revenues were $134.4 in the

                                       15
<PAGE>
second quarter of 2000 compared to $84.2 in the second quarter of 1999, an
increase of $50.2, or 60%. These increases were primarily related to increased
maintenance revenues on enterprise storage hardware and software products.
Server service revenues from the Company's Data General division were $76.0 in
the second quarter of 2000 compared to $93.9 in the second quarter of 1999, a
decrease of $17.9, or 19%. The decrease is primarily due to the refocusing of
the AViiON business combined with the effect of closing certain international
sales offices.

    Total revenues from storage products and services were $2,000.6 in the
second quarter of 2000, compared to $1,399.9 in the second quarter of 1999,
representing an increase of $600.7, or 43%. Total revenues from server products
and services were $145.3 in the second quarter of 2000, compared to $247.8 in
the second quarter of 1999, representing a decrease of $102.5, or 41%.

    Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $1,328.7 in the
second quarter of 2000 compared to $1,048.8 in the second quarter of 1999, an
increase of $279.9, or 27%. The revenue growth reflects strong demand for the
Company's storage products and services, which increased by 37% compared to the
second quarter of 1999. This growth was offset by a decrease in AViiON server
revenues due to the refocusing of the business on the most profitable product
lines.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, the Middle East and Africa
were $571.4 in the second quarter of 2000 compared to $444.1 in the second
quarter of 1999, an increase of $127.3, or 29%. The increase is primarily due to
strong demand for the Company's storage products and services, which increased
by 42% compared to the second quarter of 1999. This growth was offset by
decreased revenues from AViiON products due to the closing of certain regional
sales offices acquired in connection with the acquisition of Data General
Corporation in 1999.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $205.4 in
the second quarter of 2000 compared to $107.2 in the second quarter of 1999, an
increase of $98.2, or 92%. The increase was primarily due to the Company's
efforts to expand its business in this region combined with continued strong
demand for the Company's storage products and services, which increased by 111%
compared to the second quarter of 1999. This growth was offset by decreased
revenues from AViiON products due to the closing of certain regional sales
offices acquired in connection with the acquisition of Data General Corporation
in 1999.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of Latin America were $40.4 in the second
quarter of 2000 compared to $47.6 in the second quarter of 1999, a decrease of
$7.2, or 15%. The decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues from AViiON
products due to the closing of certain regional offices acquired in connection
with the acquisition of Data General Corporation in 1999. The Company's storage
products and services increased by 10% compared to the second quarter of 1999.

    GROSS MARGINS

    Overall gross margins increased to 57.9% of revenues in the second quarter
of 2000, compared to 50.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 1999. Product
gross margins increased to 60.9% in the second quarter of 2000, compared to
53.0% in the second quarter of 1999. This increase in product margins was
primarily attributable to increased licensing of the Company's enterprise
software products, which have higher gross margins than sales of the Company's
hardware products. Software revenue as a percentage of total revenues increased
to 16% in the second quarter of 2000 from 11% in the second quarter of 1999.
Other factors affecting product gross margins include the impact of component
cost declines being greater than the impact of product price declines. The
Company currently believes that product price declines will continue.

    Service gross margins decreased to 30.7% in the second quarter of 2000,
compared to 32.4% in the second quarter of 1999. The decrease in service margins
from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to a

                                       16
<PAGE>
decrease in service revenues for Data General products caused by the closure of
certain international sales offices.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $194.3 and $139.7 in the
second quarters of 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $54.6, or 39%.
R&D expenses were 9.1% and 8.5% of revenues in the second quarters of 2000 and
1999, respectively. The increase in R&D spending levels from 1999 to 2000
reflects the Company's ongoing research and development efforts in a variety of
areas, including EMC Enterprise Storage Network technologies, network attached
storage products, enhancements to the Symmetrix family of products, new
enterprise storage software products and fibre channel connectivity products.
The Company expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the
balance of 2000 and thereafter.

    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

    Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $506.1 and $336.0
in the second quarters of 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $170.1, or
51%. SG&A expenses were 23.6% and 20.4% of revenues in the second quarters of
2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in spending levels was primarily due
to the Company's efforts to build an infrastructure to achieve broader coverage
and greater account depth around the world and to expand its technical sales
organization to support the current and expected growth in software revenues.

    INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE

    Investment income increased to $48.1 in the second quarter of 2000 from
$29.6 in the second quarter of 1999. Interest income was earned primarily from
investments in cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. Investment
income increased in the second quarter 2000 primarily due to higher cash and
investment balances which were derived from operations.

    Interest expense decreased to $3.0 in the second quarter of 2000 from $8.2
in the second quarter of 1999 primarily due to conversion of the Company's
3 1/4% convertible subordinated notes due 2002 (the "3 1/4% Notes") during
March 2000 and the Company's 6% convertible subordinated notes due 2004 (the "6%
Notes") during May 2000.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

    The provision for income taxes was $158.7 and $96.9 in the second quarters
of 2000 and 1999, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of 27.0%
and 25.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate is less than U.S. statutory
rates due to the Company's various tax strategies and benefits related to
offshore manufacturing.

investments in cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. Investment
income increased in the first six months of 2000 primarily due to higher cash
and investment balances which were derived from operations.

    Interest expense decreased to $9.8 in the first six months of 2000 from
$17.0 in the first six months of 1999 primarily due to conversion of the
Company's 3 1/4% Notes during March 2000 and the Company's 6% Notes during
May 2000.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

    The provision for income taxes was $281.5 and $170.9 in the first six months
of 2000 and 1999, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of 27.0%
and 25.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate is less than U.S. statutory

offshore manufacturing.

    RESTRUCTURING, MERGER AND OTHER CHARGES

    During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company approved and implemented a
restructuring program in connection with its acquisition of Data General
Corporation. The restructuring plan, which is expected to be completed by
December 2000, provides for the consolidation of the Company's operations and
elimination of duplicative facilities worldwide. Accordingly, during the fourth
quarter of 1999, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $170.6 related
to employee termination benefits, facility closure costs, asset disposals, and
other exit costs which the Company has recorded in operating expenses. The total
cash impact of the charge is approximately $140.7, of which $52.4 was paid in
1999 and $43.5 was paid in 2000.

    The program included a net reduction of the workforce by approximately 1,100
employees, approximately 59% of whom are or were based in North America and 23%
of whom are or were based in Europe. The employee separations affect the
majority of business functions and job classes. As of June 30, 2000, employee
separations due to restructuring actions totaled approximately 900.

    During fiscal year 1998, Data General recorded a charge of $82.4 related to
a restructuring program. The charge included employee termination benefits,
asset write-downs, and other exit costs. The total cash impact of the
restructuring charge is approximately $58.5, of which $46.0 was paid prior to
December 31, 1999 and $1.5 was paid during the first six months of 2000. As of
June 30, 2000, the remaining accruals of $14.3 from the 1998 restructuring
program are related to excess vacant rental properties in Europe.

    FINANCIAL CONDITION

    Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $3,664.6
and $3,173.7 at June 30, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively, an increase
of $490.9. Cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of
2000 was $1,017.2, generated primarily from net income. Cash used by investing
activities was $439.4, principally from the acquisition of Softworks, Inc. and
additions to property, plant and equipment. Cash provided by financing
activities was $112.0, principally from the issuance of common stock from stock
option exercises.

    In March 1997, the Company sold $517.5 of the 3 1/4% Notes. On March 15,
2000, all of the outstanding 3 1/4% Notes were converted into Common Stock. In
May 1997, Data General Corporation sold $212.8 of the 6% Notes, which were
assumed by the Company in connection with the acquisition of Data General in
1999. The 6% Notes were generally convertible into shares of EMC common stock at
a conversion price of approximately $41.91 per share, subject to adjustment in
certain events. As of June 30, 2000, $212.6 of the 6% Notes were converted into
EMC common stock. The Company paid approximately one hundred fifty-five thousand
dollars to redeem the remaining 6% Notes.

    At June 30, 2000, the Company had available for use its credit line of $50.0
and may elect to borrow at any time. Based on its current operating and capital
expenditure forecasts, the Company believes that the combination of funds
currently available, funds generated from operations and its available line of
credit will be adequate to finance its ongoing operations.

    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements"
subsequently updated by SAB 101A and SAB 101B ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 summarizes
certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles
to revenue recognition in financial statements. The Company is required to adopt
SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of SAB 101 on its results of operations and
financial position.

    In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation--an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44
clarifies the application of APB Opinion No. 25 and among other issues clarifies
the following: the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB
Opinion No. 25, the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequence of various modifications to the
terms of previously fixed stock options or awards, and the accounting for an
exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is
effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in FIN 44 cover specific events
that occurred after either December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The Company
does not expect FIN 44 to have a material impact on its results of operations
and financial position.

    In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments--an amendment of FAS 133" ("Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities"). This statement amends the accounting and
reporting standards for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities.
The Company is required to adopt FAS 138 no later than the third quarter of
fiscal 2000 and is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of FAS 138 on its
results of operations and financial position.

    YEAR 2000 ISSUES

    The information provided below constitutes a "Year 2000 Readiness
Disclosure" under the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.

    To date, EMC has not experienced, and is not aware of, any significant Year
2000 problems or disruptions in any of its internal systems or products and has
not received any notification from any of its key vendors, suppliers or other
third parties of any significant Year 2000 problems or disruptions.

    EMC had established a Year 2000 program to assess and remediate potential
systems and software problems in interpreting certain dates. EMC also received
certifications or statements of Year 2000 compliance from all of its key vendors
and suppliers and developed a contingency plan to address the most reasonably
likely worst-case scenarios for Year 2000 problems or disruptions.

    The total cost of EMC's Year 2000 program has not had, and EMC does not
anticipate that the total cost of this program will have a material effect on
its business, results of operations or financial condition; however, EMC cannot,
at this time, be assured that Year 2000 problems or disruptions in its internal
systems or products, or in the systems or products of third parties will not
have such a material effect on its business, results of operations or financial
condition.

    FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

    This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" as
defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ

certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) component quality and
availability; (ii) delays in the development of new technology and the
transition to new products; (iii) competitive factors, including but not limited
to pricing pressures, in the computer storage and server markets; (iv) the
relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines;
(v) economic trends in various geographic markets and fluctuating currency
exchange rates; (vi) deterioration or termination of the agreements with certain
of the Company's resellers or original equipment manufacturers and other
indirect channel participants; (vii) the uneven pattern of quarterly sales;
(viii) risks associated with strategic investments and acquisitions; (ix) the
ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; and (x) other one-time
events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in
EMC's other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of

Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares available for
grant under the plan by 20,000,000, and an amendment to the Company's 1989
Employee Stock Purchase Plan as described in the Company's Proxy Statement. The
