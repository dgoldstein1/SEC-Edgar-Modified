4. Comprehensive Income

   Effective  January 1, 1998, the Company adopted  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income."  This Statement establishes standards for reporting and
displaying  comprehensive  income and its  components  (revenues,
expenses,  gains  and  losses) in a full set  of  general-purpose
financial statements.  This Statement requires the classification
of  items  of comprehensive income by their nature in a financial
statement  and  the  accumulated balance of  other  comprehensive
income  separately from retained earnings and additional  paid-in
capital  in  the equity section of the balance sheet.   Financial
statements for prior periods must be restated.

  The Company's total comprehensive income is as follows:

                                  For the Three           For the Nine

5. Litigation

   In  August 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit  against
the  Company in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging that the Company is infringing  two
patents  and  seeking unspecified damages.  The Company  filed  a
motion  to transfer the case to the United States District  Court
for  the  District of Massachusetts and a motion to  dismiss  the
suit.   The  Company's motion to transfer was granted with  leave
for  the plaintiff to amend the complaint to overcome the grounds
for  dismissal. In the amended complaint, TM alleged infringement
only as to one of the two patents originally at issue.  Discovery
in  this  case has concluded.  The Company's motions for  summary
judgment  based on invalidity and noninfringement were  heard  on
November 5, 1998.  A trial is set for January 1999.  The  Company
believes TM's claims are without merit.

   In  December  1997,  NewFrame Corporation Ltd.  ("NewFrame")
filed  suit  against  the Company in the United  States  District
Court  for  the District of Massachusetts.  The suit  contains  a
variety  of  allegations  relating  to  the  Company's   use   of
NewFrame's  software  developments,  including  various  contract
claims  and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks monetary  damages
relating primarily to lost future profits.  The Company  filed  a
motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted in part.   The
Company believes NewFrame's claims are without merit.

  In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed
suit against the Company in the United States District Court  for
the Northern District of California alleging that the Company was
infringing  a patent purported to cover virtual tape and  seeking
unspecified damages.  The Company's response to the complaint was
to  raise  as  an  affirmative defense that EMC was  licensed  to
promote  the use of, market, sell and make virtual tape  products
pursuant to a patent license agreement between EMC and STK  dated
April 11, 1996 (the "License Agreement").  After a trial held  in
August 1998, the court ruled that EMC is licensed to promote  the
use  of, market, sell and make virtual tape products pursuant  to
the  License Agreement.  As a result, the Court found that  STK's
suit was without foundation and awarded costs to EMC.  In October
1998, STK filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court's ruling.

 NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)
                                
       (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)


   The  Company is a party to other litigation which it considers
routine  and  incidental  to its business.  Management  does  not
expect  the  results of any of these actions to have  a  material
adverse  effect on the Company's business, results of  operations
or financial condition.


6. Acquisitions

   In April, July and August of 1998, the Company acquired all of
the outstanding common stock of Groupe MCI, Millennia III,  Inc.,
and  Conley Corporation, respectively, in exchange for  cash  and
common  stock.   The acquisitions were accounted  for  using  the
purchase  method.  Accordingly, the purchase price was  allocated
to  assets  and liabilities acquired based on their fair  values.
Pro   forma   presentations  have  not  been  included   as   the
acquisitions  were not material to the results of  operations  or
financial condition of the Company.


7. New Accounting Pronouncement

   In  June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,  Accounting
for  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("FAS 133").
FAS  133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning  after June 15, 1999 (January 1, 2000 for the Company).
FAS  133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded  on
the  balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value
of  derivatives  are  recorded  each  period  in  either  current
earnings  or other comprehensive income, depending on  whether  a
derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and,  if
it  is,  the  type  of hedge transaction.  For  fair-value  hedge
transactions  in  which the Company is hedging  changes  in  fair
value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment, changes in  the
fair  value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset
in  the  income  statement by changes in the fair  value  of  the
hedged  item.   For cash-flow hedge transactions,  in  which  the
Company  is  hedging the variability of cash flows related  to  a
variable-rate  asset,  liability, or  a  forecasted  transaction,
changes  in the fair value of the derivative instrument  will  be
reported in other comprehensive income.  The gains and losses  on
the   derivative   instrument  that   are   reported   in   other
comprehensive  income will be reclassified  as  earnings  in  the
periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of  the
cash  flows of the hedged item.  The ineffective portion  of  all
hedges will be recognized in current earnings.

   The  Company is assessing the impact of FAS 133, and currently
believes  it  will not have a material impact on its earnings  or
statement of financial position.

   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and  Results  of  Operations should be read in  conjunction  with
"Factors That May Affect Future Results" set forth on  page  17
and  in EMC's other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.

All  dollar amounts in this Management's Discussion and  Analysis
are in millions.

Results of Operations - Third Quarter of 1998 compared to Third
Quarter of 1997

 Revenues

   Total  revenues  for the third quarter of 1998  were  $1,002.5
compared to $732.6 for the third quarter of 1997, an increase  of
$269.9 or 37%.

   Enterprise  systems revenues from products sold  directly  and
through  OEMs and resellers were $792.0 in the third  quarter  of
1998,  compared  to  $621.0  in the third  quarter  of  1997,  an
increase  of  $171.0 or 28%.  The increase was due  to  continued
strong  demand  for the Company's Symmetrix series  of  products.
These  products  address the growing demand  for  enterprise-wide
storage  solutions,  allowing users to move,  store  and  protect
mission  critical information in mainframe, UNIX and  Windows  NT
environments.

   Enterprise  software revenues from products sold directly  and
through  OEMs and resellers were $117.5 in the third  quarter  of
1998  compared to $49.8 in the third quarter of 1997, an increase
of  $67.7 or 136%.  Enterprise software products provide  primary
and  extended functionality for the Company's enterprise  storage
products.

   Revenues  from products sold by McDATA Corporation,  primarily
the  ESCON  Director series of products, were $36.2 in the  third
quarter of 1998, compared to $43.1 in the third quarter of  1997,
a  decrease  of  $6.9  or  16%,  due  primarily  to  the  product
transition from ESCON-based to fibre channel-based directors.

  Revenues from service and rental income were $56.7 in the third
quarter of 1998, compared to $18.6 in the third quarter of  1997,
an  increase  of  $38.1 or 205%, primarily as  a  result  of  the
acquisitions of the professional services businesses  Groupe  MCI
and Millennia III, Inc. in the second and third quarters of 1998.

   In  May 1998, the Company announced the expansion of the terms
and  scope  of  its original reseller agreement  with  HP.   This
enables  HP  to  resell  the  Company's  enterprise  systems  and
software  for connection to its Intel-based HP NetServer Systems,
a leading Windows NT platform.  Revenues for the third quarter of
1998 and 1997 under this agreement were $164.7 and $134.6, or 16%
and 18% of total revenues, respectively.

   In July 1998, the Company announced a reseller agreement under
which  ICL  will  resell  the Company's  enterprise  systems  and
software  for  connection  to ICL's  Trimetra  range  of  servers
running VME, Unix and Windows NT.

   Revenues on sales into the North American markets were  $624.1
in  the  third  quarter of 1998 compared to $426.7 in  the  third
quarter  of  1997,  an increase of $197.4 or  46%.   The  revenue
growth in North America reflects continued strong demand for  the
Company's products and services.

   Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, Africa  and  the
Middle East were $294.9 in the third quarter of 1998 compared  to
$221.6 in the third quarter of 1997, an increase of $73.3 or 33%.

   Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific  region
were $67.9 in the third quarter of 1998 compared to $77.4 in  the
third  quarter of 1997, a decrease of $9.5 or 12%.  The  decrease
is  principally  attributable  to  the  current  economic  trends
affecting the Asia Pacific markets.

                                 10

<PAGE>

   Revenues on sales into the markets of South America were $15.6
in  the  third  quarter of 1998 compared to  $6.9  in  the  third
quarter of 1997, an increase of $8.7 or 127%, as a result of  the
Company's efforts to expand its business in this region.


 Gross Margins

   Gross  margins  increased to 52.3% of revenues  in  the  third
quarter  of  1998,  compared to 46.6% of revenues  in  the  third
quarter  of  1997.   This increase is primarily  attributable  to
increased  licensing of the Company's enterprise  software  which
has higher gross margins than sales of enterprise systems.  Other
factors  affecting  gross margins in the third  quarter  of  1998
include the impact of component cost declines being greater  than
the  impact  of  product price declines.  The  Company  currently
believes that product price declines will continue.


 Research and Development

   Research  and  development ("R&D") expenses were  $80.4  and
$56.5  in  the third quarters of 1998 and 1997, respectively,  an
increase  of  $23.9 or 42%.  R&D expenses were 8.0% and  7.7%  of
revenues  in  the third quarters of 1998 and 1997,  respectively.
The  dollar  increase was primarily due to the cost of  technical
staff  and  equipment to support a variety of projects  including
both  ongoing  development of enterprise  software  products  and
fibre  channel connectivity and also includes the integration  of
Conley  Corporation  in  August 1998.   The  Company  expects  to
continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the balance  of
1998 and thereafter.


 Selling, General and Administrative

   Selling,  general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses  were
$193.1  and  $122.1  in  the third quarters  of  1998  and  1997,
respectively,  an increase of $71.0 or 58%.  SG&A  expenses  were
19.3%  and  16.7% of revenues in the third quarters of  1998  and
1997,  respectively.  The dollar and percentage increase  is  due
primarily  to  costs  associated with a continued  investment  in
additional  worldwide  sales  and  support  personnel  and  their
related  overhead  costs,  with  the  objective  of  building  an
infrastructure  to achieve broader coverage and  greater  account
depth around the world. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in
dollar terms for the balance of 1998 and thereafter.


 Investment Income and Interest Expense

   Investment  income  was $25.8 in the  third  quarter  of  1998
compared  with  $20.7 in the same period a  year  ago.   Interest
income was earned from investments in cash equivalents, and short
and  long-term investments.  Investment income increased  in  the
third quarter of 1998 primarily due to higher cash and investment
balances which were derived from operations.

   Interest  expense  was $4.9 in the third quarter  of  1998  as
compared  to  $4.7  in  the third quarter  of  1997  and  relates
primarily to the $517.5 of 3 1/4%  convertible subordinated notes
due 2002 issued in March 1997.


 Other Income/(Expense), Net

   The  net other expense was $3.4 in the third quarter  of  1998
compared with the net expense of $0.3 in the same period  a  year
ago.   The increase is primarily attributable to costs associated
with  a  bond  offering  which  was cancelled  during  the  third
quarter,  gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions,  and
losses on sales of fixed assets.

                                 11

 Provision for Income Taxes

  The provision for income taxes was $67.1 and $45.8 in the third
quarters  of  1998 and 1997, respectively, which resulted  in  an
effective  tax  rate of 25.0% in the third quarter  of  1998  and
25.7%  in  the  third  quarter of  1997.   The  decrease  in  the
effective  tax rate is mainly attributable to the realization  of
benefits  associated with the continued progress on the Company's
various tax strategies.

Results  of  Operations - First Nine Months of 1998  compared  to
First Nine Months of 1997

 Revenues

   Total  revenues for the first nine months ended September  30,
1998 were $2,782.9 compared to $2,064.5 for the first nine months
of 1997, an increase of $718.4 or 35%.

   Enterprise  systems revenues from products sold  directly  and
through OEMs and resellers were $2,256.6 in the first nine months
of  1998, compared to $1,756.0 in the first nine months of  1997,
an  increase of $500.6 or 29%.  The increase was due to continued
strong  demand  for the Company's Symmetrix series  of  products.
These  products  address the growing demand  for  enterprise-wide
storage  solutions,  allowing users to move,  store  and  protect
mission  critical information in mainframe, UNIX and  Windows  NT
environments.

   Enterprise  software revenues from products sold directly  and
through  OEMs and resellers were $281.4 in the first nine  months
of  1998 compared to $117.2 in the first nine months of 1997,  an
increase of $164.2 or 140%.  Enterprise software products provide
primary  and extended functionality for the Company's  enterprise
storage products.

   Revenues  from products sold by McDATA Corporation,  primarily
the  ESCON Director series of products, were $132.5 in the  first
nine  months of 1998, compared to $136.2 in the first nine months
of  1997, a decrease of $3.7 or 3%, due primarily to the  product
transition from ESCON-based to fibre channel-based directors.

   Revenues  from service and rental income were  $112.3  in  the
first  nine  months of 1998, compared to $55.1 in the first  nine
months  of  1997, an increase of $57.2 or 104%,  primarily  as  a
result   of   the  acquisitions  of  the  professional   services
businesses  Groupe MCI and Millennia III, Inc. in the second  and
third quarters of 1998.

   In  May 1998, the Company announced the expansion of the terms
and  scope  of  its original reseller agreement  with  HP.   This
enables  HP  to  resell  the  Company's  enterprise  systems  and
software  for connection to its Intel-based HP NetServer Systems,
a  leading  Windows  NT platform.  Revenues for  the  first  nine
months  of  1998  and 1997 under this agreement were  $507.7  and
$360.7, or 18% and 17% of total revenues, respectively.

  Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $1,683.0
in  the  first  nine months of 1998 compared to $1,188.9  in  the
first  nine  months of 1997, an increase of $494.1 or  42%.   The
revenue growth in North America reflects continued strong  demand
for the Company's products and services.

   Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, Africa  and  the
Middle East were $852.3 in the first nine months of 1998 compared
to $656.7 in the first nine months of 1997, an increase of $195.6
or 30%.

   Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific  region
were  $216.0 in the first nine months of 1998 compared to  $204.5
in  the  first nine months of 1997, an increase of $11.5  or  6%.
The reduced growth rate in 1998 is principally attributable to  a
downturn in economic trends in the Asia Pacific markets.

   Revenues on sales into the markets of South America were $31.6
in  the first nine months of 1998 compared to $14.4 in the  first
nine months of 1997, an increase of $17.2 or 119%, as a result of
the Company's efforts to expand its business in this region.

 Gross Margins

   Gross margins increased to 50.5% of revenues in the first nine
months  of 1998, compared to 46.1% of revenues in the first  nine
months  of  1997.   This  increase is primarily  attributable  to
increased  licensing of the Company's enterprise  software  which
has higher gross margins than sales of enterprise systems.  Other
factors affecting gross margins in the first nine months of  1998
include the impact of component cost declines being greater  than
the  impact  of  product price declines.  The  Company  currently
believes that product price declines will continue.


 Research and Development

   Research  and development ("R&D") expenses were  $220.3  and
$158.1  in  the first nine months of 1998 and 1997, respectively,
an  increase of $62.2 or 39%.  R&D expenses were 7.9% and 7.7% of
revenues in the first nine months of 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The  dollar  increase was primarily due to the cost of  technical
staff  and  equipment to support a variety of projects  including
both  ongoing  development of enterprise  software  products  and
fibre  channel connectivity and also includes the integration  of
Conley  Corporation  in  August 1998.   The  Company  expects  to
continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the balance  of
1998 and thereafter.


 Selling, General and Administrative

   Selling,  general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses  were
$523.9  and  $334.4 in the first nine months of  1998  and  1997,
respectively,  an increase of $189.5 or 57%.  SG&A expenses  were
18.8% and 16.2% of revenues in the first nine months of 1998  and
1997,  respectively.  The dollar and percentage increase  is  due
primarily  to  costs  associated with a continued  investment  in
additional  worldwide  sales  and  support  personnel  and  their
related  overhead  costs,  with  the  objective  of  building  an
infrastructure  to achieve broader coverage and  greater  account
depth  around the world.  SG&A expenses are expected to  increase
in dollar terms for the balance of 1998 and thereafter.


 Investment Income and Interest Expense

   Investment income was $72.2 in the first nine months  of  1998
compared  with  $49.8  in the same period a  year  ago.  Interest
income was earned from investments in cash equivalents, and short
and  long-term investments.  Investment income increased  in  the
first  nine  months  of 1998 primarily due  to  higher  cash  and
investment balances which were derived from operations.

   Interest expense increased by $3.9 to $14.6 in the first  nine
months  of 1998 from $10.7 in the first nine months of 1997.  The
increase was attributable to the $517.5  of  3 1/4%  convertible
subordinated notes due 2002 issued in March 1997.


 Other Income/(Expense), Net

  The net other expense was $3.6 in the first nine months of 1998
compared  with the net other income of $1.4 in the same period  a
year   ago.   The  increase  in  the  net  expense  is  primarily
attributable to costs associated with a bond offering  which  was
cancelled  during the third quarter, gains and losses on  foreign
exchange transactions, and losses on sales of fixed assets.


 Provision for Income Taxes

   The  provision for income taxes was $179.0 and $128.4  in  the
first  nine months of 1998 and 1997, respectively, which resulted
in  an  effective tax rate of 25.0% in the first nine  months  of
1998 and 25.7% in the first nine months of 1997.  The decrease in
the  effective tax rate is mainly attributable to the realization
of  benefits  associated  with  the  continued  progress  on  the
Company's various tax strategies.

                                 14

 Financial Condition

   Cash  and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments
were $1,926.7 and $1,650.6 at September 30, 1998 and December 31,
1997, respectively, an increase of $276.1.

  Cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months
of  1998  was $597.4, generated primarily from net income.   Cash
used  by  investing  activities was $680.8, principally  for  the
purchase of short-term and long-term investments and additions to
property,  plant and equipment.  The year-over-year  increase  in
additions   to   property,  plant  and  equipment  is   primarily
attributable to the construction of the manufacturing  facilities
in  Franklin,  Massachusetts  and Cork,  Ireland.   The  increase
includes  approximately  $10.1 accrued for  construction  of  the
manufacturing  facility  in  Massachusetts.   Cash  provided   by
financing activities was $33.3, principally from the issuance  of
common stock from stock option exercises.

   At  September 30, 1998, the Company had available for use  its
credit line of $50 and may elect to borrow at any time.

    Based  on  its  current  operating  and  capital  expenditure
forecasts, the Company presently believes that the combination of
funds  currently available, funds generated from  operations  and
its  available  line of credit will be adequate  to  finance  its
ongoing operations.


 New Accounting Pronouncement

   In  June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,  Accounting
for  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("FAS 133").
FAS  133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning  after June 15, 1999 (January 1, 2000 for the Company).
FAS  133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded  on
the balance sheet at their fair value.  Changes in the fair value
of  derivatives  are  recorded  each  period  in  either  current
earnings  or other comprehensive income, depending on  whether  a
derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and,  if
it  is,  the  type  of hedge transaction.  For  fair-value  hedge
transactions  in  which the Company is hedging  changes  in  fair
value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment, changes in  the
fair  value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset
in  the  income  statement by changes in the fair  value  of  the
hedged  item.   For cash-flow hedge transactions,  in  which  the
Company  is  hedging the variability of cash flows related  to  a
variable-rate  asset,  liability, or  a  forecasted  transaction,
changes  in the fair value of the derivative instrument  will  be
reported in other comprehensive income.  The gains and losses  on
the   derivative   instrument  that   are   reported   in   other
comprehensive  income will be reclassified  as  earnings  in  the
periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of  the
cash  flows of the hedged item.  The ineffective portion  of  all
hedges will be recognized in current earnings.

   The  Company is assessing the impact of FAS 133, and currently
believes  it  will not have a material impact on its earnings  or
statement of financial position.


 Year 2000 Issues

    Certain   computer  hardware  and  software  is   unable   to
appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year  2000.   These
systems  and software refer to years in terms of their final  two
digits  only and may interpret the year 2000 as the year 1900  in
error.   Therefore, they will need to be modified  prior  to  the
year  2000  in  order  to  remain functional.   The  Company  has
established  a  Year  2000 program that  involves  assessing  the
Company's   key  hardware  and  software,  assessing  Year   2000
compliance by third parties with which the Company has a material
relationship,  assessing Year 2000 compliance  of  the  Company's
products, and modifying and  testing hardware and software in  the
Company's internal systems and products, where necessary.

   The  Company  has completed an assessment of the hardware  and
software  in  its  core  business  information  systems  and  has
substantially completed the necessary modifications.  The Company
is  now  extending the assessment and remediation process to  the
hardware  and software in other information systems used  in  its
operations.  The Company has contacted key vendors and  suppliers
and  other third parties whose systems failures could potentially
have  a  significant impact on the Company's  operations  and  is
currently   assessing   questionnaire   responses   and   related
information from such third parties.

                                 15

<PAGE>

  The Company has designed and tested the current versions of its
Symmetrix  series  of products and the current  versions  of  its
other  products to be Year 2000 compliant.  Some of the Company's
customers are running earlier versions of its Symmetrix series of
products  and other products that have not been tested  for  Year
2000 compliance.  The Company has made upgrades available for the
older  versions  of  its Symmetrix series  of  products  and  for
certain  other  of its older products so that such products  will
test as Year 2000 compliant.

   The  Company anticipates that its Year 2000 conversion program
will  be  completed  in a timely manner.  The  Company  does  not
anticipate  that  the  total cost of such  program  will  have  a
material  effect on the Company's business, results of operations
or financial condition.

   The  most reasonably likely worst case scenario regarding  the
Year  2000 issue would include a hardware failure, the corruption
or  loss  of data contained in the Company's internal information
systems, a failure affecting the Company's key vendors, suppliers
or  customers, the failure of infrastructure services provided by
government   agencies  or  other  third  parties,  and   customer
dissatisfaction  related  to  the performance  of  the  Company's
products.

   The  Company is currently assessing the need for a  Year  2000
contingency plan.  However, the Company anticipates that its Year
2000  conversion program will be completed far enough in  advance
of  January 1, 2000 so as to formulate a contingency plan at such
time, if necessary.  The Company expects its contingency plan, if
developed, would include,  among other things, manual "work-
arounds" for  hardware and  software  failures, as well as
substitution of  systems, if required.

   There  can  be  no assurance that conversion of the  Company's
hardware and software will be successful, that key third  parties
will  have  successful conversion programs,  that  the  Company's
products  do not contain undetected errors or defects  associated
with Year 2000 date functions, or that other factors relating  to
Year  2000  compliance, including litigation,  will  not  have  a
material  adverse  effect on the Company's business,  results  of
operations or financial condition.


 Euro Conversion

   On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries  of
the  European  Union are scheduled to establish fixed  conversion
rates  between their existing sovereign currencies and the  euro.
The  participating  countries have agreed to adopt  the  euro  as
their  common  legal currency on that date.  The euro  will  then
trade  on  currency  exchanges  and  be  available  for  non-cash
transactions.   The participating countries will issue  sovereign
debt  exclusively  in  euros, and will  redenominate  outstanding
sovereign  debt.  At that time, the participating countries  will
no  longer  control  their  own monetary  policies  by  directing
independent  interest rates for the legacy currencies.   Instead,
the  authority to direct monetary policy, including money  supply
and official interest rates for the euro will be exercised by the
new European Central Bank.

   Following  the introduction of the euro, the legacy currencies
are  scheduled  to  remain  legal  tender  in  the  participating
countries  as denominations of the euro between January  1,  1999
and  January  1,  2002 (the "transition period").   During  the
transition period, public and private parties may pay  for  goods
and services using either the euro or the participating country's
legacy  currency  on  a "no compulsion, no prohibition"  basis.
However,  conversion  rates no longer will be  computed  directly
from  one  legacy  currency to another.   Instead,  a  triangular
process  will apply whereby an amount denominated in  one  legacy
currency  will  first be converted into the euro.  The  resultant
euro-denominated  amount will then be converted  into  the  third
legacy currency.

   The Company has established plans and has begun developing the
necessary  modifications  for  the technical  adaptation  of  its
internal  information technology and other systems to accommodate
euro-denominated   transactions.   The   Company   is   currently
assessing  the business implications of conversion to  the  euro,
including   the  long  term  competitive  implications   of   the
conversions  and  the  effect  on market  risk  with  respect  to
financial  instruments. At this time, management is also  in  the
process  of  evaluating other impacts of this conversion  on  the
Company, including the potential actions which may or may not  be
taken by the Company's competitors and suppliers.  The Company is
currently  unable to determine the ultimate financial impact,  if
any, of the conversion on its operations.

 Factors That May Affect Future Results

   This  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking
statements  as defined under the Federal Securities Laws.  Actual
results  could  differ  materially from those  projected  in  the
forward-looking statements as a result of certain  risk  factors,
including  but not limited to: (i) a failure by any  supplier  of
high density DRAMs, disk drives or other components to meet EMC's
requirements for an extended period of time; (ii) delays  in  the
development of new technology and the transition to new products;
(iii) the historic and recurring "hockey stick" pattern of  the
Company's  sales  by  which a disproportionate  percentage  of  a
quarter's total sales occur in the last month and weeks and  days
of  each  quarter;  (iv)  the "hockey  stick"  pattern  of  the
Company's  sales, making it extremely difficult to predict  near-
term  demand  and  adjust  production capacity  accordingly;  (v)
competitive  factors,  including  but  not  limited  to   pricing
pressures,  in the computer storage market; (vi) economic  trends
in  various geographic markets and fluctuating currency  exchange
rates; (vii) the relative and varying rates of product price  and
component  cost declines; (viii) deterioration or termination  of
the  agreements with certain of the Company's OEMs or  resellers;
(ix)  risks  associated with acquisitions; (x) Year 2000  issues;
(xi)  other one-time events and other important factors disclosed
previously and from time to time in EMC's other filings with  the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

                            PART II.
                        OTHER INFORMATION
                                
Item 1.   Legal Proceedings

   In  August 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit  against
the  Company in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging that the Company is infringing  two
patents  and  seeking unspecified damages.  The Company  filed  a
motion  to transfer the case to the United States District  Court
for  the  District of Massachusetts and a motion to  dismiss  the
suit.   The  Company's motion to transfer was granted with  leave
for  the plaintiff to amend the complaint to overcome the grounds
for dismissal.  In the amended complaint, TM alleged infringement
only as to one of the two patents originally at issue.  Discovery
in  this  case has concluded.  The Company's motions for  summary
judgment  based on invalidity and noninfringement were  heard  on
November  5, 1998.  A trial is set for January 1999. The  Company
believes TM's claims are without merit.

   In  December  1997,  NewFrame Corporation Ltd.  ("NewFrame")
filed  suit  against  the Company in the United  States  District
Court  for  the District of Massachusetts.  The suit  contains  a
variety  of  allegations  relating  to  the  Company's   use   of
NewFrame's  software  developments,  including  various  contract
claims  and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks monetary  damages
relating primarily to lost future profits.  The Company  filed  a
motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted in part.   The
Company believes NewFrame's claims are without merit.

  In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed
suit against the Company in the United States District Court  for
the Northern District of California alleging that the Company was
infringing  a patent purported to cover virtual tape and  seeking
unspecified damages.  The Company's response to the complaint was
to  raise  as  an  affirmative defense that EMC was  licensed  to
promote  the use of, market, sell and make virtual tape  products
pursuant to a patent license agreement between EMC and STK  dated
April 11, 1996 (the "License Agreement").  After a trial held  in
August 1998, the court ruled that EMC is licensed to promote  the
use  of, market, sell and make virtual tape products pursuant  to
the  License Agreement.  As a result, the Court found that  STK's
suit was without foundation and awarded costs to EMC.  In October
1998, STK filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court's ruling.

   The  Company is a party to other litigation which it considers
routine  and  incidental to its business.   Management  does  not
expect  the  results of any of these actions to have  a  material
adverse  effect on the Company's business, results of  operations
or financial condition.


Item 2.   Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds

   On  July  1,  1998, the Company issued 504,464 shares  of  its
common  stock, $.01 par value per share, in connection  with  the
acquisition of Millennia III, Inc, a professional services firm.

   These  shares  were issued pursuant to an exemption  from  the
registration  requirements  of the Securities  Act  of  1933,  as
amended  (the  "Securities Act"), provided for  in  Section  4(2)
thereunder.

  The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the
Securities  and  Exchange Commission under  the  Securities  Act,
which  became effective on August 5, 1998 and which  permits  the
resale, on a registered basis, of these shares from time to  time
by  the  securityholders named therein.  The Company also  listed
these shares of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
