ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

           On January 25, 2000, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of January 14, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Akamai
Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), Aloha Merger Corporation, a California
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Akamai ("Merger Sub"), and Network24
Communications, Inc., a California corporation ("Network24"), Akamai acquired
Network24 by means of a merger of Network24 into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), with
Merger Sub remaining as the surviving corporation in the Merger. At the
effective time of the Merger, the outstanding shares of the capital stock of
Network24 were converted into the right to receive shares of Akamai common
stock. As a result, stockholders of Network24 became stockholders of Akamai.
Merger Sub continues to conduct the business and operations of Network24 as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Akamai.

           The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. The purchase
price will be allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based
on their estimated fair values. Results of operations for Network24 will be
included in Akamai's consolidated operating results for periods subsequent to
the date of acquisition.

           Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, an aggregate of $12,496,197 in cash
was paid and approximately 620,871 shares of Akamai common stock were issued in
exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Network24. Each
outstanding share of Network24 common stock was converted into the right to
receive 0.037502 of a share of Akamai common stock (the "Common Exchange
Ratio"). Each outstanding share of Network24 Series A preferred stock was
converted into the right to receive (i) a number of shares of Akamai common
stock equal to the number of shares of Network24 common stock into which such
share of Network24 Series A stock was convertible immediately prior to the
Merger, multiplied by 0.028126, and (ii) a cash payment from Akamai in the
amount of $2.156345. Of the approximately 620,871 shares of Akamai common stock
issued in the Merger, approximately 67,516 shares will be held in escrow for the
purpose of indemnifying Akamai against certain liabilities of Network24 for up
to one year after the closing of the Merger. All options, warrants and other
rights to purchase shares of Network24 capital stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger were assumed by Akamai. Each such option, warrant and other
right became exercisable for that number of shares of Akamai common stock equal
to the product of (a) the Common Exchange Ratio and (b) the number of shares of
Network24 capital stock subject to such option, warrant or other right
immediately prior to the Merger. The per share exercise price of each such
option, warrant or other right was adjusted to equal the quotient of (x) the per
share exercise price of such option, warrant or other right immediately prior to
the Merger and (y) the Common Exchange Ratio.

           The consideration paid by Akamai for the outstanding capital stock of
Network24 and the other terms of the Merger Agreement were determined on the
basis of arms' length negotiations.

           Network24 delivers Internet broadcast solutions for enterprises,
Internet content providers and value-added partners. Akamai intends to integrate
Network24's technology into Akamai's EdgeAdvantage platform to provide
corporations, media and entertainment companies the ability to conduct and
manage live and on-demand Internet broadcasts.

           This report may contain information about future expectations, plans
and prospects of Akamai's management that constitute forward-looking statements
for purposes of the safe harbor



                                      -2-

provisions under The Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may
differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a
result of various important factors including, but not limited to, the
dependence on Akamai's Internet content delivery service, a failure of its
network infrastructure, the complexity of its service and the networks on which
the service is deployed, the failure to obtain access to transmission capacity
and other factors that are discussed in Akamai's Registration Statement on Form
S-1 and other documents periodically filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


           THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT") is made and
entered into as of January 14, 2000, by and among AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
("PARENT"), a Delaware corporation; ALOHA MERGER CORPORATION ("SUB"), a

                                    PREAMBLE

           The respective Boards of Directors of Company, Sub and Parent are of
the opinion that the transactions described herein are in the best interests of
the parties to this Agreement and their respective stockholders. This Agreement
provides for the acquisition of Company by Parent pursuant to the merger of
Company with and into Sub. At the effective time of such merger, the outstanding
shares of the capital stock of Company shall be converted into the right to
receive shares of the common stock of Parent (except as provided herein). As a
result, stockholders of Company shall become stockholders of Parent and Sub
shall continue to conduct it's business and operations of Company as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The transactions described in this Agreement
are subject to the approval of the stockholders of Company and the satisfaction
of certain other conditions described in this Agreement. It is the intention of
the parties to this Agreement that the Merger for federal income tax purposes
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.

           Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each of the directors of Company and each of the holders of 5% or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock has executed and delivered to Parent
an agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit 1 (the "VOTING AGREEMENTS"),
pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote the shares of
Company Capital Stock over which such Persons have voting power to approve and
adopt this Agreement.

           Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1 of
this Agreement.

           NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual
warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1

Sub (the "MERGER"). Sub shall be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the
Merger, shall remain a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue to
be governed by the Laws of the State of California. The Merger shall be
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger,
which has been approved and adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of

                           MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

           3.1       CONVERSION OF SHARES

           Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE 3, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Company,
Sub or the stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows:

                     (a)       Each share of capital stock of Parent issued and
           outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
           issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time.

                     (b)       Each share of Sub Common Stock issued and
           outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
           issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time. Each stock
           certificate of Sub evidencing ownership of any shares of Sub Common
           Stock shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of common
           stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                     (c)       Each share of Company Common Stock (excluding
           shares held by Company or any Parent Entity and shares held by
           stockholders who perfect, and not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited at
           or prior to the Effective Time, their statutory dissenters' rights as
           provided in Section 3.4) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
           the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
           converted into and exchanged for (i) the right to receive 0.033752 of
           a share of Parent Common Stock (the "Common Firm Exchange Ratio") and
           (ii) (subject to the provisions of Section 4.3) the contingent right
           to receive 0.003750 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the "Escrow
           Exchange Ratio"). The sum of the Firm Exchange Ratio and the Escrow
           Exchange Ratio (0.037502 of a share of Parent Common Stock) is
           referred to herein as the "Common Exchange Ratio".

                     (d)       Each share of Company Series A Stock (excluding
           shares held by Company or any Parent Entity and shares held by
           stockholders who perfect, and not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited at
           or prior to the Effective Time, their statutory dissenters' rights as
           provided in Section 3.4) issued and outstanding immediately prior to
           the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
           converted into and exchanged for (i) the right to receive a number of
           shares of Parent Common Stock equal



                                      -3-
<PAGE>   9

           to the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such share
           of Company Series A Stock was convertible immediately prior to the
           Effective Time, pursuant to Company's articles of incorporation as in
           effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
           0.024376 (the "Preferred Firm Exchange Ratio"), (ii) (subject to the
           provisions of Section 4.3) the contingent right to receive a number
           of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
           Company Common Stock into which such share of Company Series A Stock
           was convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to
           Company's articles of incorporation as in effect immediately prior to
           the Effective Time, multiplied by the Escrow Exchange Ratio, and
           (iii) the right to receive a cash payment from Parent in the amount
           of $2.156345 (the "Preferred Cash Payment"). For purposes of this
           Agreement, the "Firm Shares" shall mean the aggregate number of
           shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Sections 3.1(c)(i)
           and 3.1(d)(i) and "Escrow Shares" shall mean the aggregate number of
           shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Sections
           3.1(c)(ii) and 3.1(d)(ii).

           3.2       ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS

           In the event Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to such stock
and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective
date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar recapitalization for which
a record date is not established) shall be prior to the Effective Time, the
Common Firm Exchange Ratio, the Preferred Firm Exchange Ratio and the Escrow
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.

           3.3       SHARES HELD BY COMPANY OR PARENT

           Each of the shares of Company Capital Stock held by Company or by any
Parent Entity shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

           3.4       DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS

           Any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who perfects, and has
not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited at or prior to the Effective Time, such
holder's dissenters' rights in accordance with and as contemplated by the
California Corporations Code (a "DISSENTING STOCKHOLDER") shall be entitled to
receive the value of such shares in cash as determined pursuant to such
provision of Law; provided, that no such payment shall be made to any Dissenting
Stockholder unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder has complied with the
applicable provisions of the California Corporations Code and surrendered to
Company the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Company
Capital Stock for which payment is being made. In the event that after the
Effective Time a Dissenting Stockholder of Company fails to perfect, or
effectively withdraws or loses, his right to appraisal and of payment for his
shares of Company Capital Stock, Parent shall issue and deliver the
consideration to which such holder of shares of Company Capital Stock is
entitled under this ARTICLE 3 (without interest) upon surrender by such holder
of the certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock
held by such holder.

           3.5       FRACTIONAL SHARES

           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Firm Share (after taking
into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a
Firm Share multiplied by the last sale price of Parent Common Stock on the
Nasdaq National Market (as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if not
reported thereby, any other authoritative source selected by Parent) on the last
trading day preceding the Effective Time. No such holder will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of any
fractional shares.

           3.6       CONVERSION OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS; RESTRICTED STOCK.

                     (a)       At the Effective Time, each option, warrant or
other Equity Right to purchase shares of Company Capital Stock ("Company Equity
Rights") granted by Company under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise, which are
outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be
converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent
shall assume each Company Equity Right, in accordance with the terms of the
Company Stock Plan and stock option agreement or other agreement or instrument
by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i)
Parent and its Compensation Committee shall be substituted for Company and the
Committee of Company's Board of Directors (including, if applicable, the entire
Board of Directors of Company) administering the Company Stock Plan, (ii) each
Company Equity Right assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of
Parent Common Stock (or cash, if so provided under the terms of such Company
Equity Right), (iii) the maximum number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to such Company Equity Right shall be equal to the number of shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Equity Right immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Common
Exchange Ratio, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such Company
Equity Right shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under
each such Company Equity Right by the Common Exchange Ratio and rounding up to
the nearest cent. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence, Parent shall not be obligated to issue any fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock upon exercise of Company Equity Rights and any
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be subject to a
converted Company Equity Right shall represent the right to receive a cash
payment upon exercise of such converted Company Equity Right equal to the
product of such fraction and the difference between the market value of one
share of Parent Common Stock at the time of exercise of such Option and the per
share exercise price of such Option. The market value of one share of Parent
Common Stock at the time of exercise of an Option shall be the last sale price
of such common stock on the Nasdaq National Market (as reported by The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source
selected by Parent) on the last trading day preceding the date of exercise. In
addition, notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (iii) and (iv) of the first
sentence of this Section 3.6, each Company Equity Right which is an "incentive
stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Internal
Revenue Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to
constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option, within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Internal Revenue Code.

                     (b)       As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the participants in each Company Stock Plan an
appropriate notice setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto and
the grants subject to such Company Stock Plan shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Section 3.6(a)
after giving effect to the Merger), and Parent shall comply with the terms of
each Company Stock Plan to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the
provisions of, such Company Stock Plan, that Company Equity Rights which
qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of
Company Equity Rights assumed by it in accordance with this Section 3.6. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file one or more
registration statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Company Equity Rights granted under the Company Stock Plan and shall use its
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
(and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

                     (c)       All contractual restrictions or limitations on
transfer with respect to Company Common Stock awarded under the Company Stock
Plan or any other plan, program, Contract or arrangement of Company, to the
extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed
(whether as a result of the Merger or otherwise), and except as otherwise
expressly provided in such plan, program, Contract or arrangement, shall remain
in full force and effect with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock into
which such restricted stock is converted pursuant to Section 3.1.

                     (d)       Each of Company and Parent agrees to take all
necessary steps to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.6, including
using its reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder of a Company Equity
Right any Consent or Contract that may be deemed necessary or advisable in order
to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.6, including an
agreement not to exercise after the Effective Time Company Equity Rights granted
under the Company Stock Plan until Parent has filed a registration statement on
Form S-8 in accordance with this Section. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion,
not to deliver the consideration provided in this Section 3.6 to a former holder
of a Company Equity Right who has not delivered such Consent or Contract.

                               EXCHANGE OF SHARES

           4.1       EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

                     (a)       Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
make available to Parent's transfer agent or another exchange agent selected by
Parent (the "Exchange Agent") for exchange in accordance with this Section 4.1
the Firm Shares and cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.5. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent and Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of



                                      -6-
<PAGE>   12

record of a certificate or certificates which represented shares of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Certificates")
appropriate transmittal materials and instructions (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange
Agent), which shall include or be accompanied by the Stockholder Representation
Agreement. The Certificate or Certificates so delivered shall be duly endorsed
as the Exchange Agent may require. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Capital Stock represented by Certificates that are not
registered in the transfer records of Company, the consideration provided in
Section 3.1 may be issued to a transferee if the Certificates representing such
shares are delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Exchange
Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt of
(i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to be
lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (ii) such bond, security or indemnity as
Parent and the Exchange Agent may reasonably require and (iii) any other
documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide exchange thereof, the
Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the consideration into which the
shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall
have been converted. The Exchange Agent may establish such other reasonable and
customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties as it may deem
appropriate.

                     (b)       After the Effective Time, each holder of shares
of Company Capital Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
3.3 or as to which statutory dissenters' rights have been perfected as provided
in Section 3.4) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall deliver to
the Exchange Agent the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares and
the Shareholder Representation Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
3 (or such other form as shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and shall
promptly upon surrender thereof receive in exchange therefor the consideration
provided in Section 3.1, together with all undelivered dividends or
distributions in respect of such shares (without interest thereon) pursuant to
Section 4.2. To the extent required by Section 3.5, each holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time also shall
receive, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates, cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder may be otherwise
entitled (without interest). Parent shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of Company Capital Stock is entitled as
a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such holder's Certificate or
Certificates (or substitute documentation as provided in this Section 4.1) for
exchange as provided in this Section 4.1 and delivers the Stockholder
Representation Agreement, which Company acknowledges and agrees is a condition
to effecting the issuance of Parent Common Stock as a private placement pursuant
to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and that Parent will be relying upon the
representations made by each stockholder of Company in the applicable
Stockholder Representation Agreement in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock to such stockholder.

                     (c)       Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any



                                      -7-
<PAGE>   13

amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be.

                     (d)       Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to a holder of Company Capital Stock for any amounts paid
or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

           4.2       RIGHTS OF FORMER COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS

                     (a)       At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of Company shall be closed as to holders of Company Capital Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Company Capital Stock by any such
holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1, each Certificate theretofore
representing shares of Company Capital Stock (other than shares to be canceled
pursuant to Sections 3.3 and 3.4) shall from and after the Effective Time
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided
in Sections 3.1 and 3.5 in exchange therefor.

                     (b)       Whenever a dividend or other distribution is
declared by Parent on the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at
or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of
record of Parent Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any Certificate until such holder surrenders
such Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 4.1. However, upon
surrender of such Certificate, both the Parent Common Stock certificate
(together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without
interest) and any undelivered dividends and cash payments payable hereunder
(without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each share
represented by such Certificate.

           4.3       ESCROW AGREEMENT

           In connection with the Closing, Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Stockholders' Representative shall have executed and delivered to the other an
escrow agreement (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"), which shall be in substantially the
form of Exhibit 4 (with such reasonable and customary modifications as the
Escrow Agent may require). The Escrow Shares to be issued pursuant to Sections
3.1(c)(ii) and 3.1(d)(ii) shall be issued to, and registered in the name of, the
Escrow Agent as nominee for the holders of Certificates cancelled pursuant to
Section 4.1 and shall held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement and distributed in accordance with terms thereof. The
representations, warranties and agreements of Company contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement
notwithstanding any investigation conducted with respect thereto or any
knowledge acquired as to the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such representation
or warranty.

           4.4       RESTRICTED STOCK; LEGENDING OF CERTIFICATES

           The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with
this Agreement will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under
the Securities Act by reason of Section 4(2) thereof or Regulation D promulgated
thereunder, and Parent is relying on the representations of Company and the
stockholders of the Company with respect to such exemption. Stop transfer
instructions with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock received by each
stockholder of Company pursuant to the Merger will be given to Parent's transfer
agent and there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or shares
issued in substitution thereof, a legend stating in substance:

        "The securities represented hereby have not been registered under the
        Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered, sold,
        transferred or otherwise disposed of unless registered with the
        Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States and the
        securities regulatory authorities of applicable states or unless an
        exemption from such registration is available."

The foregoing legend will also be placed on any certificate representing
securities issued subsequent to the original issuance of the Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger as a result of any transfer of such shares or any stock
dividend, stock split, or other recapitalization as long as the Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to the Merger has not been transferred in such manner to
justify the removal of the legend therefrom.

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY
                   -----------------------------------------

           Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows, except
as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Memorandum:

           5.1       ORGANIZATION, STANDING, AND POWER

           Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of California, and has the corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and to own, lease
and operate its material Assets. Company is duly qualified or licensed to
transact business as a foreign corporation in good standing in the States of the
United States and foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the
nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed,
except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or
licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The minute book and other organizational
documents for Company have been made available to Parent for its review and are
true and complete in all material respects as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and accurately reflect in all material respects all amendments thereto
and all proceedings of the Board of Directors and stockholders thereof.

           5.2       AUTHORITY OF COMPANY; NO BREACH BY AGREEMENT

                     (a)       Company has the corporate power and authority
necessary to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery,
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, including the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action in respect thereof on the part of Company,
subject to the approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger by the holders
of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock, voting as a single class, by the holders of a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, voting as a separate class, and by the holders
of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding
shares of Company Series A Stock, voting as a separate class, which are the only
stockholder votes required for approval of this Agreement and consummation of
the Merger by Company. Subject to such requisite stockholder approval, this
Agreement represents a legal, valid, and binding obligation of Company,
enforceable against Company in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may
be brought).

                     (b)       Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Company, nor the consummation by Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Company with any of the provisions
hereof, will (i) subject to receipt of requisite stockholder approvals, conflict
with or result in a breach of any provision of Company's Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws or the certificate or articles of incorporation or
bylaws of any Company Subsidiary or any resolution adopted by the board of

other health plans, all life insurance plans, and all other employee benefit
plans or fringe benefit plans, including "employee benefit plans" as that term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently adopted, maintained by, sponsored
in whole or in part by, or contributed to by Company or ERISA Affiliate thereof
for the benefit of employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors,
independent contractors, or other beneficiaries and under which employees,
retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or other

Plans"). Any of the Company Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit
plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein

Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts
which are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

                     (c)       There is no "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
Company, or any single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Internal
Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived) (an "ERISA
Affiliate"). Company has not provided, and is not required to provide, security
to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29)
of the Internal Revenue Code.

                     (d)       Company has no Liability for retiree health and
life benefits under any of the Company Benefit Plans and there are no
restrictions on the rights of Company to amend or terminate any such retiree
health or benefit Plan without incurring any Liability thereunder, which
Liability is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                     (e)       Company is not a party to any oral or written (i)
Contract with any stockholders, director, executive officer or other key
employee of Company (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of
which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving
Company of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(B) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee or (C) providing

States and foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature
or conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except

not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

           6.2       AUTHORITY; NO BREACH BY AGREEMENT.

                     (a)       Parent has the corporate power and authority

such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may
be brought).

                     (b)       Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent, nor the consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Parent with any of the provisions hereof,
will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of

Parent's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (ii) constitute or result in
a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to, or result in the creation
of any Lien on any Asset of any Parent Entity under, any Contract or Permit of
any Parent Entity, where such Default or Lien, or any failure to obtain such
Consent, is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, or, (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite
Consents referred to in Section 9.1(b), constitute or result in a Default under,
or require any Consent pursuant to, any Law or Order applicable to any Parent
Entity or any of their respective material Assets.

                     (c)       Other than such Consents, filings, or
notifications which, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably likely to have,

Parent Preferred Stock, none of which are issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Capital Stock are, and all of the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for shares of Company Capital
Stock upon consummation of the Merger, when issued in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding and fully
paid and nonassessable under the DGCL. None of the outstanding shares of Parent
Capital Stock has been, and none of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be

Merger will be, issued in violation of any preemptive rights of the current or
past stockholders of Parent.

           6.4       SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                     (a)       Parent has timely filed and made available to
Company all SEC Documents required to be filed by Parent (the "Parent SEC
Reports"). The Parent SEC Reports (i) at the time filed, complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Laws and
other applicable Laws and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated in such Parent SEC Reports or
necessary in order to make the statements in such Parent SEC Reports, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

<PAGE>   29

consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated,

extensions have been timely filed, granted, and have not expired for periods
ended on or before December 31, 1998, and on or before the date of the most
recent fiscal year end immediately preceding the Effective Time, except to the

to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and all Tax Returns filed are complete
and accurate in all material respects to the Knowledge of Parent. All Taxes
shown on filed Tax Returns have been paid. As of the date of this
Agreement,there is no audit examination, deficiency, or refund Litigation with
respect to any Taxes that is reasonably likely to result in a determination that

except as reserved against in the Parent Financial Statements delivered prior to
the date of this Agreement. All Taxes and other Liabilities due with respect to
completed and settled examinations or concluded Litigation have been paid.

                     (b)       None of the Parent Entities has executed an
extension or waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or
collection of any Tax due (excluding such statutes that relate to years
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable
taxing authorities) that is currently in effect.

                     (c)       The provision for any Taxes due or to become due
for any of the Parent Entities for the period or periods through and including

Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law) as a transferee or successor or by Contract or otherwise.

           Each Parent Entity has in effect all Permits necessary for it to own,

conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and there has occurred no Default under any such Permit, other than
Defaults which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of the Parent Entities:

           or

                     (c)       since January 1, 1995, has received any

           compliance with any of the Laws or Orders which such governmental
           authority or Regulatory Authority enforces, where such noncompliance
           is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
           Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) threatening to revoke any
           Permits, the revocation of which is reasonably likely to have,
           individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,

           issuance of a cease and desist order, formal agreement, directive,
           commitment or memorandum of understanding, or to adopt any Board
           resolution or similar undertaking, which restricts materially the
           conduct of its business.

           6.8       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

           There is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the Knowledge of

employee benefit plan of any Parent Entity, or against any Asset, interest, or
right of any of them, that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor are there any Orders of any
Regulatory Authorities, other governmental authorities, or arbitrators

not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect). As of their respective dates, each of such reports and
documents, including the financial statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto,
complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws. As of its respective
date, each such report and document did not, in all material



                                      -25-

consummation of the transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger, have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action in respect
thereof on the part of Sub. This Agreement represents a legal, valid, and
binding obligation of Sub, enforceable against Sub in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except that the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).

impede or delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to in
Section 9.1(b) or result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of the

upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any of its Subsidiaries which (i) is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse

or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, or
covenants contained herein, and to use its reasonable efforts to prevent or
promptly to remedy the same.

           8.6       INVESTIGATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY.

                     (a)       Prior to the Effective Time and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each Party shall keep
the other Party advised of all material developments relevant to its business
and to consummation of the Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or
cause to be made such investigation of its business and properties and of its
financial and legal conditions as the other Party reasonably requests, provided
that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal
operations. No investigation by a Party shall affect the representations and
warranties of the other Party.

                     (b)       In addition to the Parties' respective
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which is hereby reaffirmed and
adopted, and incorporated by reference herein, each Party shall, and shall cause

such information for any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the

Proposal with respect to Company to preserve the confidentiality of the
information relating to Company provided to such Persons and their Affiliates
and Representatives.

                     (d)       Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice
as soon as practicable after any determination by it of any fact or occurrence
relating to the other Party which it has discovered through the course of its
investigation and which represents, or is reasonably likely to represent, either
a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
other Party or which has had or is reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

           8.7       PRESS RELEASES

           Prior to the Effective Time, Company and Parent shall consult with
each other as to the form and substance of any press release or other public
disclosure materially related to this Agreement or any other transaction
contemplated hereby; provided, that nothing in this Section 8.7 shall be deemed
to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its counsel deems
necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Party's disclosure obligations
imposed by Law.

           8.8       CERTAIN ACTIONS

           Except with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither Company nor any Affiliate thereof nor any

                                      -31-
<PAGE>   37

Representative thereof shall furnish any non-public information that it is not
legally obligated to furnish, negotiate with respect to, or enter into any
Contract with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal, but Company may communicate
information about such an Acquisition Proposal to its stockholders if and to the
extent that it is required to do so in order to comply with its legal
obligations as advised by outside counsel. Company shall promptly advise Parent
following the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the details thereof, and
advise Parent of any developments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
promptly upon the occurrence thereof. Company shall (i) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and (ii)
direct and use its reasonable efforts to cause all of its Affiliates and
Representatives not to engage in any of the foregoing.

           8.9       TAX TREATMENT

           Each of the Parties undertakes and agrees to use its reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action which would cause the Merger
not, to qualify for treatment as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes.

           8.10      STATE TAKEOVER LAWS

           Company shall take all necessary steps to exempt the transactions

or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law.

           8.11      CHARTER PROVISIONS

           Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the entering
into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any
rights to any Person under the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or other
governing instruments of Company or restrict or impair the ability of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a
stockholder with respect to, shares of Company that may be directly or
indirectly acquired or controlled by them.

           8.12      EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND CONTRACTS

           Following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide generally to
officers and employees of Company employee benefits under employee benefit and
welfare plans (other than stock option or other plans involving the potential
issuance of Parent Common Stock), on terms and conditions which when taken as a
whole are substantially similar to those currently provided by the Parent
Entities to their similarly situated officers and employees. For purposes of
participation, vesting and (except in the case of Parent retirement plans)
benefit accrual under Parent's employee benefit plans, the service of the
employees of the Company Entities prior to the Effective Time shall be treated
as service with a Parent Entity participating in such employee benefit plans.
Parent also shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor
in accordance with their terms all employment, severance, consulting and other
compensation Contracts disclosed in Section 8.12 of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum to Parent between Company and any current or former director,
officer, or employee thereof, and all provisions for



                                      -32-

                     (a)       Parent shall not cause or allow the Surviving
Corporation to modify, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, any
rights to indemnification or exculpation from Liabilities arising out of actions
or omissions arising out of any Person's service or services as a director or
officer of Company or, at Company's request, of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
now existing in favor of such Persons as provided in Company's articles of
incorporation or bylaws, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

                     (b)       Any Person wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 8.13 (each, an "Indemnified Party"), upon learning
of any such Liability or Litigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving
Corporation thereof. In the event of any such Litigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), except as otherwise provided in any
indemnification Contract between Company and the Indemnified Party, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues which raise
conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such Litigation, and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; and
provided further that the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

                     (c)       If the Surviving Corporation or any successors or
assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or shall
transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then and in each
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
8.13.

                     (d)       Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of the directors and officers of Company and each other Person who is
party to an indemnification agreement with Company to execute and deliver to
Parent the letters contemplated by Section 9.2(h).

           At the Closing, Parent shall execute and deliver a declaration of
registration rights ("DECLARATION OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS") in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit 5. As soon as practicable after the Closing,
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain all required approvals
pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement dated
as of September 20, 1999, among Parent and certain holders of Parent Capital
Stock identified therein (the "PARENT REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), to amend
the Parent Registration Rights Agreement to provide that, with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger, the former holders of
Company Capital Stock shall be entitled to registration rights under Sections 3
and 4 of the Parent Registration Rights Agreement on a pro rata basis with
holders of Restricted Stock (as defined in the Parent Registration Rights
Agreement), and such amendment shall supersede the Declaration of Registration
Rights.

           8.15      TREATMENT OF HP WARRANTS

                     (a)       Pursuant to a Warrant to Purchase Common Stock,
dated December 23, 1999 (the "HP Warrant"), between Company and Hewlett-Packard
Company ("HP"), HP may exercise rights to purchase up to 1,136,605 shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Base Warrant Shares") and up to an additional 436,272
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Contingent Warrant Shares") if Company's
revenues for the calendar years 2000 and 2001 include specified amounts of "HP
Revenue" (as defined in the Warrant) (the "Revenue Requirements"). Prior to the
Closing, Company shall take all such action as Parent or its counsel shall
direct to irrevocably waive the Revenue Requirements so as to permit exercise of
the HP Warrant with respect to the Contingent Warrant Shares on the same basis
the HP Warrant may be exercised with respect to the Base Warrant Shares.

                     (b)       Prior to Closing, Company may undertake to
negotiate with HP the terms on which Company will waive the Revenue
Restrictions, including possible modifications to the Strategic Supply, Services
and Promotion Agreement, dated as of December 23, 1999 (the "Strategic
Agreement"), between Company and HP,and possible reduction in the number of
Contingent Warrant Shares. Company shall keep Parent fully apprised of the
status of all such negotiations and Parent shall have the right to participate
in such negotiations. Company shall not agree to any modifications to the
Strategic Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent.

                CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS TO CONSUMMATE
                -------------------------------------------------

           9.1       CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY

           The respective obligations of each Party to perform this Agreement
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, unless waived by both
Parties pursuant to Section 11.6:

                     (a)       STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. The stockholders of Company
           shall have approved this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, and the
           consummation of the



                                      -34-
<PAGE>   40

           transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger,
           as and to the extent required by Law or by the provisions of any
           governing instruments.

                     (b)       REGULATORY APPROVALS. All Consents of, filings
           and registrations with, and notifications to, all Regulatory
           Authorities required for consummation of the Merger shall have been
           obtained or made and shall be in full force and effect and all
           waiting periods required by Law shall have expired. No Consent
           obtained from any Regulatory Authority which is necessary to
           consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be conditioned
           or restricted in a manner (including requirements relating to the
           raising of additional capital or the disposition of Assets) which in
           the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent would so
           materially adversely impact the economic or business benefits of the
           transactions contemplated by this Agreement that, had such condition
           or requirement been known, Parent would not, in its reasonable
           judgment, have entered into this Agreement.

                     (c)       CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Company shall have
           obtained the Consents identified in Section 5.2(c) of the Company
           Disclosure Memorandum and any and all other Consents required for
           consummation of the Merger (other than those referred to in Section
           (b)) or for the preventing of any Default under any Contract or
           Permit of such Party which, if not obtained or made, is reasonably
           likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
           Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Consent so
           obtained which is necessary to consummate the transactions
           contemplated hereby shall be conditioned or restricted in a manner
           which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent
           would so materially adversely impact the economic or business
           benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that, had
           such condition or requirement been known, Parent would not, in its

           Opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to

           Party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
           covenant, or other agreement contained in this Agreement) in the
           event of a material breach by the other Party of any representation
           or warranty contained in this Agreement which cannot be or has not
           been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the
           breaching Party of such breach and which breach is reasonably likely,

           in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
           Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, on the breaching Party; or

                     (c)       By either Party (provided that the terminating
           Party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
           covenant, or other agreement contained in this Agreement) in the
           event of a material breach by the other Party of any covenant or

           and the

                     (e)       By either Party in the event that the Merger
           shall not have been consummated by March 1, 2000, if the failure to
           consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on or before such
           date is not caused by any breach of this Agreement by the Party
           electing to terminate pursuant to this Section 10.1(e); or

                     (f)       By either Party (provided that the terminating

           Party to consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied or fulfilled by
           the date specified in Section 10.1(e).

           10.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION

           In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect,
except that (i) the provisions of this Section 10.2 and ARTICLE 11 and Section
8.6(b) shall survive any such termination and abandonment, and (ii) a
termination pursuant to Sections 10.1(b), 10.1(c) or 10.1(f) shall not relieve
the breaching Party from Liability for an uncured willful breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement giving rise to such
termination.
