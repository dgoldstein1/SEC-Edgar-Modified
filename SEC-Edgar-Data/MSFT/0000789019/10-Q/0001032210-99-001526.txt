Notes to Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related
interim statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity include all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) necessary for their fair
presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses.  Examples include provisions for returns and bad debts and the
length of product life cycles and buildings' lives.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results
for a full year.  The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis and financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Microsoft Corporation 1999 Form 10-K.

Stock Split

In March 1999, outstanding shares of common stock were split two-for-one.  All
prior share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is computed on the
basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the
effect of outstanding preferred shares using the "if-converted" method, assumed
net-share settlement of common stock structured repurchases, and outstanding
stock options using the "treasury stock" method.

The components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:

Unearned Revenue

A portion of Microsoft's revenue is earned ratably over the product life cycle
or, in the case of subscriptions, over the period of the license agreement.

End users receive certain elements of the Company's products over a period of
time. These elements include browser technologies and technical support.
Consequently, Microsoft's earned revenue reflects the recognition of the fair
value of these elements over the product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue
recognized ratably ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of Windows desktop
operating systems and approximately 10% to 20 % of desktop applications,
depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements.
Product life cycles are currently estimated at three years for Windows operating
systems and 18 months for desktop applications. The Company also sells
subscriptions to certain products via maintenance and certain organization
license agreements. At September 30, 1999, Windows Platforms products unearned
revenue was $2.25 billion and unearned revenue associated with Productivity
Applications and Developer products totaled $1.72 billion. Unearned revenue for
other miscellaneous programs totaled $154 million at September 30, 1999.

Stockholders' Equity

Microsoft repurchases its common stock in the open market to provide shares for
issuance to employees under stock option and stock purchase plans.  During the
first quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company repurchased 12.1 million shares of
Microsoft common stock in the open market.

To enhance its stock repurchase program, Microsoft sells put warrants to
independent third parties.  These put warrants entitle the holders to sell
shares of Microsoft common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified
prices.  On September 30, 1999, 163 million warrants were outstanding with
strike prices ranging from $64 to $73 per share.  The put warrants expire
between March 2000 and September 2002.  The outstanding put warrants permit a
net-share settlement at the Company's option and do not result in a put warrant
liability on the balance sheet.

During 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible
exchangeable principal-protected preferred stock.  Dividends are payable
quarterly in arrears.  Preferred shareholders have preference over common
stockholders in dividends and liquidation rights.  In December 1999, each
preferred share is convertible into common shares or an equivalent amount of
cash determined by a formula that provides a floor price of $79.875 and a cap of
$102.24 per preferred share, equivalent to $19.97 and $25.56 per common share.
Net proceeds of $980 million were used to repurchase common shares.

Operational Transactions

In September 1999, the Company sold the entertainment city guide portion of
MSN(TM) Sidewalk(R) to Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, Inc. (TMCS) for a
combination of TMCS stock and warrants with a value of $223 million. The
transaction also included a distribution agreement. Microsoft recognized a gain
of $156 million on the sale and will recognize amounts related to the
distribution arrangement over the term of the agreement.

In September 1999, the Company announced that Visio Corporation, a leading
supplier of business diagramming and technical drawing software, would be
combined with Microsoft.  Each share of Visio common stock will be exchanged for
0.45 shares of Microsoft common stock, and the merger is expected to be
accounted for as a pooling of interests.  The transaction, subject to regulatory
review and the approval of Visio shareholders, is expected to close in December
1999.

In August 1998, the Company sold a wholly-owned subsidiary, Softimage, Inc. to
Avid Technology, Inc.  Microsoft received cash of $79 million and securities
valued at $85 million.  A pretax gain of $160 million was recognized in the
first quarter of fiscal 1999.

Contingencies

On October 7, 1997, Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") brought suit against
Microsoft in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
Sun's complaint alleges several claims against Microsoft, all related to the
parties' relationship under a March 11, 1996 Technology License and Distribution
Agreement (Agreement) concerning certain Java programming language technology.
The Complaint seeks: a preliminary and permanent injunction against Microsoft
distributing certain products with the Java Compatibility logo, and against
distributing Internet Explorer 4.0 browser technology unless certain alleged
obligations are met; an order compelling Microsoft to perform certain alleged
obligations; an accounting; termination of the Agreement; and an award of
damages, including compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages, and liquidated
damages of $35 million for the alleged source code disclosure.

On March 24, 1998, the Court entered an order enjoining Microsoft from using the
Java Compatibility logo on Internet Explorer 4.0 and the Microsoft Software
Developers Kit (SDK) for Java 2.0.  Microsoft has taken steps to fully comply
with the order.

On November 17, 1998, the Court entered an order granting Sun's request for a
preliminary injunction, holding that Sun had established a likelihood of success
on its copyright infringement claims, because Microsoft's use of Sun's
technology in its products was beyond the scope of the parties' license
agreement. The Court ordered Microsoft to make certain changes in its products
that include Sun's Java technology and to make certain changes in its Java
software development tools. The Court also enjoined Microsoft from entering into
any licensing agreements that were conditioned on exclusive use of Microsoft's
Java Virtual Machine. Microsoft appealed that ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals on December 16, 1998. Oral argument on that appeal was held on June 16,
1999. In the interim, Microsoft is complying with the ruling and has not sought
a stay of the injunction pending appeal. On December 18, 1998, Microsoft filed a
motion requesting an extension of the 90-day compliance period for certain
Microsoft products, which was granted in part in January 1999. Microsoft filed a
motion on February 5, 1999, seeking clarification of the Court's order that
Microsoft would not be prevented from engaging in independent development of
Java technology under the order. The Court granted that motion. On July 23, 1999
the Court also granted Microsoft's motion to increase the bond on the
preliminary injunction from $15 million to $35 million.

On January 22, 1999, Microsoft and Sun filed a series of summary judgment
motions regarding the interpretation of the contract and other issues. On May
20, 1999, the Court issued tentative rulings on three of the motions. In the
preliminary rulings, the Court (1) granted Sun's motion for summary judgment
that prior versions of Internet Explorer 4.0, Windows 98, Windows NT, Visual J++
(R) 6.0 development system, and the SDK for Java infringe Sun's copyrights,
because they contain Sun's program code but do not pass Sun's compatibility
tests and, therefore, Microsoft's use of Sun's technology is outside the scope
of the Agreement and unlicensed; (2) granted Microsoft's motion that the
Agreement authorizes Microsoft to distribute independently developed Java
Technology that is not subject to the compatibility obligations in the
Agreement; and (3) denied Sun's motion for summary judgment on the meaning of
certain provisions of the Agreement, tentatively adopting Microsoft's
interpretation that Sun is required to deliver certain new Java Technology,
called "Supplemental Java Classes," in working order on Microsoft's then
existing and commercially distributed virtual machine. On June 24, 1999, the
Court heard oral argument on the three tentative rulings. No final orders have
been issued.

On August 23,1999 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the November 1998
preliminary injunction and remanded the case to the district Court for further
proceedings. Sun immediately filed two motions to reinstate and expand the scope
of the earlier injunction on the basis of copyright infringement and unfair
competition. Oral argument on these motions was held on October 16, 1999. There
are no other hearing or trial dates set.

On May 18, 1998, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
and a group of 20 state Attorneys General filed two antitrust cases against
Microsoft in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The DOJ
complaint alleges violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The DOJ
complaint seeks declaratory relief as to the violations it asserts and
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief regarding: the inclusion of Internet
browsing software (or other software products) as part of Windows; the terms of
agreements regarding non-Microsoft Internet browsing software (or other software
products); taking or threatening "action adverse" in consequence of a person's
failure to license or distribute Microsoft Internet browsing software (or other
software product) or distributing competing products or cooperating with the
government; and restrictions on the screens, boot-up sequence, or functions of
Microsoft's operating system products. The state Attorneys General allege
largely the same claims and various pendent state claims. The states seek
declaratory relief and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief similar to
that sought by the DOJ, together with statutory penalties under the state law
claims. The

foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the complaints and other papers on file in those actions, case numbers 98-
1232 and 98-1233.

On May 22, 1998, Judge Jackson consolidated the two actions. The judge granted
Microsoft's motion for summary judgment as to the states' monopoly leverage
claim and permitted the remaining claims to proceed to trial. Trial began on
October 19, 1998 and ended with closing arguments on September 21, 1999. The
Court will first rule on factual issues, and will then rule on legal
conclusions. Microsoft believes the claims are without merit and is defending
against them vigorously. In other ongoing investigations, the DOJ and several
state Attorneys General have requested information from Microsoft concerning
various issues.

Caldera, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Microsoft in July 1996. It alleges Sherman
Act violations relating to Microsoft licensing practices of the MS-DOS(R)
operating system and Windows in the late 80s and early 90s - essentially the
same complaints that resulted in the 1994 DOJ consent decree. Caldera claims to
own the rights of Novell, Inc. and Digital Research, Inc. relating to DR-DOS and
Novell DOS products. It also asserts a claim that Windows 95 is a technological
tie of Windows and MS-DOS. Trial is scheduled for January 2000. Some partial
summary judgment motions are pending. Microsoft believes the claims are without
merit and is vigorously defending the case.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a non-public investigation
into the Company's accounting reserve practices. Microsoft is also subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business.

Management currently believes that resolving these matters will not have a
material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or its results of
operations.

</TABLE>


The Company's organizational structure and fundamental approach to business
reflect the needs of its customers. As such, Microsoft has three major segments:
Windows Platforms; Productivity Applications and Developer; and Consumer,
Commerce and Other. Windows Platforms includes the Business and Enterprise
Division, which is primarily responsible for Windows NT and developing Windows
2000. Windows Platforms also includes the Consumer Windows Division, which
oversees Windows 98 and Windows 95. Productivity Applications and Developer
includes the Business Productivity Division, which is responsible for developing
and marketing desktop applications, server applications, and developer tools.
Consumer, Commerce, and Other products and services include primarily learning,
entertainment, and PC input device products; WebTV and PC online access; and
portal and vertical properties and e-commerce platforms. Assets of the segment
groups are not relevant for management of the businesses nor for disclosure.

The Company's financial reporting systems present various data for management to
run the business, including profit and loss (P&L) statements prepared on a basis
not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciling items
include certain elements of unearned revenue, the treatment of certain channel
inventory amounts and estimates, and revenue from product support, consulting,
and training and certification of system integrators. Additionally, the internal
P&Ls use accelerated methods of depreciation and amortization. In fiscal 2000,
the Company's internal P&Ls included the Black-Scholes value of employee stock
option grants, amortized over the remaining months of the fiscal year of the
grant. Prior year disclosures have been restated for consistent presentation.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Results of Operations

Microsoft develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of
software products for a multitude of computing devices. Microsoft software
includes scalable operating systems for intelligent devices, personal computers
(PCs), and servers; server applications for client/server environments;
knowledge worker productivity applications; and software development tools. The
Company's online efforts include the MSN network of Internet products and
services; e-commerce platforms; and alliances with companies involved with
broadband access and various forms of digital interactivity. Microsoft also
licenses consumer software programs; sells PC input devices; trains and
certifies system integrators; and researches and develops advanced technologies
for future software products.

Revenue

Revenue of $5.38 billion in the September quarter of fiscal 2000 increased 28%
over the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Revenue growth reflected the continued
adoption of Microsoft(R) Windows(R) operating systems, including Windows 98,
Windows NT(R) Workstation, and Windows NT Server; along with the Company's
server applications. Microsoft Office also continued its strong growth after the
recent launch of the latest versions of desktop applications, particularly
Microsoft Office 2000. Reported revenue also included $150 million related to
fulfillment of the Microsoft Office 2000 Technology Guarantee. Certain customers
acquiring Microsoft Office 97 or related applications were entitled to a free
upgrade to the corresponding Microsoft Office 2000 application. The value of the
upgrade expected to be redeemed by the customer was treated as unearned revenue
until fulfillment of the upgrade.

Software license volume increases have been the principal factor in the
Company's revenue growth. The average selling price per license has decreased,
primarily because of general shifts in the sales mix from retail packaged
products to licensing programs, from new products to product upgrades, and from
stand-alone desktop applications to integrated product suites. Average revenue
per license from original equipment manufacturer (OEM) licenses and
organizational license programs is lower than average revenue per license from
retail versions. Likewise, product upgrades have lower prices than new products.
Also, prices of integrated suites, such as Microsoft Office and BackOffice, are
less than the sum of the prices for the individual programs included in these
suites when such programs are licensed separately. An increased percentage of
products and programs included elements that were billed but unearned and
recognized ratably, such as Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, maintenance,
and other subscription models. See accompanying notes to financial statements.

Business Divisions

Microsoft has three major segments: Windows Platforms; Productivity Applications
and Developer; and Consumer, Commerce, and Other.

Windows Platforms products, developed and marketed by the Consumer Windows
Division and the Business and Enterprise Division, include primarily Windows 98,
Windows NT Workstation, and Windows NT Server.  Revenue of $2.25 billion in the
first quarter represented growth of 17% over the prior year.  Windows-based
units licensed through the PC original equipment manufacturer (OEM) channel,
particularly Windows NT Workstation, increased strongly over the prior year.
Windows NT Server revenue growth was robust during the September quarter.
Partially offsetting the healthy growth of Windows NT operating systems was less
revenue from retail packaged product versions of Windows 98 in the first quarter
of fiscal 2000 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 1999.  The decrease
reflected the strong comparable quarter of the prior year which included
significant revenue from Windows 98 after its launch in June 1998.

Productivity Applications and Developer products include desktop applications
such as Microsoft Office, server applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server
and Microsoft SQL Server(TM), and software developer tools.  Revenue increased
40% to $2.45 billion in the September quarter.  Revenue from Microsoft Office
integrated suites, including the Premium, Professional, Small Business, and
Standard Editions was very strong, reflecting the recent launch of Microsoft
Office 2000.  Revenue also included the recognition of $150 million of
previously unearned revenue, due to the impact of the Microsoft Office 2000
Technology Guarantee noted above.  Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 revenue was
particularly robust.  Revenue from Microsoft Exchange Server and software
developer tools was steady.

Consumer, Commerce, and Other products include learning and entertainment
software; PC input devices; training and certification fees; consulting; and the
online services.  Revenue in the September quarter was $685 million, up

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      10
<PAGE>

30% from the comparable quarter of fiscal 1999. Online advertising and access
revenue rose substantially while revenue from hardware products and consumer
software grew moderately.

Distribution Channels

Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses,
organizational licenses, and retail packaged products. OEM channel revenue
represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who pre-install
Microsoft products, primarily on PCs. Microsoft has three major geographic sales
and marketing organizations: the South Pacific and Americas Region; the Europe,
Middle East, and Africa Region; and the Asia Region. Sales of organizational
licenses and packaged products via these channels are primarily to and through
distributors and resellers.

OEM first quarter revenue of $1.74 billion represented an increase of 27% over
the comparable quarter of fiscal 1999. PC shipment growth coupled with an
increased penetration of higher value 32-bit operating systems and Microsoft
Office drove the OEM revenue increase over the prior year.

South Pacific and Americas Region revenue in the September quarter increased 16%
to $1.87 billion. Office revenue grew moderately, while Windows NT Server and
server applications showed strong growth. Organizational licensing activity
exhibited a seasonal slowdown. Revenue growth was particularly strong in Latin
America but slower in the United States and the South Pacific.

Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region first quarter revenue of $1.18 billion
was up 32% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 1999.  Windows NT Server,
Microsoft Office, and server applications grew strongly compared to the prior
year, particularly via organizational licensing.  Revenue growth was solid in
the United Kingdom and France, and was particularly high in Germany.

Asia Region revenue in the September quarter of $593 million increased 82% from
the first quarter of the prior year, reflecting better local economic conditions
and the launch of localized versions of Microsoft Office 2000, particularly in
Japan.  Revenue grew very strongly in most countries in the Asia Region.  As
discussed below, strengthening local currencies positively impacted translated
revenue compared to the prior year, particularly in Japan.

Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates.  The
impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the September
quarter compared to a year ago, as the Japanese yen was very strong versus the
U.S. dollar, offset partially by weaker European currencies versus the U.S.
dollar.  Had the rates from the prior year been in effect in the first quarter
of fiscal 2000, translated international revenue billed in local currencies
would have been $65 million lower.  Certain manufacturing, selling,
distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion
of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation
exposure.

Operating Expenses

Cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 13.2% in the first quarter, down
from 15.5% in the first quarter of the prior year. The percentage decrease
resulted primarily from the trend in mix shift to organizational licenses, lower
costs associated with WebTV(R) operations, and the recognition of previously
unearned revenue related to the Office 2000 Technology Guarantee.

Research and development expenses increased 28% from the first quarter of the
prior year to $834 million, driven primarily by higher development headcount-
related costs and third-party development costs.

Sales and marketing expenses were $903 million in the September quarter, which
represented 16.8% of revenue, compared to 16.4% in the first quarter of the
prior year.  Sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue increased
slightly due to higher relative marketing costs offset partially by lower
relative sales expenses.

General and administrative costs were $143 million in the first quarter compared
to $99 million in the September quarter of the prior year.  The increase for the
quarter was due primarily to higher legal fees and certain stock option-related
charges.

Other expenses include primarily the recognition of Microsoft's share of joint
venture activities, including Transpoint and the MSNBC entities.

Investment Income, Gains on Sales, and Income Taxes

First quarter investment income increased to $397 million from $261 million in
the first quarter of the prior year.  The increase was due to realized gains of
approximately $50 million and the larger investment portfolio generated by cash
from operations.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2000, Microsoft sold the entertainment city
guide portion of MSN(TM) Sidewalk(R) to Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, Inc.
(TMCS) for a combination of TMCS stock and warrants. Microsoft recognized a gain
of $156 million.

During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, Microsoft sold its Softimage, Inc.
subsidiary to Avid Technology, Inc for a pretax gain of $160 million.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 is 34%.  Excluding the tax impact of the
gain on the sale of Softimage, the effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was 35%.

Financial Condition

The Company's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $18.90 billion at
September 30, 1999. The portfolio is diversified among security types,
industries, and individual issuers. Microsoft's investments are generally liquid
and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar
denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in
anticipation of continued international expansion. The portfolio is primarily
invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate
rapid deployment in the event of immediate cash needs.

Microsoft also invests in equities, primarily strategic technology companies.
The Company has made large-scale investments in access providers, including
cable, telephony, and wireless communications companies. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company purchased $400 million of Rogers
Communications convertible preferred securities and warrants. In connection with
AT&T's proposed merger with MediaOne Group, Inc., the Company agreed to acquire
MediaOne's interest in Telewest Communications plc, a leading provider of cable
television and residential and business cable telephony services in the United
Kingdom, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other conditions.

Microsoft and National Broadcasting Company (NBC) operate two MSNBC joint
ventures: a 24-hour cable news and information channel, and an online news
service.  Microsoft is paying $220 million over a five-year period that ends in
2001 for its interest in the cable venture and one-half of the operational
funding of both joint ventures.  Microsoft guarantees a portion of MSNBC debt.

Microsoft has no material long-term debt and has $100 million of standby
multicurrency lines of credit to support foreign currency hedging and cash
management. Stockholders' equity at September 30, 1999 was $31.34 billion.

Microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, and product support
infrastructure. Additionally, research and development activities will include
investments in existing and advanced areas of technology, including using cash
to acquire technology. Cash will also be used to fund ventures and strategic
opportunities. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new
facilities and computer systems for R&D, sales and marketing, support, and
administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $300
million on September 30, 1999.

In addition, cash will be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for
employee stock option and purchase plans. The buyback program has not kept pace
with employee stock option grants or exercises. Beginning in fiscal 1990,
Microsoft has repurchased 722 million common shares while 1.84 billion shares
were issued under the Company's employee stock option and purchase plans. The
market value of all outstanding stock options was $68 billion as of September
30, 1999. Microsoft enhances its repurchase program by selling put warrants.
During December 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible
exchangeable preferred stock. Net proceeds of $980 million were used to
repurchase common shares. In December 1999, each preferred share is convertible
into common shares or an equivalent amount of cash determined by a formula that
provides a floor price of $79.875 and a cap of $102.24 per preferred share,
equivalent to $19.97 and $25.56 per common share.

Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for
the next 12 months. The Company's cash and short-term investments are available
for strategic investments, mergers and acquisitions, other potential large-scale
cash needs that may arise, and to fund an increased stock buyback program over
historical levels to reduce the dilutive impact of the Company's employee stock
option and purchase programs.

Microsoft has not paid cash dividends on its common stock. The preferred stock
pays $2.196 per annum per share.

Year 2000

The Year 2000 presents potential concerns for business and consumer computing.
In addition to the well-known calculation problems with the use of 2-digit date
formats as the year changes from 1999 to 2000, the Year 2000 is a special case
leap year and in many organizations using older technology, dates were used for
special programmatic functions. The problem exists for many kinds of software
and hardware, including mainframes, mini computers, PCs, and embedded systems.
The consequences of this issue may include systems failures and business process
interruption.

Microsoft has tested more than 3000 versions/languages of its products. The vast
majority of these tested products are Year 2000 compliant, as defined by
Microsoft. There are a small number of older products that are identified as
being non-compliant, and Microsoft will provide recommendations regarding these
products. Not all versions of products or all products will be tested. All Year
2000 software updates, resources, and tools are available to customers at no
charge from the Microsoft Year 2000 Portal Page or Microsoft Year 2000 Resource
CD.

Current information needed to evaluate the impact of the Year 2000 on
organizational and home computing environments is available at the Microsoft
Year 2000 Portal Page (www.microsoft.com/year2000) and the Microsoft Year 2000
                       --------------------------
Resource CD, which is released on a quarterly basis.  The Web site and Microsoft
Year 2000 Resource CD detail specific Year 2000 information concerning Microsoft
products and technologies for large organizations.  The detailed information
available on the Web site and Microsoft Year 2000 Resource CD is presented to
assist information technology (IT) professionals in planning their transition to
the Year 2000.  The Microsoft Year 2000 Portal Page also contains information
for small business and home PC users, including in-depth product information,
answers to frequently asked questions, and links to other Year 2000 sites.

Variability of definitions of "compliance" with the Year 2000 and of different
combinations of software, firmware, and hardware will likely lead to lawsuits
against the Company.  The outcome of such lawsuits and the impact on the Company
are not estimable at this time.

The Year 2000 issue also affects the Company's internal systems, including IT
and non-IT systems.  Microsoft has assessed the readiness of its mission-
critical systems for handling the Year 2000.  Although testing and remediation
of all systems have not been completed, management currently believes that all
mission critical-systems will be compliant by the Year 2000 and that the cost to
address the issues is not material.  Nevertheless, Microsoft is creating
contingency plans for certain internal systems.

Microsoft is addressing the effect this issue will have on its third-party
supply chain and has undertaken steps to formulate a system of working with key
third parties to understand their ability to continue providing services and
products through the change to 2000.  Microsoft is working directly with its key
vendors, distributors, and resellers to avoid material business interruptions in
2000.  Contingency plans are being developed where practicable for these key
third parties.

Resolving Year 2000 issues is a worldwide phenomenon that is absorbing a
substantial portion of IT budgets and attention. Certain industry analysts
believe that Year 2000 concerns will cause IT managers to lock down their
desktops and systems, creating less demand for computer hardware and software,
which could negatively impact Microsoft. Others believe major remediation
efforts at large organizations are completed or that small organizations are
solving Year 2000 issues by purchasing new PCs. The impact of the Year 2000 on
future Microsoft revenue is difficult to discern, but is a risk to be considered
in evaluating the future growth of the Company.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

See notes to financial statements.

Item 2.  Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds

During the first quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company issued an aggregate of
663,895 of its common shares pursuant to a merger in exchange for the
outstanding capital shares of Intrinsa Corporation held by 65 shareholders. The
shares were issued pursuant to an exemption by reason of Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933. These sales were made without general solicitation or
advertising. In connection with this merger, 41 of the former Intrinsa
Corporation shareholders represented that he, she, or it was an accredited
investor. Shareholders who signified that they were not accredited investors
were represented by a qualified purchaser's representative. The Company has
filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of such
securities. All net proceeds from the sale of such securities will go to the
selling shareholders who offer and sell their shares. The Company has not
received and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of these common shares
other than the assets and liabilities of the acquired companies.

Reference is also made to the information on sales of put warrants described in
the accompanying notes to financial statements. All such transactions are exempt
from registration under Section 4 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933. Each
transaction was privately negotiated and each offeree and purchaser was an
accredited investor/qualified institutional buyer. No public offering or public
solicitation was used by Microsoft in the placement of these securities.

Item 6.  Exhibits and Reports on Form 8-K

(A)  Exhibits

     27. Financial Data Schedule

(B)  Reports on Form 8-K

The Company filed one report on Form 8-K during the quarter ended September 30,
1999.  On July 19, 1999, the Company disclosed its reclassified quarterly income
statements to reflect changes in the way it reports revenue and costs associated
with product support, consulting, Internet access, and certification of system
integrators.  Henceforth, amounts received from customers from these activities
will be classified as revenue in a manner consistent with Microsoft's primary
businesses.  Direct costs of these activities will be classified as cost of
revenue.  Additionally, the Company announced that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is conducting a non-public investigation into the Company's
accounting reserve practices.

Items 3, 4, and 5 are not applicable and have been omitted.
