Notes to Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related
interim statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity include all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) necessary for their fair
presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses.  Examples include provisions for returns and bad debts and the
length of product life cycles and buildings' lives.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results
for a full year.  The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis and financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Microsoft Corporation 1998 Form 10-K.

Stock Splits

In February 1998, outstanding shares of common stock were split two-for-one.
All prior share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock
split.  On January 25, 1999, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one stock split effective March 29, 1999 for shareholders of
record March 12, 1999.  The stock split is subject to shareholder approval of an
amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation to increase the Company's
authorized common stock.  Share and per share amounts have not been restated for
the upcoming stock split.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is computed on the
basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the
effect of outstanding preferred shares using the "if-converted" method, assumed
net-share settlement of common stock structured repurchases, and outstanding
stock options using the "treasury stock" method.

The components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:

Unearned Revenue

A portion of Microsoft's revenue is earned ratably over the product life cycle
or, in the case of subscriptions, over the period of the license agreement.

End-users receive certain elements of the Company's platform products over a
period of time.  These elements include browser and other Internet technologies,
telephone support, Internet-based technical support, service releases, and new
device drivers.  Consequently, Microsoft recognizes the fair value of these
elements, currently approximately 20% of Windows 98 and Windows 95 desktop
operating systems OEM revenue and approximately 35% of retail version revenue,
over the product's life cycle.  Approximately 20% of Windows NT Workstation and
Windows NT Server revenue is also recognized ratably.  Product life cycles are
currently estimated at two years.  The Company also sells subscriptions to
platforms products via maintenance and certain organizational license
agreements.  At December 31, 1998, platform products unearned revenue was $1.89
billion.

Likewise, end-users of the Company's applications products receive elements over
time, including telephone support, new Internet technologies, and service
releases. The fair value of these elements, which is currently approximately 20%
of Office 97 applications revenue, is recognized ratably over the estimated 18-
month product life cycle. The Company also sells subscriptions to applications
and tools products, including maintenance and certain organizational license
programs. Unearned revenue associated with applications and tools products
totaled $1.57 billion at December 31, 1998.

Unearned revenue associated with other miscellaneous programs totaled $93
million at December 31, 1998.

Stockholders' Equity

Microsoft repurchases its common stock in the open market to provide shares for
issuance to employees under stock option and stock purchase plans.  During the
first half of fiscal 1999, the Company repurchased 7.8 million shares of
Microsoft common stock in the open market.  In addition, the Company has
executed structured repurchases with an independent third party.  Under these
arrangements, a portion of the purchase price will be paid in the next five or
six years and determined based upon the price of Microsoft common stock at that
time.  The timing and method of payment (net-share or cash) is at the discretion
of the Company.  The differential between the cash paid and the price of
Microsoft common stock on the date of the agreement is reflected in common stock
and paid-in capital.  During fiscal 1998, 21 million shares were purchased under
these arrangements.

To enhance its stock repurchase program, Microsoft sells put warrants to
independent third parties.  These put warrants entitle the holders to sell
shares of Microsoft common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified
prices, and permit a net-share settlement at the Company's option.  On December
31, 1998, 75 million warrants were outstanding.  The outstanding put warrants
expire between June 1999 and December 2001 and have strike prices ranging from
$87 to $99 per share.

During 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible
exchangeable principal-protected preferred stock.  Dividends are payable
quarterly in arrears.  Preferred shareholders have preference over common
stockholders in dividends and liquidation rights.  In December 1999, each
preferred share is convertible into common shares or an equivalent amount of
cash determined by a formula that provides a floor price of $79.875 and a cap of
$102.24 per preferred share.  Net proceeds of $980 million were used to
repurchase common shares.

Acquisitions

In November 1998, Microsoft acquired LinkExchange, Inc., a leading provider of
online marketing services to web site owners and small and medium-sized
businesses.  Microsoft paid $265 million in stock.  The Company did not record
an in-process technology write-off in connection with the purchase of
LinkExchange.

In August 1997, Microsoft acquired WebTV Networks, Inc., an online service that
enables consumers to experience the Internet through their televisions via set-
top terminals based on proprietary technologies.  Microsoft paid $425 million in
stock and cash.  The Company recorded an in-process technologies write-off of
$296 million in the first quarter of 1998.

Sale of Softimage

In August 1998, the Company sold a wholly-owned subsidiary, Softimage, Inc. to
Avid Technology, Inc.  Microsoft received cash of $79 million and securities
valued at $85 million.  A pretax gain of $160 million was recognized in the
first quarter of 1999.  As part of a transitional service agreement, Microsoft
agreed to make certain development tools and management systems available to
Avid for use in the Softimage business.

On October 7, 1997, Sun Microsystems, Inc. brought suit against Microsoft in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  Sun's Complaint
alleges several claims against Microsoft, all related to the parties'
relationship under a March 11, 1996 Technology License and Distribution
Agreement (Agreement) concerning certain Java programming language technology.
The Complaint seeks: a preliminary and permanent injunction against Microsoft
distributing certain products with the Java Compatibility logo, and against
distributing Internet Explorer 4.0 unless certain alleged obligations are met;
an order compelling Microsoft to perform certain alleged obligations; an
accounting; termination of the Agreement; and an award of damages, including
compensatory, exemplary and punitive damages, and liquidated damages of $35
million for the alleged source code disclosure.

On March 24, 1998, the court entered an order enjoining Microsoft from using the
Java Compatibility logo on Internet Explorer 4.0 and the Microsoft Software
Developers Kit for Java 2.0.  Microsoft has taken steps to fully comply with the
order.

On May 12, 1998, Sun filed companion motions seeking a preliminary injunction
based on allegations of copyright infringement and unfair competition. Sun
requested an order enjoining Microsoft from distributing any Java-based
technology in any operating system, browser, or developers tools, including
Windows 98, Internet Explorer 4.0 software, and the Visual J++(TM) 6.0
development system for Java, unless and until Microsoft includes with each such
product an implementation of the Java run-time environment that passes Sun's
compatibility test suite or an operable implementation of Sun's current Java
run-time environment.  Hearings on these motions were held in September 1998.

On November 17, 1998, the court entered an order granting Sun's request for a
preliminary injunction, holding that Sun had established a likelihood of success
on its copyright infringement claims because Microsoft's use of Sun's technology
in its products was beyond the scope of the parties' license agreement.  The
court ordered Microsoft to make certain changes in its products that include
Sun's Java Technology and to make certain changes in its Java software
development tools.  The court also enjoined Microsoft from entering into any
licensing agreements that were conditioned on exclusive use of Microsoft's Java
Virtual Machine.  Microsoft appealed that ruling to the 9th Circuit on December
16, 1998.  In the interim, Microsoft is complying with the ruling and has not
sought a stay of the injunction pending appeal.  On December 18, 1998, Microsoft
filed a motion requesting an extension of the 90-day compliance period for
certain Microsoft products, which was granted in part in January 1999.
Microsoft filed a motion on February 5, 1999, seeking clarification of the
court's order that Microsoft would not be prevented from engaging in independent
development of Java technology under the order.  On January 22, 1999, Microsoft
and Sun filed a series of summary judgment motions regarding the interpretation
of the contract and other issues.  The hearing date for those motions is March
12, 1999.

On October 20, 1997, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ) filed a Petition for An Order To Show Cause in United States District
Court for the District of Columbia.  In its petition, the DOJ contends that
Microsoft has violated a 1994 consent decree by including Internet Explorer
technology in Windows 95, and by preventing OEMs from removing Internet Explorer
functionality from versions of Windows 95 the OEMs are licensed to install on
computer systems they sell.

On December 11, 1997, the district court entered two orders.  In the first
order, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson denied the DOJ's contempt petition, and
dismissed the DOJ's request for relief concerning Microsoft's non-disclosure
agreements because the DOJ had failed to present evidence that the agreements
had interfered with any DOJ investigation.  In addition, however, the court
ruled that there were disputed issues of fact regarding Microsoft's violation of
the consent decree, and concluded that the DOJ was likely to prevail on its
claim that a violation had occurred.  The court entered a preliminary injunction
sua sponte requiring Microsoft not to condition the licensing of Windows 95 or
- ----------                                                                    
any successor desktop operating system on a computer manufacturer also licensing
any Microsoft browser software, including Internet Explorer 3.0 or 4.0.  In the
second order, the court appointed Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig as a
special master, to whom the court delegated the authority to conduct discovery,
take evidence, and make proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on all
issues in the case by May 31, 1998.

Microsoft immediately appealed the preliminary injunction to the District of
Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.  On May 5, 1998, Microsoft also sought a stay
of the District Court's injunction insofar as it applied to Windows 98.  On May
12, 1998, the Court of Appeals granted Microsoft's request for a stay.  The
Court of Appeals issued an opinion on Microsoft's appeal on June 23, 1998.  It
unanimously reversed the trial court, both as to the entry of the 

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
injunction and the reference to the special master. The opinion both cited
procedural errors in the issuance of the injunction and errors of substantive
law in the interpretation of the consent decree. The court remanded the case to
Judge Jackson for further proceedings consistent with the Court's opinion. There
has been no further action in that case since the Court of Appeals' decision.

Although the Court of Appeals could have reversed the district court solely on
procedural grounds, it chose to address at length the central issue in both the
consent decree case and in the new Sherman Act case brought by the DOJ and 20
state Attorneys General: whether Microsoft is unlawfully "tying" a "separate
product" known as Microsoft Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system.
Two members of the Court rejected the DOJ's main argument that Internet Explorer
constitutes a separate product because Microsoft treats it separately in some
circumstances.  (One judge dissented in part from the reasoning in this part of
the opinion.)  The Court's discussion of antitrust tying law, although made in
the context of the consent decree case, clearly provides guidance on many of the
issues raised in the new Sherman Act case.

On May 18, 1998, the DOJ and a group of 20 state Attorneys General filed two
antitrust cases against Microsoft in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia.  The DOJ complaint alleges violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the
Sherman Act.  The DOJ complaint seeks declaratory relief as to the violations it
asserts and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief regarding: the inclusion
of Internet browsing software (or other software products) as part of Windows;
the terms of agreements regarding non-Microsoft Internet browsing software (or
other software products); taking or threatening "action adverse" in consequence
of a person's failure to license or distribute Microsoft Internet browsing
software (or other software product) or distributing competing products or
cooperating with the government; and restrictions on the screens, boot-up
sequence, or functions of Microsoft's operating system products.  The state
Attorneys General allege largely the same claims, and various pendent state
claims.  The states seek declaratory relief, and preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief similar to that sought by the DOJ, together with statutory
penalties under the state law claims.  The foregoing description is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of the complaints and other papers on
file in those actions, case numbers 98-1232 and 98-1233.

On May 22, 1998, Judge Jackson consolidated the two actions.  The judge granted
Microsoft's motion for summary judgment as to the states' monopoly leverage
claim, and permitted the remaining claims to proceed to trial.  Trial began on
October 19, 1998.  Microsoft believes the claims are without merit and is
defending against them vigorously.  In other ongoing investigations, the DOJ and
several state Attorneys General have requested information from Microsoft
concerning various issues.

Caldera, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Microsoft in July 1996.  It alleges
Sherman Act violations relating to Microsoft licensing practices of MS-DOS and
Windows in the late 80's and early 90's  essentially the same complaints that
resulted in the 1994 consent decree.  Caldera claims to own the rights of
Novell, Inc. and Digital Research Inc. relating to DR-DOS and Novell DOS
products. It also asserts a claim that Windows 95 is a technological tie of
Windows and MS-DOS. Microsoft has filed nine motions for summary judgment
seeking dismissal of Caldera's claims. Those motions are scheduled for hearings
in April and May 1999. Trial is scheduled for June 1999. Microsoft is vigorously
defending the case.

Microsoft is also subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of business.

Management currently believes that resolving these matters will not have a
material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or its results of
operations.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

Results of Operations

Microsoft develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of
software products, including scalable operating systems for intelligent devices,
personal computers (PCs), and servers; server applications for client/server
environments; business and consumer productivity applications; software
development tools; and Internet and intranet software and technologies.  The
Company's interactive efforts include entertainment and information software
programs; the MSN(TM) network of Internet products and services; and alliances
with companies involved with other forms of digital interactivity.  Microsoft
also sells personal computer input devices and books, and researches and
develops advanced technologies for future software products.

Revenue

Revenue of $4.94 billion in the December quarter of fiscal 1999 increased 38%
over the second quarter of fiscal 1998.  On a year to date basis, revenue in the
first half of fiscal 1999 totaled $8.89 billion, an increase of 32% over the
first two quarters of fiscal 1998.  Revenue growth reflected the continued
adoption of Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 32-bit operating systems and Microsoft
Office.  Organizational licensing increased substantially, particularly toward
the end of the period, coinciding with the end of budget years for the
Information Technology (IT) departments of many companies and governmental
units.  This surge of IT spending on PCs, desktop applications, and server and
server applications appears to have been based on pre-Year 2000 "lockdowns"
(i.e. customer decisions to refrain from further software purchases until
completion of necessary Year 2000 remediation efforts).

Software license volume increases have been the principal factor in Microsoft's
revenue growth.  The average selling price per license has decreased, primarily
because of general shifts in the sales mix from retail packaged products to
licensing programs, from new products to product upgrades, and from stand-alone
programs to integrated product suites.  Average revenue per license from
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) licenses and organizational license
programs is lower than average revenue per license from retail versions.
Likewise, product upgrades have lower prices than new products.  Also, prices of
integrated suites, such as Microsoft Office and BackOffice, are less than the
sum of the prices for the individual programs included in these suites when such
programs are licensed separately.  An increased percentage of products and
programs included elements that were billed but unearned and recognized ratably,
such as certain platforms and applications programs, maintenance, and other
subscription models.  See accompanying notes to financial statements.

Product Groups

Platforms product revenue grew 50% to $2.32 billion in the second quarter.
Revenue of $4.25 billion for the first half of fiscal 1999 grew 44% over the
first half of fiscal 1998.  Windows units licensed through the OEM channel,
particularly Windows NT(R) Workstation, increased strongly over the prior year.
Organizational licenses of these desktop platforms also contributed to the
growth.  Retail versions of Windows 98, which was released in June 1998,
contributed to growth, particularly in the first quarter.  Windows NT Server
revenue was quite healthy.  Windows CE and WebTV(TM) service continued to show
strong revenue growth, although small in amount.

Applications and Tools product revenue increased 27% to $2.15 billion in the
December quarter.  Revenue for the first two quarters of $3.86 billion grew 24%
compared to the comparable period of the prior year.  Desktop applications
revenue growth was strong, led by Microsoft Office integrated suites, including
the Standard, Professional, and Small Business Editions.  The primary programs
in Microsoft Office are the word processor Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet, and Microsoft PowerPoint(R) presentation graphics program.  Various
versions of Office, which are available for Windows and Macintosh operating
systems, also include Microsoft Access database management program, Microsoft
Outlook(TM) messaging and collaboration client, or other programs.  Server
applications revenue, principally Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft SQL
Server(TM), increased strongly over the comparable periods of the prior year.
The Visual Studio(R) 6.0 development system, an integrated set of software
development tools, was recently released, leading to hearty tools revenue
growth.

Interactive Media and Other revenue was $467 million in the December quarter, up
36% from the comparable quarter of fiscal 1998.  Revenue from hardware products
increased smartly, particularly joysticks and gamepads.  Learning and
entertainment software revenue was strong, including Microsoft Encarta(R)
reference titles, Flight Simulator games, and the Age of Empires(R) game.
Revenue from Microsoft Press was relatively flat and online services revenue
rose substantially, but from a small base.  Interactive Media and Other revenue
of $783 million grew 18% over the first half of the prior year.  In the first
quarter, revenue from Microsoft Press; hardware; and learning and entertainment
software was relatively flat compared to the prior year.

Sales Channels

Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses,
organizational licenses, and retail packaged products.  OEM channel revenue
represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who pre-install
Microsoft products, primarily on PCs.  Microsoft has three major geographic
sales and marketing organizations: the South Pacific and Americas Region; the
Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region; and the Asia Region.  Sales of
organizational licenses and packaged products in these channels are primarily to
distributors and resellers.

Second quarter revenue from OEMs of $1.80 billion represented an increase of 48%
over the comparable quarter of fiscal 1998.  OEM revenue of $3.16 billion in the
first half of fiscal 1999 increased 44% over the first half of fiscal 1998.
Robust PC shipment growth, particularly in the second quarter, coupled with an
increased penetration of higher value 32-bit operating systems drove the OEM
revenue increase over the prior year.

For the December quarter, revenue in the South Pacific and Americas Region
increased 34% to $1.57 billion.  Revenue for the first two quarters of fiscal
1999 also grew 32% to $3.01 billion.  These high growth rates reflected strong
licensing of many products, including Microsoft Office, Windows NT Server,
Windows NT Workstation, Windows 98, and server applications.  In addition to
steady growth in the U.S., revenue increased strongly in Brazil.

In the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region, second quarter revenue of $1.20
billion was up 37% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 1998.  For the first
two quarters of fiscal 1999, revenue in the region totaled $2.04 billion, an
increase of 31% over the prior year.  Organizational licensing of Microsoft
Office, Windows NT Server, Windows NT Workstation, and server applications grew
strongly when compared to the prior year.  Revenue growth continued to be solid
in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and was particularly high in Sweden.

Revenue in the Asia Region in the December quarter of $373 million increased 14%
from the second quarter of the prior year.  Revenue increased in Hong Kong,
China, and India, but was flat in Japan and Southeast Asia due to economic
issues and weak currencies. On a year to date basis, revenue in the Asia Region
was $680 million, flat with the comparable period of the prior year.  Revenue in
the September quarter decreased 11% from the first quarter of the prior year.
Revenue was flat in Japan and decreased in Southeast Asia due to economic issues
and weak currencies.  As discussed below, the strengthening U.S. dollar
negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year, particularly
in Japan.

Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates.  The
impact of foreign exchange rates on second quarter revenue was nominal, as
weaknesses in Japanese, Australian, and Southeast Asian currencies versus the
U.S. dollar were offset by the relative strength of European currencies.  Had
the rates from the prior year been in effect in the first quarter, international
revenue billed in local currencies would have been $100 million higher, due to
weaknesses in currencies versus the U.S. dollar.  Certain manufacturing,
selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and
a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the
translation exposure.

Operating Expenses, Nonoperating Items, and Income Taxes

Cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 8.8% in the second quarter, similar
to the percent of revenue the prior year.  On a year to date basis, the
percentage was 8.3%, which also was similar to the percentage the prior year.
The trend in mix shift to higher-margin OEM and organizational licenses was
offset by greater volumes of lower-margin interactive media products and certain
manufacturing costs, including costs of the WebTV service.

Research and development expenses in the second quarter increased 6% over the
prior year to $667 million.  For the first two quarters, research and
development expenses were $1.28 billion, up 7% over the comparable period of the
prior year.  These increases were driven primarily by higher development
headcount-related costs, offset by lower third-party development costs.

In August 1997, the Company acquired WebTV Networks, Inc., an online service
that enables consumers to experience the Internet through their televisions via
set-top terminals.  Microsoft paid $425 million in stock and cash for WebTV.
Fiscal 1998 results reflect a one-time write-off of in-process technologies
under development by WebTV of $296 million.

Sales and marketing expenses were $940 million in the December quarter, which
represented 19.0% of revenue, compared to 24.4% in the second quarter of the
prior year.  On a year to date basis, sales and marketing expenses were $1.77
billion, which represented 19.9% of revenue, down from 24.8% of revenue for the
first two quarters of fiscal 1998.  Expenses as a percent of revenue decreased
due to lower relative sales expenses, marketing, and support costs.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                      10
<PAGE>
 
General and administrative costs were $149 million in the second quarter
compared to $106 million in the December quarter of the prior year.  First half
general and administrative costs were $248 million, up 23% from $201 million the
prior year.  The increases were due, in part, to higher legal costs.

Other expenses include primarily the recognition of Microsoft's share of joint
venture activities, including DreamWorks Interactive and the MSNBC cable and
online news services.

Second quarter investment income increased to $337 million from $157 million in
the second quarter of the prior year.  Year to date investment income totaled
$598 million in fiscal 1999, compared to $299 million the prior year.  The
increases were due to the larger investment portfolio generated by cash from
operations, coupled with realized gains of $70 million from the sale of certain
bond and equity securities in the second quarter.

In August 1998, Microsoft sold its Softimage subsidiary to Avid Technology, Inc.
A pretax gain of $160 million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 1999.

Excluding the tax impact of the gain on the sale of Softimage, the effective tax
rate for fiscal 1999 was 35%, less than the higher effective rate in fiscal 1998
due to a legislative clarification of the foreign sales corporation rules as
they apply to software and the nondeductible write-off of WebTV in-process
technologies.

Financial Condition

Microsoft's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $19.24 billion at
December 31, 1998.  The portfolio is diversified among security types,
industries, and individual issuers.  Microsoft's investments are generally
liquid and investment grade.  The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.
dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in
anticipation of continued international expansion.  The portfolio is primarily
invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate
rapid deployment in the event of immediate cash needs.

Microsoft also invests in equity securities, including financial investments and
strategic technology companies in many areas.

Microsoft has no material long-term debt and has $100 million of standby
multicurrency lines of credit to support foreign currency hedging and cash
management.  Stockholders' equity at December 31, 1998 was $22.58 billion.

Microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, and product support
infrastructure.  Additionally, research and development activities will include
investments in existing and advanced areas of technology, including using cash
to acquire technology and to fund ventures and other strategic opportunities.
Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and
computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and
administrative staff.  Commitments for constructing new buildings were $330
million on December 31, 1998.

Cash will also be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for employee
stock option and purchase plans.  The buyback program has not kept pace with
employee stock option grants or exercises.  Beginning in fiscal 1990, Microsoft
has repurchased 355 million common shares while 853 million shares were issued
under the Company's employee stock option and purchase plans.  The market value
of all outstanding stock options was $60 billion as of December 31, 1998.
Microsoft enhances its repurchase program by selling put warrants.  During
December 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible
preferred stock.  Net proceeds of $980 million were used to repurchase common
shares.

Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for
the next 12 months.  Microsoft's cash and short-term investments are available
for strategic investments, mergers and acquisitions, other potential large-scale
cash needs that may arise, and to fund an increased stock buyback program over
historical levels to reduce the dilutive impact of the Company's employee stock
option and purchase programs.

Microsoft has not paid cash dividends on its common stock.  The preferred stock
pays $2.196 per annum per share.

Year 2000

The Year 2000 presents concerns for business and consumer computing.  Aside from
the well-known problems with the use of certain 2-digit date formats as the year
changes from 1999 to 2000, the Year 2000 is a special case leap year, and dates
such as 9/9/99 were used by certain organizations for special functions.  The
problem exists for many kinds of software and hardware, including mainframes,
mini-computers, PCs, and embedded systems.

Microsoft offers a broad range of information resources and software updates to
help customers plan and implement Year 2000 remediation programs.  Current
information about the Company's products and business and technical issues is
available at the Microsoft Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure and Resource Center
web site (www.microsoft.com/year2000).  Information on the web site will help
          --------------------------                                         
customers evaluate the impact of the Year 2000 on Microsoft products used in
their computing environments.

The Company is continuing to test its products and classify its tested products
into the following categories of compliance: "compliant," "compliant with minor
issues," and "not compliant."  Most of the products tested are either
"compliant" or "compliant with minor issues," as defined.  Microsoft's policy is
to make future and current versions of its core products Year 2000 "compliant,"
although the status of certain current versions will remain at "compliant with
minor issues."  For non-compliant products, Microsoft is providing
recommendations as to how an organization may address possible Year 2000 issues
regarding that product.  Microsoft is issuing software updates (at no additional
charge) for most, but not all, known issues.  Not all products will be tested.

Information on the Company's web site is provided to customers for the sole
purpose of assisting in planning for the transition to the Year 2000.  Such
information is the most currently available concerning the behavior of the
Company's products and is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
However, variability of definitions of "compliance" with the Year 2000 and of
different combinations of software, firmware, and hardware will likely lead to
lawsuits against the Company.  The outcome of such lawsuits and the impact on
the Company are not estimable at this time.

The Year 2000 issue also affects the Company's internal systems, including
information technology (IT) and non-IT systems.  Microsoft is assessing the
readiness of its systems for handling the Year 2000, and has started the
remediation and certification process.  Contingency plans are being developed in
parallel with the testing and remediation efforts.

Microsoft is evaluating its third-party distribution and supply chain to
understand their ability to continue providing services and products through the
change to the year 2000. Microsoft is monitoring and working directly with key
vendors, product manufacturers, distributors, and direct resellers to avoid any
business interruptions in the year 2000. For critical third parties with known
issues, contingency plans will be developed.

The Company is also reviewing its facilities and infrastructure.  Remediation
efforts are under way and certain contingency plans are in development.

While Year 2000 issues present a potential risk to Microsoft's internal systems,
distribution and supply chain, and facilities, the Company is minimizing risk
with a worldwide effort. Microsoft is performing an extensive assessment and is
in the process of testing and remediating mission critical components. The
current plan is to have the majority of these components resolved by June 1999,
with the remaining components resolved by September 1999. Management currently
believes that all critical systems will be ready by the Year 2000 and that the
cost to address the issues is not material.

Resolving Year 2000 issues is a worldwide phenomenon that will likely absorb a
substantial portion of IT budgets and attention in the near term.  Certain
industry analysts believe the Year 2000 issue will accelerate the trend toward
distributed PC-based systems from mainframe systems.  Others believe a majority
of IT financial resources will be devoted to fixing older mainframe software in
lieu of funding purchases of PC software or transitions to systems based on
software such as that sold by Microsoft.  The impact of the Year 2000 on future
Microsoft revenue is difficult to discern but is a risk to be considered in
evaluating future growth of the Company.
