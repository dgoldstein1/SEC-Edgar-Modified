Item 5. Other Events.

On June 7, 2000, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
entered a Final Judgment and Memorandum and Order in the case United States of
America v. Microsoft Corporation, Civil Action Nos. 98-1232 (TPJ) and 98-1233
(TPJ).  Generally, the Final Judgment ordered the following:

     .  Within four months of the entry of the Final Judgment, Microsoft must
        submit a plan to separate its business into two completely different
        companies (the "Operating Systems Business" and the "Applications
        Business"), which divestiture would be completed within one year after
        the plan is approved by all parties to the case.
     .  Prior to implementation of a divestiture plan, Microsoft must
        preserve the business of each of the two proposed new companies as they
        are presently conducted.
     .  After implementation of divestiture, the two new companies would be
        prohibited from merging, sharing technology or entering into joint
        business ventures for 10 years.
     .  The two new companies would be monitored for compliance with the plan of
        divestiture and would be subject to a variety of restrictions on their
        business conduct including the following:

          .  A ban on threats or retaliation against computer makers supporting
             competing products;
          .  A requirement of uniform terms for the licensing of Microsoft's
             operating system products except for different language versions
             and volume discounts;
          .  A requirement of greater flexibility in the configuration of
             windows operating system products by computer makers;
          .  A requirement to disclose of certain Microsoft proprietary
             information including application program information to software
             developers;
          .  A ban on certain exclusive contracts;
          .  A ban on contracts in which Microsoft establishes conditions under
             which a licensee is required to license, promote or distribute
             other Microsoft products;
          .  A ban on "binding" of certain middleware products (such as
             browsers) to Microsoft operating system products unless such
             middleware can be readily removed by either the computer
             manufacturer or the end user;
          .  A requirement that predecessor versions of Microsoft operating
             system products be made available to requesting computer
             manufacturers for three years after release of a new product on the
             same terms and conditions.

     The Final Judgment contains a number of other provisions and is attached
as an exhibit to this report. You are encouraged to read the full order as well
as the other exhibits that are attached.

     On June 13, 2000, Microsoft filed a Notice of Appeal and Motion for a Stay
of the Judgment Pending Appeal, appealing to the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit the Final Judgment and the Findings of Fact
and Conclusions of Law entered on April 3, 2000 finding that Microsoft violated
the federal and state antitrust laws.

     The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
entered an Order on June 13, 2000 agreeing to hear the appeal by the court
sitting en banc.

     Microsoft issued a press release on June 13, 2000 reporting Microsoft's
appeal of the Final Judgment and Microsoft's position with respect to the Final
Judgment and its arguments on appeal.

     Although Microsoft expects to obtain relief from some or all of the
provisions in the Final Judgment, it is unable to predict when or to what extent
such relief will be obtained.  The failure to obtain sufficient relief through
the stay and/or the appeal could have a material adverse effect on the value of
Microsoft's common stock.  You are encouraged to read our motion for a stay
pending the appeal, which is attached as an exhibit.  This motion summarizes our
objections to the Final Judgment.

     ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as follows:

2.   Divestiture

     1.   Not later than four months after entry of this Final Judgment,
          Microsoft shall submit to the Court and the Plaintiffs a proposed plan
          of divestiture. The Plaintiffs shall submit any objections to the
          proposed plan of divestiture to the Court within 60 days of receipt of
          the plan, and Microsoft shall submit its response within 30 days of
          receipt of the plaintiffs' objections.

     2.   Following approval of a final plan of divestiture by the Court (the
          "Plan")/1/ (and the expiration of the stay pending appeal set forth in
          section 6.a), Microsoft shall implement such Plan.

     3.   The Plan shall provide for the completion, within 12 months of the
          expiration of the stay pending appeal set forth in section 6.a., of
          the following steps:

          1.   The separation of the Operating Systems Business from the
               Applications Business, and the transfer of the assets of one of
               them (the "Separated

______________________
     /1/  Definitions of capitalized terms are set forth in section 7, below.
<PAGE>

               Business") to a separate entity along with (a) all personnel,
               systems, and other tangible and intangible assets (including
               Intellectual Property) used to develop, produce, distribute,
               market, promote, sell, license and support the products and
               services of the Separated Business, and (b) such other assets as
               are necessary to operate the Separated Business as an independent
               and economically viable entity.

          2.   Intellectual Property that is used both in a product developed,
               distributed, or sold by the Applications Business and in a
               product developed, distributed, or sold by the Operating Systems
               Business as of April 27, 2000, shall be assigned to the
               Applications Business, and the Operating Systems Business shall
               be granted a perpetual, royalty-free license to license and
               distribute such Intellectual Property in its products, and,
               except with respect to such Intellectual Property related to the
               Internet browser, to develop, license and distribute modified or
               derivative versions of such Intellectual Property, provided that
               the Operating Systems Business does not grant rights to such
               versions to the Applications Business. In the case of such
               Intellectual Property that is related to the Internet browser,
               the license shall not grant the Operating Systems Business any
               right to develop, license, or distribute modified or derivative
               versions of the Internet browser.

          3.   The transfer of ownership of the Separated Business by means of a
               distribution of stock of the Separated Business to Non-Covered
               Shareholders of Microsoft, or by other disposition that does not
               result in a Covered Shareholder owning stock in both the
               Separated Business and the Remaining Business.

     4.   Until Implementation of the Plan, Microsoft shall:

          1.   preserve, maintain, and operate the Operating Systems Business
               and the Applications Business as ongoing, economically viable
               businesses, with management, sales, products, and operations of
               each business held as separate, distinct and apart from one
               another as they were on April 27, 2000, except to provide the
               accounting, management, and information services or other
               necessary support functions provided by Microsoft prior to the
               entry of this Final Judgment;

          2.   use all reasonable efforts to maintain and increase the sales and
               revenues of both the products produced or sold by the Operating
               Systems Business and those produced or sold by the Applications
               Business prior to the Implementation of the Plan and to support

               business development efforts of both the Operating Systems
               Business and the Applications Business;

          3.   take no action that undermines, frustrates, interferes with, or
               makes more difficult the divestiture required by this Final
               Judgment without the prior approval of the Court; and

          4.   file a report with the Court 90 days after entry of this Final
               Judgment on the steps Microsoft has taken to comply with the
               requirements of this section 1.d.

3.   Provisions Implementing Divestiture

     1.   After Implementation of the Plan, and throughout the term of this
          Final Judgment, neither the Operating Systems Business nor the
          Applications Business, nor any member of their respective Boards of
          Directors, shall acquire any securities or assets of the other
          Business; no Covered Shareholder holding securities of either the
          Operating Systems Business or the Applications Business shall acquire
          any securities or assets of or shall be an officer, director, or
          employee of the other Business; and no person who is an officer,
          director, or employee of the Operating Systems Business or the
          Applications Business shall be an officer, director, or employee of
          the other Business.

     2.   After Implementation of the Plan and throughout the term of this Final
          Judgment, the Operating Systems Business and the Applications Business
          shall be prohibited from:

          1.   merging or otherwise recombining, or entering into any joint
               venture with one another;

          2.   entering into any Agreement with one another under which one of
               the Businesses develops, sells, licenses for sale or
               distribution, or distributes products or services (other than the
               technologies referred to in the following sentence) developed,
               sold, licensed, or distributed by the other Business;

          3.   providing to the other any APIs, Technical Information,
               Communications Interfaces, or technical information that is not
               simultaneously published, disclosed, or made readily available to
               ISVs, IHVs, and OEMs; and

          4.   licensing, selling or otherwise providing to the other Business

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

          Section 2.b.ii shall not prohibit the Operating Systems Business and
          the Applications Business from licensing technologies (other than
          Middleware Products) to each other for use in each others' products or
          services provided that such technology (i) is not and has not been
          separately sold, licensed, or offered as a product, and (ii) is
          licensed on terms that are otherwise consistent with this Final
          Judgment.

     3.   Three months after Implementation of the Plan and once every three
          months thereafter throughout the term of this Final Judgment, the

     4.   Throughout the term of this Final Judgment, Microsoft, the Operating
          Systems Business and the Applications Business shall be prohibited

     the term of this Final Judgment.

     1.   OEM Relations.

          1.   Ban on Adverse Actions for Supporting Competing Products.
               Microsoft shall not take or threaten any action adversely
               affecting any OEM (including but not limited to giving or
               withholding any consideration such as licensing terms; discounts;
               technical, marketing, and sales support; enabling programs;
               product information; technical information; information about
               future plans; developer tools or developer support; hardware
               certification; and permission to display trademarks or logos)
               based directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, on any actual
               or contemplated action by that OEM:

     (1)  to use, distribute, promote, license, develop, produce or sell any
          product or service that competes with any Microsoft product or
          service; or

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

          (2)  to exercise any of the options or alternatives provided under
               this Final Judgment.

     2.   Uniform Terms for Windows Operating System Products Licensed to
          Covered OEMs. Microsoft shall license Windows Operating System
          Products to Covered OEMs pursuant to uniform license agreements with
          uniform terms and conditions and shall not employ market development
          allowances or discounts in connection with Windows Operating System
          Products. Without limiting the foregoing, Microsoft shall charge each
          Covered OEM the applicable royalty for Windows Operating System
          Products as set forth on a schedule, to be established by Microsoft
          and published on a web site accessible to plaintiffs and all Covered
          OEMs, that provides for uniform royalties for Windows Operating
          System Products, except that -

          (1)  the schedule may specify different royalties for different
               language versions, and

          (2)  the schedule may specify reasonable volume discounts based upon
               actual volume of total shipments of Windows Operating System
               Products.

               Without limiting the foregoing, Microsoft shall afford Covered
               OEMs equal access to licensing terms; discounts; technical,
               marketing, and sales support; product information; technical
               information; information about future plans; developer tools or
               developer support; hardware certification; and permission to
               display trademarks or logos.  The foregoing requirement insofar
               as it relates to access to technical information and information
               about future plans shall not apply to any bona fide joint
               development effort by Microsoft and a Covered OEM with respect to
               confidential matters within the scope of that effort.  Microsoft
               shall not terminate a Covered OEM's license for a Windows
               Operating System Product without having first given the Covered
               OEM written notice of the reason for the proposed termination and
               not less than thirty days' opportunity to cure.  Microsoft shall
               not enforce any provision in any Agreement with a Covered OEM
               that is inconsistent with this Final Judgment.

          3.   OEM Flexibility in Product Configuration. Microsoft shall not
               restrict (by contract or otherwise, including but not limited to
               granting or withholding consideration) an OEM from modifying the
               boot sequence, startup folder, internet connection wizard,
               desktop, preferences, favorites, start page, first screen, or
               other aspect of a Windows Operating System Product to -

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

          (1)  include a registration sequence to obtain subscription or other
               information from the user;

          (2)  display icons of or otherwise feature other products or services,
               regardless of the size or shape of such icons or features, or to
               remove the icons, folders, start menu entries, or favorites of
               Microsoft products or services;

          (3)  display any user interfaces, provided that an icon is also
               displayed that allows the user to access the Windows user
               interface; or

          (4)  launch automatically any non-Microsoft Middleware, Operating
               System or application, offer its own Internet access provider or
               other start-up sequence, or offer an option to make non-Microsoft
               Middleware the Default Middleware and to remove the means of End-
               User Access for Microsoft's Middleware Product.

2.   Disclosure of APIs, Communications Interfaces and Technical Information.
     Microsoft shall disclose to ISVs, IHVs, and OEMs in a Timely Manner, in
     whatever media Microsoft disseminates such information to its own
     personnel, all APIs, Technical Information and Communications Interfaces
     that Microsoft employs to enable -

     1.   Microsoft applications to interoperate with Microsoft Platform
          Software installed on the same Personal Computer, or

     2.   a Microsoft Middleware Product to interoperate with Windows Operating
          System software (or Middleware distributed with such Operating System)
          installed on the same Personal Computer, or

     3.   any Microsoft software installed on one computer (including but not
          limited to server Operating Systems and operating systems for handheld
          devices) to interoperate with a Windows Operating System (or
          Middleware distributed with such Operating System) installed on a
          Personal Computer.

     To facilitate compliance, and monitoring of compliance, with the foregoing,
     Microsoft shall create a secure facility where qualified representatives of
     OEMs, ISVs, and IHVs shall be permitted to study, interrogate and interact
     with relevant and necessary portions of the source code and any related
     documentation of Microsoft Platform Software for the sole purpose of
     enabling their products to


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

     interoperate effectively with Microsoft Platform Software (including
     exercising any of the options in section 3.a.iii).

3.   Knowing Interference with Performance. Microsoft shall not take any action
     that it knows will interfere with or degrade the performance of any non-
     Microsoft Middleware when interoperating with any Windows Operating System
     Product without notifying the supplier of such non-Microsoft Middleware in
     writing that Microsoft intends to take such action, Microsoft's reasons for
     taking the action, and any ways known to Microsoft for the supplier to
     avoid or reduce interference with, or the degrading of, the performance of
     the supplier's Middleware.

4.   Developer Relations. Microsoft shall not take or threaten any action
     affecting any ISV or IHV (including but not limited to giving or
     withholding any consideration such as licensing terms; discounts;
     technical, marketing, and sales support; enabling programs; product
     information; technical information; information about future plans;
     developer tools or developer support; hardware certification; and
     permission to display trademarks or logos) based directly or indirectly, in
     whole or in part, on any actual or contemplated action by that ISV or IHV
     to -

     1.   use, distribute, promote or support any Microsoft product or service,
          or

     2.   develop, use, distribute, promote or support software that runs on
          non-Microsoft Middleware or a non-Microsoft Operating System or that
          competes with any Microsoft product or service, or

     3.   exercise any of the options or alternatives provided under this Final
          Judgment.

5.   Ban on Exclusive Dealing. Microsoft shall not enter into or enforce any
     Agreement in which a third party agrees, or is offered or granted
     consideration, to -

     1.   restrict its development, production, distribution, promotion or use
          of, or payment for, any non-Microsoft Platform Software,

     2.   distribute, promote or use any Microsoft Platform Software
          exclusively,

     3.   degrade the performance of any non-Microsoft Platform Software, or

     4.   in the case of an agreement with an Internet access provider or
          Internet content provider, distribute, promote or use Microsoft
          software in exchange for placement with respect to any aspect of a
          Windows Operating System Product.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

     6.   Ban on Contractual Tying. Microsoft shall not condition the granting
          of a Windows Operating System Product license, or the terms or
          administration of such license, on an OEM or other licensee agreeing
          to license, promote, or distribute any other Microsoft software
          product that Microsoft distributes separately from the Windows
          Operating System Product in the retail channel or through Internet
          access providers, Internet content providers, ISVs or OEMs, whether or
          not for a separate or positive price.

     7.   Restriction on Binding Middleware Products to Operating System
          Products. Microsoft shall not, in any Operating System Product
          distributed six or more months after the effective date of this Final
          Judgment, Bind any Middleware Product to a Windows Operating System
          unless:

          1.   Microsoft also offers an otherwise identical version of that
               Operating System Product in which all means of End-User Access to
               that Middleware Product can readily be removed (a) by OEMs as
               part of standard OEM preinstallation kits and (b) by end users
               using add-remove utilities readily accessible in the initial boot
               process and from the Windows desktop; and

          2.   when an OEM removes End-User Access to a Middleware Product from
               any Personal Computer on which Windows is preinstalled, the
               royalty paid by that OEM for that copy of Windows is reduced in
               an amount not less than the product of the otherwise applicable
               royalty and the ratio of the number of amount in bytes of binary
               code of (a) the Middleware Product as distributed separately from
               a Windows Operating System Product to (b) the applicable version
               of Windows.

     8.   Agreements Limiting Competition. Microsoft shall not offer, agree to
          provide, or provide any consideration to any actual or potential
          Platform Software competitor in exchange for such competitor's
          agreeing to refrain or refraining in whole or in part from developing,
          licensing, promoting or distributing any Operating System Product or
          Middleware Product competitive with any Windows Operating System
          Product or Middleware Product.

     9.   Continued Licensing of Predecessor Version. Microsoft shall, when it
          makes a major Windows Operating System Product release (such as
          Windows 95, OSR 2.0, OSR 2.5, Windows 98, Windows 2000 Professional,
          Windows "Millennium," "Whistler," "Blackcomb," and successors to
          these), continue for three years after said release to license on the
          same terms and conditions the previous Windows Operating System
          Product to any OEM that desires such a license. The net royalty rate
          for the previous Windows Operating System Product shall be no more
          than the average royalty paid by the OEM for such Product prior

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

          to the release. The OEM shall be free to market Personal Computers in
          which it preinstalls such an Operating System Product in the same
          manner in which it markets Personal Computers preinstalled with other
          Windows Operating System Products.

5.   Internal Antitrust Compliance. This section shall remain in effect
     throughout the term of this Final Judgment, provided that, consistent with
     section 2.e, this section shall not apply to the Applications Business
     after the Implementation of the Plan.

     1.   Within 90 days after the effective date of this Final Judgment,
          Microsoft shall establish a Compliance Committee of its corporate

          Board of Directors who are not present or former employees of
          Microsoft.

          shall report directly to the Compliance Committee and to the Chief
          Executive Officer of Microsoft.

          supervision of Microsoft's internal programs to ensure compliance with
          the antitrust laws and this Final Judgment.

               each platform software developer and employee involved in
               relations with OEMs, ISVs, or IHVs, a copy of this Final Judgment
               together with additional informational materials describing the
               conduct prohibited and required by this Final Judgment;

          2.   distribute in a timely manner a copy of this Final Judgment and
               such additional informational materials to any person who
               succeeds to a position of officer, director, or Manager, or
               platform software developer or employee involved in relations
               with OEMs, ISVs or IHVs;

          3.   obtain from each officer, director, and Manager, and each
               platform software developer and employee involved in relations
               with OEMs, ISVs or IHVs, within 90 days of entry of this Final
               Judgment, and for each

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

               person thereafter succeeding to such a position within 5 days of
               such succession, a written certification that he or she:

               (2)  has been advised and understands that his or her failure to
                    comply with this Final Judgment may result in conviction for
                    criminal contempt of court;

          4.   maintain a record of persons to whom this Final Judgment has been
               distributed and from whom, pursuant to Section 4.e.iii, such
               certifications have been obtained;

               on a confidential basis; and

          6.   report immediately to Plaintiffs and the Court any violation of

          Microsoft officers, directors and managers engaged in software
          development, marketing, sales and developer relations related to
          Platform Software.

6.   Compliance Inspection.  This section shall remain in effect throughout the
     term of this Final Judgment.

     1.   For purposes of determining or securing implementation of or
          compliance with this Final Judgment, including the provisions
          requiring a plan of divestiture, or determining whether this Final
          Judgment should be modified or vacated, and subject to any legally

          1.   Duly authorized representatives of a Plaintiff, upon the written
               request of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the
               Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or

               and on reasonable notice to Microsoft made to its principal
               office, shall be permitted:

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

               (1) Access during office hours to inspect and copy or, at
               Plaintiffs' option, demand Microsoft provide copies of all books,
               ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, source code, and
               other records and documents in the  possession or under the
               control of Microsoft (which may have counsel present), relating
               to the matters contained in this Final Judgment; and

               (2) Subject to the reasonable convenience of Microsoft and
               without restraint or interference from it, to interview, either
               informally or on the record, its officers, employees, and agents,
               who may have their individual counsel present, regarding any such
               matters.

          2.   Upon the written request of the Assistant Attorney General in
               charge of the Antitrust Division of the United States Department
               of Justice, or the Attorney General of a Plaintiff State, as the
               case may be, made to Microsoft at its principal offices,
               Microsoft shall submit such written reports, under oath if
               requested, as may be requested with respect to any matter
               contained in this Final Judgment.

          3.   No information or documents obtained by the means provided in
               this section shall be divulged by a representative of a Plaintiff
               to any person other than a duly authorized representative of a
               Plaintiff, except in the course of legal proceedings to which the
               Plaintiff is a party (including grand jury proceedings), or for
               the purpose of securing compliance with this Final Judgment, or
               as otherwise required by law.

          4.   If at the time information or documents are furnished by
               Microsoft to a Plaintiff, Microsoft represents and identifies in
               writing the material in any such information or documents to

     These cases are before the Court for disposition of the sole matter
presently remaining for decision by the trial court, namely, entry of
appropriate relief for the violations of the Sherman Act, (S)(S) 1 and 2, and
various state laws committed by the defendant Microsoft Corporation as found by
Court in accordance with its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  Final
judgment will be entered contemporaneously herewith.  No further proceedings
will be required.

     The Court has been presented by plaintiffs with a proposed form of final
judgment that would mandate both conduct modification and structural
reorganization by the defendant when fully implemented.  Microsoft has responded
with a motion for summary rejection of structural reorganization and a request
for months of additional time to oppose the relief sought in all other respects.
Microsoft claims, in effect, to have been surprised by the "draconian" and
"unprecedented" remedy the plaintiffs recommend.  What it proposes is yet
another round of discovery, to be followed by a second trial - in essence an ex
                                                                             --
post and de facto bifurcation of the case already considered and rejected by the
- ----     -- -----
Court.

     Microsoft's profession of surprise is not credible./1/  From the inception
of this case Microsoft knew, from well-established Supreme Court precedents
dating from the beginning of the last century, that a mandated divestiture was a
possibility, if not a probability, in the event of an adverse result at trial.
At the conclusion of the trial the Court's Findings of Fact gave clear warning
to Microsoft that the result would likely be adverse, yet the Court delayed
entry of its

__________________________
     /1/       Despite their surprise, compounded no doubt by the Court's
refusal on May 24th to allow discovery and take testimony on the issue,
Microsoft's attorneys were promptly able to tender a 35-page "Offer of Proof,"
summarizing in detail the testimony 16 witnesses would give to explain why
plaintiffs' proposed remedy, in its entirety, is a bad idea. Within a week they
added seven more.

Conclusions of Law for five months, and enlisted the services of a
distinguished mediator, to assist Microsoft and the plaintiffs in reaching
agreement on a remedy of some description that Microsoft knew was inevitable.
Even assuming that Microsoft negotiated in utmost good faith in the course of
mediation, it had to have in contemplation the prospect that, were mediation to
fail, the prevailing plaintiffs would propose to the Court a remedy most to
their liking and least likely to be acceptable to Microsoft.  Its failure to
anticipate and to prepare to meet such an eventuality gives no reason to afford
it an opportunity to do so now.

     These cases have been before the Court, and have occupied much of its
attention, for the past two years, not counting the antecedent proceedings.
Following a full trial Microsoft has been found guilty of antitrust violations,
notwithstanding its protests to this day that it has committed none.  The Court
is convinced for several reasons that a final - and appealable - judgment should
be entered quickly.  It has also reluctantly come to the conclusion, for the
same reasons, that a structural remedy has become imperative: Microsoft as it is
presently organized and led is unwilling to accept the notion that it broke the
law or accede to an order amending its conduct.

     First, despite the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,
Microsoft does not yet concede that any of its business practices violated the
Sherman Act.  Microsoft officials have recently been quoted publicly to the
effect that the company has "done nothing wrong" and that it will be vindicated
on appeal.  The Court is well aware that there is a substantial body of public
opinion, some of it rational, that holds to a similar view.  It is time to put
that assertion to the test.  If true, then an appellate tribunal should be given
early opportunity to confirm it as promptly as possible, and to abort any
remedial measures before they have become irreversible

                                       3
<PAGE>

as a practical matter.

     Second, there is credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft,
convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in the past, and
may yet do to other markets what it has already done in the PC operating system
and browser markets.  Microsoft has shown no disposition to voluntarily alter
its business protocol in any significant respect.  Indeed, it has announced its
intention to appeal even the imposition of the modest conduct remedies it has
itself proposed as an alternative to the non-structural remedies sought by the
plaintiffs.

     Third, Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past.  In earlier
proceedings in which a preliminary injunction was entered, Microsoft's purported
compliance with that injunction while it was on appeal was illusory and its
explanation disingenuous.  If it responds in similar fashion to an injunctive
remedy in this case, the earlier the need for enforcement measures becomes
apparent the more effective they are likely to be.

     Finally, the Court believes that extended proceedings on the form a remedy
should take are unlikely to give any significantly greater assurance that it
will be able to identify what might be generally regarded as an optimum remedy.
As has been the case with regard to Microsoft's culpability, opinion as to an
appropriate remedy is sharply divided.  There is little chance that those
divergent opinions will be reconciled by anything short of actual experience.
The declarations (and the "offers of proof") from numerous potential witnesses
now before the Court provide some insight as to how its various provisions might
operate, but for the most part they are merely the predictions of purportedly
knowledgeable people as to effects which may or may not ensue if the proposed
final judgment is entered.   In its experience the Court has found testimonial
predictions of future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to

                                       4
<PAGE>

historical fact, and cross-examination to be of little use in enhancing or
detracting from their accuracy.

     In addition to its substantive objections, the proposed final judgment is
also criticized by Microsoft as being vague and ambiguous.  Plaintiffs respond
that, to the extent it may be lacking in detail, it is purposely so to allow
Microsoft itself to propose such detail as will be least disruptive of its
business, failing which plaintiffs will ask the Court to supply it as the need
appears.

     Plaintiffs won the case, and for that reason alone have some entitlement to
a remedy of their choice. Moreover, plaintiffs' proposed final judgment is the
collective work product of senior antitrust law enforcement officials of the
United States Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of 19 states, in
conjunction with multiple consultants./2/ These officials are by reason of
office obliged and expected to consider - and to act in - the public interest;
Microsoft is not. The proposed final judgment is represented to the Court as
incorporating provisions employed successfully in the past, and it appears to
the Court to address all the principal objectives of relief in such cases,
namely, to terminate the unlawful conduct, to prevent its repetition in the
future, and to revive competition in the relevant markets. Microsoft's
alternative decree is plainly inadequate in all three respects.

     The final judgment proposed by plaintiffs is perhaps more radical than
might have resulted had mediation been successful and terminated in a consent
decree.  It is less so than that

_________________________
     /2/       Two states dissented from the imposition of structural remedies
but fully supported the remainder of the relief proposed. The absence of total
unanimity merely confirms the collaborative character of the process by which
the proposed final judgment was formulated.

advocated by four disinterested amici curiae. It is designed, moreover, to take
                                ----- ------
force in stages, so that the effects can be gauged while the appeal progresses
and before it has been fully implemented. And, of course, the Court will retain
jurisdiction following appeal, and can modify the judgment as necessary in
accordance with instructions from an appellate court or to accommodate
conditions changed with the passage of time.

     It is, therefore, this _____ day of June, 2000,
     ORDERED, that the motion of defendant Microsoft Corporation for summary
rejection of the plaintiffs' proposed structural reorganization is denied; and
it is

     FURTHER ORDERED, that defendant Microsoft Corporation's "position" as to
future proceedings on the issue of remedy is rejected; and it is

     FURTHER ORDERED, that plaintiffs' proposed final judgment, as revised in
accordance with the proceedings of May 24, 2000 and Microsoft's comments
thereon, be entered as a Final Judgment herein.

Pursuant to Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, defendant-
appellant Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") hereby moves for a stay of all
provisions of the district court's June 7, 2000 final judgment pending
resolution of this appeal.

Although the district court's judgment and accompanying memorandum made clear
that it was highly unlikely that the district court would stay the judgment
pending appeal, Microsoft filed a short stay motion with the district court on
June 7, 2000. Five days later, plaintiffs filed a response to Microsoft's stay
motion urging the district court to deny the motion, but to defer its ruling
until (i) Microsoft filed its notice of appeal and (ii) the district court was
in a position to resolve a motion for certification of direct appeal to the
Supreme Court--issues wholly unrelated to the district court's consideration of
a stay pending appeal. On June 13, 2000, the district court entered an order
finding that "consideration of a stay pending appeal is premature in that no
notice of appeal has yet been filed" and "reserv[ing] ruling on Microsoft's
motion until such time as a timely notice of appeal is filed."

Microsoft's stay motion has been pending for nearly a week, and the district
court has "failed to afford the relief requested" by the motion. Fed. R. App. P.
8(a)(2)(A)(ii). Accordingly, Microsoft now asks this Court to stay the judgment
pending appeal. Time is of the essence here. Many extreme provisions of the
judgment start to take effect 90 days after its entry, and Microsoft must begin
preparing immediately if it is to be in compliance with the judgment in 84 days.
Microsoft
<PAGE>

therefore respectfully requests that the Court set an expedited briefing
schedule on Microsoft's motion so that it can be resolved as soon as possible.
Microsoft will promptly advise the Court if, contrary to all expectations, the
district court grants Microsoft's stay motion now that a notice of appeal has
been filed.

                                 INTRODUCTION

This is an appeal from a judgment of the district court (Hon. Thomas Penfield
Jackson) holding Microsoft liable for violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the
Sherman Act and various corresponding provisions of state law. The judgment was
entered in two consolidated actions, one brought by the Antitrust Division of
the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the other by nineteen States and the
District of Columbia.

Microsoft's appeal will present an overwhelming case for reversal of the
judgment based on an array of serious substantive and procedural errors that
infected virtually every aspect of the proceedings below. These flaws culminated
in the entry of unprecedented relief that extends far beyond the case that was
presented, without affording Microsoft an evidentiary hearing on the terms of
one of the most complex antitrust decrees in history. Based on six hearsay
declarations submitted by plaintiffs, the district court ordered that Microsoft
be split into two companies, disclose its valuable intellectual property to
competitors, redesign all of its operating system software to plaintiffs' vague
specifications and re-price that software according to an arbitrary court-
imposed formula.

Although final implementation of the breakup is stayed pending appeal, the
judgment's other extreme provisions take effect 90 days after entry. Absent a
stay from this Court, these provisions will (i) result in a confiscation of
large amounts of Microsoft's intellectual property, (ii) interfere with
Microsoft's release of new products such as its Windows Millenium operating
system, (iii) require Microsoft to redesign all of its existing operating
systems within six months of the judgment's effective date or else withdraw them
from the marketplace, (iv) force Microsoft immediately to divert vast resources
from software development to complying with the judgment and formulating the
required breakup plan, and (v) make it difficult for Microsoft to conduct
business in the highly-competitive, fast-moving software industry at a critical
time when software is being transformed from standalone products to Web-based
services. The effect of these provisions will be devastating, not only to
Microsoft, but also to its employees, shareholders, business partners and
customers, and could have a significant adverse impact on the Nation's economy.
A stay pending appeal is necessary to prevent these far-reaching and
irreversible consequences of a profoundly flawed ruling.

                             STATEMENT OF THE CASE

A. The Complaints and Preliminary Injunction Motion

On May 18, 1998, the DOJ and various States commenced these actions alleging
violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and the States' respective
antitrust statutes. Plaintiffs
<PAGE>

asserted two claims under Section 1 (unlawful tying and exclusive dealing) and
two claims under Section 2 (attempted monopolization of "Internet browsers" and
maintenance of a monopoly in "PC operating systems"). (DOJ Compl. (P)(P) 130-41;
States First Am. Compl. (P)(P) 85-90, 93-97.) The central allegation of
plaintiffs' complaints was that Microsoft had unlawfully foreclosed Netscape
Communications Corp. ("Netscape") from distributing and promoting its Web
browsing software, called Navigator, by (i) including Microsoft's own Web
browsing software, called Internet Explorer, in its Windows 95 and Windows 98
operating systems, (ii) entering into exclusive distribution and promotion
agreements relating to Internet Explorer with distributors such as online
services ("OLSs"), Internet service providers ("ISPs") and Internet content
providers ("ICPs"), and (iii) not granting computer manufacturers ("OEMs") that
preinstall Windows the right to modify the initial Windows startup sequence and
the Windows desktop to prevent end users from accessing Internet Explorer.

Plaintiffs contended that Microsoft sought to limit Netscape's distribution of
Navigator because it was concerned that Navigator could become a competing
"platform" to which applications could be written, and thus might reduce what
plaintiffs viewed as the sole barrier to entry into the PC operating system
business. (DOJ Compl. (P)(P) 3-4, 7-9; States First Am. Compl. (P)(P) 32-37.)
According to plaintiffs, this so-called barrier--referred to as the
"applications barrier to entry"--results from Microsoft's success in persuading
software developers to write large numbers of applications for Windows relative
to other operating systems. (DOJ Compl. (P) 3; States First Am. Compl. (P) 35.)
In plaintiffs' view, this purported barrier could be eroded if more applications
were written for cross-platform "middleware" such as Navigator that has versions
that run on multiple operating systems. (DOJ Compl. (P)(P) 66-68; States First
Am. Compl. (P)(P) 34-36.)

As the district court observed in its September 1998 summary judgment decision,
plaintiffs' complaints both sought virtually the same narrow relief, namely, an
order enjoining Microsoft from:

(1) entering into or enforcing certain contractual provisions which allegedly
foreclose distribution and/or promotion of competing Internet browsers; (2)
distributing a "bundled" version of its operating system and browser unless
Microsoft provides a practical way of removing browser functions and provides
OEMs that do not wish to license the browser an appropriate deduction from the
royalty rate; (3) distributing a "bundled" version of its operating system and
browser unless Microsoft treats Netscape Corporation's ("Netscape") browser the
same as its own with respect to inclusion and removal; and (4) retaliating
against any OEM that chooses to remove Microsoft's browser from Windows 98.

United States v. Microsoft Corp., Nos. 98-1232, 1233, 1998 WL 614485, at *1
(D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998). Together with their complaints, plaintiffs filed
motions for a preliminary injunction seeking largely the same relief--what
plaintiffs at the time referred to as a "surgical strike." Plaintiffs argued
that in the absence of preliminary relief, Netscape would be effectively
foreclosed from
<PAGE>

getting Navigator into the hands of consumers and that consumers would thus be
deprived of their choice of Web browsing software.

B. Pretrial Proceedings

Following a scheduling conference on May 22, 1998, the district court
consolidated the two actions pursuant to Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. The district court also advanced the trial of both actions on
the merits and consolidated it with the preliminary injunction hearing pursuant
to Rule 65(a)(2). In view of the narrow focus of plaintiffs' complaints and
requested relief, the district court, over Microsoft's objection, scheduled the
trial to commence on September 8, 1998--less than four months away. The court
also limited each side to twelve trial witnesses and required the parties to
file the direct examinations of their witnesses in the form of written
declarations.

On June 23, 1998, a little more than a month after the complaints were filed,
this Court reversed the district court's December 11, 1997 order granting a sua
sponte preliminary injunction in a closely related action brought by the DOJ
against Microsoft under a 1994 consent decree. United States v. Microsoft Corp.,
147 F.3d 935 (D.C. Cir. 1998). This Court held, based on the record before it,
that Windows 95 and Internet Explorer 4.0 constitute an "integrated product"
under the consent decree because there are "facially plausible benefits" to the
"integrated design" of Windows 95, including its Internet Explorer components,
"as compared to an operating system combined with a stand-alone browser such as
Netscape's Navigator." Id. at 950. Based largely on this Court's decision,
Microsoft moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' tying and other claims.

In denying Microsoft's motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' tying claim,
the district court observed that although this Court's opinion "was ostensibly
limited to interpreting the specific terms of the Consent Decree, the analysis
was, in the Court of Appeals' eyes, `consistent with tying law.'" 1998 WL
614485, at *10 (quoting 147 F.3d at 950). The district court acknowledged that
this Court had articulated the controlling legal standard in this case for
"determining whether an integration amounts to a single product for purposes of
evaluating a tying claim," id., a ruling the court would repudiate eighteen
months later in its conclusions of law when it condemned Microsoft's design of
Windows 95 and 98 as unlawful ties. In its summary judgment decision, however,
the district court applied this Court's standard, stating that it could not
"determine whether Windows and IE are `separate products' until it becomes clear
what are the synergistic benefits that are unique to the Windows/IE combination,
i.e., benefits that could not be obtained by combining another browser with
Windows." Id. at *12.

Although the district court denied Microsoft's summary judgment motion, this
Court's June 1998 decision eviscerated the central contention of plaintiffs'
complaints, namely, that Microsoft had "tied" Internet Explorer to Windows 95
and Windows 98. (See, e.g., DOJ Compl. (P)(P) 18-23, 103-23, 134-37; States
First Am. Compl. (P)(P) 47-50, 54-69, 93-95.) In the months following that
<PAGE>

decision, plaintiffs responded by dramatically expanding the scope of their
case, raising new allegations not included in their complaints and seeking to
convert the case into an omnibus Section 2 monopoly maintenance action. Over
Microsoft's vehement and repeated objections, plaintiffs advanced new
allegations concerning Microsoft's interactions with Intel Corporation
("Intel"), Apple Computer Corp. ("Apple"), RealNetworks, Inc. ("RealNetworks")
and IBM Corp. ("IBM"). Plaintiffs also contended that Microsoft unlawfully
impeded marketplace acceptance of the Java technologies promoted by Sun
Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") by creating its own implementation of Java optimized
for use with Windows. This allegation was already the subject of a lawsuit
between Sun and Microsoft. See Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., No. C-
97-20884-RMW (N.D. Cal.).

Despite the dramatic transformation of the cases, the district court did not
require plaintiffs to amend their complaints. Rather, the court assured
Microsoft that it "would not be making any findings" and "would not predicate
any relief" on matters unrelated to the conduct challenged in the complaints
(Sept. 17, 1998 Tr. at 7), an assurance the court would later ignore both in
making its findings of fact and in fashioning relief. The court also refused to
give Microsoft additional time to conduct discovery and prepare for a greatly
expanded trial, notwithstanding Microsoft's repeated pleas for both. Because
Microsoft ultimately had less than five months to prepare for trial (and much
less time to prepare its defense to plaintiffs' new allegations involving
various highly technical subjects), Microsoft was unable to pursue entire
avenues of necessary discovery. The limited time available to Microsoft was
particularly unfair given that the DOJ had been investigating the issues for
years before filing its complaint using compulsory process granted by the
Antitrust Civil Process Act.
C. The Trial

Notwithstanding Microsoft's motion for a continuance, trial began on October 19,
1998, less than five months after the complaints were filed. The Final Pretrial
Order provided that "no new discovery shall be initiated by any party after
entry of this Final Pretrial Order except with prior leave of the Court for
cause shown." The parties concluded their cases-in-chief on February 26, 1999,
and presented rebuttal evidence between June 1, 1999 and June 24, 1999.

At trial, the district court largely suspended application of the Federal Rules
of Evidence, admitting into evidence numerous newspaper and magazine articles
and other rank hearsay. For example, sixty-nine paragraphs of the written direct
testimony of James Barksdale, then chief executive officer of Netscape and
plaintiffs' first witness, contained large amounts of inadmissible hearsay,
oftentimes multiple levels of hearsay. Yet, the district court denied
Microsoft's motion in limine to exclude such hearsay statements.

In the middle of trial, an event occurred that completely changed the
competitive landscape of the software industry. On November 24, 1998, America
Online, Inc. ("AOL"), a Microsoft competitor that provided plaintiffs' second
witness, agreed to acquire Netscape--the company plaintiffs
<PAGE>

claimed had been fatally injured by Microsoft's conduct--in a stock acquisition
valued at $10 billion at the time of closing. In a related transaction, AOL
entered into a three-year "strategic alliance" with Sun, another competitor of
Microsoft that likewise provided plaintiffs with a trial witness.

D. Findings of Fact

The district court bifurcated briefing on findings of fact and conclusions of
law, and issued its findings of fact on November 5, 1999. Although 412
paragraphs long, the court's findings do not contain a single citation to the
record, making it impossible to ascertain the purported basis for many findings
and thereby compounding the many evidentiary errors at trial. The court also did
not make any specific credibility determinations, and many of its "findings"
consist of nothing more than sweeping, conclusory assertions. What is more, the
court simply ignored vast amounts of uncontradicted evidence submitted by
Microsoft, including Microsoft's explanation of why it did not charge separately
for Internet Explorer and Microsoft's detailed description of the many benefits
flowing from the integrated design of Windows that cannot be duplicated by
combining an operating system with a standalone browser like Navigator.

The district court adopted nearly every position advanced by plaintiffs. The
court found that Microsoft possesses monopoly power in the market for "Intel-
compatible PC operating systems" (Findings (P) 33), a putative market that is so
narrow that it excludes both Apple's Mac OS operating system (id. (P)(P) 20-21)
and the competing platform technologies--Navigator and Java--that the court
determined posed the greatest competitive threat to Microsoft's purported
operating system monopoly and that were the crux of plaintiffs' claims of
anticompetitive conduct (id. (P)(P) 68-77).

The court also accepted plaintiffs' position as to the so-called "applications
barrier to entry." (Id. (P) 36.) According to the district court, "[t]he
overwhelming majority of consumers will only use a PC operating system for which
there already exists a large and varied set of high-quality, full-featured
applications." (Id. (P) 30.) Even if a competing operating system "attracted
several thousand compatible applications," the court stated, it "would still
look like a gamble from the consumer's perspective next to Windows, which
supports over 70,000 applications." (Id. (P) 40.) The court concluded that
"[a]lthough Apple's Mac OS supports more than 12,000 applications," including
Microsoft Office, "even an inventory of that magnitude is not sufficient to
enable Apple to present a significant percentage of users with a viable
substitute for Windows." (Id. (P) 47.)

Many of the district court's other findings are clearly erroneous, particularly
those regarding Microsoft's supposed foreclosure of Netscape from specific
channels of distribution. For example, the court found that "Microsoft has
largely succeeded in exiling Navigator from the crucial OEM distribution
channel." (Findings (P) 239.) According to the court, "[b]y the beginning of
January 1999, Navigator was present on the desktop of only a tiny percentage of
the PCs that OEMs were shipping." (Id.) In fact, documents reporting the results
of AOL's due diligence
<PAGE>

investigation prior to acquiring Netscape--elsewhere relied on by the district
court--state that as of 1998 Navigator was distributed on "22% of OEM
shipments." (DX 2440 at 341778.) When confronted with these documents at trial,
plaintiffs' economist, Frank Fisher, acknowledged that Barksdale's testimony
that Microsoft had foreclosed Netscape from the OEM channel was an
"exaggeration." (June 3, 1999 A.M. Tr. at 56-58.) There is thus no credible
evidence to support the district court's finding of foreclosure in the OEM
channel.

Significantly, the district court found that Microsoft had not foreclosed
Netscape from the marketplace as a whole. In particular, the court found that
"Microsoft did not actually prevent users from obtaining and using Navigator"
and that "Netscape could still carpet bomb the population with CD-ROMs and make
Navigator available for downloading." (Findings (P) 357.) The court further
found that "Navigator's installed base has grown even as its usage share has
fallen" (id. (P) 378), demonstrating that Netscape was able not only to get
Navigator into the hands of consumers, but also to get them to use it instead of
Internet Explorer, even though Internet Explorer is included in Windows. In
fact, the court noted that "Navigator's installed base in the United States
alone grew from fifteen million in 1996 to thirty-three million in December
1998" (id.), the very period in which plaintiffs claimed that Microsoft had
foreclosed Netscape from promoting and distributing Navigator. And the court
later found (Conclusions at 38) that Netscape was able to distribute 160 million
copies of Navigator (nearly 1.6 copies for every Web user) in 1998 alone--the
same year in which plaintiffs suggested that a preliminary injunction was
necessary to prevent Microsoft from foreclosing Netscape's distribution.

E. Conclusions of Law

The parties subsequently submitted their proposed conclusions of law. Over
Microsoft's objection, the district court invited Professor Lawrence Lessig, the
same professor whom this Court prevented from acting as special master in the
prior consent decree action, to participate as amicus curiae. In overruling
Microsoft's objection, the court stated that Professor Lessig would "submit his
views exclusively on the issue of technological tying," a subject on which the
court said he was "uniquely qualified to offer advice." (Mem. & Order at 2.) In
his amicus brief, Professor Lessig stated that the district court's "opinion in
the summary judgment stage of this case seemed to indicate" that the standard
articulated by this Court in its June 1998 decision governs the "separate
product" issue, which lies at the heart of the tying claim. (Brief of Lawrence
Lessig at 11.) After discussing this Court's decision, Professor Lessig
concluded that "under the Court of Appeals test, Microsoft must prevail." (Id.
at 17.)

In its conclusions of law entered on April 3, 2000, the court nevertheless
decided that Microsoft violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by unlawfully tying
Internet Explorer to Windows. The court, however, rejected plaintiffs' exclusive
dealing claim, holding that the challenged agreements with various third parties
"did not foreclose enough of the relevant market to constitute a (S) 1
violation." (Conclusions at 39.) The court also determined that Microsoft had
<PAGE>

violated Section 2 by maintaining a monopoly in operating systems and by
attempting to monopolize Web browsing software, despite the fact that
distribution foreclosure is a central premise of both violations in this case.

1. Tying

Having been told by Professor Lessig that Microsoft must prevail under this
Court's test for technological tying, the district court simply refused to apply
that test. (Id. at 26-27.) The court did so even though it recognized that this
Court's decision "sought to guide [the court], insofar as practicable, in the
further proceedings it fully expected to ensue on the tying issue." (Id. at 26.)
The court held that this Court's "undemanding test" is "inconsistent with
pertinent Supreme Court precedents" (id. at 27), namely, Jefferson Parish
Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984), and Eastman Kodak Co. v.
Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451 (1992), even though this Court
carefully considered both cases in its June 1998 decision.

Specifically, the court concluded that this Court's admonition "to refrain from
any product design assessment as to whether the `integration' of Windows and
Internet Explorer is a `net plus'. . . is at odds with the Supreme Court's own
approach," which focuses on whether there is separate consumer demand for the
alleged products. (Conclusions at 29.) "To the extent that the Supreme Court has
spoken authoritatively on these issues," the district court stated, it "is bound
to follow its guidance and is not at liberty to extrapolate a new rule governing
the tying of software products." (Id. at 34.) The district court thus declined
to follow this Court's test in favor of the "consumer-demand" test of Jefferson
Parish and Eastman Kodak, despite the fact that this Court had expressly
rejected the assertion that this "consumer-demand" test should apply to claims
of "technological tying." 147 F.3d at 946-47. In so doing, the court recognized
that its conclusion "is arguably at variance" with this Court's decision, but
asserted that it was obliged to follow this Court's pronouncements only "until
the trail falters." (Conclusions at 26-27.)

2. Exclusive Dealing

The district court dismissed plaintiffs' exclusive-dealing claims under Section
1 because the challenged agreements did not exclude Netscape from the
marketplace:

Microsoft's multiple agreements with distributors did not ultimately deprive
Netscape of the ability to have access to every PC user worldwide to offer an
opportunity to install Navigator. Navigator can be downloaded from the Internet.
It is available through myriad retail channels. It can (and has been) mailed
directly to an unlimited number of households.

(Id. at 38 (emphasis added).) In fact, the court determined that in 1998 alone,
"Netscape was able to distribute 160 million copies of Navigator, contributing
to an increase in its installed base from 15 million in 1996 to 33 million in
December 1998." (Id.) The court concluded that "the evidence does not support a
finding that these agreements completely excluded Netscape from any constituent
portion of the worldwide browser market, the relevant line of commerce." (Id.)

3. Monopoly Maintenance
<PAGE>

Despite finding that Netscape had access "to every PC user worldwide," the court
held that Microsoft had unlawfully maintained a monopoly in operating systems
primarily based on its erroneous conclusion that Microsoft had excluded Netscape
from the OEM and Internet access provider ("IAP") distribution channels. (Id. at
10-17.) The court stated: "The fact that Microsoft's arrangements with various
firms did not foreclose enough of the relevant market to constitute a (S) 1
violation in no way detracts from the Court's assignment of liability for the
same arrangements under (S) 2." (Id. at 39.)

The court concluded that Microsoft's design of Windows 95 and Windows 98 to
include built-in Web browsing functionality and Microsoft's refusal to permit
OEMs to "reconfigure or modify" its copyrighted operating systems to hide access
to that functionality reduced the likelihood that OEMs would preinstall
Navigator on their new computers. (Id. at 11.) The court also found that
"Microsoft adopted similarly aggressive measures to ensure that the IAP channel
would generate browser usage share for Internet Explorer rather than Navigator."
(Id. at 15.) The court held that Microsoft's agreements with Apple, ICPs and
independent software vendors ("ISVs") "supplemented Microsoft's efforts in the
OEM and IAP channels" (id. at 17), and that Microsoft also unfairly "impeded
Java's progress" (id. at 19).

In holding that Microsoft had unlawfully maintained a monopoly, the district
court branded as anticompetitive Microsoft's efforts "to maximize Internet
Explorer's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense" at a time when
Navigator enjoyed a substantial majority of usage share. (Id. at 10.) Indeed,
the notion that Microsoft's desire to increase Internet Explorer's usage share
somehow rendered its conduct anticompetitive was a recurring theme throughout
the court's ruling. The court also concluded that conduct that was not itself
anticompetitive could become unlawful when viewed together with other conduct.
(Id. at 20-21.) "Viewing Microsoft's conduct as a whole," the court stated,
"reinforces the conviction that it was predacious" by demonstrating that
Microsoft induced third parties "to take actions that would help enhance
Internet Explorer's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense." (Id. at 21.)
By condemning vigorous competition by a new entrant into a purported market, the
court evinced a profound misunderstanding of the antitrust laws.

4. Attempted Monopolization

The court's holding that Microsoft attempted to monopolize Web browsing software
cannot be reconciled with its own findings of fact. For example, the court found
that Microsoft's intent was to "demonstrate that Navigator would not become the
standard" Web browsing software at a time when "Navigator seemed well on its way
to becoming the standard." (Findings (P)(P) 133, 377.) Indeed, the court found
that Navigator usage share was "above eighty percent in January 1996." (Id. (P)
360.) Yet, in its conclusions of law, the court determined that Microsoft's
efforts to prevent Netscape from monopolizing Web browsing software established
that Microsoft itself had an unlawful intent to monopolize because "there is no
evidence that Microsoft tried" to prevent its
<PAGE>

efforts "from achieving overkill." (Conclusions at 23.) In so ruling, the court
invoked the negligence standard in resolving the issue of specific intent:

While Microsoft's top executives never expressly declared acquisition of
monopoly power in the browser market to be the objective, they knew, or should
have known, that the tactics they actually employed were likely to push Internet
Explorer's shares to those extreme heights.(Id. at 22 (emphasis added).)

F. The Final Judgment

The district court's April 3, 2000 order accompanying its conclusions of law
stated that it would enter relief "following proceedings to be established by
further Order of the Court." The court thereafter held two chambers conferences
to discuss the procedures to be employed during the remedies phase of the trial.
At those conferences, Microsoft stated that it could not take a position on the
procedures to be followed until it received plaintiffs' request for relief.
(Apr. 4, 2000 Tr. at 14-16, 18; Apr. 5, 2000 Tr. at 7-8.) The court responded
that Microsoft's position was "fair" and "reasonable." (Apr. 4, 2000 Tr. at 15,
18; Apr. 5, 2000 Tr. at 8.) When asked by Microsoft whether it "contemplate[d]
further proceedings of some kind or another" on remedies, the court replied, "I
would assume that there would be further proceedings." (Apr. 4, 2000 Tr. at 8-
9.) The court stated that it might "replicate the procedure at trial with
testimony in written form subject to cross-examination." (Id. at 11.)

Microsoft proposed that it file a "summary response" shortly after receiving
plaintiffs' proposed relief, which "would consist of three things: our
objections to the government's proposal, our counterproposal and our submission
to the court of our position on the procedure that should be employed in
adjudicating the remedy question." (Apr. 5, 2000 Tr. at 6.) The court thereafter
issued Scheduling Order No. 8, which called for Microsoft to submit only a
"summary response" to plaintiffs' proposed relief consisting of the three items
Microsoft had suggested.

On April 28, 2000, plaintiffs filed their proposed final judgment, together with
a supporting memorandum and six declarations. Although such radical relief was
not even hinted at in their complaints, plaintiffs (with the exception of two
States, Illinois and Ohio) requested that Microsoft be broken up into two
separate companies, one that would have Microsoft's operating systems and the
other that would have Microsoft's applications and other products (including
numerous operating system components).

The other provisions of plaintiffs' proposed final judgment were just as extreme
and unwarranted as their breakup proposal. For example, plaintiffs requested
that Microsoft be required to disclose proprietary information about its
operating systems--including source code--to all who claim a desire to make
their products "interoperate effectively" with Microsoft's operating systems, a
group that includes all of Microsoft's competitors. Plaintiffs further requested
that Microsoft be required to redesign all of its existing and future operating
systems to enable OEMs and end users to substitute third-party software for
components of the operating
<PAGE>

system, thus forcing Microsoft to offer new operating system features on an a la
carte basis and severely hindering Microsoft's ability to improve its products.
Moreover, like the breakup proposal, the scope of the injunctive relief
requested by plaintiffs extended far beyond the case that was tried,
encompassing products like Windows CE, Windows 2000 Server and Microsoft Office
that are wholly outside the markets defined by the court.

In accordance with Scheduling Order No. 8, Microsoft filed its own proposed
final judgment, its summary objections to plaintiffs' proposed final judgment
and its recommendations for future proceedings on remedies. Microsoft also filed
a motion for summary rejection of plaintiffs' breakup proposal, arguing that
dismemberment of Microsoft is unwarranted as a matter of law. In its submission
on future proceedings, Microsoft asserted that the nature and scope of the
procedures required depended on the kinds of remedies the court was prepared to
consider; the more extreme the remedies under consideration, the more discovery
and the more time Microsoft would need to prepare for an evidentiary hearing on
relief. Microsoft thus requested that if the court elected not to enter
Microsoft's proposed final judgment, the court should enter a schedule providing
for three to six months in which to conduct discovery and prepare for an
evidentiary hearing, depending on which of three requested categories of relief
the court intended to consider. Such additional proceedings were absolutely
essential in this case because much of the relief requested by plaintiffs
related to highly complex subjects such as Microsoft's addition of Kerberos
support in Windows 2000 that were not even touched on at trial. Indeed, by
filing six declarations with their proposed final judgment, plaintiffs
implicitly acknowledged that the trial record was insufficient to support the
sweeping relief they requested.

Following plaintiffs' submission of a reply in which they urged the district
court to enter their proposed final judgment "forthwith," the court held a
hearing on May 24, 2000. At the outset of that hearing, Microsoft stated its
view that only two matters were before the court: Microsoft's motion for summary
rejection of plaintiffs' breakup proposal and the court's consideration of a
schedule for further proceedings to take evidence relating to plaintiffs'
requested relief. (May 24, 2000 A.M. Tr. at 4.) Notwithstanding the prior
discussions in chambers and the terms of Scheduling Order No. 8, the court again
changed the rules to Microsoft's prejudice, responding, "I intend to proceed to
the merits of the remedy." (Id. at 5.) The court also made clear that it was not
interested in further submissions on remedies. When plaintiffs volunteered to
submit a brief on a particular issue, the court responded, "I don't want any
more briefs." (Id. at 34.)

At the conclusion of the hearing, Microsoft again asked if there would be
further process on the issue of remedies, to which the court responded, "I'm not
contemplating any further process." (May 24, 2000 P.M. Tr. at 33.) Microsoft
then filed an offer of proof summarizing the anticipated testimony of sixteen
individuals whom it would have called as witnesses at an evidentiary hearing on
relief. Microsoft also stressed that if given an opportunity, it would have
developed testimony
<PAGE>

from additional witnesses about the extreme adverse effects of plaintiffs'
proposed final judgment. (Id. at 35-36.)

On May 26, 2000, plaintiffs submitted a revised proposed final judgment that
made minor modifications to their initial proposal. Plaintiffs again urged the
court to enter their proposed relief without any further proceedings. On May 31,
2000, Microsoft submitted objections to the form of plaintiffs' proposed decree,
together with a supplemental offer of proof identifying seven additional
witnesses whom Microsoft would have called at an evidentiary hearing. Plaintiffs
responded to Microsoft's objections on June 5, 2000, agreeing to make only a few
cosmetic changes to their proposed decree and rejecting all of the
clarifications to the decree that they themselves had proffered in prior
filings. Microsoft submitted a reply on June 6, 2000.

On June 7, 2000, the district court signed plaintiffs' proposed final judgment
as ultimately proffered without a single substantive change. The court thus
entered radical and unwarranted permanent injunctive relief in these actions
without granting Microsoft leave to conduct discovery and without making
findings of fact or creating an evidentiary record on the issue of remedies. In
ordering the breakup of Microsoft--which, until the court entered its findings
of fact, had the largest market capitalization in the world--the court did not
even grant Microsoft leave to depose the six individuals who submitted
declarations in support of plaintiffs' proposed remedies.

Together with its final judgment, the district court issued a remarkable six-
page memorandum that purports to explain the basis for its entry of the sweeping
relief requested by plaintiffs. The memorandum is bereft of even a single
citation to case law or evidence. According to the court, "a structural remedy
has become imperative" because "Microsoft does not yet concede that any of its
business practices violated the Sherman Act." (Mem. & Order at 3.) Despite the
court's criticism of Microsoft for being "unwilling to accept the notion that it
broke the law" (id.), it should go without saying that Microsoft's exercise of
its appellate rights provides no conceivable basis for imposing punitive
sanctions.

Rather than finding that the judgment would increase competition, the court
remarked that even "purportedly knowledgeable people" do not know what "may or
may not ensue," and the court dismissed the notion of having an evidentiary
hearing to explore that question because "testimonial predictions of future
events" are "less reliable even than testimony as to historical fact." (Id. at
4.) In an astounding abdication of the judicial function, the court offered the
following reason for its entry of the final judgment served up by plaintiffs:

Plaintiffs won the case, and for that reason alone have some entitlement to a
remedy of their choice. Moreover, plaintiffs' proposed final judgment is the
collective work product of senior antitrust law enforcement officials of the
United States Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of 19 states, in
conjunction with multiple consultants. These officials are by reason of office
obliged and expected to consider--and act in--the public interest; Microsoft is
not. (Id. at 5 (footnote omitted).)
<PAGE>

The court was even more blunt in the many press interviews it gave about the
case, both before and after entry of final judgment. For instance, the Wall
Street Journal quoted the court as giving the following explanation for its
refusal to provide Microsoft with any process before entering relief: "[I]t's
procedurally unusual to do what Microsoft is proposing--are you aware of very
many cases in which the defendant can argue with the jury about what an
appropriate sanction should be? Were the Japanese allowed to propose the terms
of their surrender? The government won the case." John R. Wilke, For Antitrust
Judge, Trust, or Lack of It, Really Was the Issue, Wall St. J., June 8, 2000, at
A1. And the Washington Post quoted the following explanation for why the court
adopted plaintiffs' proposed relief without modification: "I am not an
economist. I do not have the resources of economic research or any significant
ability to be able to craft a remedy of my own devising." James V. Grimaldi,
Reluctant Ruling for Judge, Wash. Post, June 8, 2000, at A1.

Perhaps most shocking, however, are the remarks attributed to the court in an
article in The New York Times. When asked about the possibility of a breakup of
Microsoft during a February 2000 interview--which was described as "a rare
audience with a sitting judge during the course of a trial"--the court is quoted
as saying, "I am not sure I am competent to do that." Joel Brinkley & Steve
Lohr, Retracing the Missteps in the Microsoft Defense, N.Y. Times, June 9, 2000,
at A1. The court apparently echoed that sentiment in a later interview. When
asked why it had simply rubberstamped plaintiffs' draconian remedies, the court
is quoted as responding, "I am not in a position to duplicate that and re-
engineer their work. There's no way I can equip myself to do a better job than
they have done." Id. at C9. Lastly, in a repudiation of the most fundamental
tenet of American jurisprudence, the court is quoted as offering the following
explanation for its rejection of Microsoft's pleas for an evidentiary hearing on
relief, "I am not aware of any case authority that says I have to give them any
due process at all. The case is over. They lost." Id. at C8.

                                   ARGUMENT

In determining whether a stay pending appeal is warranted, courts consider four
factors: (i) the likelihood that the moving party will prevail on the merits,
(ii) the prospect of irreparable injury to the moving party absent a stay, (iii)
the possibility of harm to other parties if a stay is granted, and (iv) the
public interest in granting the stay. See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770,
776 (1987); see also D.C. Cir. R. 8(a)(1). If the arguments for one factor are
particularly strong, a stay may issue even if the arguments for other factors
are less so. See CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d
738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Hence, "[a] stay may be granted with either a high
probability of success and some injury, or vice versa." Cuomo v. United States
Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 772 F.2d 972, 974 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam).
Here, all four factors strongly support issuance of a stay pending appeal.

I. Microsoft Will Prevail on the Merits.
<PAGE>

As the preceding discussion makes clear, the proceedings below went badly awry
from the outset. The district court's many serious substantive and procedural
errors are fatal to its conclusion that Microsoft violated the antitrust laws
and to the relief entered. Before listing some of the district court's more
egregious errors, two general observations illustrate how misguided the decision
below is.

First, the court's ruling condemns Microsoft's efforts to add support for
Internet standards like HTML and HTTP to Windows in order to make the operating
system relevant in the Internet era. The court found that "consumers in 1995
were already demanding software that enabled them to use the Web with ease,"
that "IBM had announced in September 1994 its plan to include browsing
capability in OS/2 Warp [the principal challenger to Windows at the time] at no
extra charge," and that "Microsoft had reason to believe that other operating-
system vendors would do the same." (Findings (P) 140.) In such circumstances,
adding Internet support to Windows cannot violate the antitrust laws, no matter
what Microsoft's "intent" was in doing so. Indeed, Microsoft's addition of such
functionality to Windows was but a single instance of a pervasive practice in
high-technology industries--the improvement of a product through the integration
of new functionality previously provided by separate products. See 147 F.3d at
951.

To hold that efforts to improve a product in response to consumer demand and
competitive pressures and to distribute those improvements broadly to consumers
violate the antitrust laws is to turn those laws on their head. The record here
demonstrates that Microsoft's inclusion of Internet support in Windows made it
easier for thousands of software developers to write Internet-enabled
applications that rely on platform services provided by the Internet Explorer
components of the operating system and for millions of consumers to access the
Internet. Even the district court recognized that Microsoft's "inclusion of
Internet Explorer with Windows at no separate charge increased general
familiarity with the Internet and reduced the cost to the public of gaining
access to it." (Findings (P) 408.)

At the same time, Microsoft did nothing to exclude Netscape from the
marketplace. There is no claim that Navigator is incompatible with either
Windows 95 or Windows 98; to the contrary, Netscape's Barksdale testified that
Navigator is "perfectly interoperable" with Windows. (Oct. 22, 1998 P.M. Tr. at
51-52.) The court also found that Netscape had "access to every PC user
worldwide," distributing 160 million copies of Navigator in 1998 alone and
increasing its user base from 15 million to 33 million between 1996 and 1998.
(Conclusions at 38.) Absent a showing of actual exclusion--precluded by these
undisputed facts--no antitrust issue is even presented.

Second, accepting, arguendo, plaintiffs' theory of the case, there is no
antitrust violation. Plaintiffs' theory was that Microsoft attempted to impede
the distribution of Navigator because it threatened to reduce (through a long,
speculative and unproven chain of causation) the hypothesized "applications
barrier to entry" into the market for "Intel-compatible PC operating systems."
There is no dispute, however, that Microsoft entered the alleged market for Web
<PAGE>

browsing software at a time when Netscape was dominant. It is also undisputed
that Microsoft's efforts to develop, promote and distribute Internet Explorer
resulted in lower prices, greater innovation and increased distribution of Web
browsing software. In fact, the district court found that Microsoft's actions
"contributed to improving the quality of Web browsing software, lowering its
cost, and increasing its availability, thereby benefiting consumers." (Findings
(P) 408.) Unambiguously procompetitive conduct in one supposed market does not
become an antitrust violation simply because that conduct allegedly had
collateral effects in another supposed market. As Areeda and Hovenkamp have
observed:

[A]ggressive but non-predatory pricing, higher output, improved product quality,
energetic market penetration, successful research and development, cost-reducing
innovations, and the like are welcomed by the Sherman Act. They are therefore
not to be considered "exclusionary" for (S) 2 purposes even though they tend to
exclude rivals and may even create monopoly.

III Phillip E. Areeda & Hebert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (P) 651b, at 76 (1996).

In holding that Microsoft violated the antitrust laws by improving Windows and
distributing broadly the operating system's Internet Explorer technologies, the
district court committed many serious legal errors, several of which are
summarized below:

     .    The district court erroneously held that Microsoft's inclusion of
          Internet support in Windows 95 and Windows 98 constituted an unlawful
          tie. In upholding plaintiffs' "technological tying" claim, the trial
          court became the first court ever to sustain such a challenge to a
          single, integrated product. As this Court observed, "courts have
          recognized the limits of their institutional competence and have on
          that ground rejected theories of `technological tying.'" 147 F.3d at
          949. Similarly, in entering relief that intrudes broadly on
          Microsoft's product design decisions based on the purported tying
          violation, the district court disregarded this Court's warning about
          the "undesirability of having courts oversee product design." Id. at
          948. The district court was able to reach this unprecedented result
          only by refusing to apply the test articulated by this Court in the
          consent decree case and by other courts in cases involving
          "technological tying" claims. As the court's handpicked amicus curiae
          stated, under this Court's test, "Microsoft must prevail." (Brief of
          Lawrence Lessig at 17.) By instead applying a consumer-demand test,
          the court adopted a standard that would essentially freeze product
          development. As this Court explained, focusing on consumer demand
          "seems sure to thwart Microsoft's legitimate desire to continue to
          integrate products that had been separate--and hence necessarily would
          have been provided in distinct markets." 147 F.3d at 953.

     .    The district court erroneously held that agreements with distributors
          that did not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act because they did not
          foreclose Netscape's access to consumers could nevertheless violate
          Section 2. The court concluded that "[t]he fact that Microsoft's
          arrangements with various firms did not foreclose enough of the
          relevant market to constitute a (S) 1 violation in no way detracts
          from the Court's assignment of liability for the same arrangements
          under (S) 2." (Conclusions at 39.) That conclusion is contrary to
          settled law. E.g., Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d
          227, 236-38 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.). An act is anticompetitive
          under Section 2 only if it has a significant exclusionary impact. U.S.
          Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsources, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 597-98 (1st
          Cir. 1993). Agreements that do not substantially foreclose competitors
          from the marketplace do not have such an exclusionary impact.

     .    The district court erroneously held that the provisions in Microsoft's
          license agreements with OEMs that do not permit OEMs to modify
          Microsoft's copyrighted operating systems without Microsoft's
          permission violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act by foreclosing
          distribution of Navigator. In refusing to grant OEMs a broad license
          to modify Windows by removing or hiding features of the operating
          system, Microsoft has simply exercised rights granted to it by federal
<PAGE>

          copyright law. As the holder of valid copyrights, Microsoft is
          entitled to require its distributors--including OEMs--to deliver
          Windows to users as Microsoft created it. See WGN Continental Broad.
          Co. v. United Video, Inc., 693 F.2d 622, 625 (7th Cir. 1982) (Posner,
          J.); Gilliam v. ABC, 538 F.2d 14, 21, 23 (2d Cir. 1976). Because the
          challenged provisions of Microsoft's OEM license agreements simply
          restate, and do not enlarge upon, Microsoft's rights under federal
          copyright and trademark law, they do not violate the antitrust laws.
          See Intergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp., 195 F.3d 1346, 1362 (Fed. Cir.
          1999); In re Indep. Serv. Orgs. Antitrust Litig., 989 F. Supp. 1131,
          1134 (D. Kan. 1997), aff'd, 203 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In any
          event, the court found that "Microsoft's license agreements have never
          prohibited OEMs from pre-installing programs, including Navigator, on
          their PCs and placing icons and entries for those programs on the
          Windows desktop and in the `Start' menu." (Findings (P) 217.)

     .    The district court erroneously held that Microsoft possesses monopoly
          power in a relevant product market. The market defined by the court is
          too narrow because it excludes the most serious threats faced by
          Microsoft's operating systems, including the competing platform
          technologies that were the objects of the allegedly anticompetitive
          conduct in this case. In addition, the court did not find that
          Microsoft has the power unilaterally to raise prices in or exclude
          competition from the operating system business, the touchstone of
          monopoly power. See, e.g., Indiana Grocery, Inc. v. Super Valu Stores,
          Inc., 864 F.2d 1409, 1414 (7th Cir. 1989); Ball Mem'l Hosp., Inc. v.
          Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1335 (7th Cir. 1986). In fact,
          the court found that the evidence was insufficient to establish that
          Microsoft ever charged a "monopoly price" for Windows. (See Findings
          (P) 65.)

     .    The district court erroneously held that Microsoft maintained a
          monopoly through anticompetitive conduct. The general theme running
          through the court's ruling is that Microsoft "set out to maximize
          Internet Explorer's share of browser usage at Netscape's expense."
          (Conclusions at 10.) That says nothing about whether Microsoft engaged
          in anticompetitive conduct because "[t]he intent to preserve or expand
          one's market share is presumptively lawful." MCI v. AT&T, 708 F.2d
          1081, 1113 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891 (1983). The district
          court's condemnation of Microsoft's conduct was all the more misguided
          given that Microsoft was a new entrant into a line of business
          dominated by Netscape. Under these circumstances, efforts to maximize
          Microsoft's share at the expense of Netscape were procompetitive.
          Indeed, the court found that "[t]he debut of Internet Explorer and its
          rapid improvement gave Netscape an incentive to improve Navigator's
          quality at a competitive rate." (Findings (P) 408.)

     .    The district court erroneously held that Microsoft unlawfully
          maintained a monopoly even though plaintiffs failed to establish the
          requisite causal connection between the alleged anticompetitive
          conduct and Microsoft's maintenance of a purported monopoly in
          operating systems. "To find that a monopolist's acts may improperly
          impair rivals' opportunities does not say how substantial a
          contribution that act has made or may make to achieving or maintaining
          the monopoly." III Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra (P) 651c, at 77. An
          antitrust plaintiff "has the burden of pleading, introducing evidence,
          and presumably proving by a preponderance of the evidence that
          [anticompetitive] behavior has contributed significantly to the
          achievement or maintenance of the monopoly." Id. (P) 650c, at 69. The
          district court found that "[t]here is insufficient evidence to find
          that, absent Microsoft's actions, Navigator and Java already would
          have ignited genuine competition in the market for Intel-compatible PC
          operating systems." (Findings (P) 411.) That finding is fatal to
          plaintiffs' monopoly maintenance claim.

     .    The district court erroneously held that acts that are not
          anticompetitive under controlling legal principles can somehow become
          illegal when viewed in combination with other acts that are not
          anticompetitive. Relying on Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &
          Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690 (1962), the court ruled that conduct that
          does not "independently satisfy the second element of a (S) 2 monopoly
          maintenance claim" can become anticompetitive when viewed together
          with other conduct. (Conclusions at 20.) In Intergraph, the Federal
          Circuit recently rejected just such a reading of Continental Ore. 195
          F.3d at 1366-67. Contrary to the district court's ruling, "once a
          claim is found to be without merit, such a claim cannot be used as a
          basis for finding other claims to constitute a violation of the
          antitrust laws." Southern Pac. Communications Co. v. AT&T, 556 F.
          Supp. 825, 888 n.69 (D.D.C. 1983), aff'd, 740 F.2d 980 (D.C. Cir.
          1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1005 (1985). Courts have "reject[ed] the
          notion that if there is a fraction of validity to each of the basic
          claims and the sum of the fractions is one or more, the plaintiffs
          have proved a violation of
<PAGE>

          section 1 or section 2 of the Sherman Act." City of Groton v.
          Connecticut Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921, 928-29 (2d Cir. 1981).

     .    The district court erroneously held that Microsoft possessed a
          specific intent to monopolize Web browsing software. In upholding
          plaintiffs' attempted monopolization claim, the court stated that
          Microsoft attempted to "expand[] Internet Explorer's share of browser
          usage--and simultaneously depress[] Navigator's share--to an extent
          sufficient to demonstrate to developers that Navigator would never
          emerge as the standard software employed to browse the Web."
          (Conclusions at 22-23.) That conclusion is patently insufficient to
          establish a specific intent to monopolize. "[S]pecific intent in this
          context refers to a purpose to acquire monopoly power by driving one's
          rival from the market by exclusionary or predatory means." Association
          for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women v. NCAA, 735 F.2d 577, 585
          (D.C. Cir. 1984). At most, Microsoft intended to compete vigorously
          with Netscape to prevent Navigator from achieving a dominant position
          in the eyes of developers. The antitrust laws encourage, rather than
          proscribe, such an intent. Ball Mem'l Hosp., 784 F.2d at 1338-39.

     .    The district court erroneously held that Microsoft's discussions with
          Netscape in June 1995--when Microsoft allegedly presented a "market
          allocation proposal"--established a dangerous probability of
          monopolization, relying on United States v. American Airlines, Inc.,
          743 F.2d 1114 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1001 (1985).
          (Conclusions at 24.). Even plaintiffs' witness Barksdale suggested
          that whatever proposal Microsoft made in June 1995 was vague and in
          futuro (Oct. 27, 1998 P.M. Tr. at 69-71), and there is no dispute that
          Netscape rejected Microsoft's alleged proposal (see, e.g., Findings
          (P)(P) 86-87). Moreover, the June 1995 discussions related to
          collaboration in the development of new products--a necessary and
          usually procompetitive activity--not price fixing. Indeed, Microsoft
          was not even a participant in the purported "Internet browser market"
          until it released Windows 95 in August 1995. The facts surrounding
          Microsoft's June 1995 discussions with Netscape are thus a far cry
          from those at issue in American Airlines, which the court described as
          "uniquely unequivocal" and "uniquely consequential." 743 F.2d at 1119.

     .    The district court erroneously imposed extreme and punitive relief
          unrelated to the violations found in this case. It is well-settled
          that "[c]ourts are not authorized in civil proceedings to punish
          antitrust violators" and that relief "must not be punitive." United
          States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 326 (1961).
          Structural remedies are "not to be used indiscriminately, without
          regard to the type of violation or whether other effective methods,
          less harsh, are available." Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United
          States, 341 U.S. 593, 603-04 (1951) (Reed, J., concurring). The
          draconian relief imposed by the court--which includes, but is not
          limited to, the only breakup of a unitary company ever ordered under
          Section 2 outside the context of negotiated consent decrees--bears no
          relation whatsoever to the antitrust violations found. What is more,
          the relief ordered is punitive in concept and effect, extending to
          products and markets far removed from those in issue at trial, and
          thus is unwarranted as a matter of law. See United States v. National
          Lead Co., 332 U.S. 319, 351-53 (1947).

     .    The district court erroneously entered a sweeping permanent
          injunction, including a breakup of Microsoft, over Microsoft's
          strenuous objection, without conducting an evidentiary hearing on
          relief or affording Microsoft an opportunity to present evidence. The
          only basis proffered by plaintiffs in support of the relief ultimately
          entered were six hearsay declarations untested by cross-examination.
          Such a "record" cannot provide a basis for awarding permanent
          injunctive relief. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a). Nor did the district
          court make corresponding findings of fact and conclusions of law
          regarding the terms of the decree. In sum, there was no competent
          adjudication of relief, which by itself requires that the judgment be
          vacated.

In light of the numerous legal errors and procedural irregularities that
pervaded the proceedings below, it is inconceivable that the judgment will
withstand appellate review. This is reason alone to stay the judgment pending
appeal.

II. Microsoft Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay.

Although the district court's judgment provides that the actual dismemberment of
Microsoft is stayed pending appeal, the judgment's other extreme provisions take
effect 90 days after entry.
<PAGE>

Absent a stay, those provisions will inflict massive and irreparable injury on
Microsoft, possibly resulting in the company's demise as an effective competitor
in the software industry. Indeed, the court itself recognized in its June 7,
2000 memorandum that absent appellate intervention, the relief entered will
quickly become "irreversible as a practical matter." (Mem. & Order at 3.)

The non-breakup provisions of the judgment reflect three primary objectives,
none of which is warranted by the violations found by the court and none of
which serves a legitimate purpose under the antitrust laws. First, the judgment
reflects a profound hostility to Microsoft's efforts to improve Windows by
adding new features and functionality. The judgment treats Windows not as a
single product, but rather as a combination of (i) software that fits
plaintiffs' narrow (and static) definition of an "operating system" and (ii) an
indeterminate set of separate technologies (dubbed "middleware products") that
OEMs may elect to turn on or off, or delete altogether, as they choose. By
prohibiting Microsoft from maintaining the consistency of Windows as a platform
for software development, the judgment will destroy the principal value of a
product that Microsoft has spent billions of dollars developing and that has
played a major role in the personal computer revolution. Second, for the
proffered purpose of promoting "interoperability," the judgment will effect a
confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property in its operating systems by
requiring disclosure of proprietary information--an extreme remedy that is
unrelated to any of the claims alleged in the complaints and that applies to
products that were not even part of this case. Third, the judgment will
effectively compel Microsoft to treat all OEMs and ISVs, among others, exactly
the same in all respects, whether or not such third parties have the capability
or desire to work closely with Microsoft. This will make it virtually impossible
for Microsoft to continue to collaborate with a broad array of OEMs and ISVs to
develop and market innovative new technologies.

Some examples of the serious injury that will befall Microsoft if a stay is not
granted are discussed below.

     .    The judgment will require Microsoft to disclose large amounts of
          proprietary information about its operating systems and other products
          to competitors, the ultimate penalty for a company whose business is
          based entirely on intellectual property. Paragraph 3.b of the judgment
          will require Microsoft to disclose the internals of important products
          to all software developers, hardware vendors and OEMs, a group that
          includes literally everyone in the computer industry. Even worse,
          paragraph 3.b will require Microsoft to permit anyone in the industry,
          including all of Microsoft's competitors, "to study, interrogate and
          interact" with the source code for Microsoft's operating systems,
          which are replete with valuable trade secrets and constitute
          Microsoft's "crown jewels." Although the judgment purports to limit
          the purpose of such source code access to development of products that
          "interoperate effectively" with Windows, that restriction is
          hopelessly vague and thus would be impossible to enforce. In short,
          the judgment will require Microsoft to disclose much of its
          intellectual property--the lifeblood of the company--without
          compensation, thereby undermining Microsoft's incentive to innovate.
          Once that intellectual property is disclosed, the loss will be
          irretrievable. FMC Corp. v. Taiwan Tainan Giant Indus. Co., 730 F.2d
          61, 63 (2d Cir. 1984) ("A trade secret once lost is, of course, lost
          forever.").

     .    The judgment will result in a direct and immediate intrusion into
          Microsoft's product design decisions. For instance, paragraph 3.g will
          prohibit Microsoft from adding most new features (not just Web
          browsing functionality) to its operating systems unless it provides
          OEMs and end users with a means of removing end user access to those
          new features. The judgment thus essentially
<PAGE>

          draws a line around Windows, preventing its evolution as a software
          development platform. The judgment also ignores this Court's
          admonition about the "undesirability of having courts oversee product
          design" 147 F.3d at 948, as well as its statement that "by allowing
          OEMs to conceal IE, rather than refuse it, the remedy fits poorly with
          the Department's tying theory," id. at 941 n.3. The effect of this
          interference with Microsoft's development of new products during the
          pendency of an appeal will be irremediable even if Microsoft prevails.

     .    The judgment will result in fragmentation of the Windows platform. A
          primary benefit of Windows is that it provides a consistent platform
          for software developers and users. The net result of paragraphs
          3.a.iii(4), 3.f and 3.g will be to undermine the integrity of Windows
          as a platform so that neither software developers nor end users can
          rely on crucial functionality being present. For example, paragraph
          3.f will require Microsoft to permit OEMs to remove software code from
          Windows if Microsoft also distributes that code separately from the
          operating system through various enumerated channels, a routine
          practice in the software industry. If software code that comprises
          Windows is not present on a machine because the OEM removed it, then
          applications that rely on that software code will not function
          properly or at all.

     .    The judgment will require Microsoft to relinquish its rights under
          federal trademark and copyright laws. Paragraph 3.a.iii(4) will
          require Microsoft to permit OEMs to substitute third-party software
          for components of Microsoft's copyrighted Windows operating systems.
          Not only will Microsoft be compelled to allow OEMs to create
          derivative works of Windows; the judgment also will permit OEMs to
          market their modified versions of the operating system using
          Microsoft's trademarks and logos--denying Microsoft the ability to
          control what is marketed to customers under the valuable Windows
          trademark. The damage to Microsoft's copyright and trademark rights
          will not be curable even if Microsoft prevails on this appeal.

     .    The judgment will prevent Microsoft from releasing new and innovative
          operating systems in a timely manner, and may require Microsoft to
          halt distribution of its currently shipping operating systems.
          Paragraph 3.g will prohibit Microsoft from "distribut[ing]" any
          operating system that does not comply with various amorphous design
          specifications six months after the effective date of the judgment.
          This provision thus will require Microsoft to reengineer all of its
          currently shipping operating systems (including Windows 98 and Windows
          2000 Professional), as well as soon-to-be-released operating systems
          like Windows Millenium. It could take several years for Microsoft to
          redesign those products to remove all cross-dependencies among
          components that fall within the judgment's vague and open-ended
          definition of "middleware," depending on how that term is construed.
          As a result, Microsoft will be unable to release Windows Millenium
          later this year as scheduled, and it may have to halt distribution of
          its currently shipping operating systems six months after the judgment
          becomes effective. Plaintiffs' only response to this serious concern
          is to note that "Microsoft will have nine months from entry of the
          Final Judgment to prepare the modified version[s]" of its operating
          systems required by paragraph 3.g. (Pls.' Response to MS Comments at
          18.) More fundamentally, requiring Microsoft to devote the lion's
          share of its development resources to reengineering its existing
          products--which Microsoft will need to begin doing immediately absent
          a stay--will greatly delay Microsoft's release of many other new
          products.

     .    The judgment will require Microsoft to modify its existing license
          agreements with the top 20 OEMs, wreaking havoc with Microsoft's
          relationships with those companies. Paragraph 3.a.ii compels Microsoft
          to license Windows to those OEMs "pursuant to uniform license
          agreements with uniform terms and conditions." Because that paragraph
          also prohibits Microsoft from enforcing any license provision
          inconsistent with the judgment, Microsoft will be required to
          renegotiate existing license agreements with those OEMs within 90 days
          of entry of the judgment--although why any of them would agree to
          forego the benefits of their existing contracts is unclear.

     .    The judgment will make it virtually impossible for Microsoft to work
          with and assist software developers and hardware vendors seeking to
          create products for use with Windows. Paragraph 3.d.i provides that
          Microsoft shall not take "any action affecting" any software developer
          or hardware vendor "based directly or indirectly, in whole or in part,
          on any actual or contemplated action" by such party to "use,
          distribute, promote, or support any Microsoft product." Such
          regulation of Microsoft's relationships with software developers and
          hardware vendors will block
<PAGE>

          the sort of collaboration that has facilitated the creation of large
          numbers of products compatible with Windows.

     .    The judgment will prevent Microsoft from entering into routine cross-
          promotional and joint development agreements, even plainly
          procompetitive ones. Given the judgment's broad definitions of terms
          such as "platform software" and "middleware," paragraph 3.e will
          forbid Microsoft from entering into any agreement that in any way
          limits a third party's development, distribution, promotion or use of
          any non-Microsoft software. Similarly, paragraph 3.h will proscribe
          routine interactions with other software developers. Plaintiffs' only
          response to these concerns is that they "intend to enforce the
          provision only against anticompetitive agreements." (Pls.' Response to
          MS Comments at 19.) The scope of an injunction cannot be based on the
          purported intentions of the party charged with enforcing it.

     .    The judgment will require Microsoft to submit a "proposed plan of
          divestiture" not later than four months after its entry. Requiring
          Microsoft to submit such a plan will cause a huge diversion of effort
          by Microsoft's executives at a critical time when Microsoft is
          attempting to change its entire business and programming model to
          remain competitive in the Internet age. This diversion (and the
          adverse effect on employee morale when the plan is submitted) will be
          entirely pointless even in the event that the decreed breakup is
          affirmed--given the lightening pace of change in the software
          industry, any "proposed plan of divestiture" created four months after
          entry of judgment will be out of date when it comes time actually to
          implement the plan.

     .    The judgment will require Microsoft to freeze its internal
          organization. Paragraph 1.d.i compels Microsoft to "preserve,
          maintain, and operate the Operating System Business and the
          Applications Business as separate . . . as they were on April 27,
          2000." This requirement will make it difficult for Microsoft to adapt
          its organization to the ever-changing needs of its business.
          Reorganizations to realign product units across the imaginary boundary
          decreed in the judgment have been a routine part of Microsoft's
          business and are essential to ensure that needed resources are brought
          to bear on the competitive challenges faced by the company. Freezing
          Microsoft's internal organization will result in stagnation, with
          fewer products being brought to market.

In sum, compliance with the terms of the judgment, which touch upon virtually
every aspect of Microsoft's business, will be impossible despite Microsoft's
best efforts. The provisions of paragraph 3, read in conjunction with the
definitions of the numerous defined terms (many of which are contrary to normal
industry usage), are hopelessly vague and ambiguous. Moreover, the distraction
that inevitably will flow from efforts to comply with the judgment will damage
Microsoft's most important asset--its ability to recruit, retain and motivate
creative people. As an intellectual property firm, Microsoft's entire business
depends on that asset. The judgment also will prevent Microsoft from working
closely with other companies in the industry to deliver innovative computing
solutions unless Microsoft is willing to work with all companies--including its
competitors--on identical terms. Simply stated, Microsoft cannot operate its
business under the terms of the judgment.

III. No Other Parties Will Be Harmed by a Stay.

No other parties interested in the proceeding will be harmed if the Court grants
a stay, much less suffer injury that would outweigh the serious and irreparable
injury Microsoft will suffer absent a stay. Plaintiffs cannot claim that they
themselves will be harmed in any respect by a stay. Nor can they contend that
other interested parties--i.e., the Microsoft competitors that convinced them to
bring this lawsuit and seek draconian structural relief--will be injured in any
legal sense if relief in these actions is stayed pending appeal.
<PAGE>

Nothing in the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law suggests
that any other party will suffer immediate, tangible harm if the relief in these
actions is stayed pending appeal. The vague "consumer harm" identified in the
court's findings consists primarily of speculation about unspecified innovations
that might have come to market and competition that might have existed but for
Microsoft's alleged conduct. (Findings (P)(P) 411-12.) Yet, the court determined
that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that, absent Microsoft actions,
greater operating system competition would exist today. (See, e.g., id. (P)
411.) Similarly, the antitrust violations found by the court focus primarily on
Microsoft's alleged efforts to restrict Netscape's access to the OEM and IAP
channels of distribution over a very limited period of time. (Conclusions at 10-
18.) But the court also found that Netscape was--and is--able to distribute
Navigator broadly through other channels of distribution to "every PC user
worldwide" (id. at 38), and many of the agreements challenged by plaintiffs have
since expired and are not being renewed by Microsoft (Findings (P)(P) 269, 331).
There is thus no basis in the district court's ruling to suggest that another
party will go out of business or suffer some other irreparable injury unless the
relief entered in these actions takes effect immediately.

In contrast to the vague and speculative harm to consumers and competitors
discussed in the court's findings, if the judgment is not stayed, Microsoft, its
employees, its shareholders, its business partners and customers and the
consuming public will suffer certain, definite and immediate harm. That harm
clearly outweighs any speculative injury that others with an interest in the
proceedings might suffer if a stay is granted.

IV. The Public Interest Weighs Strongly in Favor of a Stay.

The public interest requires a stay of the judgment pending appeal. The
devastating effects of the judgment will not be felt by Microsoft and its
employees and shareholders alone. Tens of thousands of computer manufacturers,
software developers, system integrators and resellers that have built their
entire businesses on Windows, as well as the millions of consumers who use
Microsoft's products, will also suffer grievous injury absent a stay. Indeed,
the entire United States economy may suffer if Microsoft is irreparably injured
while it prosecutes this appeal. Some, but by no means all, of the ways in which
the public will suffer absent a stay of the judgment pending appeal are
described below.

     .    The public will suffer serious and far-reaching harm if the Windows
          platform begins to fragment. Millions of computer users and thousands
          of software developers depend on the consistency and stability of the
          Windows platform. Paragraphs 3.a.iii, 3.f and 3.g.i of the judgment
          threaten to destroy the consistency and stability of Windows by giving
          OEMs broad latitude to modify the operating system and yet market
          their modified versions using the Windows logo and trademark. If the
          Windows platform begins to fragment due to these modifications,
          applications designed to run on Windows will no longer work on some or
          all versions of the operating system, imposing significant costs on
          both software developers and consumers.

     .    The public will suffer irreparable harm if Microsoft cannot develop
          and release new products in a timely manner. Requiring Microsoft to
          devote vast resources to redesigning its existing operating systems
          and otherwise attempting to comply with the provisions of the judgment
          will greatly retard Microsoft's ability to develop innovative products
          like the "Pocket PC," the "Tablet PC,"
<PAGE>

          the "E-book" reader and the "X-Box" game console. That distraction
          also will impair Microsoft's ability to pursue its major initiative
          for the next competitive era--Next Generation Windows Services. To be
          sure, Microsoft's competitors will benefit if Microsoft's ability to
          innovate is impeded and its intellectual property is disclosed, but
          consumers and the economy will not. In addition, Microsoft is
          scheduled to release its latest consumer operating system, Windows
          Millenium, later this year. OEMs, software developers and retailers
          are already counting on this release to help stimulate demand for
          their products in the critical Christmas season. If Microsoft is
          required to redesign Windows Millenium in accordance with the
          judgment, the release of that product will be delayed for many months.

     .    The public will suffer severe adverse consequences if Microsoft is
          required to halt distribution of Windows six months after the judgment
          becomes effective. Despite plaintiffs' unfounded assurances to the
          contrary, Microsoft cannot redesign all of its existing operating
          systems such as Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 2000 Professional
          in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 3.g.i in the six-
          month period provided. If Microsoft were forced to halt distribution
          of those operating systems, the worldwide personal computer industry
          would be paralyzed, causing severe economic dislocation.

     .    Innovation by software developers, hardware vendors and OEMs will be
          reduced if the judgment takes effect. Paragraphs 3.a and 3.d seek to
          regulate Microsoft's relationships with companies creating products
          that are compatible with Windows. By preventing Microsoft from
          providing information to any software developer, hardware vendor or
          OEM unless Microsoft provides the same information to everyone else in
          the industry, including companies creating products for competing
          operating systems, the judgment will limit the amount and kind of
          information that Microsoft can provide to companies with the resources
          and motivation to work closely with Microsoft on joint development
          projects. The judgment thus will block the sort of cooperative efforts
          that provide major benefits to consumers by producing a wide range of
          new technologies.

There can be no doubt that the public interest weighs heavily in favor of a
stay. Even plaintiffs admit that the judgment will have profound and uncertain
effects on the high-technology sector of the United States economy. There is no
reason to subject the Nation's economic well being to such risks before this
Court has had an opportunity to review the fatally flawed decision below.

                                  CONCLUSION

The judgment is the culmination of a proceeding permeated by serious substantive
and procedural errors, and it imposes harsh and unsustainable burdens on
Microsoft, the software industry and the public. The Court should stay the
judgment in its entirety pending this appeal.
Respectfully submitted,

Microsoft Files Notice of Appeal and
Motion for Stay

Appeal Will Point Out "Serious Substantive and Procedural Errors"; Company Asks
Court of Appeals to Stay Remedies While Appeal Is Pending

REDMOND, Wash. -- June 13, 2000 -- Microsoft Corp. today filed its notice of
appeal and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to stay all provisions of the U. S.
District Court's June 7, 2000, final judgment pending resolution of the appeal
process.

"Microsoft is looking forward to the next phase of this case, and we are
optimistic that the appellate courts will reverse the recent ruling," said Steve
Ballmer, Microsoft president and CEO. "Obviously, we will comply with any final
order in this case, but we believe this judgment is both wrong and unfair. We
believe the appellate courts will recognize that Microsoft's product innovation
is the heart and soul of competition in the high-tech industry."

The company filed a 39-page brief seeking a stay of the June 7 ruling. The
company will file a more detailed brief on the merits of its appeal in the
future, based on a schedule established by the court.

In Wednesday's filing, the company argues that reversal of the district court
judgment is necessary "based on an array of serious substantive and procedural
errors that infected virtually every aspect of the proceedings below. These
flaws culminated in the entry of unprecedented relief that extends far beyond
the case that was presented, without affording Microsoft an evidentiary
hearing." (Filing at p. 2.)

"We've created a world-class technology team here at Microsoft. For 25 years,
our team has worked to deliver widespread benefits to the economy and to
consumers. This ruling says to Microsoft and other creators of intellectual
property --the government can take what you have created and give it to others
if you are too successful or too popular," Ballmer said.

Microsoft also noted that many of the district court's factual findings are
clearly erroneous and that the court ignored unchallenged evidence presented by
Microsoft on many key issues. While the company will provide more extensive
examples when it files its detailed appeal papers, the stay brief cites several
examples in which the district court erred, because it:

     .    Failed to address evidence submitted by Microsoft showing why the
          company did not charge consumers a separate fee for the Internet
          Explorer improvements to Windows, a practice that clearly benefited
          software developers and consumers.

     .    Failed to address detailed and unrefuted evidence submitted by
          Microsoft of the many benefits from the design of Windows with
          integrated Internet support that cannot be duplicated by combining an
          operating system with a standalone browser like Netscape Navigator.

     .    Failed to address the fact that Navigator was distributed on 22
          percent of shipments of new personal computers and thus was not
          foreclosed from the OEM channel of distribution even though this fact
          was included in a third-party document that the court relied upon for
          other reasons.
<PAGE>

"The factual errors are the tip of the iceberg," said Bill Neukom, Microsoft's
executive vice president for law and corporate affairs. "The district court's
judgment should also be stayed and its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
should be reversed because it misapplied longstanding legal precedent and
presided over a pretrial process and a trial that did not afford Microsoft a
fair opportunity to defend itself." As part of its analysis of the district
court's legal conclusions, Microsoft notes the following:

     .    The district court declined to apply the legal test for technological
          tying that was previously articulated by the court of appeals and
          reflects prior court precedents. Instead, the district court
          formulated its own test that it said was based on U.S. Supreme Court
          precedents, despite the fact that the court of appeals considered and
          rejected the applicability of those specific precedents in its June
          1998 decision in favor of Microsoft on the very same issue.

     .    The district court misapplied a fundamental tenet of the antitrust
          laws --confusing anticompetitive conduct with pro-competitive conduct.
          In particular, the court improperly overlooked the pro-competitive,
          pro-consumer impact of Microsoft's efforts to compete broadly with
          Netscape by improving Windows to make it relevant in the Internet age
          and distributing Internet Explorer broadly, particularly in view of
          the fact that Netscape Navigator held more than 80 percent of the
          browser usage share in 1996 (according to the court). Microsoft's
          actions directly benefited consumers by lowering the price, increasing
          the availability and accelerating the development of browsing
          technology, as the court found.

In its filing today, Microsoft asks the court of appeals to stay the judgment so
that its extreme regulations will not be imposed while the court hears the
appeal. On June 7, the district court entered the government's proposed final
judgment without a single substantive change and without giving Microsoft the
opportunity to call witnesses to testify about the adverse impacts of the
government's proposal. According to Microsoft's filing, "The provisions that
become effective on September 5, 2000 absent a stay from the Appellate Courts
would force Microsoft to:

     .    disclose its valuable intellectual property -- including source code
          -- to competitors,

     .    interfere with Microsoft's release of new products,

     .    require the company to redesign all of its operating systems within 6
          months of the effective date of the judgment date,

     .    impose price controls on the company,

     .    and make it difficult for Microsoft to deliver on its vision for the
          next-generation of Web-based software services.

"The effect of these provisions will be devastating, not only to Microsoft, but
also to its employees, shareholders, business partners and customers, and could
have a significant adverse impact on the nation's economy, " the Microsoft
filing notes. "A stay pending appeal is necessary to prevent these far-reaching
and irreversible consequences of a profoundly flawed ruling." (Filing at p. 3.)
The Department of Justice has indicated that it intends to ask Judge Jackson to
certify the case for direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme
Court has complete discretion on whether it will accept jurisdiction of the
case.

"We want to resolve this case as quickly as possible. We believe we have a
winning legal case, regardless of where the case goes. Given the enormous
procedural and factual irregularities throughout this trial record, we believe
the court of appeals is the appropriate next step," Neukom said. "In the past 26
years, only two cases have bypassed the appeals court and gone directly to the
U.S. Supreme Court, and both of those cases involved very narrow issues of law
and the parties were united in seeking immediate U.S. Supreme Court review."
