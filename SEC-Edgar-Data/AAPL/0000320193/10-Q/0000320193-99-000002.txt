Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim 
periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire 
year. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying 
notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated 
financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 
25, 1998, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
September 25, 1998 (the 1998 Form 10-K).

During the first quarter of 1999, the Company amended its By-laws to provide 
that beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 1999 each of the Company's 
fiscal quarters would end on Saturday rather than Friday. Accordingly, one 
day was added to the first quarter of 1999 so that the quarter ended on 
Saturday, December 26, 1998. This change did not have a material effect on 
the Company's results of operations for the quarter and had no effect on the 
amount of revenue recognized during the quarter.

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of 
common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number 
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings 
per share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):

Options to purchase approximately 85,000 shares of common stock were 
outstanding as of December 26, 1998, that were not included in the 
computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 
26, 1998, because the options' exercise price was greater than the average 
market price of the Company's common stock during the period and, therefore, 
the effect would be antidilutive.	

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible 
subordinated notes (the Notes) which are convertible by their holders into 
approximately 22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of 
$29.205 per share subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. 
The common shares represented by these Notes upon conversion were included 
in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 
December 26, 1998, as the effect of using the if-converted method was dilutive 
for that period. The common shares represented by these Notes were not 
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months 
ended December 26, 1997, because the effect of using the if-converted method 
for those periods would be anti-dilutive. For additional disclosures regarding 
the outstanding preferred stock, employee stock options and the Notes, see the 
1998 Form 10-K.

Note 4 - Equity Investment Gains
As of September 25, 1998, the Company owned 25.9% of the outstanding stock 
of ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a publicly held company in the United Kingdom 
involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related 
technology. Through September 25, 1998, the Company accounted for this 
investment using the equity method. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 
2.9 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, 
a gain of approximately $32 million recorded as other income, and related 
income tax expense of approximately $3 million.

As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM  fell to 
19%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company 
no longer accounts for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity 
method and has categorized its remaining shares as available for sale 
requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and 
losses reported as a component of shareholders' equity. During the first 
quarter of 1999, the Company increased the carrying value of its remaining 
shares in ARM by $180 million to adjust their total carrying value at 
December 26, 1998, to their market value of approximately $197 million. The 
carrying value of the ARM shares is included in other assets. The total 
unrealized gain net of taxes recognized in other comprehensive income during 
the first quarter of 1999 was approximately $113 million.

Note 5 - Comprehensive Income
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 
No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", beginning with the Company's 
first quarter of 1999. SFAS No. 130 separates comprehensive income into two 
components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other 
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under 
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of 
shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. While SFAS No. 130 
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income, 
it has no impact on the Company's net income or total shareholders' equity. 
The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency 
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as 
their functional currency and from unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
securities categorized as available for sale.  See Note 4 regarding unrealized 
gains on available for sale securities.

The components of comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows

Note 6 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131, 
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", and in 
June 1998 issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and 
Hedging Activities." A discussion of these accounting standards is included in 
the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the 1998 Form 10-K 
under the subheading "Recent Accounting Pronouncements."


In March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, 
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for 
Internal Use," which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer 
software intended for internal use.  SOP 98-1 must be adopted by the Company 
effective as of fiscal 2000 and is not expected to have a material impact on 
the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.

During the fist quarter of 1999, the Company adopted AICPA SOP 97-2, 
"Software Revenue Recognition." SOP 97-2 established standards relating to 
the recognition of software revenue. SOP 97-2 was effective for transactions 
entered into by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The 
adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the 
Company's results of operations.

Note 7 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1998 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to 
certain other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary 
course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of 
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion 
of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any 
legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its 
financial condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies 
by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in 
dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income 
tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial 
number of issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still 
remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management 
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from tax examinations.

Note 8 - Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the  Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 
the three months ended December 26, 1997, have been reclassified to conform 
to the 1999 presentation.

Note 9 - Subsequent Events
On February 1, 1999, the Company took further actions to improve the 
flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final 
assembly of certain of its products to original equipment manufacturers. These 
restructuring actions will result in the Company recognizing a charge to 
operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999.

On February 2, 1999, the Company sold 2 million shares of ARM stock for net 
proceeds of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of approximately 
$55 million which will be recognized as other income by the Company in the 
second quarter of 1999. Subsequent to this sale, the Company holds 
approximately 7.3 million shares of ARM stock which represent approximately 
14.9% of the currently outstanding shares.

NM: Not Meaningful

Net income for the first quarter of 1999 includes a $32 million gain before 
tax associated with the sale by the Company of 2.9 million shares of its 
investment in ARM which were recognized as other income. Income tax expense 
recognized in the first quarter on this gain was approximately $3 million. 

                                      11
<PAGE>

Net Sales
Net sales for the first quarter of 1999 were $1.71 billion, an 8% increase 
over the same quarter in 1998. The increase in net sales is primarily 
attributable to a year-over-year 49% increase in Macintosh CPU unit volume. 
Volumes were favorably affected by sales of iMac, the Company's moderately 
priced Macintosh system designed for education and consumer markets 
introduced during the fourth quarter of 1998, which represented 55% or 
519,000 of the total Macintosh CPU units sales during the first quarter of 
During the first quarter of 1999, the Company also experienced year-over-year 
unit volume growth in both its Power Macintosh G3 and Powerbook G3 
product lines of 23% and 39%, respectively.  Further contributing to the year-
over-year increase in net sales was approximately $33 million of incremental 
net sales in the first quarter of 1999 related to the introduction MacOS 8.5, 
the most recent version of the Company's Macintosh operating system. The 
positive effect of these factors on first quarter 1999 net sales was partially 
offset by two principal factors. First, average revenue per Macintosh system, 
a function of total net sales related to hardware shipments and total 
Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 26% to $1,776 during the first quarter of 1999 
as compared to the same quarter in 1998. The decline in the average revenue 
per Macintosh system was the result of lower priced iMac systems comprising a 
significant portion of first quarter 1999 net sales, the decline in net sales 
from the phase out of certain peripheral products, and the overall industry 
trend towards lower priced products. Second, net sales of imaging and display 
products decreased by $93 million to $116 million in the first quarter of 1999 
compared with the same quarter in 1998 reflecting the Company's continuing 
phase-out of most imaging and many display products.

Net sales increased sequentially $154 million or 10% during the first quarter 
of 1999 as compared to the fourth quarter of 1998. The sequential revenue 
increase is attributable to a 13% rise in Macintosh unit shipments and 
incremental net sales from MacOS 8.5 upgrades. The rise in unit sales during 
the first quarter is attributable to a 21% increase in iMac unit sales 
compared to the fourth quarter of 1998 and a similar 15% increase in unit 
shipments of Power Macintosh G3 professional Macintosh systems partially 
offset by a 17% sequential decline in unit shipments of G3 Powerbooks 
resulting from the introduction of several new Powerbook models during the 
fourth quarter of 1998.

International sales for the first quarter of 1999 represented 47% of 
consolidated net sales versus 50% in the first quarter of 1998 and 37% during 
the fourth quarter of 1998. In total, international net sales during the first 
quarter of 1999 were relatively unchanged from the same quarter in 1998, but 
rose $229 million or 40% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 1998. This 
sequential increase in international net sales was caused by the introduction 
of the iMac during the current quarter in Europe and Asia and by strong sales 
internationally of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 and Powerbook G3 
product lines. On a year-over-year basis, total Macintosh unit sales during 
the first quarter of 1999 increased 55% in Europe, 26% in Japan, and 33% in 
the rest of Asia. Domestic net sales increased 14% or $114 million during the 
first quarter of 1999 as compared to 1998 while declining sequentially from 
the fourth quarter of 1998 $75 million or 8%.
                                      12
<PAGE>
Consistent with the historical seasonal pattern, the Company anticipates a 
sequential decline in net sales during the second quarter of 1999 but expects 
the second quarter to show year-over-year growth in both net sales and unit 
shipments. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's 
actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set 
forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results 
and Financial Condition".

Gross Margin
Gross margin for the first quarter of 1999 was 28.2% as compared to 22.4% for 
the same quarter in 1998 and 26.8% for the fourth quarter of 1998. The year-
over-year increase in gross margin is attributable to various operational 
changes made by the Company throughout fiscal 1998 that improved 
operational efficiency and reduced product costs. These changes included 
simplification of the Company's product line, focus on the use of industry 
standard parts, expanded use of supplier inventory hubs, outsourcing of 
various aspects of product manufacturing, and streamlining of product 
distribution channels and policies. Margins have also been favorably impacted 
during the last year by the declining cost of various components of the 
Company's products, particularly those sourced from Asia. The sequential 
increase in gross margin from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the first quarter 
of 1999 is primarily attributable to high margin incremental net sales of 
MacOS 8.5 during the current quarter. Such sales accounted for a sequential 
improvement in first quarter 1999 gross margin of approximately 1.5 
percentage points.

The Company expects gross margins to decline sequentially during the second 
quarter of 1999 due to lower net sales of MacOS upgrades and pricing pressure 
on consumer products. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection 
entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

There can be no assurance that current or targeted consolidated gross margin 
levels will be achieved or that current margins on existing individual 
products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on 
individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a 
variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing 
pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential 
increases in the cost of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and 
potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of 
consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. 
In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects that it will 
continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins 
could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality 
problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its 
products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account 
anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, 
the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the 
short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Operating Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $45 
million or 19% during the first quarter of 1999 as compared to both the same 
quarter of 1998 and sequentially over the fourth quarter of 1998. These 
increases are reflective of increased advertising and promotional spending 
during the 1998 holiday season associated with the worldwide introduction of 
iMac and MacOS 8.5. Expenditures for research and development remained 
relatively consistent in terms of absolute dollars between the first quarter 
of 1999, the same quarter in 1998, and the fourth quarter of 1998. 

The Company expects operating expenses to decline sequentially during the 
second quarter of 1999 by approximately $40 to $45 million due to seasonally 
lower marketing expenditures. This expected decline in operating expenses 
does not include the effect of the restructuring charge described in the 
following paragraph. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection 
entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

On February 1, 1999, the Company took further actions to improve the 
flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final 
assembly of certain of its products to original equipment manufacturers. These 
restructuring actions will result in the Company recognizing a charge to 
operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999.


Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the 
Company's debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for 
using the equity method, realized gains and losses on the sale of securities, 
certain foreign exchange gains and losses, and other miscellaneous income and 
expense items. 

As of September 25, 1998, the Company owned 25.9% of the outstanding stock 
of ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a publicly held company in the United 
Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and 
related technology. Through September 25, 1998, the Company accounted for 
this investment using the equity method. On October 14, 1998, the Company 
sold 2.9 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $37 
million, a gain of approximately $32 million recorded as other income, and 
related income tax expense of approximately $3 million.

As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM fell to 19%.  
Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company no 
longer accounts for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity method 
and has categorized its remaining shares as available for sale requiring the 
shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a 
component of shareholders' equity. During the first quarter of 1999, the 

                                      14

<PAGE>
Company increased the carrying value of its remaining shares in ARM by $180 
million to adjust their total carrying value at December 26, 1998, to their 
market value of approximately $197 million. The carrying value of the ARM 
shares is included in other assets. The total unrealized gain net of taxes 
related to ARM shares recognized in other comprehensive income during the 
first quarter of 1999 was approximately $113 million.

On February 2, 1999, the Company sold 2 million shares of ARM stock for net 
proceeds of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of approximately 
$55 million which will be recognized as other income by the Company in the 
second quarter of 1999. Subsequent to this sale, the Company holds 
approximately 7.3 million shares which represent approximately 14.9% of the 
currently outstanding stock of ARM.

Provision for Income Taxes
As of  December 26, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $663 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of December 26, 1998, a valuation allowance of $180 million was recorded 
against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be 
realized. Realization of approximately $73 million of the asset representing 
tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to 
generate approximately $209 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management 
believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, 
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning 
strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior 
to their expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, 
there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of 
future U.S. taxable income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets 
considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates 
of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company 
will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 1999 was only 10% 
due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established 
valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no 
U.S. taxes were provided.

As of December 26, 1998, the Company had approximately $2.58 billion in 
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $278 
million over the same balances at the end of fiscal 1998. During the first 
quarter of 1999, the most significant sources of cash were $152 million of net 
income, declines in net accounts receivable of $42 million and inventory of 
$53 million, and proceeds on the sales of ARM shares of $37 million. These 
factors were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $64 
million. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of December 26, 
1998, and September 25, 1998, include $4 million and $56 million, 
respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit.

The Company's debt ratings are currently non-investment grade. As of March 
27, 1998, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt ratings were 
B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's (S&P) Rating Agency, and 
B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services (Moody's). In June 
1998, Moody's upgraded the Company's senior debt to B2 from B3 and 
subordinated debt to Caa1 from Caa2 citing strengthened debtholder protection 
measurements as the major reason for the upgrade. On November 9, 1998, S&P 
upgraded the Company's senior debt to B+ from B- and upgraded its 
subordinated debt to B- from CCC citing the Company's improved profitability 
and financial profile for the upgrade. Despite these recent upgrades, the 
Company's continued non-investment grade debt ratings will maintain pressure 
on the Company's cost of funds in future periods and may require the Company 
to pledge additional collateral or agree to more stringent debt covenants. 


                                      16
<PAGE>

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over 
the next twelve months. However, given the Company's current debt ratings, if 
the Company should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can no 
assurance that such borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates. The 
inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially 
adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and 
liquidity.


Year 2000 Compliance
The information presented below related to Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance 
contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and 
uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ significantly from 
those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q regarding Year 2000 
compliance.

The Company's Information Systems and Technology department (IS&T) 
began addressing the Y2K issue in 1996 as part of its Next Generation 
strategy, which addressed the need for ongoing enhancement and replacement 
of the Company's various disparate legacy information technology (IT) 
Systems.  In 1998, the Company established a Year 2000 Executive Steering 
Committee (Steering Committee) composed of senior executives of the 
Company and the Company's Year 2000 Project Management Office (PMO).  
The PMO reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
the Steering Committee, and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of 
Directors.

The PMO developed and manages the Company's worldwide Y2K strategic 
plan (Y2K Plan) to address the potential impact of Y2K on the Company's 
operations and business processes. In particular, the Y2K Plan addresses four 
principal areas that may be impacted by the Y2K issue: Apple Branded 
Products; Third Party Relationships; Non-IT Business Systems; and IT 
Systems. With respect to the IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems, the 
Y2K Plan consists of four separate but overlapping phases: Phase I - Inventory 
and Risk Assessments; Phase II - Remediation Cost Estimation; Phase III - 
Remediation; and Phase IV - Remediation Testing. In addition, the Company 
has an ongoing Y2K Awareness Program designed to keep employees informed 
about Y2K issues. The Company's goal is to substantially complete Phase III - 
Remediation during the third quarter of 1999; complete Phase IV - 
Remediation Testing during the fourth quarter of 1999, and to continue 
compliance efforts throughout the remainder of calendar year 1999.  There 
have been no significant changes made to this schedule during the first 
quarter of 1999, and the Company remains on schedule to meet these goals.

The Company designs and manufacturers microprocessor-based personal 
computers, related peripherals, operating system software and application 
software, including Macintosh personal computers and the Mac OS which are 
marketed under the "Apple" brand (collectively "Apple Branded Products"). 


                                      17
<PAGE>
The Company tested certain Apple Branded Products to determine Y2K 
compliance, although such testing did not include third party products bundled 
with Apple Branded Products and certain Apple Branded Products no longer 
supported by the Company. For purposes of this discussion, Y2K compliant 
means a product will not produce errors processing date data in connection 
with the year change from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000, when used 
with accurate date data in accordance with the its documentation, provided all 
other products (including other software, firmware and hardware) used with it 
properly exchange date data with it. A Y2K compliant product will recognize 
the Year 2000 as a leap year. Information regarding the Y2K readiness of all 
Apple Branded Products is available on the Apple corporate web site at 
www.apple.com. Such information is not to be considered part of this quarterly 
report. The Company believes that the unsupported Apple Branded Products 
are Y2K compliant because, unlike other companies personal computers and 
related products, the Company's products do not rely upon the two digit date 
format but used a long word approach which allows the correct representation 
of dates up to the year 2040. The current date and time utilities utilized by 
Apple Branded Products are 64 bit signed value which covers dates from 30081 
BC to  29940 AD. Since the Company does not control the design of non-Apple 
Branded Products or third party products bundled with Apple Branded 
Products, it cannot assure they are Y2K compliant. Certain products acquired 
from NeXT Software, Inc., including OpenStep and NextStep, are not currently 
Y2K compliant. The Company intends to develop and make available during 
the third quarter of 1999 a software patch intended to allow such products to 
become Y2K compliant. 


The Company's business operations are heavily dependent on third party 
corporate service vendors, materials suppliers, outsourced operations 
partners, distributors and others. The Company is working with key external 
parties to identify and attempt to mitigate the potential risks to it of Y2K.  
The failure of external parties to resolve their own Y2K issues in a timely 
manner could result in a material financial risk to the Company.  As part of 
its overall Y2K program, the Company is actively communicating with third 
parties through face to face meetings and correspondence, on an ongoing basis, 
to ascertain their state of readiness.  Although numerous third parties have 
indicated to the Company in writing that they are addressing their Y2K issues 
on a timely basis, the readiness of third parties overall varies widely. 
Because the Company's Y2K compliance is dependent on the timely Y2K 
compliance of third parties, there can be no assurances that the Company's 
efforts alone will resolve all Y2K issues.

The costs of the Y2K program are primarily costs associated with the 
utilization of existing internal resources and incremental external spending. 
The Company previously estimated it had incurred approximately $4.1 million 
of incremental external spending directly associated with Y2K issues through 
the end of fiscal 1998 and that it would incur future incremental external 
spending associated with Y2K issues of approximately $5.1 million to address 
those risks identified as high and medium. There have been no material 
changes to the Company's costs estimates during the first quarter of 1999. 


                                      18
<PAGE>
However, as the Company's Y2K Plan continues, the actual future incremental 
spending may prove to be higher. Also, this estimate does not include the 
costs that could be incurred by the Company if one or more of its significant 
third party service providers fails to achieve Y2K compliance. The Company is 
not separately identifying and including in these estimates the Y2K costs 
incurred that are the result of utilization of the Company's existing internal 
resources. 

Based on current information, the Company believes the Y2K issue will not 
have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no 
assurance that the Y2K remediation by the Company or third parties will be 
properly and timely completed, and the failure to do so could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company, its business, results of operations, and its 
financial condition. In particular, the Company has not yet completed its 
assessment of the Y2K readiness of its significant third party service 
providers. Completion of this assessment may result in the identification of 
additional issues which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
results of operations. In addition, important factors that could cause results 
to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the ability of the 
Company to successfully identify systems which have a Y2K issue, the nature 
and amount of remediation effort required to fix the affected system, and the 
costs and availability of labor and resources to successfully address the Y2K 
issues.

Further details regarding the Company's Y2K compliance efforts may be found 
in the 1998 Form 10-K in Item 7 under the heading "Year 2000 Compliance."

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition
The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a 
number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In 
addition to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are 
many factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which 
may cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon 
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the Company 
must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating 
results and a favorable financial condition.

Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future 
operating results and financial condition include, among other things, 
continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any 
reaction by the Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing 
actions by the Company; risks associated with international operations, 
including economic and labor conditions, the continuing economic problems 
being experienced in Asia and Latin America, political instability, tax laws, 
and currency fluctuations; increasing dependence on third-parties for 
manufacturing and other outsourced functions such as logistics; the 

                                      19
<PAGE>
availability of key components on terms acceptable to the Company; the 
continued availability of certain components essential to the Company's 
business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources, 
including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by and obtained from 
IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products in certain 
categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or 
other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace 
of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely 
delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely delivery of 
future versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party software for 
particular applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain 
key employees; the effect of Y2K compliance issues; managing the impact of the 
European Union's transition to the Euro as its common legal currency; the 
Company's ability to retain the operational and cost benefits derived from its 
recently completed restructuring program; and the Company's ability to 
successfully replace its existing transaction systems in the U.S.

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" in 
the Company's 1998 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The information presented below regarding Market Risk contains forward 
looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. The Company's 
actual results may differ significantly from those discussed below and 
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q regarding market risk. . The following discussion 
should be read in conjunction with the 1998 Form 10-K and the condensed 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this 
Form 10-Q.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates 
primarily to the Company's investments and long-term debt obligations and 
related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its investments 
with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit 
exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk 
of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market 
and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months 
or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; 
investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to 
be short-term investments. As of December 26, 1998, there are no investments 
with maturities greater than 12 months.

Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. 
dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected 
by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, 
changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross 
margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.


                                      20
<PAGE>
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with 
financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks 
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed 
transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The 
Company's foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a 
majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. 
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction 
exposures that are immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar 
value or in terms of the related currency's historically high correlation with 
the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value 
in other current liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange 
option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the 
life of the option.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange 
and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and 
opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its 
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, 
option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with 
its underlying foreign currency and interest rate-related exposures, 
respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, 
given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and 
the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no 
assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of 
the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either 
foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting 
for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for 
any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related 
to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the 
Company's consolidated operating results and financial position.

For a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign currency 
related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's 
1998 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the Company's 
exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks since September 25, 1998.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in the 1998 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other 
legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of 
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal 
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of 
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any 
legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its 
financial condition or results of operations.

                             APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

                          (a California corporation)

                    (as amended through December 15, 1998)

                                   Article I

                                    OFFICES

    Section 1.1:      Principal Office.  The principal executive office for the
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop, 
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board of Directors is hereby granted full 
power and authority to change the location of the principal executive office 
from one location to another.

    Section 1.2:      Other Offices.  One or more branch or other subordinate 
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at 
such place or places within or without the State of California as it deems 
appropriate.

                                  Article II

                                  DIRECTORS

    Section 2.1:      Exercise of Corporate Powers.  Except as otherwise 
provided by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this 
corporation or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter in 
force, the business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all 
corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of 
Directors.

    Section 2.2:      Number.  The number of directors of the corporation 
shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of 
directors shall be six (6) until changed within the limits specified above, by 
a by-law amending this section, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by 
the shareholders.  The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a 
definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly 
adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this 
by-law duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of 
the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment 


                                      25
<PAGE>
reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number 
less than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at 
a meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of 
action by written consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding 
shares entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum 
number of authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated 
minimum number of directors minus one.

    Section 2.3:      Need Not Be Shareholders.  The directors of this 
corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.

    Section 2.4:      Compensation.  Directors and members of committees may 
receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed or 
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained 
shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this corporation in 
any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

    Section 2.5:      Election and Term of Office.  The directors shall be 
divided into two classes, designated Class I and Class II.  Each class shall 
consist of one-half of the directors or as close an approximation as possible. 
The initial term of office of the directors of Class I shall expire at the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991 and the initial term of 
office of the directors of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting to be 
held during fiscal year 1992.  At each annual meeting, commencing with the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991, each of the successors to 
the directors of the class whose term shall have expired at such annual 
meeting shall be elected for a term running until the second annual meeting 
next succeeding his or her election and until his or her successor shall have 
been duly elected and qualified.

    Section 2.6:      Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of 
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any 
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the 
shareholders fail, at any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director 
is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be voted for 
at that meeting. The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a 
director if he or she is declared of unsound mind by an order of court or 
convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after notice of his or her 
election, he or she does not accept the office. Any vacancy, except for a 
vacancy created by removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, 
may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the remaining directors 
then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining 
director. Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of removal 
of directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders. The shareholders 
may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the 
directors. Any such election by written consent requires the consent of a 
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling of 
any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been 
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the 
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more 
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote 

                                      26
<PAGE>

for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held to 
elect the entire Board of Directors. The term of office of any director shall 
terminate upon such election of a successor. Any director may resign effective 
upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors of 
this corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the 
effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future 
time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes 
effective. A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove 
any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.

    Section 2.7:      Removal. The entire Board of Directors or any individual 
director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a 
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the 
entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the 
votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, 
would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without 
regard to whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at 
which the same total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by 
written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number 
of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if 
greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then 
being elected. If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be 
elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a 
class or series of shares is entitled to elect one or more directors under 
authority granted by the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the 
provisions of this Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series 
and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

    Section 2.8:      Powers and Duties.  Without limiting the generality or 
extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of 
Directors pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby provided that 
the Board of Directors shall have full power with respect to the following 
matters:

date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to

principal executive office for the transaction of business of this corporation, 
or at any place within or without the State which may be designated by written 
consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, or which may be

entitled to vote thereat, given either before or after the meeting and filed 
with the Secretary of this corporation.

    Section 10.3:     Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders 
for any purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time by the 
President or by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members thereof, or 
by one or more holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent 
(10%) of the votes on the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8.  
Upon request in writing sent by registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer, 
President, Vice President or Secretary, or delivered to any such officer in 
person, by any person or persons entitled to call a special meeting of 
shareholders (such request, if sent by a shareholder or shareholders, to 
include the information required by Section 10.13), it shall be the duty of 
such officer, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, to cause notice 
to be given to the shareholders entitled to vote that a meeting will be 
requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, the date of which 
meeting, which shall be set by such officer, to be not less than 35 days nor 
more than 60 days after such request or, if applicable, determination of the 
validity of such request pursuant to the immediately succeeding sentence.  
Within seven days after receiving such a written request from a shareholder or 
shareholders of the corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine 
whether shareholders owning not less than ten percent (10%) of the shares as 
of the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8 for such request 
support the call of a special meeting and notify the requesting party or 
parties of its finding.

    Section 10.4:     Notice of Meetings.  Notice of any meeting of 
shareholders shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days 
before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat by 
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or other person charged with that 
duty, or if there be no such officer or person, or in case of his or her 
neglect or refusal, by any director or shareholder.  The notice shall state the 
place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, 
the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may 
be transacted, or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which 
the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to 
present for action by the shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented 
at the meeting for such action except 
38
<PAGE> 

that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal relating to 
approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of this 
corporation, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of 
this corporation or winding up of this corporation. The notice of any meeting 
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees 
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for election. 
Written notice shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder, either 
(i)  personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, 
charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's address 
appearing on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder to 
this corporation for the purpose of notice. If a shareholder gives no address 
or no such address appears on the books of this corporation, notice shall be 
deemed to have been given if sent by mail or other means of written 
                                      36
<PAGE>

communication addressed to the place where the principal executive office of 
this corporation is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the county in which such office is located. The notice 
shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or 
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means 
of written communication and addressed as hereinbefore provided. An affidavit 
of delivery or mailing of any notice in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 10.4, executed by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer 
agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice. If any 
notice addressed to the shareholder at the address of such shareholder 
appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to this corporation by 
the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States 
Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder at such 
address, all future notices shall be deemed to have been duly given without 
further mailing if the same shall be available for the shareholder upon 
written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive office of this 
corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice 
to all other shareholders.

    Section 10.5:     Consent to Shareholders' Meetings. The transactions of 
any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, 
are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and 
notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either 
before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not 
present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to 
the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such 
waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or 
made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting 
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person 
objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business 
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that 
attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the 
consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not 
so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the 
business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting 
of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as 
to approval of contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, 
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation 
or winding up the affairs of this corporation.

    Section 10.6:     Quorum. The presence in person or by proxy of the 
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares 
shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such 
shares at the meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot be 
lawfully voted at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or 
held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business 
until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to 
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is 
approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

                                      37
<PAGE>

    Section 10.7:     Adjourned Meetings. Any shareholders' meeting, whether 
or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of 
a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or 
represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 10.6 hereof, 
in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such 
meeting.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days or if after 
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of 
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to 
vote at a meeting. Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any 
notice of 
the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be 
transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such 
adjournment is taken. At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact 
any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

Section 10.8:	Voting Rights. Only persons in whose names shares entitled 
to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close of 
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given 
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next 
preceding the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be fixed 
for the determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section 2.8(k) 
hereof, then on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. In 
the absence of any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in 
any applicable statute relating to the election of directors or to other 
particular matters, each such person shall be entitled to one vote for each 
share.

In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to 
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors 
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which 
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, 
and which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the date upon 
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of 
Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders 
authorize or take corporate action by written consent or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice 
to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The 
Board of Directors shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28) 
days after the date on which such request is received, adopt a resolution 
fixing the record date.

    Section 10.9:     Action by Written Consents.  Any action which may be 
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a 
meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the 
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having 
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to 
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to 
vote thereon were present and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving 
such written consent or consents from shareholders of the corporation, the 
Board of Directors shall determine whether holders of outstanding shares as of 
                                      38
<PAGE>

the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8 having not less than the 
minimum number of votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such 
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present 
and voted have properly consented thereto in writing and notify the requesting 
party of its finding. Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote 
have been solicited in writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) 
contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, (ii) 
indemnification of any person, (iii) reorganization of this corporation or (iv) 
distributions to shareholders upon winding up of this corporation in certain 
circumstances without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall 
be given at least 10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by 
such approval, and prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other 
corporate action approved by shareholders without a meeting by less than 
unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not 
consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.  When written consents 
are given with respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from 
the persons in whose names such shares stand on the books of this corporation 
at the time such respective consents are given, or any shareholder's proxy 
holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the 
shareholder or their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a 
writing received by this corporation prior to the time that written consents 
of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been 
filed with the Secretary of this corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  
Such revocation is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this 
corporation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be 
elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares 
entitled to vote for the election of directors.

    Section 10.10:    Elections of Directors. In any election of directors, the 
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares 
entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by 
such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with 
respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.  
Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a 
shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.

    Section 10.11:    Proxies.  Every person entitled to vote or execute 
consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more 
agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person's 
duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this corporation.  No 
proxy shall be valid (l) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is 
specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and 
applicable law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from the date 
thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time 
for which such proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may be effected by a 
writing delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating that the proxy 
is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the 
meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy.  A proxy is 
not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is 
counted, a written notice of such death or incapacity is received by this 
                                      39
<PAGE>

corporation.  A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for 
the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following or a 
nominee of any of the following: (l) a pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased 
or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person 
who has sold a portion of such person's shares in this corporation to the 
maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor or creditors of this corporation or the 
shareholder who extended or continued credit to this corporation or the 
shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was 
given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the 
name of the person extending or continuing the credit, (4) a person who has 
contracted to perform services as an employee of this corporation, if a proxy 
is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was 
given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the 
employee and the period of employment contracted for, (5) a person designated 
by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust 
agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to 
secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or 
equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the 
obligation secured by it. Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability 
specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option 
or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares 
of this corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is 
paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has 
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust 
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, 
notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares 
without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of 
the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such 
shares. Every form of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity 
to specify approval or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also 
contain an appropriate space marked "abstain", whereby a shareholder may 
indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her shares on the proposal. A 
proxy marked "abstain" by the shareholder with respect to a particular 
proposal shall not be voted either for or against such proposal.  In any 
election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted 
upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder 
"withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to 
vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for 
or against the election of a director.

    Section 10.12:    Inspectors of Election. Before any meeting of 
shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than 
nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its 
adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of 
the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's 
proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. The number of 
inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed 
at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the 
holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall 
determine whether one (l) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any 
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the 
                                      40
<PAGE>

Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a 
shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.

	These inspectors shall:

         (a)  Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power 
of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and 
the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

         (b)  Receive votes, ballots, or consents;

         (c)  Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way 
arising in connection with the right to vote;

         (d)  Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

         (e)  Determine when the polls shall close;

         (f)  Determine the result; and

         (g)  Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or 
vote with fairness to all shareholders.

     Section 10.13:   Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals and Director 
Nominations.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as 
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought 
before a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given 
timely notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such 
nomination or nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a 
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not 
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in the event 
less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the 
meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be 
timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th 
day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was 
mailed or such public disclosure was made.  To be  in proper written form a 
shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address 
of the shareholder who intends to make the nominations or propose the 
business and, as the case may be, of the person or persons to be nominated or 
of the business to be proposed, (ii) a representation that the shareholder is a 
holder of record of stock of the Corporation that intends to vote such stock 
at such meeting and, if applicable, intends to appear in person or by proxy at 
the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (iii) 
if applicable, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the 
shareholder and each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such 
person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be 
made by the shareholder, (iv) such other information regarding each nominee 
or each matter of business to be proposed by such shareholder as would be 
required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A 
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated, or intended 
                                      41
<PAGE>

to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, by 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable, the consent 
of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The chairman of 
a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any 
person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the 
foregoing procedure.


                                  Article XI

                            MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS

    Section 11.1:     Place of Meetings.  Meetings (whether regular, special 
or adjourned) of the Board of Directors of this corporation shall be held at 
the principal office of this corporation for the transaction of business, as 
specified in accordance with Section 1.1 hereof, or at any other place within 
or without the State which has been designated from time to time by resolution 
of the Board or which is designated in the notice of the meeting.

    Section 11.2:     Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Board of 
Directors shall be held after the adjournment of each annual meeting of the 
shareholders (which regular directors' meeting shall be designated the 
"Regular Annual Meeting") and at such other times as may be designated from 
time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Notice of the time and 
place of all regular meetings shall be given in the same manner as for special 
meetings, except that no such notice need be given if (l) the time and place 
of such meetings are fixed by the Board of Directors or (2) the Regular Annual 
Meeting is held at the principal place of business provided at Section 1.1 
hereof and on the date specified in Section 10.2 hereof.

    Section 11.3:     Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of 
Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or  
the President, or any Vice President, or the Secretary or by any two or more 
directors.

    Section 11.4:     Notice of Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the 
Board of Directors shall be held upon no less than four days' notice by mail 
or 48 hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph to each 
director. Notice need not be given to any director who signs a waiver of 
notice or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its 
commencement, the lack of notice to such director. Any oral notice given 
personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a 
person at the home or office of the director who the person giving the notice 
has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. A notice 
or waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any meeting of the Board. 
If the address of a director is not shown on the records and is not readily 
ascertainable, notice shall be addressed to him at the city or place in which 
the meetings of the directors are regularly held. If the meeting is adjourned 
for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place 
shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to all directors not 
present at the time of adjournment.

    Section 11.5:     Quorum.  A majority of all directors elected by the 
shareholders and appointed to fill vacancies as provided in Section 2.6 hereof 
shall constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors for the transaction of 
business. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors 
present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the 
Board of Directors subject to provisions of law relating to interested 
directors and indemnification of agents of this corporation. A majority of the 
directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting 
to another time and place. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present 
may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, 
if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum 
for such meeting.

    Section 11.6:     Conference Telephone.  Members of the Board of Directors 
may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar 
communications equipment, so long as all directors participating in such 
meeting can hear one another.  Participation in a meeting pursuant to this 
Section 11.6 constitutes presence in person at such meeting.

    Section 11.7:     Waiver of Notice and Consent.  The transactions of any 
meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever 
held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular 
call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the 
meeting, each of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a 
consent to holding such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All 
such waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records 
or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

    Section 11.8:     Action Without a Meeting.  Any action required or 
permitted by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a 
meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors shall individually or 
collectively consent in writing to such action.  Such written consent or 
consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of 
Directors. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect 
as the unanimous vote of such directors.

    Section 11.9:     Committees.  The provisions of this Article XI apply 
also to committees of the Board of Directors and action by such committees, 
mutatis mutandis.

    Section 12.1:     Instruments in Writing.  All checks, drafts, demands for 
money and notes of this corporation, and all written contracts of this

the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.  No officer, agent, or 
employee of this corporation shall have the power to bind this corporation by 
contract or otherwise unless authorized to do so by these By-Laws or by the 
Board of Directors.

signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer 
agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed 
upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or 
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by this 
corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer 
agent or registrar at the date of issue.

    Section 12.4:     Lost Certificates.  Where the owner of any certificate 
for shares of this corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, 
stolen or destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of the original
certificate if the owner (l) so requests before this corporation has notice 
that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, 
(2) files with this corporation an indemnity bond in such form and in such 
amount as shall be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a 
Vice President of this corporation, and (3) satisfies any other reasonable 
requirements imposed by this corporation.  The Board of Directors may adopt 
such other provisions and restrictions with reference to lost certificates, 
not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in its discretion deem 
appropriate.

    Section 12.5:     Certification and Inspection of By-Laws.  This 
corporation shall keep at its principal executive or business office the 
original or a copy of these By-Laws as amended or otherwise altered to date, 
which shall be open to inspection by the shareholders at all reasonable times 
during office hours.

    Section 12.6:     Annual Reports.  The making of annual reports to the 
shareholders is dispensed with and the requirement that such annual reports be 
made to shareholders is expressly waived, except as may be directed from time 
to time by the Board of Directors or the President.

    Section 12.7:     Fiscal Quarters.  Each fiscal quarter of the Corporation 
shall be comprised of 13 weeks each of which shall end at midnight on 
Saturday of such week, and the fiscal months in any one calendar quarter shall 
be comprised of at least four consecutive calendar weeks with one week to be 
added, at management's discretion, to any one month during such fiscal year.

    Section 12.8:     Officer Loans and Guaranties.  If the corporation has 
outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons on the date of 
approval by the Board of Directors, the corporation may make loans of money 
or property to, or guarantee the obligations of, any officer of the 
corporation or its parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the officer is a 
director, upon the approval of the Board of Directors alone. Such approval by 
the Board of Directors must be determined by a vote of a majority of the 
disinterested directors, if it is determined that such a loan or guaranty may 
reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. In no event may an officer 
owning 2% or more of the outstanding common shares of the corporation be 
extended a loan under this provision.

                                  Article XIII

                        CONSTRUCTION OF BY-LAWS WITH
                        REFERENCE TO PROVISIONS OF LAW

    Section 13.1:     By-Law Provisions Additional and Supplemental to 
Provisions of Law.  All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other 
provisions of these By-Laws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as 
supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject 
matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said 
provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.

    Section 13.2:     By-Law Provisions Contrary to or Inconsistent with 
Provisions of Law.  Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, 
clause or phrase of these By-Laws which, upon being construed in the manner 
provided in Section 13.1 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any 
applicable provision of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law 
shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or 
applicability of any other portions of these By-Laws, it being hereby declared 
that these By-Laws, and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, 
sentence, clause, or phrase thereof, would have been adopted irrespective of 
the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, 
sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.

                                  Article XIV

                   ADOPTION, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL OF BY-LAWS

    Section 14.1:     By Shareholders.  By-Laws may be adopted, amended or 
repealed by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the 
outstanding shares entitled to vote. By-Laws specifying or changing a fixed 
number of directors  or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a 
fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the 
shareholders; provided, however, that a By-Law or amendment of the Articles 
of Incorporation reducing the number or the minimum number of directors to a 
number less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption 
at a meeting or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written 
consent are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to 
vote.

                                      45
<PAGE>

    Section 14.2:     By the Board of Directors.  Subject to the right of 
shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws, By-Laws, other than a By-
Law or amendment thereof specifying or changing a fixed number of directors 
or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable 
board or vice versa, may be adopted, amended or repealed by the Board of 
Directors. A By-Law adopted by the shareholders may restrict or eliminate the 
power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws.


                                  Article XV

                       RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF STOCK

    Section 15.1:     Subsequent Agreement or By-Law.  If (a) any two or more 
shareholders of this corporation shall enter into any agreement abridging, 
limiting or restricting the rights of any one or more of them to sell, assign, 
transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or transfer on the books of this 
corporation any or all of the shares of this corporation held by them, and if 
a copy of said agreement shall be filed with this corporation, or if (b) 
shareholders entitled to vote shall adopt any By-Law provision abridging, 
limiting or restricting the aforesaid rights of any shareholders, then, and in 
either of such events, all certificates of shares of stock subject to such 
abridgments, limitations or restrictions shall have a reference thereto 
endorsed thereon by an officer of this corporation and such certificates shall 
not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation except in 
accordance with the terms and provisions of such agreement or ByLaw, as the 
case may be; provided, that no restriction shall be binding with respect to 
shares issued prior to adoption of the restriction unless the holders of such 
shares voted in favor of or consented in writing to the restriction.

                                 Article XVI

                    INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
                          EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS


    Section 16.1:     Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  The 
corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the 
Code, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (as 
defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements, and 
other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any 
proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by reason of 
the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation.  For purposes 
of this Article XVI, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any 
person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is 
or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of 
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, 
or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a 
predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the 
request of such predecessor corporation.

    Section 16.2:     Indemnification of Others.  The corporation shall have 
the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Code, to indemnify 
each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against 
expenses (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, 
settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection 
with any proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by 
reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation.  
For purposes of this Article XVI, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation 
(other than a director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an 
employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the 
request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an 
employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the 
corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor 
corporation.

    Section 16.3:     Payment of Expenses in Advance.  Expenses incurred in 
defending any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification 
is required pursuant to Section 16.1 or for which indemnification is permitted 
pursuant to Section 16.2 following authorization thereof by the Board of 
Directors, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final 
disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or 
on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately 
be determined that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as 
authorized in this Article XVI.

    Section 16.4:     Indemnity Not Exclusive.  The indemnification provided 
by this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which 
those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, 
vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to 
action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while 
holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to 
indemnification are authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.

    Section 16.5:     Insurance Indemnification.  The corporation shall have 
the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is 
or was an Agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or 
incurred by such person in such capacity or arising out of such person's 
status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to 
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article XVI.

    Section 16.6:     Conflicts.  No indemnification or advance shall be made 
under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or advance is 
mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent 
jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears:

(a)  That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles 
of Incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an 


                                      47
<PAGE>


agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the 
action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other 
amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

(b)  That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly 
imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim 
periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire 
year. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying 
notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated 
financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 
25, 1998, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
September 25, 1998 (the 1998 Form 10-K).

During the first quarter of 1999, the Company amended its By-laws to provide 
that beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 1999 each of the Company's 
fiscal quarters would end on Saturday rather than Friday. Accordingly, one 
day was added to the first quarter of 1999 so that the quarter ended on 
Saturday, December 26, 1998. This change did not have a material effect on 
the Company's results of operations for the quarter and had no effect on the 
amount of revenue recognized during the quarter.

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of 
common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number 
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings 
per share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):

  and assumed conversions                        172,062                139,839

Basic earnings per share                          $ 1.12                 $ 0.37    

Diluted earnings per share                        $ 0.95                 $ 0.33    
</TABLE>


Options to purchase approximately 85,000 shares of common stock were 
outstanding as of December 26, 1998, that were not included in the 
computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 
26, 1998, because the options' exercise price was greater than the average 
market price of the Company's common stock during the period and, therefore, 
the effect would be antidilutive.	

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible 
subordinated notes (the Notes) which are convertible by their holders into 
approximately 22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of 
$29.205 per share subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. 
The common shares represented by these Notes upon conversion were included 
in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 
December 26, 1998, as the effect of using the if-converted method was dilutive 
for that period. The common shares represented by these Notes were not 
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months 
ended December 26, 1997, because the effect of using the if-converted method 
for those periods would be anti-dilutive. For additional disclosures regarding 
the outstanding preferred stock, employee stock options and the Notes, see the 
1998 Form 10-K.

Note 4 - Equity Investment Gains
As of September 25, 1998, the Company owned 25.9% of the outstanding stock 
of ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a publicly held company in the United Kingdom 
involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related 
technology. Through September 25, 1998, the Company accounted for this 
investment using the equity method. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 
2.9 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, 
a gain of approximately $32 million recorded as other income, and related 
income tax expense of approximately $3 million.

As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM  fell to 
19%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company 
no longer accounts for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity 
method and has categorized its remaining shares as available for sale 
requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and 
losses reported as a component of shareholders' equity. During the first 
quarter of 1999, the Company increased the carrying value of its remaining 
shares in ARM by $180 million to adjust their total carrying value at 
December 26, 1998, to their market value of approximately $197 million. The 
carrying value of the ARM shares is included in other assets. The total 
unrealized gain net of taxes recognized in other comprehensive income during 
the first quarter of 1999 was approximately $113 million.

Note 5 - Comprehensive Income
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 
No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", beginning with the Company's 
first quarter of 1999. SFAS No. 130 separates comprehensive income into two 
components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other 
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under 
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of 
shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. While SFAS No. 130 
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income, 
it has no impact on the Company's net income or total shareholders' equity. 
The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency 
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as 
their functional currency and from unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
securities categorized as available for sale.  See Note 4 regarding unrealized 
gains on available for sale securities.

The components of comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows
 (in millions):

Note 6 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131, 
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", and in 
June 1998 issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and 
Hedging Activities." A discussion of these accounting standards is included in 
the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the 1998 Form 10-K 
under the subheading "Recent Accounting Pronouncements."


In March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, 
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for 
Internal Use," which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer 
software intended for internal use.  SOP 98-1 must be adopted by the Company 
effective as of fiscal 2000 and is not expected to have a material impact on 
the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.

During the fist quarter of 1999, the Company adopted AICPA SOP 97-2, 
"Software Revenue Recognition." SOP 97-2 established standards relating to 
the recognition of software revenue. SOP 97-2 was effective for transactions 
entered into by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The 
adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the 
Company's results of operations.

Note 7 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1998 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to 
certain other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary 
course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of 
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion 
of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any 
legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its 
financial condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies 
by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in 
dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income 
tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial 
number of issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still 
remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management 
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from tax examinations.

Note 8 - Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the  Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 
the three months ended December 26, 1997, have been reclassified to conform 
to the 1999 presentation.

Note 9 - Subsequent Events
On February 1, 1999, the Company took further actions to improve the 
flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final 
assembly of certain of its products to original equipment manufacturers. These 
restructuring actions will result in the Company recognizing a charge to 
operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999.

On February 2, 1999, the Company sold 2 million shares of ARM stock for net 
proceeds of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of approximately 
$55 million which will be recognized as other income by the Company in the 
second quarter of 1999. Subsequent to this sale, the Company holds 
approximately 7.3 million shares of ARM stock which represent approximately 
14.9% of the currently outstanding shares.

NM: Not Meaningful

Net income for the first quarter of 1999 includes a $32 million gain before 
tax associated with the sale by the Company of 2.9 million shares of its 
investment in ARM which were recognized as other income. Income tax expense 
recognized in the first quarter on this gain was approximately $3 million. 

                                      11
<PAGE>

Net Sales
Net sales for the first quarter of 1999 were $1.71 billion, an 8% increase 
over the same quarter in 1998. The increase in net sales is primarily 
attributable to a year-over-year 49% increase in Macintosh CPU unit volume. 
Volumes were favorably affected by sales of iMac, the Company's moderately 
priced Macintosh system designed for education and consumer markets 
introduced during the fourth quarter of 1998, which represented 55% or 
519,000 of the total Macintosh CPU units sales during the first quarter of 
During the first quarter of 1999, the Company also experienced year-over-year 
unit volume growth in both its Power Macintosh G3 and Powerbook G3 
product lines of 23% and 39%, respectively.  Further contributing to the year-
over-year increase in net sales was approximately $33 million of incremental 
net sales in the first quarter of 1999 related to the introduction MacOS 8.5, 
the most recent version of the Company's Macintosh operating system. The 
positive effect of these factors on first quarter 1999 net sales was partially 
offset by two principal factors. First, average revenue per Macintosh system, 
a function of total net sales related to hardware shipments and total 
Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 26% to $1,776 during the first quarter of 1999 
as compared to the same quarter in 1998. The decline in the average revenue 
per Macintosh system was the result of lower priced iMac systems comprising a 
significant portion of first quarter 1999 net sales, the decline in net sales 
from the phase out of certain peripheral products, and the overall industry 
trend towards lower priced products. Second, net sales of imaging and display 
products decreased by $93 million to $116 million in the first quarter of 1999 
compared with the same quarter in 1998 reflecting the Company's continuing 
phase-out of most imaging and many display products.

Net sales increased sequentially $154 million or 10% during the first quarter 
of 1999 as compared to the fourth quarter of 1998. The sequential revenue 
increase is attributable to a 13% rise in Macintosh unit shipments and 
incremental net sales from MacOS 8.5 upgrades. The rise in unit sales during 
the first quarter is attributable to a 21% increase in iMac unit sales 
compared to the fourth quarter of 1998 and a similar 15% increase in unit 
shipments of Power Macintosh G3 professional Macintosh systems partially 
offset by a 17% sequential decline in unit shipments of G3 Powerbooks 
resulting from the introduction of several new Powerbook models during the 
fourth quarter of 1998.

International sales for the first quarter of 1999 represented 47% of 
consolidated net sales versus 50% in the first quarter of 1998 and 37% during 
the fourth quarter of 1998. In total, international net sales during the first 
quarter of 1999 were relatively unchanged from the same quarter in 1998, but 
rose $229 million or 40% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 1998. This 
sequential increase in international net sales was caused by the introduction 
of the iMac during the current quarter in Europe and Asia and by strong sales 
internationally of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 and Powerbook G3 
product lines. On a year-over-year basis, total Macintosh unit sales during 
the first quarter of 1999 increased 55% in Europe, 26% in Japan, and 33% in 
the rest of Asia. Domestic net sales increased 14% or $114 million during the 
first quarter of 1999 as compared to 1998 while declining sequentially from 
the fourth quarter of 1998 $75 million or 8%.
                                      12
<PAGE>
Consistent with the historical seasonal pattern, the Company anticipates a 
sequential decline in net sales during the second quarter of 1999 but expects 
the second quarter to show year-over-year growth in both net sales and unit 
shipments. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's 
actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set 
forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results 
and Financial Condition".

Gross Margin
Gross margin for the first quarter of 1999 was 28.2% as compared to 22.4% for 
the same quarter in 1998 and 26.8% for the fourth quarter of 1998. The year-
over-year increase in gross margin is attributable to various operational 
changes made by the Company throughout fiscal 1998 that improved 
operational efficiency and reduced product costs. These changes included 
simplification of the Company's product line, focus on the use of industry 
standard parts, expanded use of supplier inventory hubs, outsourcing of 
various aspects of product manufacturing, and streamlining of product 
distribution channels and policies. Margins have also been favorably impacted 
during the last year by the declining cost of various components of the 
Company's products, particularly those sourced from Asia. The sequential 
increase in gross margin from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the first quarter 
of 1999 is primarily attributable to high margin incremental net sales of 
MacOS 8.5 during the current quarter. Such sales accounted for a sequential 
improvement in first quarter 1999 gross margin of approximately 1.5 
percentage points.

The Company expects gross margins to decline sequentially during the second 
quarter of 1999 due to lower net sales of MacOS upgrades and pricing pressure 
on consumer products. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection 
entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

There can be no assurance that current or targeted consolidated gross margin 
levels will be achieved or that current margins on existing individual 
products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on 
individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a 
variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing 
pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential 
increases in the cost of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and 
potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of 
consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. 
In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects that it will 
continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins 
could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality 
problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its 
products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account 
anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, 
the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the 
short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.


                                      13
<PAGE>
Operating Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $45 
million or 19% during the first quarter of 1999 as compared to both the same 
quarter of 1998 and sequentially over the fourth quarter of 1998. These 
increases are reflective of increased advertising and promotional spending 
during the 1998 holiday season associated with the worldwide introduction of 
iMac and MacOS 8.5. Expenditures for research and development remained 
relatively consistent in terms of absolute dollars between the first quarter 
of 1999, the same quarter in 1998, and the fourth quarter of 1998. 

The Company expects operating expenses to decline sequentially during the 
second quarter of 1999 by approximately $40 to $45 million due to seasonally 
lower marketing expenditures. This expected decline in operating expenses 
does not include the effect of the restructuring charge described in the 
following paragraph. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection 
entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

On February 1, 1999, the Company took further actions to improve the 
flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final 
assembly of certain of its products to original equipment manufacturers. These 
restructuring actions will result in the Company recognizing a charge to 
operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999.


Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the 
Company's debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for 
using the equity method, realized gains and losses on the sale of securities, 
certain foreign exchange gains and losses, and other miscellaneous income and 
expense items. 

As of September 25, 1998, the Company owned 25.9% of the outstanding stock 
of ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a publicly held company in the United 
Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and 
related technology. Through September 25, 1998, the Company accounted for 
this investment using the equity method. On October 14, 1998, the Company 
sold 2.9 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $37 
million, a gain of approximately $32 million recorded as other income, and 
related income tax expense of approximately $3 million.

As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM fell to 19%.  
Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company no 
longer accounts for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity method 
and has categorized its remaining shares as available for sale requiring the 
shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a 
component of shareholders' equity. During the first quarter of 1999, the 

                                      14

<PAGE>
Company increased the carrying value of its remaining shares in ARM by $180 
million to adjust their total carrying value at December 26, 1998, to their 
market value of approximately $197 million. The carrying value of the ARM 
shares is included in other assets. The total unrealized gain net of taxes 
related to ARM shares recognized in other comprehensive income during the 
first quarter of 1999 was approximately $113 million.

On February 2, 1999, the Company sold 2 million shares of ARM stock for net 
proceeds of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of approximately 
$55 million which will be recognized as other income by the Company in the 
second quarter of 1999. Subsequent to this sale, the Company holds 
approximately 7.3 million shares which represent approximately 14.9% of the 
currently outstanding stock of ARM.

Provision for Income Taxes
As of  December 26, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $663 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of December 26, 1998, a valuation allowance of $180 million was recorded 
against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be 
realized. Realization of approximately $73 million of the asset representing 
tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to 
generate approximately $209 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management 
believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, 
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning 
strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior 
to their expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, 
there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of 
future U.S. taxable income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets 
considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates 
of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company 
will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 1999 was only 10% 
due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established 
valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no 
U.S. taxes were provided.

(b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each 
period
(c) Based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales 
adjusted for the change in inventory 

As of December 26, 1998, the Company had approximately $2.58 billion in 
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $278 
million over the same balances at the end of fiscal 1998. During the first 
quarter of 1999, the most significant sources of cash were $152 million of net 
income, declines in net accounts receivable of $42 million and inventory of 
$53 million, and proceeds on the sales of ARM shares of $37 million. These 
factors were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $64 
million. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of December 26, 
1998, and September 25, 1998, include $4 million and $56 million, 
respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit.

The Company's debt ratings are currently non-investment grade. As of March 
27, 1998, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt ratings were 
B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's (S&P) Rating Agency, and 
B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services (Moody's). In June 
1998, Moody's upgraded the Company's senior debt to B2 from B3 and 
subordinated debt to Caa1 from Caa2 citing strengthened debtholder protection 
measurements as the major reason for the upgrade. On November 9, 1998, S&P 
upgraded the Company's senior debt to B+ from B- and upgraded its 
subordinated debt to B- from CCC citing the Company's improved profitability 
and financial profile for the upgrade. Despite these recent upgrades, the 
Company's continued non-investment grade debt ratings will maintain pressure 
on the Company's cost of funds in future periods and may require the Company 
to pledge additional collateral or agree to more stringent debt covenants.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over 
the next twelve months. However, given the Company's current debt ratings, if 
the Company should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can no 
assurance that such borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates. The 
inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially 
adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and 
liquidity.


Year 2000 Compliance
The information presented below related to Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance 
contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and 
uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ significantly from 
those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q regarding Year 2000 
compliance.

The Company's Information Systems and Technology department (IS&T) 
began addressing the Y2K issue in 1996 as part of its Next Generation 
strategy, which addressed the need for ongoing enhancement and replacement 
of the Company's various disparate legacy information technology (IT) 
Systems.  In 1998, the Company established a Year 2000 Executive Steering 
Committee (Steering Committee) composed of senior executives of the 
Company and the Company's Year 2000 Project Management Office (PMO).  
The PMO reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
the Steering Committee, and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of 
Directors.

The PMO developed and manages the Company's worldwide Y2K strategic 
plan (Y2K Plan) to address the potential impact of Y2K on the Company's 
operations and business processes. In particular, the Y2K Plan addresses four 
principal areas that may be impacted by the Y2K issue: Apple Branded 
Products; Third Party Relationships; Non-IT Business Systems; and IT 
Systems. With respect to the IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems, the 
Y2K Plan consists of four separate but overlapping phases: Phase I - Inventory 
and Risk Assessments; Phase II - Remediation Cost Estimation; Phase III - 
Remediation; and Phase IV - Remediation Testing. In addition, the Company 
has an ongoing Y2K Awareness Program designed to keep employees informed 
about Y2K issues. The Company's goal is to substantially complete Phase III - 
Remediation during the third quarter of 1999; complete Phase IV - 
Remediation Testing during the fourth quarter of 1999, and to continue 
compliance efforts throughout the remainder of calendar year 1999.  There 
have been no significant changes made to this schedule during the first 
quarter of 1999, and the Company remains on schedule to meet these goals.

The Company designs and manufacturers microprocessor-based personal 
computers, related peripherals, operating system software and application 
software, including Macintosh personal computers and the Mac OS which are 
marketed under the "Apple" brand (collectively "Apple Branded Products"). 


                                      17
<PAGE>
The Company tested certain Apple Branded Products to determine Y2K 
compliance, although such testing did not include third party products bundled 
with Apple Branded Products and certain Apple Branded Products no longer 
supported by the Company. For purposes of this discussion, Y2K compliant 
means a product will not produce errors processing date data in connection 
with the year change from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000, when used 
with accurate date data in accordance with the its documentation, provided all 
other products (including other software, firmware and hardware) used with it 
properly exchange date data with it. A Y2K compliant product will recognize 
the Year 2000 as a leap year. Information regarding the Y2K readiness of all 
Apple Branded Products is available on the Apple corporate web site at 
www.apple.com. Such information is not to be considered part of this quarterly 
report. The Company believes that the unsupported Apple Branded Products 
are Y2K compliant because, unlike other companies personal computers and 
related products, the Company's products do not rely upon the two digit date 
format but used a long word approach which allows the correct representation 
of dates up to the year 2040. The current date and time utilities utilized by 
Apple Branded Products are 64 bit signed value which covers dates from 30081 
BC to  29940 AD. Since the Company does not control the design of non-Apple 
Branded Products or third party products bundled with Apple Branded 
Products, it cannot assure they are Y2K compliant. Certain products acquired 
from NeXT Software, Inc., including OpenStep and NextStep, are not currently 
Y2K compliant. The Company intends to develop and make available during 
the third quarter of 1999 a software patch intended to allow such products to 
become Y2K compliant. 


The Company's business operations are heavily dependent on third party 
corporate service vendors, materials suppliers, outsourced operations 
partners, distributors and others. The Company is working with key external 
parties to identify and attempt to mitigate the potential risks to it of Y2K.  
The failure of external parties to resolve their own Y2K issues in a timely 
manner could result in a material financial risk to the Company.  As part of 
its overall Y2K program, the Company is actively communicating with third 
parties through face to face meetings and correspondence, on an ongoing basis, 
to ascertain their state of readiness.  Although numerous third parties have 
indicated to the Company in writing that they are addressing their Y2K issues 
on a timely basis, the readiness of third parties overall varies widely. 
Because the Company's Y2K compliance is dependent on the timely Y2K 
compliance of third parties, there can be no assurances that the Company's 
efforts alone will resolve all Y2K issues.

The costs of the Y2K program are primarily costs associated with the 
utilization of existing internal resources and incremental external spending. 
The Company previously estimated it had incurred approximately $4.1 million 
of incremental external spending directly associated with Y2K issues through 
the end of fiscal 1998 and that it would incur future incremental external 
spending associated with Y2K issues of approximately $5.1 million to address 
those risks identified as high and medium. There have been no material 
changes to the Company's costs estimates during the first quarter of 1999. 


                                      18
<PAGE>
However, as the Company's Y2K Plan continues, the actual future incremental 
spending may prove to be higher. Also, this estimate does not include the 
costs that could be incurred by the Company if one or more of its significant 
third party service providers fails to achieve Y2K compliance. The Company is 
not separately identifying and including in these estimates the Y2K costs 
incurred that are the result of utilization of the Company's existing internal 
resources. 

Based on current information, the Company believes the Y2K issue will not 
have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no 
assurance that the Y2K remediation by the Company or third parties will be 
properly and timely completed, and the failure to do so could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company, its business, results of operations, and its 
financial condition. In particular, the Company has not yet completed its 
assessment of the Y2K readiness of its significant third party service 
providers. Completion of this assessment may result in the identification of 
additional issues which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
results of operations. In addition, important factors that could cause results 
to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the ability of the 
Company to successfully identify systems which have a Y2K issue, the nature 
and amount of remediation effort required to fix the affected system, and the 
costs and availability of labor and resources to successfully address the Y2K 
issues.

Further details regarding the Company's Y2K compliance efforts may be found 
in the 1998 Form 10-K in Item 7 under the heading "Year 2000 Compliance."

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition
The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a 
number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In 
addition to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are 
many factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which 
may cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon 
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the Company 
must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating 
results and a favorable financial condition.

Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future 
operating results and financial condition include, among other things, 
continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any 
reaction by the Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing 
actions by the Company; risks associated with international operations, 
including economic and labor conditions, the continuing economic problems 
being experienced in Asia and Latin America, political instability, tax laws, 
and currency fluctuations; increasing dependence on third-parties for 
manufacturing and other outsourced functions such as logistics; the 

                                      19
<PAGE>
availability of key components on terms acceptable to the Company; the 
continued availability of certain components essential to the Company's 
business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources, 
including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by and obtained from 
IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products in certain 
categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or 
other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace 
of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely 
delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely delivery of 
future versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party software for 
particular applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain 
key employees; the effect of Y2K compliance issues; managing the impact of the 
European Union's transition to the Euro as its common legal currency; the 
Company's ability to retain the operational and cost benefits derived from its 
recently completed restructuring program; and the Company's ability to 
successfully replace its existing transaction systems in the U.S.

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" in 
the Company's 1998 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The information presented below regarding Market Risk contains forward 
looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. The Company's 
actual results may differ significantly from those discussed below and 
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q regarding market risk. . The following discussion 
should be read in conjunction with the 1998 Form 10-K and the condensed 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this 
Form 10-Q.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates 
primarily to the Company's investments and long-term debt obligations and 
related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its investments 
with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit 
exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk 
of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market 
and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months 
or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; 
investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to 
be short-term investments. As of December 26, 1998, there are no investments 
with maturities greater than 12 months.

Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. 
dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected 
by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, 
changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross 
margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.


                                      20
<PAGE>
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with 
financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks 
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed 
transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The 
Company's foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a 
majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. 
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction 
exposures that are immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar 
value or in terms of the related currency's historically high correlation with 
the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value 
in other current liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange 
option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the 
life of the option.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange 
and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and 
opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its 
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, 
option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with 
its underlying foreign currency and interest rate-related exposures, 
respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, 
given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and 
the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no 
assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of 
the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either 
foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting 
for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for 
any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related 
to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the 
Company's consolidated operating results and financial position.

For a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign currency 
related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's 
1998 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the Company's 
exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks since September 25, 1998.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in the 1998 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other 
legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of 
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal 
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of 
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any 
legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its 
financial condition or results of operations.

                             APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

                          (a California corporation)

                    (as amended through December 15, 1998)

                                   Article I

                                    OFFICES

    Section 1.1:      Principal Office.  The principal executive office for the
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop, 
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board of Directors is hereby granted full 
power and authority to change the location of the principal executive office 
from one location to another.

    Section 1.2:      Other Offices.  One or more branch or other subordinate 
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at 
such place or places within or without the State of California as it deems 
appropriate.

                                  Article II

                                  DIRECTORS

    Section 2.1:      Exercise of Corporate Powers.  Except as otherwise 
provided by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this 
corporation or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter in 
force, the business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all 
corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of 
Directors.

    Section 2.2:      Number.  The number of directors of the corporation 
shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of 
directors shall be six (6) until changed within the limits specified above, by 
a by-law amending this section, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by 
the shareholders.  The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a 
definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly 
adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this 
by-law duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of 
the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment 


                                      25
<PAGE>
reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number 
less than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at 
a meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of 
action by written consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding 
shares entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum 
number of authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated 
minimum number of directors minus one.

    Section 2.3:      Need Not Be Shareholders.  The directors of this 
corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.

    Section 2.4:      Compensation.  Directors and members of committees may 
receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed or 
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained 
shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this corporation in 
any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

    Section 2.5:      Election and Term of Office.  The directors shall be 
divided into two classes, designated Class I and Class II.  Each class shall 
consist of one-half of the directors or as close an approximation as possible. 
The initial term of office of the directors of Class I shall expire at the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991 and the initial term of 
office of the directors of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting to be 
held during fiscal year 1992.  At each annual meeting, commencing with the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991, each of the successors to 
the directors of the class whose term shall have expired at such annual 
meeting shall be elected for a term running until the second annual meeting 
next succeeding his or her election and until his or her successor shall have 
been duly elected and qualified.

    Section 2.6:      Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of 
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any 
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the 
shareholders fail, at any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director 
is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be voted for 
at that meeting. The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a 
director if he or she is declared of unsound mind by an order of court or 
convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after notice of his or her 
election, he or she does not accept the office. Any vacancy, except for a 
vacancy created by removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, 
may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the remaining directors 
then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining 
director. Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of removal 
of directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders. The shareholders 
may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the 
directors. Any such election by written consent requires the consent of a 
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling of 
any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been 
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the 
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more 
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote 

                                      26
<PAGE>

for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held to 
elect the entire Board of Directors. The term of office of any director shall 
terminate upon such election of a successor. Any director may resign effective 
upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors of 
this corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the 
effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future 
time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes 
effective. A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove 
any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.

    Section 2.7:      Removal. The entire Board of Directors or any individual 
director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a 
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the 
entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the 
votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, 
would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without 
regard to whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at 
which the same total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by 
written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number 
of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if 
greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then 
being elected. If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be 
elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a 
class or series of shares is entitled to elect one or more directors under 
authority granted by the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the 
provisions of this Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series 
and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

    Section 2.8:      Powers and Duties.  Without limiting the generality or 
extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of 
Directors pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby provided that 
the Board of Directors shall have full power with respect to the following 
matters:

         (a)  To purchase, lease, and acquire any and all kinds of property, 
real, personal or mixed, and at its discretion to pay therefor in money, in 
property and/or in stocks, bonds, debentures or other securities of this 
corporation.

         (b)  To enter into any and all contracts and agreements which in its 
judgment may be beneficial to the interests and purposes of this corporation.

         (c)  To fix and determine and to vary from time to time the amount or 
amounts to be set aside or retained as reserve funds or as working capital of 
this corporation or for maintenance, repairs, replacements or enlargements of 
its properties.

         (d)	 To declare and pay dividends in cash, shares and/or property 
out of any funds of this corporation at the time legally available for the 
declaration and payment of dividends on its shares.
                                      27
<PAGE>

         (e)  To adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of its 
meetings and the management of the affairs of this corporation as it may 
deem proper.

(f)  To prescribe the manner in which and the person or persons by 
whom any or all of the checks, drafts, notes, bills of exchange, contracts 
and other corporate instruments shall be executed.

(g)  To accept resignations of directors; to declare vacant the 
office of a director as provided in Section 2.6 hereof; and, in case of 
vacancy in the office of directors, to fill the same to the extent provided in 
Section 2.6 hereof.

(h)  To create offices in addition to those for which provision is 
made by law or these By-Laws; to elect and remove at pleasure all officers of 
this corporation, fix their terms of office, prescribe their powers and

meeting, which shall be set by such officer, to be not less than 35 days nor

the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to 
present for action by the shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented 
at the meeting for such action except 
38
<PAGE> 

that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal relating to 
approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of this

charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's address 
appearing on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder to 
this corporation for the purpose of notice. If a shareholder gives no address 
or no such address appears on the books of this corporation, notice shall be 
deemed to have been given if sent by mail or other means of written 
                                      36
<PAGE>

communication addressed to the place where the principal executive office of 
this corporation is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the county in which such office is located. The notice 
shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or 
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means 
of written communication and addressed as hereinbefore provided. An affidavit 
of delivery or mailing of any notice in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 10.4, executed by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer 
agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice. If any 
notice addressed to the shareholder at the address of such shareholder 
appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to this corporation by 
the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States 
Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder at such 
address, all future notices shall be deemed to have been duly given without 
further mailing if the same shall be available for the shareholder upon 
written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive office of this 
corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice 
to all other shareholders.

    Section 10.5:     Consent to Shareholders' Meetings. The transactions of 
any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, 
are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and 
notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either 
before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not 
present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to 
the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such 
waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or 
made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting 
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person 
objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business 
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that 
attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the 
consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not 
so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the 
business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting 
of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as 
to approval of contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, 
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation 
or winding up the affairs of this corporation.

    Section 10.6:     Quorum. The presence in person or by proxy of the 
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares 
shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such 
shares at the meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot be 
lawfully voted at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or 
held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business 
until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to 
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is 
approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of 
a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or 
represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 10.6 hereof, 
in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such 
meeting.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days or if after 
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of 
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to 
vote at a meeting. Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any 
notice of 
the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be 
transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such 
adjournment is taken. At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact 
any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

Section 10.8:	Voting Rights. Only persons in whose names shares entitled 
to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close of 
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given 
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next 
preceding the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be fixed 
for the determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section 2.8(k) 
hereof, then on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. In 
the absence of any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in 
any applicable statute relating to the election of directors or to other 
particular matters, each such person shall be entitled to one vote for each 
share.

In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to 
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors 
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which 
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, 
and which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the date upon 
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of 
Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders 
authorize or take corporate action by written consent or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice 
to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The 
Board of Directors shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28) 
days after the date on which such request is received, adopt a resolution 
fixing the record date.

    Section 10.9:     Action by Written Consents.  Any action which may be 
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a 
meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the 
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having 
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to 
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to 
vote thereon were present and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving 
such written consent or consents from shareholders of the corporation, the 
Board of Directors shall determine whether holders of outstanding shares as of 
                                      38
<PAGE>

the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8 having not less than the 
minimum number of votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such 
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present 
and voted have properly consented thereto in writing and notify the requesting 
party of its finding. Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote 
have been solicited in writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) 
contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, (ii) 
indemnification of any person, (iii) reorganization of this corporation or (iv) 
distributions to shareholders upon winding up of this corporation in certain 
circumstances without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall 
be given at least 10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by 
such approval, and prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other 
corporate action approved by shareholders without a meeting by less than 
unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not 
consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.  When written consents 
are given with respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from 
the persons in whose names such shares stand on the books of this corporation 
at the time such respective consents are given, or any shareholder's proxy 
holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the 
shareholder or their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a 
writing received by this corporation prior to the time that written consents 
of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been 
filed with the Secretary of this corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  
Such revocation is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this 
corporation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be 
elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares 
entitled to vote for the election of directors.

    Section 10.10:    Elections of Directors. In any election of directors, the 
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares 
entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by 
such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with 
respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.  
Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a 
shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.

    Section 10.11:    Proxies.  Every person entitled to vote or execute 
consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more 
agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person's 
duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this corporation.  No 
proxy shall be valid (l) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is 
specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and 
applicable law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from the date 
thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time 
for which such proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may be effected by a 
writing delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating that the proxy 
is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the 
meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy.  A proxy is 
not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is 
counted, a written notice of such death or incapacity is received by this 
                                      39
<PAGE>

corporation.  A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for 
the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following or a 
nominee of any of the following: (l) a pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased 
or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person 
who has sold a portion of such person's shares in this corporation to the 
maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor or creditors of this corporation or the 
shareholder who extended or continued credit to this corporation or the 
shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was 
given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the 
name of the person extending or continuing the credit, (4) a person who has 
contracted to perform services as an employee of this corporation, if a proxy 
is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was 
given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the 
employee and the period of employment contracted for, (5) a person designated 
by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust 
agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to 
secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or 
equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the 
obligation secured by it. Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability 
specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option 
or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares 
of this corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is 
paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has 
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust 
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, 
notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares 
without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of 
the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such 
shares. Every form of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity 
to specify approval or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also 
contain an appropriate space marked "abstain", whereby a shareholder may 
indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her shares on the proposal. A 
proxy marked "abstain" by the shareholder with respect to a particular 
proposal shall not be voted either for or against such proposal.  In any 
election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted 
upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder 
"withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to 
vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for 
or against the election of a director.

    Section 10.12:    Inspectors of Election. Before any meeting of 
shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than 
nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its 
adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of 
the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's 
proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. The number of 
inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed 
at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the 
holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall 
determine whether one (l) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any 
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the 
                                      40
<PAGE>

Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a 
shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.

	These inspectors shall:

         (a)  Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power 
of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and 
the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

         (b)  Receive votes, ballots, or consents;

         (c)  Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way 
arising in connection with the right to vote;

         (d)  Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

         (e)  Determine when the polls shall close;

         (f)  Determine the result; and

         (g)  Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or 
vote with fairness to all shareholders.

     Section 10.13:   Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals and Director 
Nominations.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as 
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought 
before a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given 
timely notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such 
nomination or nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a 
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not 
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in the event 
less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the 
meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be 
timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th 
day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was 
mailed or such public disclosure was made.  To be  in proper written form a 
shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address 
of the shareholder who intends to make the nominations or propose the 
business and, as the case may be, of the person or persons to be nominated or 
of the business to be proposed, (ii) a representation that the shareholder is a 
holder of record of stock of the Corporation that intends to vote such stock 
at such meeting and, if applicable, intends to appear in person or by proxy at 
the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (iii) 
if applicable, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the 
shareholder and each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such 
person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be 
made by the shareholder, (iv) such other information regarding each nominee 
or each matter of business to be proposed by such shareholder as would be 
required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A 
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated, or intended 
                                      41
<PAGE>

to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, by 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable, the consent 
of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The chairman of 
a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any 
person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the 
foregoing procedure.


                                  Article XI

                            MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS

    Section 11.1:     Place of Meetings.  Meetings (whether regular, special 
or adjourned) of the Board of Directors of this corporation shall be held at 
the principal office of this corporation for the transaction of business, as 
specified in accordance with Section 1.1 hereof, or at any other place within 
or without the State which has been designated from time to time by resolution 
of the Board or which is designated in the notice of the meeting.

    Section 11.2:     Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Board of 
Directors shall be held after the adjournment of each annual meeting of the 
shareholders (which regular directors' meeting shall be designated the 
"Regular Annual Meeting") and at such other times as may be designated from 
time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Notice of the time and 
place of all regular meetings shall be given in the same manner as for special 
meetings, except that no such notice need be given if (l) the time and place 
of such meetings are fixed by the Board of Directors or (2) the Regular Annual 
Meeting is held at the principal place of business provided at Section 1.1 
hereof and on the date specified in Section 10.2 hereof.

    Section 11.3:     Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of 
Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or  
the President, or any Vice President, or the Secretary or by any two or more 
directors.

    Section 11.4:     Notice of Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the 
Board of Directors shall be held upon no less than four days' notice by mail 
or 48 hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph to each 
director. Notice need not be given to any director who signs a waiver of 
notice or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its 
commencement, the lack of notice to such director. Any oral notice given 
personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a 
person at the home or office of the director who the person giving the notice 
has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. A notice 
or waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any meeting of the Board. 
If the address of a director is not shown on the records and is not readily 
ascertainable, notice shall be addressed to him at the city or place in which 
the meetings of the directors are regularly held. If the meeting is adjourned 
for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place 
shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to all directors not 
present at the time of adjournment.

    Section 11.5:     Quorum.  A majority of all directors elected by the 
shareholders and appointed to fill vacancies as provided in Section 2.6 hereof 
shall constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors for the transaction of 
business. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors 
present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the 
Board of Directors subject to provisions of law relating to interested 
directors and indemnification of agents of this corporation. A majority of the 
directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting 
to another time and place. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present 
may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, 
if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum 
for such meeting.

    Section 11.6:     Conference Telephone.  Members of the Board of Directors 
may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar 
communications equipment, so long as all directors participating in such 
meeting can hear one another.  Participation in a meeting pursuant to this 
Section 11.6 constitutes presence in person at such meeting.

    Section 11.7:     Waiver of Notice and Consent.  The transactions of any 
meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever 
held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular 
call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the 
meeting, each of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a 
consent to holding such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All 
such waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records 
or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

    Section 11.8:     Action Without a Meeting.  Any action required or 
permitted by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a 
meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors shall individually or 
collectively consent in writing to such action.  Such written consent or 
consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of 
Directors. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect 
as the unanimous vote of such directors.

    Section 11.9:     Committees.  The provisions of this Article XI apply 
also to committees of the Board of Directors and action by such committees, 
mutatis mutandis.

money and notes of this corporation, and all written contracts of this 
corporation, shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents, as 
the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.  No officer, agent, or 
employee of this corporation shall have the power to bind this corporation by 
contract or otherwise unless authorized to do so by these By-Laws or by the 
Board of Directors.
                                      43

    Section 12.2:     Shares Held by the Corporation.  Shares in other 
corporations standing in the name of this corporation may be voted or 
represented and all rights incident thereto may be exercised on behalf of the 
corporation by any officer of this corporation authorized so to do by 
resolution of the Board of Directors.

    Section 12.3:     Certificates of Stock.  There shall be issued to every 
holder of shares in this corporation a certificate or certificates signed in 
the name of this corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if 
any, or the Chief Executive Officer or the President or a Vice President and 
by the Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer or the 
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and the 
class or series of shares owned by the shareholder.  Any or all of the 
signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer 
agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed 
upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or 
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by this 
corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer 
agent or registrar at the date of issue.

    Section 12.4:     Lost Certificates.  Where the owner of any certificate 
for shares of this corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, 
stolen or destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of the original
certificate if the owner (l) so requests before this corporation has notice 
that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, 
(2) files with this corporation an indemnity bond in such form and in such 
amount as shall be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a 
Vice President of this corporation, and (3) satisfies any other reasonable 
requirements imposed by this corporation.  The Board of Directors may adopt 
such other provisions and restrictions with reference to lost certificates, 
not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in its discretion deem 
appropriate.

    Section 12.5:     Certification and Inspection of By-Laws.  This 
corporation shall keep at its principal executive or business office the 
original or a copy of these By-Laws as amended or otherwise altered to date, 
which shall be open to inspection by the shareholders at all reasonable times 
during office hours.

    Section 12.6:     Annual Reports.  The making of annual reports to the 
shareholders is dispensed with and the requirement that such annual reports be 
made to shareholders is expressly waived, except as may be directed from time 
to time by the Board of Directors or the President.

    Section 12.7:     Fiscal Quarters.  Each fiscal quarter of the Corporation 
shall be comprised of 13 weeks each of which shall end at midnight on 
Saturday of such week, and the fiscal months in any one calendar quarter shall 
be comprised of at least four consecutive calendar weeks with one week to be 
added, at management's discretion, to any one month during such fiscal year.

    Section 12.8:     Officer Loans and Guaranties.  If the corporation has 
outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons on the date of 
approval by the Board of Directors, the corporation may make loans of money 
or property to, or guarantee the obligations of, any officer of the 
corporation or its parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the officer is a 
director, upon the approval of the Board of Directors alone. Such approval by 
the Board of Directors must be determined by a vote of a majority of the 
disinterested directors, if it is determined that such a loan or guaranty may 
reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. In no event may an officer 
owning 2% or more of the outstanding common shares of the corporation be 
extended a loan under this provision.

                        REFERENCE TO PROVISIONS OF LAW

    Section 13.1:     By-Law Provisions Additional and Supplemental to 
Provisions of Law.  All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other 
provisions of these By-Laws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as 
supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject 
matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said 
provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.

    Section 13.2:     By-Law Provisions Contrary to or Inconsistent with 
Provisions of Law.  Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, 
clause or phrase of these By-Laws which, upon being construed in the manner 
provided in Section 13.1 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any 
applicable provision of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law 
shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or 
applicability of any other portions of these By-Laws, it being hereby declared 
that these By-Laws, and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, 
sentence, clause, or phrase thereof, would have been adopted irrespective of 
the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, 
sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.

                                  Article XIV

    Section 14.1:     By Shareholders.  By-Laws may be adopted, amended or 
repealed by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the 
outstanding shares entitled to vote. By-Laws specifying or changing a fixed 
number of directors  or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a 
fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the 
shareholders; provided, however, that a By-Law or amendment of the Articles 
of Incorporation reducing the number or the minimum number of directors to a 
number less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption 
at a meeting or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written 
consent are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to 
vote.

shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws, By-Laws, other than a By-
Law or amendment thereof specifying or changing a fixed number of directors 
or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable 
board or vice versa, may be adopted, amended or repealed by the Board of 
Directors. A By-Law adopted by the shareholders may restrict or eliminate the 
power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws.

                       RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF STOCK

limiting or restricting the rights of any one or more of them to sell, assign, 
transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or transfer on the books of this 
corporation any or all of the shares of this corporation held by them, and if 
a copy of said agreement shall be filed with this corporation, or if (b) 
shareholders entitled to vote shall adopt any By-Law provision abridging, 
limiting or restricting the aforesaid rights of any shareholders, then, and in 
either of such events, all certificates of shares of stock subject to such 
abridgments, limitations or restrictions shall have a reference thereto 
endorsed thereon by an officer of this corporation and such certificates shall 
not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation except in 
accordance with the terms and provisions of such agreement or ByLaw, as the 
case may be; provided, that no restriction shall be binding with respect to 
shares issued prior to adoption of the restriction unless the holders of such 
shares voted in favor of or consented in writing to the restriction.

                                 Article XVI

                    INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,

Directors, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final 
disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or 
on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately 
be determined that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as 
authorized in this Article XVI.

    Section 16.4:     Indemnity Not Exclusive.  The indemnification provided 
by this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which 
those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, 
vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to 
action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while 
holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to 
indemnification are authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.

    Section 16.5:     Insurance Indemnification.  The corporation shall have 
the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is 
or was an Agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or 
incurred by such person in such capacity or arising out of such person's 
status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to 
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article XVI.

    Section 16.6:     Conflicts.  No indemnification or advance shall be made 
under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or advance is 
mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent 
jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears:

(a)  That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles 
of Incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an 


                                      47

agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the 
action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other 
amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

(b)  That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly 
imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim 
periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire 
year. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying 
notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated 
financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 
25, 1998, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
September 25, 1998 (the 1998 Form 10-K).

During the first quarter of 1999, the Company amended its By-laws to provide 
that beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 1999 each of the Company's 
fiscal quarters would end on Saturday rather than Friday. Accordingly, one 
day was added to the first quarter of 1999 so that the quarter ended on 
Saturday, December 26, 1998. This change did not have a material effect on 
the Company's results of operations for the quarter and had no effect on the 
amount of revenue recognized during the quarter.

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of 
common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number 
of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings

</TABLE>


Options to purchase approximately 85,000 shares of common stock were 
outstanding as of December 26, 1998, that were not included in the 
computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 
26, 1998, because the options' exercise price was greater than the average 
market price of the Company's common stock during the period and, therefore, 
the effect would be antidilutive.	

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible 
subordinated notes (the Notes) which are convertible by their holders into 
approximately 22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of 
$29.205 per share subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. 
The common shares represented by these Notes upon conversion were included 
in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 
December 26, 1998, as the effect of using the if-converted method was dilutive 
for that period. The common shares represented by these Notes were not 
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months 
ended December 26, 1997, because the effect of using the if-converted method 
for those periods would be anti-dilutive. For additional disclosures regarding 
the outstanding preferred stock, employee stock options and the Notes, see the 
1998 Form 10-K.

Note 4 - Equity Investment Gains
As of September 25, 1998, the Company owned 25.9% of the outstanding stock 
of ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a publicly held company in the United Kingdom 
involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related 
technology. Through September 25, 1998, the Company accounted for this 
investment using the equity method. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 
2.9 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $37 million, 
a gain of approximately $32 million recorded as other income, and related 
income tax expense of approximately $3 million.

As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM  fell to 
19%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company 
no longer accounts for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity 
method and has categorized its remaining shares as available for sale 
requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and 
losses reported as a component of shareholders' equity. During the first 
quarter of 1999, the Company increased the carrying value of its remaining 
shares in ARM by $180 million to adjust their total carrying value at 
December 26, 1998, to their market value of approximately $197 million. The 
carrying value of the ARM shares is included in other assets. The total 
unrealized gain net of taxes recognized in other comprehensive income during 
the first quarter of 1999 was approximately $113 million.

Note 5 - Comprehensive Income
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 
No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", beginning with the Company's 
first quarter of 1999. SFAS No. 130 separates comprehensive income into two 
components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other 
comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under 
generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of 
shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. While SFAS No. 130 
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income, 
it has no impact on the Company's net income or total shareholders' equity. 
The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency 
translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as 
their functional currency and from unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
securities categorized as available for sale.  See Note 4 regarding unrealized 
gains on available for sale securities.

The components of comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows
 (in millions):

Note 6 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131, 
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", and in 
June 1998 issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and 
Hedging Activities." A discussion of these accounting standards is included in 
the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the 1998 Form 10-K 
under the subheading "Recent Accounting Pronouncements."


In March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, 
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for 
Internal Use," which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer 
software intended for internal use.  SOP 98-1 must be adopted by the Company 
effective as of fiscal 2000 and is not expected to have a material impact on 
the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position.

During the fist quarter of 1999, the Company adopted AICPA SOP 97-2, 
"Software Revenue Recognition." SOP 97-2 established standards relating to 
the recognition of software revenue. SOP 97-2 was effective for transactions 
entered into by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The 
adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the 
Company's results of operations.

Note 7 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1998 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to 
certain other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary 
course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of 
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion 
of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any 
legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its 
financial condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies 
by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in 
dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income 
tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial 
number of issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still 
remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management 
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from tax examinations.

Note 8 - Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the  Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 
the three months ended December 26, 1997, have been reclassified to conform 
to the 1999 presentation.

Note 9 - Subsequent Events
On February 1, 1999, the Company took further actions to improve the 
flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final 
assembly of certain of its products to original equipment manufacturers. These 
restructuring actions will result in the Company recognizing a charge to 
operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999.

On February 2, 1999, the Company sold 2 million shares of ARM stock for net 
proceeds of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of approximately 
$55 million which will be recognized as other income by the Company in the 
second quarter of 1999. Subsequent to this sale, the Company holds 
approximately 7.3 million shares of ARM stock which represent approximately 
14.9% of the currently outstanding shares.

NM: Not Meaningful

Net income for the first quarter of 1999 includes a $32 million gain before 
tax associated with the sale by the Company of 2.9 million shares of its 
investment in ARM which were recognized as other income. Income tax expense 
recognized in the first quarter on this gain was approximately $3 million.

Net Sales
Net sales for the first quarter of 1999 were $1.71 billion, an 8% increase 
over the same quarter in 1998. The increase in net sales is primarily 
attributable to a year-over-year 49% increase in Macintosh CPU unit volume. 
Volumes were favorably affected by sales of iMac, the Company's moderately 
priced Macintosh system designed for education and consumer markets 
introduced during the fourth quarter of 1998, which represented 55% or 
519,000 of the total Macintosh CPU units sales during the first quarter of 
During the first quarter of 1999, the Company also experienced year-over-year 
unit volume growth in both its Power Macintosh G3 and Powerbook G3 
product lines of 23% and 39%, respectively.  Further contributing to the year-
over-year increase in net sales was approximately $33 million of incremental 
net sales in the first quarter of 1999 related to the introduction MacOS 8.5, 
the most recent version of the Company's Macintosh operating system. The 
positive effect of these factors on first quarter 1999 net sales was partially 
offset by two principal factors. First, average revenue per Macintosh system, 
a function of total net sales related to hardware shipments and total 
Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 26% to $1,776 during the first quarter of 1999 
as compared to the same quarter in 1998. The decline in the average revenue 
per Macintosh system was the result of lower priced iMac systems comprising a 
significant portion of first quarter 1999 net sales, the decline in net sales 
from the phase out of certain peripheral products, and the overall industry 
trend towards lower priced products. Second, net sales of imaging and display 
products decreased by $93 million to $116 million in the first quarter of 1999 
compared with the same quarter in 1998 reflecting the Company's continuing 
phase-out of most imaging and many display products.

Net sales increased sequentially $154 million or 10% during the first quarter 
of 1999 as compared to the fourth quarter of 1998. The sequential revenue 
increase is attributable to a 13% rise in Macintosh unit shipments and 
incremental net sales from MacOS 8.5 upgrades. The rise in unit sales during 
the first quarter is attributable to a 21% increase in iMac unit sales 
compared to the fourth quarter of 1998 and a similar 15% increase in unit 
shipments of Power Macintosh G3 professional Macintosh systems partially 
offset by a 17% sequential decline in unit shipments of G3 Powerbooks 
resulting from the introduction of several new Powerbook models during the 
fourth quarter of 1998.

International sales for the first quarter of 1999 represented 47% of 
consolidated net sales versus 50% in the first quarter of 1998 and 37% during 
the fourth quarter of 1998. In total, international net sales during the first 
quarter of 1999 were relatively unchanged from the same quarter in 1998, but 
rose $229 million or 40% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 1998. This 
sequential increase in international net sales was caused by the introduction 
of the iMac during the current quarter in Europe and Asia and by strong sales 
internationally of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 and Powerbook G3 
product lines. On a year-over-year basis, total Macintosh unit sales during 
the first quarter of 1999 increased 55% in Europe, 26% in Japan, and 33% in 
the rest of Asia. Domestic net sales increased 14% or $114 million during the 
first quarter of 1999 as compared to 1998 while declining sequentially from 
the fourth quarter of 1998 $75 million or 8%.
                                      12
<PAGE>
Consistent with the historical seasonal pattern, the Company anticipates a 
sequential decline in net sales during the second quarter of 1999 but expects 
the second quarter to show year-over-year growth in both net sales and unit 
shipments. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's 
actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set 
forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results 
and Financial Condition".

Gross Margin
Gross margin for the first quarter of 1999 was 28.2% as compared to 22.4% for 
the same quarter in 1998 and 26.8% for the fourth quarter of 1998. The year-
over-year increase in gross margin is attributable to various operational 
changes made by the Company throughout fiscal 1998 that improved 
operational efficiency and reduced product costs. These changes included 
simplification of the Company's product line, focus on the use of industry 
standard parts, expanded use of supplier inventory hubs, outsourcing of 
various aspects of product manufacturing, and streamlining of product 
distribution channels and policies. Margins have also been favorably impacted 
during the last year by the declining cost of various components of the 
Company's products, particularly those sourced from Asia. The sequential 
increase in gross margin from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the first quarter 
of 1999 is primarily attributable to high margin incremental net sales of 
MacOS 8.5 during the current quarter. Such sales accounted for a sequential 
improvement in first quarter 1999 gross margin of approximately 1.5 
percentage points.

The Company expects gross margins to decline sequentially during the second 
quarter of 1999 due to lower net sales of MacOS upgrades and pricing pressure 
on consumer products. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection 
entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

There can be no assurance that current or targeted consolidated gross margin 
levels will be achieved or that current margins on existing individual 
products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on 
individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a 
variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing 
pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential 
increases in the cost of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and 
potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of 
consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. 
In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects that it will 
continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins 
could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality 
problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its 
products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account 
anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, 
the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the 
short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Operating Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $45 
million or 19% during the first quarter of 1999 as compared to both the same 
quarter of 1998 and sequentially over the fourth quarter of 1998. These 
increases are reflective of increased advertising and promotional spending 
during the 1998 holiday season associated with the worldwide introduction of 
iMac and MacOS 8.5. Expenditures for research and development remained 
relatively consistent in terms of absolute dollars between the first quarter 
of 1999, the same quarter in 1998, and the fourth quarter of 1998. 

The Company expects operating expenses to decline sequentially during the 
second quarter of 1999 by approximately $40 to $45 million due to seasonally 
lower marketing expenditures. This expected decline in operating expenses 
does not include the effect of the restructuring charge described in the 
following paragraph. The foregoing statements are forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection 
entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

On February 1, 1999, the Company took further actions to improve the 
flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final 
assembly of certain of its products to original equipment manufacturers. These 
restructuring actions will result in the Company recognizing a charge to 
operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999.


Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the 
Company's debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for 
using the equity method, realized gains and losses on the sale of securities, 
certain foreign exchange gains and losses, and other miscellaneous income and 
expense items. 

As of September 25, 1998, the Company owned 25.9% of the outstanding stock 
of ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a publicly held company in the United 
Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and 
related technology. Through September 25, 1998, the Company accounted for 
this investment using the equity method. On October 14, 1998, the Company 
sold 2.9 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $37 
million, a gain of approximately $32 million recorded as other income, and 
related income tax expense of approximately $3 million.

As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM fell to 19%.  
Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company no 
longer accounts for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity method 
and has categorized its remaining shares as available for sale requiring the 
shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a 
component of shareholders' equity. During the first quarter of 1999, the 

                                      14

<PAGE>
Company increased the carrying value of its remaining shares in ARM by $180 
million to adjust their total carrying value at December 26, 1998, to their 
market value of approximately $197 million. The carrying value of the ARM 
shares is included in other assets. The total unrealized gain net of taxes 
related to ARM shares recognized in other comprehensive income during the 
first quarter of 1999 was approximately $113 million.

On February 2, 1999, the Company sold 2 million shares of ARM stock for net 
proceeds of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of approximately 
$55 million which will be recognized as other income by the Company in the 
second quarter of 1999. Subsequent to this sale, the Company holds 
approximately 7.3 million shares which represent approximately 14.9% of the 
currently outstanding stock of ARM.

Provision for Income Taxes
As of  December 26, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $663 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of December 26, 1998, a valuation allowance of $180 million was recorded 
against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be 
realized. Realization of approximately $73 million of the asset representing 
tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to 
generate approximately $209 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management 
believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, 
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning 
strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior 
to their expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, 
there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of 
future U.S. taxable income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets 
considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates 
of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company 
will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 1999 was only 10% 
due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established 
valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no 
U.S. taxes were provided.

As of December 26, 1998, the Company had approximately $2.58 billion in 
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $278 
million over the same balances at the end of fiscal 1998. During the first 
quarter of 1999, the most significant sources of cash were $152 million of net 
income, declines in net accounts receivable of $42 million and inventory of 
$53 million, and proceeds on the sales of ARM shares of $37 million. These 
factors were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $64 
million. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of December 26, 
1998, and September 25, 1998, include $4 million and $56 million, 
respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit.

The Company's debt ratings are currently non-investment grade. As of March 
27, 1998, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt ratings were 
B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's (S&P) Rating Agency, and 
B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services (Moody's). In June 
1998, Moody's upgraded the Company's senior debt to B2 from B3 and 
subordinated debt to Caa1 from Caa2 citing strengthened debtholder protection 
measurements as the major reason for the upgrade. On November 9, 1998, S&P 
upgraded the Company's senior debt to B+ from B- and upgraded its 
subordinated debt to B- from CCC citing the Company's improved profitability 
and financial profile for the upgrade. Despite these recent upgrades, the 
Company's continued non-investment grade debt ratings will maintain pressure 
on the Company's cost of funds in future periods and may require the Company 
to pledge additional collateral or agree to more stringent debt covenants. 


                                      16
<PAGE>

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over 
the next twelve months. However, given the Company's current debt ratings, if 
the Company should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can no 
assurance that such borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates. The 
inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially 
adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and 
liquidity.


Year 2000 Compliance
The information presented below related to Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance 
contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and 
uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ significantly from 
those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q regarding Year 2000 
compliance.

The Company's Information Systems and Technology department (IS&T) 
began addressing the Y2K issue in 1996 as part of its Next Generation 
strategy, which addressed the need for ongoing enhancement and replacement 
of the Company's various disparate legacy information technology (IT) 
Systems.  In 1998, the Company established a Year 2000 Executive Steering 
Committee (Steering Committee) composed of senior executives of the 
Company and the Company's Year 2000 Project Management Office (PMO).  
The PMO reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
the Steering Committee, and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of 
Directors.

The PMO developed and manages the Company's worldwide Y2K strategic 
plan (Y2K Plan) to address the potential impact of Y2K on the Company's 
operations and business processes. In particular, the Y2K Plan addresses four 
principal areas that may be impacted by the Y2K issue: Apple Branded 
Products; Third Party Relationships; Non-IT Business Systems; and IT 
Systems. With respect to the IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems, the 
Y2K Plan consists of four separate but overlapping phases: Phase I - Inventory 
and Risk Assessments; Phase II - Remediation Cost Estimation; Phase III - 
Remediation; and Phase IV - Remediation Testing. In addition, the Company 
has an ongoing Y2K Awareness Program designed to keep employees informed 
about Y2K issues. The Company's goal is to substantially complete Phase III - 
Remediation during the third quarter of 1999; complete Phase IV - 
Remediation Testing during the fourth quarter of 1999, and to continue 
compliance efforts throughout the remainder of calendar year 1999.  There 
have been no significant changes made to this schedule during the first 
quarter of 1999, and the Company remains on schedule to meet these goals.

The Company designs and manufacturers microprocessor-based personal 
computers, related peripherals, operating system software and application 
software, including Macintosh personal computers and the Mac OS which are 
marketed under the "Apple" brand (collectively "Apple Branded Products"). 


                                      17
<PAGE>
The Company tested certain Apple Branded Products to determine Y2K 
compliance, although such testing did not include third party products bundled 
with Apple Branded Products and certain Apple Branded Products no longer 
supported by the Company. For purposes of this discussion, Y2K compliant 
means a product will not produce errors processing date data in connection 
with the year change from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000, when used 
with accurate date data in accordance with the its documentation, provided all 
other products (including other software, firmware and hardware) used with it 
properly exchange date data with it. A Y2K compliant product will recognize 
the Year 2000 as a leap year. Information regarding the Y2K readiness of all 
Apple Branded Products is available on the Apple corporate web site at 
www.apple.com. Such information is not to be considered part of this quarterly 
report. The Company believes that the unsupported Apple Branded Products 
are Y2K compliant because, unlike other companies personal computers and 
related products, the Company's products do not rely upon the two digit date 
format but used a long word approach which allows the correct representation 
of dates up to the year 2040. The current date and time utilities utilized by 
Apple Branded Products are 64 bit signed value which covers dates from 30081 
BC to  29940 AD. Since the Company does not control the design of non-Apple 
Branded Products or third party products bundled with Apple Branded 
Products, it cannot assure they are Y2K compliant. Certain products acquired 
from NeXT Software, Inc., including OpenStep and NextStep, are not currently 
Y2K compliant. The Company intends to develop and make available during 
the third quarter of 1999 a software patch intended to allow such products to 
become Y2K compliant. 


The Company's business operations are heavily dependent on third party 
corporate service vendors, materials suppliers, outsourced operations 
partners, distributors and others. The Company is working with key external 
parties to identify and attempt to mitigate the potential risks to it of Y2K.  
The failure of external parties to resolve their own Y2K issues in a timely 
manner could result in a material financial risk to the Company.  As part of 
its overall Y2K program, the Company is actively communicating with third 
parties through face to face meetings and correspondence, on an ongoing basis, 
to ascertain their state of readiness.  Although numerous third parties have 
indicated to the Company in writing that they are addressing their Y2K issues 
on a timely basis, the readiness of third parties overall varies widely. 
Because the Company's Y2K compliance is dependent on the timely Y2K 
compliance of third parties, there can be no assurances that the Company's 
efforts alone will resolve all Y2K issues.

The costs of the Y2K program are primarily costs associated with the 
utilization of existing internal resources and incremental external spending. 
The Company previously estimated it had incurred approximately $4.1 million 
of incremental external spending directly associated with Y2K issues through 
the end of fiscal 1998 and that it would incur future incremental external 
spending associated with Y2K issues of approximately $5.1 million to address 
those risks identified as high and medium. There have been no material 
changes to the Company's costs estimates during the first quarter of 1999. 


                                      18
<PAGE>
However, as the Company's Y2K Plan continues, the actual future incremental 
spending may prove to be higher. Also, this estimate does not include the 
costs that could be incurred by the Company if one or more of its significant 
third party service providers fails to achieve Y2K compliance. The Company is 
not separately identifying and including in these estimates the Y2K costs 
incurred that are the result of utilization of the Company's existing internal 
resources. 

Based on current information, the Company believes the Y2K issue will not 
have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no 
assurance that the Y2K remediation by the Company or third parties will be 
properly and timely completed, and the failure to do so could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company, its business, results of operations, and its 
financial condition. In particular, the Company has not yet completed its 
assessment of the Y2K readiness of its significant third party service 
providers. Completion of this assessment may result in the identification of 
additional issues which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
results of operations. In addition, important factors that could cause results 
to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the ability of the 
Company to successfully identify systems which have a Y2K issue, the nature 
and amount of remediation effort required to fix the affected system, and the 
costs and availability of labor and resources to successfully address the Y2K 
issues.

Further details regarding the Company's Y2K compliance efforts may be found 
in the 1998 Form 10-K in Item 7 under the heading "Year 2000 Compliance."

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition
The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a 
number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In 
addition to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are 
many factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which 
may cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon 
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the Company 
must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating 
results and a favorable financial condition.

Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future 
operating results and financial condition include, among other things, 
continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any 
reaction by the Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing 
actions by the Company; risks associated with international operations, 
including economic and labor conditions, the continuing economic problems 
being experienced in Asia and Latin America, political instability, tax laws, 
and currency fluctuations; increasing dependence on third-parties for 
manufacturing and other outsourced functions such as logistics; the 

                                      19
<PAGE>
availability of key components on terms acceptable to the Company; the 
continued availability of certain components essential to the Company's 
business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources, 
including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by and obtained from 
IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products in certain 
categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or 
other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace 
of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely 
delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely delivery of 
future versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party software for 
particular applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain 
key employees; the effect of Y2K compliance issues; managing the impact of the 
European Union's transition to the Euro as its common legal currency; the 
Company's ability to retain the operational and cost benefits derived from its 
recently completed restructuring program; and the Company's ability to 
successfully replace its existing transaction systems in the U.S.

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" in 
the Company's 1998 Form 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The information presented below regarding Market Risk contains forward 
looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. The Company's 
actual results may differ significantly from those discussed below and 
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q regarding market risk. . The following discussion 
should be read in conjunction with the 1998 Form 10-K and the condensed 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this 
Form 10-Q.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates 
primarily to the Company's investments and long-term debt obligations and 
related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its investments 
with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit 
exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk 
of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market 
and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months 
or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; 
investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to 
be short-term investments. As of December 26, 1998, there are no investments 
with maturities greater than 12 months.

Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. 
dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected 
by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, 
changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross 
margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.


                                      20
<PAGE>
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with 
financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks 
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed 
transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The 
Company's foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a 
majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. 
However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction 
exposures that are immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar 
value or in terms of the related currency's historically high correlation with 
the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value 
in other current liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange 
option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the 
life of the option.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange 
and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and 
opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its 
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, 
option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with 
its underlying foreign currency and interest rate-related exposures, 
respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, 
given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and 
the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no 
assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of 
the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either 
foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting 
for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for 
any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related 
to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the 
Company's consolidated operating results and financial position.

For a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign currency 
related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's 
1998 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the Company's 
exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks since September 25, 1998.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in the 1998 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other 
legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of 
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal 
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of 
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any 
legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its 
financial condition or results of operations.

EXHIBIT 3.3
                                   BY-LAWS

                                      OF

                             APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

                          (a California corporation)

                    (as amended through December 15, 1998)

                                   Article I

                                    OFFICES

    Section 1.1:      Principal Office.  The principal executive office for the
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop, 
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board of Directors is hereby granted full 
power and authority to change the location of the principal executive office 
from one location to another.

    Section 1.2:      Other Offices.  One or more branch or other subordinate 
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at 
such place or places within or without the State of California as it deems 
appropriate.

                                  Article II

                                  DIRECTORS

    Section 2.1:      Exercise of Corporate Powers.  Except as otherwise 
provided by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this 
corporation or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter in 
force, the business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all 
corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of 
Directors.

    Section 2.2:      Number.  The number of directors of the corporation 
shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of 
directors shall be six (6) until changed within the limits specified above, by 
a by-law amending this section, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by 
the shareholders.  The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a 
definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly 
adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this 
by-law duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of 
the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment 


                                      25
<PAGE>
reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number 
less than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at 
a meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of 
action by written consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding 
shares entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum 
number of authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated 
minimum number of directors minus one.

    Section 2.3:      Need Not Be Shareholders.  The directors of this 
corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.

    Section 2.4:      Compensation.  Directors and members of committees may 
receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed or 
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained 
shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this corporation in 
any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

    Section 2.5:      Election and Term of Office.  The directors shall be 
divided into two classes, designated Class I and Class II.  Each class shall 
consist of one-half of the directors or as close an approximation as possible. 
The initial term of office of the directors of Class I shall expire at the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991 and the initial term of 
office of the directors of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting to be 
held during fiscal year 1992.  At each annual meeting, commencing with the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991, each of the successors to 
the directors of the class whose term shall have expired at such annual 
meeting shall be elected for a term running until the second annual meeting 
next succeeding his or her election and until his or her successor shall have 
been duly elected and qualified.

    Section 2.6:      Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of 
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any 
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the 
shareholders fail, at any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director 
is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be voted for 
at that meeting. The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a 
director if he or she is declared of unsound mind by an order of court or 
convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after notice of his or her 
election, he or she does not accept the office. Any vacancy, except for a 
vacancy created by removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, 
may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the remaining directors 
then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining 
director. Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of removal 
of directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders. The shareholders 
may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the 
directors. Any such election by written consent requires the consent of a 
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling of 
any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been 
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the 
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more 
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote 

                                      26
<PAGE>

for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held to 
elect the entire Board of Directors. The term of office of any director shall 
terminate upon such election of a successor. Any director may resign effective 
upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors of 
this corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the 
effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future 
time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes 
effective. A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove 
any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.

    Section 2.7:      Removal. The entire Board of Directors or any individual 
director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a 
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the 
entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the 
votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, 
would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without 
regard to whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at 
which the same total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by 
written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number 
of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if 
greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then 
being elected. If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be 
elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a 
class or series of shares is entitled to elect one or more directors under 
authority granted by the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the 
provisions of this Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series 
and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

    Section 2.8:      Powers and Duties.  Without limiting the generality or 
extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of 
Directors pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby provided that 
the Board of Directors shall have full power with respect to the following 
matters:

         (a)  To purchase, lease, and acquire any and all kinds of property, 
real, personal or mixed, and at its discretion to pay therefor in money, in

out of any funds of this corporation at the time legally available for the

(h)  To create offices in addition to those for which provision is 
made by law or these By-Laws; to elect and remove at pleasure all officers of

advisable which is not contrary to law or these By-Laws; and, if it sees fit, 
to require from the officers or any of them security for faithful service.

         (i)  To designate some person to perform the duties and exercise 
the powers of any officer of this corporation during the temporary absence or 
disability of such officer.

         (j)  To appoint or employ and to remove at pleasure such agents and 
employees as it may see fit, to prescribe their titles, powers and duties, 
limit their authority, and fix their salaries in any way it may deem advisable 
which is not contrary to law or these By-Laws; and, if it sees fit, to require 
from them or any of them security for faithful performance.

(k)  To fix a time in the future, which shall not be more than 60 
days nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the meeting nor more than 
sixty (60) days prior to any other action for which it is fixed, as a record 
date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to 
vote at any meeting, or entitled to receive any payment of any dividend or 
other distribution, or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any 
rights in respect of any other lawful action; and in such case only 
shareholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of 
and to vote at the meeting or to receive the dividend, distribution or 
allotment of rights or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, 
notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of this corporation 
after any record date fixed as aforesaid.  The Board of Directors may close 
the books of this corporation against transfers of shares during the whole or 
any part of such period.

         (l)  To fix and locate from time to time the principal office for the 
transaction of the business of this corporation and one or more branch or

adopt, make and use a corporate seal, and to prescribe the forms of

of law now or hereafter in effect.

         (m)  To authorize the issuance of shares of stock of this corporation 
in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the Articles of 
Incorporation of this corporation.

any and all amendments thereof.

corporation, including the power and authority to borrow money from any of 
the shareholders, directors or officers of this corporation, and to cause to

be binding on this corporation.

         (p)  To designate and appoint committees of the Board of Directors

    Section 10.3:     Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders 
for any purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time by the 
President or by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members thereof, or 
by one or more holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent 
(10%) of the votes on the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8.  
Upon request in writing sent by registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer, 
President, Vice President or Secretary, or delivered to any such officer in 
person, by any person or persons entitled to call a special meeting of 
shareholders (such request, if sent by a shareholder or shareholders, to 
include the information required by Section 10.13), it shall be the duty of 
such officer, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, to cause notice 
to be given to the shareholders entitled to vote that a meeting will be 
requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, the date of which 
meeting, which shall be set by such officer, to be not less than 35 days nor 
more than 60 days after such request or, if applicable, determination of the 
validity of such request pursuant to the immediately succeeding sentence.  
Within seven days after receiving such a written request from a shareholder or 
shareholders of the corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine 
whether shareholders owning not less than ten percent (10%) of the shares as 
of the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8 for such request 
support the call of a special meeting and notify the requesting party or 
parties of its finding.

    Section 10.4:     Notice of Meetings.  Notice of any meeting of 
shareholders shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days 
before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat by 
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or other person charged with that 
duty, or if there be no such officer or person, or in case of his or her 
neglect or refusal, by any director or shareholder.  The notice shall state the 
place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, 
the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may 
be transacted, or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which 
the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to 
present for action by the shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented 
at the meeting for such action except 
38
<PAGE> 

that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal relating to 
approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of this 
corporation, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of 
this corporation or winding up of this corporation. The notice of any meeting 
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees 
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for election. 
Written notice shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder, either 
(i)  personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, 
charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's address 
appearing on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder to 
this corporation for the purpose of notice. If a shareholder gives no address 
or no such address appears on the books of this corporation, notice shall be 
deemed to have been given if sent by mail or other means of written 
                                      36
<PAGE>

communication addressed to the place where the principal executive office of 
this corporation is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the county in which such office is located. The notice 
shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or 
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means 
of written communication and addressed as hereinbefore provided. An affidavit 
of delivery or mailing of any notice in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 10.4, executed by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer 
agent, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of the notice. If any 
notice addressed to the shareholder at the address of such shareholder 
appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to this corporation by 
the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United States 
Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice to the shareholder at such 
address, all future notices shall be deemed to have been duly given without 
further mailing if the same shall be available for the shareholder upon 
written demand of the shareholder at the principal executive office of this 
corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice 
to all other shareholders.

    Section 10.5:     Consent to Shareholders' Meetings. The transactions of 
any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, 
are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and 
notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either 
before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not 
present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to 
the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such 
waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or 
made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting 
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person 
objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business 
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that 
attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the 
consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not 
so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the 
business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting 
of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as 
to approval of contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, 
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation 
or winding up the affairs of this corporation.

    Section 10.6:     Quorum. The presence in person or by proxy of the 
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares 
shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such 
shares at the meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot be 
lawfully voted at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or 
held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business 
until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to 
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is 
approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

                                      37
<PAGE>

    Section 10.7:     Adjourned Meetings. Any shareholders' meeting, whether 
or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of 
a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or 
represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 10.6 hereof, 
in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such 
meeting.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days or if after 
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of 
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to 
vote at a meeting. Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any 
notice of 
the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be 
transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such 
adjournment is taken. At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact 
any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

Section 10.8:	Voting Rights. Only persons in whose names shares entitled 
to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close of 
business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given 
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next 
preceding the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be fixed 
for the determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section 2.8(k) 
hereof, then on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. In 
the absence of any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in 
any applicable statute relating to the election of directors or to other 
particular matters, each such person shall be entitled to one vote for each 
share.

In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to 
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors 
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which 
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, 
and which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the date upon 
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of 
Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders 
authorize or take corporate action by written consent or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice 
to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The 
Board of Directors shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28) 
days after the date on which such request is received, adopt a resolution 
fixing the record date.

    Section 10.9:     Action by Written Consents.  Any action which may be 
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a 
meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the 
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having 
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to 
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to 
vote thereon were present and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving 
such written consent or consents from shareholders of the corporation, the 
Board of Directors shall determine whether holders of outstanding shares as of 
                                      38
<PAGE>

the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8 having not less than the 
minimum number of votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such 
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present 
and voted have properly consented thereto in writing and notify the requesting 
party of its finding. Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote 
have been solicited in writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) 
contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, (ii) 
indemnification of any person, (iii) reorganization of this corporation or (iv) 
distributions to shareholders upon winding up of this corporation in certain 
circumstances without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall 
be given at least 10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by 
such approval, and prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other 
corporate action approved by shareholders without a meeting by less than 
unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not 
consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.  When written consents 
are given with respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from 
the persons in whose names such shares stand on the books of this corporation 
at the time such respective consents are given, or any shareholder's proxy 
holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the 
shareholder or their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a 
writing received by this corporation prior to the time that written consents 
of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been 
filed with the Secretary of this corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  
Such revocation is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this 
corporation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be 
elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares 
entitled to vote for the election of directors.

    Section 10.10:    Elections of Directors. In any election of directors, the 
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares 
entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by 
such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with 
respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.  
Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a 
shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.

    Section 10.11:    Proxies.  Every person entitled to vote or execute 
consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more 
agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person's 
duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this corporation.  No 
proxy shall be valid (l) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is 
specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and 
applicable law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from the date 
thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time 
for which such proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may be effected by a 
writing delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating that the proxy 
is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the 
meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy.  A proxy is 
not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is 
counted, a written notice of such death or incapacity is received by this 
                                      39
<PAGE>

corporation.  A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for 
the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following or a 
nominee of any of the following: (l) a pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased 
or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person 
who has sold a portion of such person's shares in this corporation to the 
maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor or creditors of this corporation or the 
shareholder who extended or continued credit to this corporation or the 
shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was 
given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the 
name of the person extending or continuing the credit, (4) a person who has 
contracted to perform services as an employee of this corporation, if a proxy 
is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was 
given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the 
employee and the period of employment contracted for, (5) a person designated 
by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust 
agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to 
secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or 
equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the 
obligation secured by it. Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability 
specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option 
or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares 
of this corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is 
paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has 
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust 
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, 
notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares 
without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of 
the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such 
shares. Every form of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity 
to specify approval or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also 
contain an appropriate space marked "abstain", whereby a shareholder may 
indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her shares on the proposal. A 
proxy marked "abstain" by the shareholder with respect to a particular 
proposal shall not be voted either for or against such proposal.  In any 
election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted 
upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder 
"withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to 
vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for 
or against the election of a director.

    Section 10.12:    Inspectors of Election. Before any meeting of 
shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than 
nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its 
adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of 
the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's 
proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. The number of 
inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed 
at a meeting on the request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the 
holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall 
determine whether one (l) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any 
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the 
                                      40
<PAGE>

Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a 
shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.

	These inspectors shall:

         (a)  Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power 
of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and 
the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

         (b)  Receive votes, ballots, or consents;

         (c)  Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way 
arising in connection with the right to vote;

         (d)  Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

         (e)  Determine when the polls shall close;

         (f)  Determine the result; and

         (g)  Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or 
vote with fairness to all shareholders.

     Section 10.13:   Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals and Director 
Nominations.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as 
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought 
before a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given 
timely notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such 
nomination or nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a 
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not 
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in the event 
less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the 
meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be 
timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th 
day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was 
mailed or such public disclosure was made.  To be  in proper written form a 
shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address 
of the shareholder who intends to make the nominations or propose the 
business and, as the case may be, of the person or persons to be nominated or 
of the business to be proposed, (ii) a representation that the shareholder is a 
holder of record of stock of the Corporation that intends to vote such stock 
at such meeting and, if applicable, intends to appear in person or by proxy at 
the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (iii) 
if applicable, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the 
shareholder and each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such 
person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be 
made by the shareholder, (iv) such other information regarding each nominee 
or each matter of business to be proposed by such shareholder as would be 
required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A 
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated, or intended 
                                      41
<PAGE>

to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, by 
the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable, the consent 
of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The chairman of 
a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any 
person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the 
foregoing procedure.


                                  Article XI

                            MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS

    Section 11.1:     Place of Meetings.  Meetings (whether regular, special 
or adjourned) of the Board of Directors of this corporation shall be held at 
the principal office of this corporation for the transaction of business, as 
specified in accordance with Section 1.1 hereof, or at any other place within 
or without the State which has been designated from time to time by resolution 
of the Board or which is designated in the notice of the meeting.

    Section 11.2:     Regular Meetings.  Regular meetings of the Board of 
Directors shall be held after the adjournment of each annual meeting of the 
shareholders (which regular directors' meeting shall be designated the 
"Regular Annual Meeting") and at such other times as may be designated from 
time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Notice of the time and 
place of all regular meetings shall be given in the same manner as for special 
meetings, except that no such notice need be given if (l) the time and place 
of such meetings are fixed by the Board of Directors or (2) the Regular Annual 
Meeting is held at the principal place of business provided at Section 1.1 
hereof and on the date specified in Section 10.2 hereof.

    Section 11.3:     Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of 
Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or  
the President, or any Vice President, or the Secretary or by any two or more 
directors.

    Section 11.4:     Notice of Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the 
Board of Directors shall be held upon no less than four days' notice by mail 
or 48 hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph to each 
director. Notice need not be given to any director who signs a waiver of 
notice or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its 
commencement, the lack of notice to such director. Any oral notice given 
personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a 
person at the home or office of the director who the person giving the notice 
has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. A notice 
or waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any meeting of the Board. 
If the address of a director is not shown on the records and is not readily 
ascertainable, notice shall be addressed to him at the city or place in which 
the meetings of the directors are regularly held. If the meeting is adjourned 
for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place 
shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to all directors not 
present at the time of adjournment.
                                      42
<PAGE>
    Section 11.5:     Quorum.  A majority of all directors elected by the 
shareholders and appointed to fill vacancies as provided in Section 2.6 hereof 
shall constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors for the transaction of 
business. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors 
present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the 
Board of Directors subject to provisions of law relating to interested 
directors and indemnification of agents of this corporation. A majority of the 
directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting 
to another time and place. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present 
may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, 
if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum 
for such meeting.

    Section 11.6:     Conference Telephone.  Members of the Board of Directors 
may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar 
communications equipment, so long as all directors participating in such 
meeting can hear one another.  Participation in a meeting pursuant to this 
Section 11.6 constitutes presence in person at such meeting.

    Section 11.7:     Waiver of Notice and Consent.  The transactions of any 
meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever 
held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular 
call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the 
meeting, each of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a 
consent to holding such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All 
such waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records 
or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

    Section 11.8:     Action Without a Meeting.  Any action required or 
permitted by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a 
meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors shall individually or 
collectively consent in writing to such action.  Such written consent or 
consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of 
Directors. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect 
as the unanimous vote of such directors.

    Section 11.9:     Committees.  The provisions of this Article XI apply 
also to committees of the Board of Directors and action by such committees, 
mutatis mutandis.


                                 Article XII

                              SUNDRY PROVISIONS

    Section 12.1:     Instruments in Writing.  All checks, drafts, demands for 
money and notes of this corporation, and all written contracts of this 
corporation, shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents, as 
the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.  No officer, agent, or 
employee of this corporation shall have the power to bind this corporation by 
contract or otherwise unless authorized to do so by these By-Laws or by the 
Board of Directors.
                                      43

    Section 12.2:     Shares Held by the Corporation.  Shares in other 
corporations standing in the name of this corporation may be voted or 
represented and all rights incident thereto may be exercised on behalf of the 
corporation by any officer of this corporation authorized so to do by 
resolution of the Board of Directors.

    Section 12.3:     Certificates of Stock.  There shall be issued to every 
holder of shares in this corporation a certificate or certificates signed in 
the name of this corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if 
any, or the Chief Executive Officer or the President or a Vice President and 
by the Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer or the 
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and the 
class or series of shares owned by the shareholder.  Any or all of the 
signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer 
agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed 
upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or 
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by this 
corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, transfer 
agent or registrar at the date of issue.

    Section 12.4:     Lost Certificates.  Where the owner of any certificate 
for shares of this corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, 
stolen or destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of the original
certificate if the owner (l) so requests before this corporation has notice 
that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, 
(2) files with this corporation an indemnity bond in such form and in such 
amount as shall be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a 
Vice President of this corporation, and (3) satisfies any other reasonable 
requirements imposed by this corporation.  The Board of Directors may adopt 
such other provisions and restrictions with reference to lost certificates, 
not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in its discretion deem 
appropriate.

    Section 12.5:     Certification and Inspection of By-Laws.  This 
corporation shall keep at its principal executive or business office the 
original or a copy of these By-Laws as amended or otherwise altered to date, 
which shall be open to inspection by the shareholders at all reasonable times 
during office hours.

    Section 12.6:     Annual Reports.  The making of annual reports to the 
shareholders is dispensed with and the requirement that such annual reports be 
made to shareholders is expressly waived, except as may be directed from time 
to time by the Board of Directors or the President.

    Section 12.7:     Fiscal Quarters.  Each fiscal quarter of the Corporation 
shall be comprised of 13 weeks each of which shall end at midnight on 
Saturday of such week, and the fiscal months in any one calendar quarter shall 
be comprised of at least four consecutive calendar weeks with one week to be 
added, at management's discretion, to any one month during such fiscal year.


                                      44

    Section 12.8:     Officer Loans and Guaranties.  If the corporation has 
outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons on the date of 
approval by the Board of Directors, the corporation may make loans of money 
or property to, or guarantee the obligations of, any officer of the 
corporation or its parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the officer is a 
director, upon the approval of the Board of Directors alone. Such approval by 
the Board of Directors must be determined by a vote of a majority of the 
disinterested directors, if it is determined that such a loan or guaranty may 
reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. In no event may an officer 
owning 2% or more of the outstanding common shares of the corporation be 
extended a loan under this provision.

                                  Article XIII

                        CONSTRUCTION OF BY-LAWS WITH
                        REFERENCE TO PROVISIONS OF LAW

    Section 13.1:     By-Law Provisions Additional and Supplemental to 
Provisions of Law.  All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other 
provisions of these By-Laws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as 
supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject 
matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said 
provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.

    Section 13.2:     By-Law Provisions Contrary to or Inconsistent with 
Provisions of Law.  Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, 
clause or phrase of these By-Laws which, upon being construed in the manner 
provided in Section 13.1 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any 
applicable provision of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law 
shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or 
applicability of any other portions of these By-Laws, it being hereby declared 
that these By-Laws, and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, 
sentence, clause, or phrase thereof, would have been adopted irrespective of 
the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, 
sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.

                                  Article XIV

                   ADOPTION, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL OF BY-LAWS

    Section 14.1:     By Shareholders.  By-Laws may be adopted, amended or 
repealed by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the 
outstanding shares entitled to vote. By-Laws specifying or changing a fixed 
number of directors  or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a 
fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the 
shareholders; provided, however, that a By-Law or amendment of the Articles 
of Incorporation reducing the number or the minimum number of directors to a 
number less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption 
at a meeting or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written 
consent are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to 
vote.

                                      45

    Section 14.2:     By the Board of Directors.  Subject to the right of 
shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws, By-Laws, other than a By-
Law or amendment thereof specifying or changing a fixed number of directors 
or the maximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable 
board or vice versa, may be adopted, amended or repealed by the Board of 
Directors. A By-Law adopted by the shareholders may restrict or eliminate the 
power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws.


                                  Article XV

                       RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF STOCK

    Section 15.1:     Subsequent Agreement or By-Law.  If (a) any two or more 
shareholders of this corporation shall enter into any agreement abridging, 
limiting or restricting the rights of any one or more of them to sell, assign, 
transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or transfer on the books of this 
corporation any or all of the shares of this corporation held by them, and if 
a copy of said agreement shall be filed with this corporation, or if (b) 
shareholders entitled to vote shall adopt any By-Law provision abridging, 
limiting or restricting the aforesaid rights of any shareholders, then, and in 
either of such events, all certificates of shares of stock subject to such 
abridgments, limitations or restrictions shall have a reference thereto 
endorsed thereon by an officer of this corporation and such certificates shall 
not thereafter be transferred on the books of this corporation except in 
accordance with the terms and provisions of such agreement or ByLaw, as the 
case may be; provided, that no restriction shall be binding with respect to 
shares issued prior to adoption of the restriction unless the holders of such 
shares voted in favor of or consented in writing to the restriction.

                                 Article XVI

                    INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
                          EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS


    Section 16.1:     Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  The 
corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the 
Code, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (as 
defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements, and 
other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any 
proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by reason of 
the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation.  For purposes 
of this Article XVI, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any 
person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is 
or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of 
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, 
or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a 
predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the 
request of such predecessor corporation.

                                      46
<PAGE>

    Section 16.2:     Indemnification of Others.  The corporation shall have 
the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Code, to indemnify 
each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against 
expenses (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, 
settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection 
with any proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by 
reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation.  
For purposes of this Article XVI, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation 
(other than a director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an 
employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the 
request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an 
employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the 
corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor 
corporation.

    Section 16.3:     Payment of Expenses in Advance.  Expenses incurred in 
defending any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification 
is required pursuant to Section 16.1 or for which indemnification is permitted 
pursuant to Section 16.2 following authorization thereof by the Board of 
Directors, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final 
disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or 
on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately 
be determined that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as 
authorized in this Article XVI.

    Section 16.4:     Indemnity Not Exclusive.  The indemnification provided 
by this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which 
those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, 
vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to 
action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while 
holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to 
indemnification are authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.

    Section 16.5:     Insurance Indemnification.  The corporation shall have 
the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is 
or was an Agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or 
incurred by such person in such capacity or arising out of such person's 
status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to 
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article XVI.

    Section 16.6:     Conflicts.  No indemnification or advance shall be made 
under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or advance is 
mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent 
jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears:

(a)  That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles 
of Incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an 


                                      47
<PAGE>


agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the 
action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other 
amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

(b)  That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly 
imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
