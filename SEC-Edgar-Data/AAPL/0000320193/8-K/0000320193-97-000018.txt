  	Apple Names Steve Jobs Interim CEO


           Cupertino, Calif.--Sept. 16, 1997--At its first
           regularly scheduled meeting last week, Apple's
           new Board of Directors formalized the role of
           Steve Jobs by naming him interim Chief
           Executive Officer of the Company until a new
           CEO is named.

           At this meeting, the Board of Directors also
           met with its executive recruiter, John Thompson
           of Heidrick & Struggles, to review the status
           of its search for a CEO. The Board expects that
           a new CEO will be named before the end of the
           year.

           Jobs, Apple's co-founder and newly appointed
           member of the Board, has been serving as an
           advisor to Apple's Board and executive
           management team for several months.

           Apple Computer, Inc. ignited the personal
           computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple
           II, and reinvented the personal computer in the
           1980s with the Macintosh. Apple is now
           recommitted to its original mission - to bring
           the best personal computing products and
           support to students, educators, designers,
           scientists, engineers, businesspersons and
           consumers in over 140 countries around the
           world.

  	Apple Names Steve Jobs Interim CEO


           Cupertino, Calif.--Sept. 16, 1997--At its first
           regularly scheduled meeting last week, Apple's
           new Board of Directors formalized the role of
           Steve Jobs by naming him interim Chief
           Executive Officer of the Company until a new
           CEO is named.

           At this meeting, the Board of Directors also
           met with its executive recruiter, John Thompson
           of Heidrick & Struggles, to review the status
           of its search for a CEO. The Board expects that
           a new CEO will be named before the end of the
           year.

           Jobs, Apple's co-founder and newly appointed
           member of the Board, has been serving as an
           advisor to Apple's Board and executive
           management team for several months.

           Apple Computer, Inc. ignited the personal
           computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple
           II, and reinvented the personal computer in the
           1980s with the Macintosh. Apple is now
           recommitted to its original mission - to bring
           the best personal computing products and
           support to students, educators, designers,
           scientists, engineers, businesspersons and
           consumers in over 140 countries around the
           world.
