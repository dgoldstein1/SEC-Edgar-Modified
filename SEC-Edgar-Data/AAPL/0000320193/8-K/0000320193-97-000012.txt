Apple Board Announces the Resignation of Chairman and CEO Gil Amelio

CUPERTINO, Calif. July 9, 1997 Apple today announced that Dr. Gilbert F. 
Amelio, after consultation with Apple's board of directors, has resigned his 
positions as chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and that the 
Company is initiating a search for a new CEO. 

Until a new CEO is hired, Fred Anderson, executive vice president and chief 
financial officer, will assume additional responsibilities for the Company's 
day-to-day operations, working closely with the board and the executive 
management team, which includes:
	Fred Anderson - executive vice president and chief financial officer
	Guerrino De Luca - executive vice president, Marketing
	Dave Manovich - executive vice president, Worldwide Sales and Service
	Jack Douglas - senior vice president, General Counsel and Secretary
	Jim McCluney - senior vice president, Operations
	Jon Rubinstein - senior vice president, Hardware Engineering
	Avie Tevanian - senior vice president, Software Engineering

During the interim period, Apple's co-founder and strategic advisor Steve Jobs 
will assume an expanded role as a key advisor to Apple's board and executive 
management team.

Heading the search for a new CEO will be a committee composed of Board Vice 
Chairman A.C. Markkula Jr., Apple Board Director and Chairman of the Board of 
E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. Edgar S. Woolard Jr., Executive Vice President 
and Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson, and Apple's strategic advisor Steve

"In recent months, Apple has made significant progress in addressing the crises 
which were threatening its viability," said Woolard. "In pursuit of the best 
interest of our shareholders and our customers, we now want to move forward 
and return the Company to growth and sustainable profitability. We believe that 
with a customer focused CEO and Apple's product and technology portfolio, the 
Company will have the necessary ingredients to return to success."

"The Company has improved its cash position, reduced operating expenses and 
improved product quality" said Anderson. "We have also introduced a series of 
outstanding products, developed a long-term operating system strategy and 
consolidated our marketing and sales organizations. The executive management 
team is committed to continue to build on this foundation".

with a customer focused CEO and Apple's product and technology portfolio, the 
Company will have the necessary ingredients to return to success."
