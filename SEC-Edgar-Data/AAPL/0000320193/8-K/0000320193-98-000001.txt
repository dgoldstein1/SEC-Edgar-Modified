Apple Expects First Quarter Profits To Top $45 Million

 MACWORLD EXPO, SAN FRANCISCO--Jan.6, 1998--Apple Computer, Inc. today 
announced that it expects to report net profits exceeding $45 million on 
revenues of approximately $1.575 billion when it reports its fiscal 1998 first
quarter financial results on Jan. 14, 1998.

"We are thrilled that our new plans are beginning to work," said Steve Jobs, 
Apple's Interim CEO. "While there is still lots of work to do, Apple is clearly
coming back as a major player."

First quarter profitability was primarily due to higher gross margins and 
continued cost cutting. The Company also benefited from the following new 
products and initiatives announced during the quarter:

              * Apple's new Power Macintosh G3 computers,
                launched on Nov. 10, 1997 significantly
                outsold Apple's forecasts for the
                quarter--over 133,000 units shipped versus
                a forecast of 80,000 units--becoming
                Apple's most successful new product launch
                in history. Power Macintosh G3 computers
                outperform the fastest Intel Pentium II
                based computers, yet are priced
                competitively with systems from Dell and
                Gateway.

              * The on-line Apple Store
                (http://www.apple.com) has become one of
                the top-ten grossing e-commerce sites on
                the Internet since opening its e-doors on
                Nov. 10, 1997.

              * Apple's new build-to-order manufacturing
                worked, confounding skeptics. Apple now
                offers its Power Macintosh G3 computers in
                over 500 custom configurations through its
                on-line Apple Store and its new
                build-to-order manufacturing. Thousands of
                orders were received and shipped during
                the quarter.


<PAGE>                                5



              * Apple's new partnership with CompUSA, the
                world's largest computer retailer, is
                producing results. During the quarter
                CompUSA outfitted 57 of its computer
                superstores with dedicated Apple "store
                within a store" environments, sending
                CompUSA's Macintosh sales soaring. In the
                beginning of the quarter, Macintosh sales
                were 3 percent of CompUSA's overall PC
                business. Now, in the 57 stores outfitted
                in the store within a store format,
                Macintosh sales are 14 percent of
                CompUSA's PC business. CompUSA expects all
                of their computer superstores to be
                outfitted with the new Apple environments
                by February.

Jobs kicked off Apple's second fiscal quarter with his Macworld keynote 
address. He was joined onstage by senior executives from Microsoft, Oracle, 
Macromedia and Broderbund--four of the more than 50 software developers 
announcing new or updated products for the Macintosh at Macworld.

Microsoft announced that Office 98 Macintosh Edition would begin shipping 
later this month--months ahead of their Windows version.  This version of 
Office offers Macintosh users advanced functionality, such as self-repairing
applications, not currently available to Windows users. In addition, Apple 
announced Mac OS 8.1, an updated version of the successful Mac OS 8 software 
launched last August, and demonstrated QuickTime 3.0, the newest release
of Apple's industry standard multimedia software.

Apple Computer, Inc. ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s 
with the Apple II, and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the 
Macintosh. Apple is now recommitted to its original mission--to bring the best
personal computing products and support to students, educators, designers,
scientists, engineers, businesspersons and consumers in over 140 countries 
around the world.

These statements regarding estimated results are preliminary and based on 
partial information and management assumptions. The Company expects to 
announce its actual results for the first quarter of fiscal 1998 on Jan.
14, 1998.

The information in this release regarding expected revenues and profitability 
is forward looking and preliminary. Actual final results for the quarter could 
differ depending on a number of factors, including accounting adjustments made
during the course of closing the quarter and the roll-up of actual financial
data from the Company's various business units. For a more detailed discussion 
of factors that affect the Company's operating results, interested parties 
should review the Company's SEC reports, including Apple's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended Sept. 26, 1997.

Apple Expects First Quarter Profits To Top $45 Million

 MACWORLD EXPO, SAN FRANCISCO--Jan.6, 1998--Apple Computer, Inc. today 
announced that it expects to report net profits exceeding $45 million on 
revenues of approximately $1.575 billion when it reports its fiscal 1998 first
quarter financial results on Jan. 14, 1998.

"We are thrilled that our new plans are beginning to work," said Steve Jobs, 
Apple's Interim CEO. "While there is still lots of work to do, Apple is clearly
coming back as a major player."

First quarter profitability was primarily due to higher gross margins and 
continued cost cutting. The Company also benefited from the following new 
products and initiatives announced during the quarter:

              * Apple's new Power Macintosh G3 computers,
                launched on Nov. 10, 1997 significantly
                outsold Apple's forecasts for the
                quarter--over 133,000 units shipped versus
                a forecast of 80,000 units--becoming
                Apple's most successful new product launch
                in history. Power Macintosh G3 computers
                outperform the fastest Intel Pentium II
                based computers, yet are priced
                competitively with systems from Dell and
                Gateway.

              * The on-line Apple Store
                (http://www.apple.com) has become one of
                the top-ten grossing e-commerce sites on
                the Internet since opening its e-doors on
                Nov. 10, 1997.

              * Apple's new build-to-order manufacturing
                worked, confounding skeptics. Apple now
                offers its Power Macintosh G3 computers in
                over 500 custom configurations through its
                on-line Apple Store and its new
                build-to-order manufacturing. Thousands of
                orders were received and shipped during
                the quarter.


<PAGE>                                5



              * Apple's new partnership with CompUSA, the
                world's largest computer retailer, is
                producing results. During the quarter
                CompUSA outfitted 57 of its computer
                superstores with dedicated Apple "store
                within a store" environments, sending
                CompUSA's Macintosh sales soaring. In the
                beginning of the quarter, Macintosh sales
                were 3 percent of CompUSA's overall PC
                business. Now, in the 57 stores outfitted
                in the store within a store format,
                Macintosh sales are 14 percent of
                CompUSA's PC business. CompUSA expects all
                of their computer superstores to be
                outfitted with the new Apple environments
                by February.

Jobs kicked off Apple's second fiscal quarter with his Macworld keynote 
address. He was joined onstage by senior executives from Microsoft, Oracle, 
Macromedia and Broderbund--four of the more than 50 software developers 
announcing new or updated products for the Macintosh at Macworld.

Microsoft announced that Office 98 Macintosh Edition would begin shipping 
later this month--months ahead of their Windows version.  This version of 
Office offers Macintosh users advanced functionality, such as self-repairing
applications, not currently available to Windows users. In addition, Apple 
announced Mac OS 8.1, an updated version of the successful Mac OS 8 software 
launched last August, and demonstrated QuickTime 3.0, the newest release
of Apple's industry standard multimedia software.

Apple Computer, Inc. ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s 
with the Apple II, and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the 
Macintosh. Apple is now recommitted to its original mission--to bring the best
personal computing products and support to students, educators, designers,
scientists, engineers, businesspersons and consumers in over 140 countries 
around the world.

These statements regarding estimated results are preliminary and based on 
partial information and management assumptions. The Company expects to 
announce its actual results for the first quarter of fiscal 1998 on Jan.
14, 1998.

The information in this release regarding expected revenues and profitability 
is forward looking and preliminary. Actual final results for the quarter could 
differ depending on a number of factors, including accounting adjustments made
during the course of closing the quarter and the roll-up of actual financial
data from the Company's various business units. For a more detailed discussion 
of factors that affect the Company's operating results, interested parties 
should review the Company's SEC reports, including Apple's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended Sept. 26, 1997.
