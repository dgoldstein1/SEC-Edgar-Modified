             Apple Announces $500 Million Stock Repurchase Program

CUPERTINO, California July 14, 1999
Apple today announced a plan to repurchase up to $500 million of its
common stock.

       "Apple's Board of Directors believes that the Company's stock is a
good long term investment," said Steve Jobs, Apple's interim CEO. "We are
confident in Apple's future and believe this repurchase program will produce
long term benefits for the Company and our shareholders."

Under the plan, the stock will be purchased in the open market or privately
negotiated transactions from time to time in compliance with the SEC's
Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and
other factors. The repurchase plan does not obligate Apple to acquire any
specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time.

Apple Computer, Inc. ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s
with the Apple II, and reinvented the personal computer in the 1980s with the
Macintosh. Apple is now recommitted to its original mission to bring the best
personal computing products and support to students, educators, designers,
scientists, engineers, businesspersons and consumers in over 140 countries
around the world.
