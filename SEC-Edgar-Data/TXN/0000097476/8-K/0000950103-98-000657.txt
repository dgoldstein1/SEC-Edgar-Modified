                               PRESS RELEASE

           Texas Instruments Adopts New Stockholder Rights Plan

Dallas (June 19, 1998) -- Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE:TXN)
announced today that its Board of Directors has adopted a new Stockholder
Rights Plan to replace the rights plan that expired on June 17, 1998.

Under the new plan, which is substantially similar to the expired plan,
Rights will be distributed as a dividend at the rate of one Right for each
share of common stock of the company held by stockholders of record at the
close of business on June 30, 1998.  Each Right will entitle stockholders
to buy, upon occurrence of certain events, one unit of a share of preferred
stock for $200.

The Rights generally will be exercisable only if a person or group
acquires beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of the company's common
stock, or commences a tender or exchange offer that, upon consummation,
would result in a person or group owning 20 percent or more of the
company's common stock.

Under certain circumstances the new Rights are redeemable at a price of 1
cent per Right and will expire on June 18, 2008.
