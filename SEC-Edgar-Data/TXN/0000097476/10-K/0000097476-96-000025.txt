                                     PART I

ITEM 1.   Business. 

General
- -------
          Texas Instruments Incorporated (hereinafter the "Registrant," 
including subsidiaries except where the context indicates otherwise) is 
engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of a variety of products in 
the electrical and electronics industry for industrial, government, and 
consumer markets.  These products consist of components, defense systems and 
electronics, and digital products.  The Registrant also produces metallurgical 
materials.  In addition, the Registrant's patent portfolio has been 
established as an ongoing contributor to the Registrant's revenues.  The 
Registrant's business is based principally on its broad semiconductor 
technology and application of this technology to selected electronic end-
equipment markets.  The Registrant from time to time considers acquisitions 
and divestitures which may alter its business mix.  The Registrant may effect 
one or more such transactions at such time or times as the Registrant 
determines to be appropriate.  

          The information with respect to net revenues, profit and 
identifiable assets of the Registrant's industry segments and operations 
outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the financial 
statements captioned "Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations" on 
pages 35-37 of the Registrant's 1995 annual report to stockholders, is 
incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

Components
- ----------
          Components consist of semiconductor integrated circuits (such as 
digital signal processors, mixed signal and analog circuits, microprocessors/ 
microcontrollers, applications processors, memories, and digital circuits), 
semiconductor discrete devices, semiconductor subassemblies (such as custom 
modules for specific applications), and electrical and electronic control 
devices (such as motor protectors, starting relays, circuit breakers, 
thermostats, sensors, and radio-frequency identification systems).

          These components are used in a broad range of products for 
industrial end-use (such as computers and peripheral equipment, 
telecommunications, instrumentation, and industrial motor controls and 
automation equipment), consumer end-use (such as televisions, cameras, 
automobiles, home appliances, and residential air conditioning and heating 
systems), and government end-use (such as defense and space equipment).  The 
Registrant sells these components primarily to original equipment 
manufacturers principally through its own marketing organizations and to a 
lesser extent through distributors.

Defense Systems and Electronics
- -------------------------------
          Defense systems and electronics consist of radar systems, navigation 
systems, infrared surveillance and fire control systems, defense suppression 
missiles, other weapon systems (including antitank and interdiction weapons), 
missile guidance and control systems, electronic warfare systems, and other 
defense electronic equipment.  Sales are made to the U.S. government (either 
directly or through prime contractors) and to international customers approved 
by the U.S. government.



                                       2



<PAGE>
Digital Products
- ----------------
          Digital products include software productivity tools, mobile 
computing products, printers, and electronic calculators.  Subsequent to year-
end 1995, the Registrant reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the 
Registrant's custom manufacturing services business.

          Digital products are used in a broad range of enterprise-wide, work 
group and personal information-based applications.  The Registrant markets 
these products through various channels, including system suppliers, business 
equipment dealers, distributors, retailers, and direct sales to end-users and 
original equipment manufacturers.

Metallurgical Materials
- -----------------------
          Metallurgical materials include clad metals, precision-engineered 
parts and electronic connectors for use in a variety of applications such as 
appliances, automobiles, electronic components, and industrial and 
telecommunications equipment.  These metallurgical materials are primarily 
sold directly to original equipment manufacturers.

Competition
- -----------
          The Registrant is engaged in highly competitive businesses.  Its 
competitors include several of the largest companies in the United States, 
Asia, and elsewhere abroad as well as many small, specialized companies.  
The Registrant is a significant competitor in each of its principal 
businesses.  Generally, the Registrant's businesses are characterized by 
rapidly changing technology which has, throughout the Registrant's history, 
intensified the competitive factors, primarily performance and price. 

Government Sales
- ----------------
          Net revenues directly from federal government agencies in the United 
States, principally related to the defense systems and electronics segment, 
accounted for approximately 8% of the Registrant's net revenues in 1995.

          Contracts for government sales generally contain provisions for 
cancellation at the convenience of the government.  In addition, companies 
engaged in supplying military equipment to the government are dependent on 
congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, and may be 
affected by changes in government policies resulting from various military and 
political developments.  See "ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings."

Backlog
- -------
          The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by the Registrant to 
be firm was $4528 million as of December 31, 1995 and $3913 million as of 
December 31, 1994.  Approximately 18% of the 1995 backlog (involving defense 
systems and electronics) is not expected to be filled within the current year.
The backlog is significant in the business of the Registrant only as an 
indication of future revenues which may be entered on the books of account of 
the Registrant. 



                                       3



<PAGE>
Raw Materials
- -------------
          The Registrant purchases materials, parts and supplies from a number 
of suppliers.  The Registrant's silicon materials operation became part of a 
joint venture with MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc., in May 1995.  The 
Registrant retains a minority ownership interest in the joint venture.  The 
materials, parts and supplies essential to the Registrant's business are 
generally available at present and the Registrant believes at this time that 
such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable 
future, although the Registrant has experienced some extended lead times on 
certain raw materials, particularly for silicon wafers, because of the rapid 
industry growth over the past three years.

Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
          The Registrant owns many patents in the United States and other 
countries in fields relating to its business.  The Registrant has developed a 
strong, broad-based patent portfolio.  The Registrant also has several 
agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that 
other licenses may be negotiated in the future.  The Registrant does not 
consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent 
license, although taken as a whole, the rights of the Registrant and the 
products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to the 
Registrant's business.  As noted above, the Registrant's patent portfolio has 
been established as an ongoing contributor to the revenues of the Registrant.  
See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations" and "ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings."

          The Registrant owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its 
business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which 
are "Texas Instruments" and the Registrant's corporate monogram. 

Research and Development
- ------------------------
          The Registrant's research and development expense was $927 million 
in 1995 compared with $689 million in 1994 and $590 million in 1993.

Seasonality
- -----------
          The Registrant's revenues are subject to some seasonal variation. 

Employees
- ---------
          The information concerning the number of persons employed by the 
Registrant at December 31, 1995 on page 21 of the Registrant's 1995 annual 
report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual 
report.

Central Expressway, Dallas, Texas.  The Registrant owns and leases plants in 
the United States and 16 other countries for manufacturing and related 
purposes.  The following table indicates the general location of the principal 
plants of the Registrant and the industry segments which make major use of

          The Registrant's facilities in the United States contained 
approximately 18,300,000 square feet as of December 31, 1995, of which 
approximately 4,300,000 square feet were leased.  The Registrant's facilities 
outside the United States contained approximately 7,000,000 square feet as of 
December 31, 1995, of which approximately 1,800,000 square feet were leased. 

          The Registrant believes that its existing properties are in good 
condition and suitable for the manufacture of its products.  At the end of 
1995, the Registrant utilized substantially all of the space in its 
facilities. 

          Leases covering the Registrant's leased facilities expire at varying 
dates generally within the next 10 years.  The Registrant anticipates no 
difficulty in either retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-
month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or replacing the leased 
facilities with equivalent facilities.

ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings.

          On January 1, 1996, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Federal 
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Samsung Electronics 
Co., Ltd. of Korea, and its two U.S. subsidiaries ("Samsung"), seeking 
injunctive relief, alleging that Samsung is infringing several of the 
Registrant's patents relating to the manufacture of semiconductor devices, 
including DRAMs.  Also on that date, Samsung brought a lawsuit in Federal 
District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking injunctive relief 
against the Registrant, alleging that the Registrant is infringing several of 
Samsung's patents, and seeking a declaratory judgment that certain of the 
Registrant's patents are either invalid, not infringed or unenforceable 
against Samsung and that certain of the Registrant's intellectual property 
licensing practices are unfair.  Separately, on January 16, 1996, and 
February 12, 1996, respectively, the Registrant and Samsung filed complaints 
with the International Trade Commission under Section 337 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended, each alleging that the other is engaged in an unfair 
act by importing and selling patent-infringing products in the U.S., and 
each seeking a permanent exclusion order forbidding such importation and 
sales.  See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations."

          On July 19, 1991, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District 
Court against Fujitsu Limited of Japan ("Fujitsu") seeking injunctive relief, 
alleging that Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of certain DRAMs infringe the 
Registrant's Japanese patent on the invention of the integrated circuit (the 
"Kilby" patent).  Concurrently, Fujitsu brought a lawsuit in the same court 
against the Registrant, seeking a declaration that Fujitsu is not infringing 
the Kilby patent.  On August 31, 1994, the district court ruled that Fujitsu's 
production of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K EPROMs does not infringe 
the Kilby patent.  The Registrant has appealed the court's decision to the 
Tokyo High Court.

          The Registrant is included among a number of U.S. defense 
contractors which are currently the subject of U.S. government investigations 
regarding alleged procurement irregularities.  The Registrant is unable to 
predict the outcome of the investigations at this time or to estimate the 
kinds or amounts of claims or other actions that could be instituted against 
the Registrant.  Under present government procurement regulations, such 
investigations could lead to a government contractor's being suspended or 
debarred from eligibility for awards of new government contracts for an 
initial period of up to three years.  In the current environment, even matters 
that seem limited to disputes about contract interpretation can result in 
criminal prosecution.  While criminal charges against contractors have 
resulted from such investigations, the Registrant does not believe such 
charges would be appropriate in its case and has not, at any time, lost its 
eligibility to enter into government contracts or subcontracts under these 
regulations.

          The Registrant is involved in various investigations and proceedings 
conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain state 
environmental agencies regarding disposal of waste materials.  Although the 
factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, the 
Registrant believes that the amount of its liability will not have a material 
adverse effect upon its financial position or results of operations and, in 
most cases, the Registrant's liability will be limited to sharing clean-up or 
other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties.

                     TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
                          As Amended November 30, 1995



The Texas Instruments Annual Incentive Plan is designed to provide an 
additional incentive for those employees who are key to the Company's success 
in the highly technological and competitive industries in which it operates.  
The Plan provides for rewarding certain employees by awards for outstanding 
ability and exceptional service based upon the individual's contribution to the
Company.

For purposes of the Plan unless otherwise indicated, the term "Company" shall 
mean Texas Instruments Incorporated and its subsidiaries of which substantially
all of the voting stock is owned directly or indirectly by Texas Instruments. 

Eligibility

The employees of the Company eligible to receive awards under the Plan shall 
consist of the group of employees (including officers and directors) in 
management or other key positions specified for each year by the Committee 
described below and such other employees as said Committee may designate for 
such year. If an employee takes an approved leave of absence or dies prior to 
a determination of awards to be made under the Plan for a year in which the 
employee was eligible to receive awards under the Plan, such employee on leave 
or the estate of such deceased employee shall be eligible to receive awards 
under the Plan for such year.  Directors who are not full-time or part-time 
officers or employees are not eligible to participate in the Plan.  

Administration of Plan 

The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors which 
shall be known as the Compensation Committee (the Committee) which shall be 
appointed by a majority of the whole Board and shall consist of not less than 
three directors.  The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate 
members of the Committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at 
any meeting of the Committee.  A director may serve as a member or alternate 
member of the Committee only during periods in which he is a "disinterested 
person" as described in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as in effect from time to time.  No member or alternate member of the Committee
shall be eligible, while a member or alternate member, for participation in the
Plan.  The Committee shall have full power and authority to construe, interpret
and administer the Plan.  It may issue rules and regulations for administration
of the Plan.  It shall meet at such times and places as it may determine.  A 
majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and all 
decisions of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all 
parties, including the Company, the stockholders and the employees. 



                                       1



<PAGE>
The Committee shall have the full and exclusive right to make awards under the 
Plan except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan.  In determining the 
selection of recipients and the amount or form of any award, the Committee 
shall take into consideration the contribution of the recipients during the 
fiscal year to the Company's success and such other factors as the Committee 
shall determine.  The Committee shall have the authority to consult with and 
receive recommendations from officers or other executives of the Company with 
regard to these matters.  

The Committee may delegate such power, authority and rights with respect to the
administration of the Plan as it deems appropriate to one or more members of 
the management of the Company (including, without limitation, a committee of 
one or more members of management appointed by the Committee); provided, 
however, that the Committee shall have the exclusive right to make awards to 
employees who are directors or officers of the Company, and that any delegation
to management shall conform with the requirements of the General Corporation 
Law of Delaware, as in effect from time to time.  

Expenses of Administration 

The expenses of the administration of this Plan, including the dividend 
equivalents and interest provided in the Plan, shall be borne by the Company 
and none of them shall be charged against the Incentive Reserve described 
below. 

Amendments 

The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time and from time to time, 
alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any part thereof as it may deem 
proper and in the best interests of the Company, provided, however, that no 
such action shall affect or impair the rights under any award theretofore 
granted under the Plan, except that in the case of an employee employed outside
the United States (or his beneficiary) the Board may vary the provisions of the
Plan as it may deem appropriate to conform with local laws, practices and 
procedures.  Further, unless the stockholders of the Company shall have first 
approved thereof, no amendment shall be made which shall increase the maximum 
amount which may be credited to the Incentive Reserve described below in any 
year.

Awards

Awards may be made from time to time during each year under the Plan by the 
Committee or its delegate(s) in amounts which do not exceed the amount then 
available in the Incentive Reserve described below.  Such awards may be 
denominated in cash, in shares of the Company's common stock, or both, and may 
be payable in cash or shares, or both, as the Committee may determine.

Scope of the Plan

The Committee shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to determine what 
payments to eligible employees shall be deemed to be incentive compensation for
the purposes of this Plan.  Awards under the Company's Patent Incentive Award 
program shall be deemed not to have been made under this Plan and payments 
under the Patent Incentive Award program shall not be charged to the Incentive 
Reserve described below.  Payments under any incentive plans which operational 
organizations of the Company may have from time to time to any employees who 



                                       2



<PAGE>
are then eligible to receive awards under this Plan shall be charged to the 
Incentive Reserve described below.  Special payments to employees involved in 
unusual transactions (including, without limitation, a sale of a portion of the
business of the Company) shall not be charged to the Incentive Reserve 
described below unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  Nothing in this 
Plan shall be construed as preventing the Company from having from time to time
incentive or other variable compensation plans applicable to employees who are 
not then eligible to participate in this Plan, and payments of incentive or 
other variable compensation under such plans to such employees shall not be 
charged to the Incentive Reserve described below.

Incentive Reserve

For the calendar year 1965 and each of the calendar years thereafter, the Board
of Directors shall cause to be credited to an Incentive Reserve (hereinafter 
called the Reserve) an amount determined as follows: 

     10% of the amount by which the Company's net income for such year exceeds 
     6% of net capital but not in excess of the amount paid out as dividends on
     the common stock of the Company during such year, except that the Board 
     may in its discretion direct that a lesser amount be credited.

As used in this Plan

     1.  "Net income" shall mean the amount reported as net income in the 
         annual statement of income for the year as shown by the annual report 
         to stockholders plus interest on long-term debt and amounts credited 
         to the Reserve for such year.

     2.  "Net capital" shall mean the total of stockholders' equity plus long-
         term debt (less current portion) as shown on the balance sheet as of 
         the end of the year preceding the year for which net income, as above,
         is determined plus treasury stock held for the purposes of this Plan.

As soon as practicable after the end of each year, the Company's independent 
auditors shall determine and report to the Board of Directors the maximum 
amount creditable to the Reserve for that year under the provisions of this 
Plan.  The Board shall determine the amount to be credited to the Reserve for 
such year.  Prior to receipt of such report of the auditors, the Board may make
such determination based on an estimate made by the Company's Chief Financial 
Officer of the maximum amount creditable, provided that such a determination 
shall be effective only upon receipt of the auditors' report by the Secretary 
of the Board of Directors and only to the extent of the maximum amount 
creditable to the Reserve, as reported by the auditors.  The amount determined 
by the Board shall be credited to the Reserve as of the close of the year.  The
Committee shall promptly be advised of the amount so credited to the Reserve 
and of the total amount available in the Reserve (after deducting any unpaid 
installments of incentive awards previously granted).

The Committee shall make a determination of awards to be made under the Plan 
for each year at such time or times as the Committee shall deem appropriate.  
The aggregate of such awards may be less than, but shall not exceed, the total 
amount available in the Reserve, except that, after the end of a year and prior
to the Board's determination of an amount to be credited to the Reserve for 
that year, the Committee may make awards in excess of the amount available in 
the Reserve if such awards are made payable only if an amount adequate to cover
such awards is first credited to the Reserve for such year. 



                                       3



<PAGE>
If the aggregate of the awards determined by the Committee to be made under the
Plan for a given year shall at any time be less than the total amount available
in the Reserve, the Committee may at any time or times determine that 
additional awards be made under the Plan for such year, provided that the 
aggregate of all awards for such year shall not exceed the total amount 
available in the Reserve, and that all awards for such year shall be determined
on or before December 31 of the following year. 

If (i) the amount determined and reported by the Company's independent auditors
as the maximum amount creditable to the Reserve for any year shall for any 
reason later prove to have been overstated and (ii) the amount credited to the 
Reserve at the close of such year was in excess of the revised maximum amount 
creditable to the Reserve for that year, then the amount available at that time
or subsequently in the Reserve shall be reduced by the amount of such excess.  
Thus excess credits to the Reserve resulting from such overstatement shall be 
corrected exclusively by adjustment of the Reserve then or subsequently 
available and not by recourse to any person.  

Any balance remaining in the Reserve after making awards for any year shall 
continue in the Reserve and be available for awards for future years except to 
the extent otherwise directed by the Committee.  Any payments that are made by 
the Company, and any incentive awards that are granted by, or become 
obligations of, the Company, through the assumption by the Company of, or in 
substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired company 
shall not, except in the case of payments made to or incentive awards granted 
to employees who are officers or directors of the Company for purposes of 
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, be charged to 
the Reserve.

Payment of Awards

Incentive awards may be made in cash or in Texas Instruments common stock, or 
partly in cash and partly in stock as the Committee in its discretion may 
determine.  Incentive awards made wholly or partly in stock, or any 
installments thereof, may be paid wholly or partly in cash as the Committee in 
its discretion may determine.  

The Company shall make available as and when required a sufficient number of 
shares of its common stock for the purpose of this Plan.  Such common stock 
shall be either authorized and unissued shares or treasury stock. 

Authorized and unissued shares and treasury stock shall be valued for the 
purpose of awards and charged to the Reserve at the simple average of the high 
and the low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite Tape on 
the date the awards are made by the Committee (or if there shall be no trading 
on that date, then on the first previous date on which there is such trading). 
Authorized and unissued shares and treasury stock shall be valued for the 
purpose of payments in cash of awards made in stock, at the simple average of 
the high and the low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite 
Tape on the payment date (or if there shall be no trading on that date, then on
the first previous date on which there is such trading).  

The Committee may direct the awards to the participants or any of them for any 
year to be paid in a single amount or in installments of equal or varying 
amounts and may prescribe such terms and conditions concerning payment of such 
installments as it deems appropriate, including completion of specific periods 
of employment with the Company or achievement of specific goals established by 



                                       4



<PAGE>
the Committee, as it deems appropriate, provided that such terms and conditions
are not more favorable to a participant than those expressly set forth in this 
Plan.  The Committee may determine that dividend equivalents or interest, as 
applicable, will be payable with respect to any installments of any award.  The
Committee may at any time after an incentive award is made amend any such 
direction and may amend or delete any such terms and conditions concerning 
payment of installments, if the Committee deems it appropriate.  

When the obligation to pay an installment or installments of an award has 
terminated for any reason, the amounts relating to such installment or 
installments shall be added back to the Reserve and shall be available for use 
under this Plan.  

Appropriate adjustments in incentive awards payable in Texas Instruments common
stock shall be made to give effect to any mergers, consolidations, 
acquisitions, stock splits, or other relevant changes in capitalization 
occurring after the effective date of this Plan; however, no fractional shares 
shall be distributed. 

Payments of awards to employees of subsidiaries of the Company shall be paid 
directly by such subsidiaries.  

Withholding

Whenever a participant is obligated to pay to the Company an amount required to
be withheld under applicable income tax laws in connection with the payment of 
stock pursuant to an award under this Plan, such payment may be made (a) in 
cash, or (b) to the extent from time to time approved by the Committee, (i) in 
Texas Instruments common stock or (ii) partly in cash and partly in Texas 
Instruments common stock.  For purposes of any payment in Texas Instruments 
common stock, such stock shall be valued at the simple average of the high and 
low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite Tape on the date 
that the payment in stock becomes taxable (or if there is no trading on that 
date, then on the first previous date on which there is such trading).

To Our Stockholders

Nineteen ninety-five was an outstanding year for our company.  We capitalized 
on strong semiconductor operating performance and robust worldwide 
semiconductor market growth to produce the best financial results in company 
history.  The people of TI improved productivity by more than 25 percent, 
measured in net revenue per employee.  We gained significant recognition for 
operational excellence, including the European Quality Award, the Singapore 
Quality Award, and the U.S. Office of Naval Research Best Manufacturing 
Practices Center of Excellence Award.  We laid the foundation for moderate 
growth in our defense business.  

We also established a new vision for Texas Instruments - one that will reshape 
our company over the next decade.

Financial highlights.  TI's revenues in 1995 were $13.1 billion, up 27 percent 
from 1994.  Net income was up 57 percent, exceeding $1 billion for the first 
time, and earnings per share were up 55 percent, to $5.63.  

Semiconductor revenues and profits reached record levels, and productivity 
improvements in this business generated output equivalent to the capacity of 
one major wafer-fabrication facility for the second consecutive year.  Shorter 
cycle times and the Defense Department's movement toward commercial practices 
helped support an improving revenue trend and stable margins in defense 
systems and electronics.  TI's materials and controls business experienced 
solid growth and record revenues for the second consecutive year.  Revenues in 
TI's mobile computing business were up substantially in the fourth quarter of 
1995, reflecting strong customer reception of the Extensa TM line of value-
priced notebook computers.  Our calculator business experienced a record year, 
extending its leadership in instructional calculators.  Our software business 
took actions to streamline operations and focus on strategic areas.

The road ahead.  Even as we were achieving these impressive results, we were 
also setting in place the goals and roadmaps that will lead our company into 
the 21st century.

In our annual report a year ago, we described how the digital revolution is 
changing the way people live, learn, and work.  If anything, the pace of that 
revolution

accelerated in 1995.  During the year, we worked to identify the longer term 
market environment, the core competencies required to meet our customers' 
needs, and the principles that will guide our behavior as we work toward our 
goals.  Out of this strategy process, we established a new goal for Texas 
Instruments:  World Leadership in Digital Solutions for the Networked Society.

- -  World leadership, because the markets we serve are global.  Our customers 
   and suppliers, the end users of our products, our employees, and even our 
   stockholders are in all parts of the world, and we must maintain a deep 
   appreciation of the world's different cultures to succeed.  

   Our goal of world leadership is not limited to our products; we also 
   recognize that as one of the world's leading technology companies, we share 
   responsibility for championing a global economic and political environment 
   in which the networked society can flourish. 

- -  Digital solutions describes both our products and services, and our 
   relationship with our customers.  TI's products and services are based on 
   the collection, processing, transmission, and display of digital 
   information.  We work in partnership with customers and suppliers to create 
   solutions that make it easy for people to connect with each other and with 
   information.

- -  Our customers and the end users of our products are part of a growing 
   worldwide networked society, in which hardware, software, networks, and 
   services are connecting people and information in unprecedented ways.

Why a new set of goals and strategies now?  First, although TI's financial 
performance has improved substantially in the last three years, we believe 
that we have only begun to tap TI's true potential.  We believe that the 
successful execution of our new strategy will lead to financial performance 
that better reflects our capabilities and the growth of our markets.  Second, 
we bring unique strengths to dynamic and growing markets.  We have a strong 
position in technologies that are the fundamental enablers of the networked 
society, including semiconductors, signal processing, mobile computing, 
wireless communications, networking, and digital imaging.

As we achieve this new goal, we will be a fundamentally stronger company than 
the TI of today.

We will be one company, with multiple businesses focused on a common 
objective.  We will make the most of TI's strengths across the company, and we 
will allocate resources based on our ability to compete and win at the company 
level.  We will focus on businesses that expand TI's core competencies in 
microelectronics, signal processing and software, in markets where we have the 
clear opportunity to be recognized among the industry leaders.

We will develop a superior marketing culture.  The essence of this culture is 
innovation driven by market foresight - a commitment to go beyond giving 
customers what they want, in order to build entirely new markets around a deep 
understanding of end users' current and future needs.  

TI's most successful businesses couple market foresight with our technology 
strengths to provide unique solutions.  These include digital signal 
processing solutions in high-speed modems, high-speed disk drives, and 
wireless communications; precision guidance and night-vision technologies for 
defense systems; and instructional calculators for the education market.  The 
common denominator in these successes has been high market share and above-
average returns.  We will build future business strategies on this model.

We will focus on high-growth markets.  Over the past three decades, the world 
semiconductor market has grown at an average rate of about 15 percent per 
year.  The semiconductor content of electronic end equipment is increasing 
rapidly, and new semiconductor markets rapidly emerging in Asia will rival in 
size the markets of Japan and the United States in the next decade.  Because 
of these factors, we believe that the world semiconductor market will grow at 
an average rate of 20 percent or more per year for the remainder of the 
decade, including 1996.  In the near term, TI will be affected by inventory 
corrections and pricing pressure in certain areas of the semiconductor market.

We will invest to win.  To accelerate the company's future growth, TI plans to 
increase capital expenditures in 1996 to about $2.5 billion, up significantly 
from $1.4 billion in 1995.  TI research and development will be increased in 
1996 to about $1.1 billion to support targeted opportunities in digital signal 
processing solutions, advanced memory

and microprocessors, digital imaging technology, and wireless transmission of 
video, voice and data.

Summary and outlook.  For the last three years, the world semiconductor market 
has grown at an average annual rate of more than 30 percent.  Although we 
appear to be entering a period of slower semiconductor industry growth in the 
short term, we intend to step up our investments to strengthen TI's long-term 
position and to build on the gains we've made during the last three years.

Our progress has provided a solid foundation.  But with all that we have 
achieved in the past, the most exciting part of TI's story is still ahead.  
The networked society offers boundless opportunities for our technology and 
our creativity.  TI's core competencies and technologies play right at the 
heart of the digital revolution.  We are in an industry that has the 
opportunity to grow faster in the next decade than it has in its previous 30-
year history.  And TI is better positioned in products and technologies, in 
our global presence, and in our commitment to customers than ever before.

We would like to thank all TI people around the world, whose individual and 
collective efforts produced outstanding results in 1995 and laid a strong 
foundation for the future.  Without question, TI owes its success to the 
thousands of TI people who are making the networked society come to life.  
This is why we will continue to develop our skills, ensure that we have the 
best tools to do the job, develop our leadership, and make the most of our 
teams.  Every day matters as we work toward World Leadership in Digital 
Solutions for the Networked Society.

We were profoundly saddened by the death on September 1, 1995, of TI founder 
J. Erik Jonsson.  Erik served TI and its predecessor company, Geophysical 
Service, for more than 50 years as president, chairman, honorary director, and 
member of the Board Advisory Council.

Erik was a man of great vision.  He embodied the strong ethical and business 
principles on which TI is based.  He will be remembered for his integrity, his 
gentle nature, his wisdom, and his generosity in business, civic, cultural, 
educational, and humanitarian endeavors.

1995 Results of Operations Compared with 1994

TI's orders for 1995 were $13.7 billion, up 32 percent from $10.4 billion in 
1994.  Significantly higher semiconductor orders in the components segment 
were the primary contributor to the change.

TI's net revenues for 1995 were $13.1 billion, up 27 percent from $10.3 
billion in 1994.  The increase was due primarily to higher semiconductor 
revenues in the components segment, resulting from increased shipments and new 
products.  Demand was particularly strong for digital signal processors, 
mixed-signal products and memory.  Profit from operations was $1594 million, 
up 47 percent from $1083 million in 1994.  Higher semiconductor operating 
profits accounted for much of the increase; higher royalties also contributed.
Results for 1995 include a profit sharing accrual of $324 million compared 
with $175 million accrued in 1994.  Results for 1994 included $132 million in 
pretax restructuring and divestiture charges taken in the first quarter.

Net income for the year was $1088 million, compared with $691 million in 1994, 
an increase of 57 percent.  Earnings per share, after the effect of the two-
for-one stock split announced June 15, 1995, were $5.63, versus $3.63 for 
1994.  Consistent with its goal of increasing shareholder value, TI posted a 
return on invested capital (ROIC) of 24.8 percent, up from 19.5 percent in 
1994.

Results for 1995 include significantly higher royalty revenues.

TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1995, was $4528 million, up 
$615 million from the end of 1994, due to an increase in semiconductor 
backlog.

TI R&D was $927 million for 1995 compared with $689 million in 1994.  Capital 
expenditures were $1439 million in 1995, compared with $1076 million in 1994.

To accelerate the company's future growth, TI plans to increase capital 
expenditures in 1996 to about $2.5 billion, and R&D will be increased in 1996 
to about $1.1 billion to support targeted opportunities in digital signal 
processing solutions, advanced memory and microprocessors, digital imaging 
technology, and wireless transmission of video, voice and data.

Depreciation for 1995 was $756 million, compared with $665 million in 1994.  
Depreciation in 1996 is expected to be about $1 billion. 

Components Segment:  Orders in the components segment were up 45 percent for 
the year, and revenues up 39 percent from 1994, with particular strength in 
semiconductors, which grew faster than the segment.  Components segment 
profits were up 66 percent, primarily due to improved semiconductor 
manufacturing productivity and higher royalties.

Semiconductor orders in the fourth quarter of 1995 were up strongly from a 
year ago, but down slightly from the prior

quarter, reflecting some buildup in customer inventories of semiconductors and 
pricing pressures, particularly for dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) and 
standard logic products.  Semiconductor revenues reached record levels for the 
year, primarily due to growth in memory and application specific products.  
Profits, up substantially in 1995 over 1994, also reached record levels.  
Semiconductor operating margins improved in 1995, primarily due to increased 
manufacturing productivity.

In the near term, TI will be affected by inventory corrections and pricing 
pressures in certain areas of the semiconductor market.  The company's DRAM 
joint ventures, which produce about 75 percent of the DRAMs marketed by TI, 
will help reduce the volatility of these market conditions on TI.  However, 
costs associated with new semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities will 
impact the first half of 1996, with little incremental revenue to offset these 
costs until the second half of the year.  TI believes that industry demand for 
memory will continue to experience solid growth in 1996, despite near-term 
inventory corrections and price declines.

Over the past three decades, the world semiconductor market has grown at an 
average rate of about 15 percent per year.  The semiconductor content of 
electronic end equipment is increasing rapidly, and new semiconductor markets 
are rapidly emerging in Asia that will rival the size of major markets like 
Japan and the U.S. in the next decade.  Because of these factors, TI believes 
the world semiconductor market will grow on average 20 percent or more per 
year, including 1996. 

Defense Systems & Electronics Segment:  In TI's defense systems and 
electronics segment, 1995 orders, revenues and margins were essentially flat 
with 1994.

For 1995, increased shipments of Paveway weapons and emerging programs more 
than offset reduced shipments of HARM missiles. Success in 1995 lays the 
foundation for moderate growth for this business in the future. 

During 1995, TI completed three small defense acquisitions that will 
strengthen the company's capabilities in mission planning, logistics 
management and digital battlefield technologies.

Digital Products Segment:  Orders in TI's digital products segment were up 14 
percent in 1995, and revenues up 11 percent, compared with 1994.  The segment 
operated at a loss during the year, due to increased marketing expenses and 
intense price competition in notebook computers, as well as continued 
investments and new product development in communications and electronic 
systems, and in the software business.

TI significantly increased marketing investments in the notebook computer 
business to increase brand awareness and aggressively communicate a strategic 
shift that emphasizes mobility and connectivity in the networked society.  
These investments, coupled with intense price competition, caused the business 
to operate at a loss for the year.  The high levels of marketing investment 
and new product development necessary to improve the competitiveness of this 
business are expected to constrain its near-term financial performance.  TI 
software also operated at a loss for the year.

Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations
(continued)

Subsequent to year-end 1995, the company reached an agreement to sell 
substantially all of its custom manufacturing services business.

Intellectual Property:  TI previously reported that most of the company's 
semiconductor patent-license agreements would expire at the end of 1995 or 
early in 1996.  Remaining licenses, which have expiration dates ranging from 
1998 to 2001, will provide ongoing royalties, and TI continues to expect a 
significant ongoing stream of royalty revenue throughout the remainder of the 
decade.

As previously announced, four licenses expired at the end of 1995.  TI does 
not accrue royalties in the absence of agreements.  Accrued royalty revenue 
from these licenses contributed about $108 million to revenues in the fourth 
quarter of 1995, principally attributable to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. of 
Korea.  These licenses, except for the license with Fujitsu Limited of Japan, 
have not yet been renewed.  The new license with Fujitsu runs until the end of 
2005 and, like the expired license, excludes TI's Kilby patent.  Annual 
payments to TI under the new license will be substantially greater than the 
annual payments under the prior license.  Payments from Fujitsu do not 
represent a significant portion of TI's total royalty revenue.

Additionally, several licenses will expire at the end of the first quarter of 
1996.  Royalty revenue from these licenses was about $40 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1995.  The expiration of these licenses will have no effect on 
first quarter 1996 royalty revenue.

Negotiations continue for renewal of expired and expiring licenses.  Also, the 
company will continue negotiations with computer manufacturers in an effort to 
reach additional computer systems licenses.  However, these negotiations by 
their nature are not predictable as to outcome or timing.

As previously announced, following extensive negotiations with Samsung and the 
expiration of its license, TI filed suit against Samsung and its two U.S. 
subsidiaries, charging them with patent infringement.  In addition to 
unspecified monetary damages, TI is asking the court to issue a permanent 
injunction barring Samsung from using TI's patents.  The litigation was filed 
in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall 
Division, alleging violation of several patents involved in the manufacture of 
semiconductor devices, including DRAMs.

Samsung has filed suit against TI in the Federal District Court for the 
Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, alleging that TI infringes 
several Samsung patents, seeking declaratory judgment that several TI patents 
are invalid or not infringed, and alleging unfair trade practice in TI's 
licensing policy.  Separately, TI and Samsung have filed complaints with the 
International Trade Commission.

Also as previously reported, in 1994, the district court in Tokyo ruled that 
Fujitsu's production of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K EPROMs does not 
infringe the company's Kilby patent.  The company has appealed the court's 
decision to the Tokyo High Court.  The decision should not have any 
significant effect on existing licenses.  As in prior years, TI's negotiations
for renewal of expired and expiring licenses are dependent on the strength of 
the company's entire patent portfolio and not any single patent.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

Financial Condition:  TI's financial condition remains strong.  Cash flow from 
operating activities net of additions to property, plant and equipment was a 
positive $228 million for year 1995.  During the year, cash and cash 
equivalents plus short-term investments increased by $263 million to $1553 
million.  In January 1995 the company reduced to zero (from $125 million) the 
outstanding balance of its asset securitization agreement, and terminated this 
agreement effective January 30, 1995.  TI's year-end 1995 debt-to-total-
capital ratio of .17 is down .04 from the year-end 1994 value.

Unused authorizations for future capital expenditures were $1654 million at 
December 31, 1995.  TI plans to raise capital expenditures in 1996 to about 
$2.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion in 1995.  The company is considering 
various debt financing alternatives in addition to existing cash balances as 
sources of funding for these expenditures.  In this regard, on February 2, 
1996, the company issued $300 million of 6.125 percent notes due 2006.

The company maintains unused lines of credit to support commercial paper 
borrowing and to provide additional liquidity.  Unused lines of credit were 
approximately $538 million at December 31, 1995.  Of this amount, $440 million 
was available to support commercial paper borrowing. 

The company believes that its financial condition provides the foundation for 
continued support of the programs essential to TI's future. 

1994 Results of Operations Compared with 1993  

TI's orders for 1994 were $10.4 billion, up 21 percent from $8.6 billion in 
1993.  Significantly higher semiconductor orders in the components segment 
were the primary contributor to the change.  Defense systems and electronics 
orders increased due primarily to the timing of orders.

TI's net revenues for 1994 were $10.3 billion, up 21 percent from $8.5 billion 
in 1993.  The increase was due primarily to higher semiconductor revenues in 
the components segment, resulting from increased shipments and new products. 
Profit from operations was $1083 million in 1994, up 49 percent from $728 
million in 1993.  Higher semiconductor operating profits accounted for much of 
the increase; higher royalties also contributed.  Results for 1994 included a 
profit-sharing accrual of $175 million compared with $83 million accrued in 
1993.

Net income for the year was $691 million, compared with $472 million for 1993.

Results for the year included one-time royalty revenues of $73 million, 
compared with $90 million in 1993.  Results also included $132 million in 
pretax restructuring and divestiture charges taken in the first quarter of 
1994, compared with $23 million in pretax consolidation charges taken in the 
fourth quarter of 1993.

The income tax provision for 1994 was for U.S. and non-U.S. taxes.  Non-U.S. 
taxes included a benefit from tax loss carry forward utilization reduced by 
certain non-U.S. taxes and losses for which no benefit was recognized.  TI's 
income tax rate for the year was 33.7 percent.  For 1993, the provision was 
net of an increase in deferred tax assets for the effect of the increase in 
the U.S. statutory rate.

TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1994, was $3913 million, up 
$108 million from the end of 1993, due to increases in semiconductor backlog.

TI R&D was $689 million for 1994, compared with $590 million for 1993.  
Customer-funded R&D was $356 million in 1994, compared with $391 million in 
1993.

Capital expenditures were $1076 million in 1994, compared with $730 million in 
1993.

Depreciation for 1994 was $665 million, compared with $617 million in 1993.

Components Segment:  Orders in the components segment were up 27 percent for 
the year, and revenues up 33 percent, from 1993.  Components segment profit 
increased substantially, primarily because of improved semiconductor 
manufacturing productivity and higher royalties.

Defense Systems and Electronics Segment:  In TI's defense systems and 
electronics segment, 1994 orders were up 11 percent from 1993 due to timing of 
orders.  Revenues were down 7 percent from 1993, primarily because of reduced 
shipments of mature production programs.  Margins for the year were 
essentially flat with 1993.

Digital Products Segment:  Orders in TI's digital products segment were up 10 
percent in 1994, and revenues up 14 percent, compared with 1993.  The segment 
operated at a profit for the year, with royalty revenues and profits from the 
personal productivity products business more than offsetting the divestiture 
charges taken in the first quarter of 1994.

Intellectual Property:  During 1994, TI reached new semiconductor patent-
license agreements with Micron Technology Inc. and GoldStar Electron Co., Ltd.

Notes to Financial Statements Accounting Policies and Practices
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective January 1, 1994, the company adopted SFAS No. 115, which required 
that cash equivalent and short-term investment debt securities be stated at 
fair value, instead of the lower of cost or fair value.  This adoption had 
no material effect on the company's financial statements.  Effective 
January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, which required the accrual 
of expected retiree health care benefit costs during the employees' working 
careers, and SFAS No. 109, which required increased recording of deferred 
income tax assets.  This resulted in a 1993 charge of $294 million ($1.57 per 
share) for SFAS No. 106 and a credit of $290 million ($1.54 per share) for 
SFAS No. 109, for the cumulative effect of the accounting changes.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all 
subsidiaries.  The preparation of financial statements requires the use of 
estimates from which final results may vary.  Intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated.  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency 
for financial reporting.  With regard to accounts recorded in currencies other 
than U.S. dollars, current assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, 
other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at 
exchange rates in effect at year end.  Inventories, property, plant and 
equipment and depreciation thereon are remeasured at historic exchange rates.  
Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are 
remeasured at the appropriate month-end rate of exchange.  Net currency 
exchange gains and losses from remeasurement and forward currency exchange 
contracts to hedge net balance sheet exposures are charged or credited on a 
current basis to other income (expense) net.  Gains and losses from forward 
currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge specific 
transactions are included in the measurement of the related transactions.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, current replacement cost or 
estimated realizable value.  Cost is generally computed on a currently 
adjusted standard (which approximates current average costs) or average basis.

Revenues from semiconductor and other commercial products and services are 
generally recognized as products are shipped or services are rendered.  
Revenues under long-term fixed price and fixed-price incentive contracts are 
recognized as deliveries are made or as performance targets are achieved.  
Revenues under long-term cost reimbursement contracts are recorded as costs 
are incurred and include estimated earned fees.  Royalty revenue is recognized 
by the company upon fulfillment of its contractual obligations and 
determination of a fixed royalty amount, or, in the case of ongoing royalties, 
upon sale by the licensee of royalty-bearing products, as estimated by the 
company.

Substantially all depreciation is computed by either the declining-balance 
method (primarily 150 percent declining method) or the sum-of-the-years-digits 
method.  Fully depreciated assets are written off against accumulated 
depreciation.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising expense was $133 
million and $88 million in 1995 and 1994.

Earnings per common and common equivalent share are based on average common 
and common equivalent shares outstanding (193,630,826 shares, 190,854,565 
shares and 187,210,960 shares for 1995, 1994 and 1993).  Shares issuable upon 
exercise of dilutive stock options and upon conversion of dilutive convertible 
debentures and, for 1993, conversion preferred stock are included in average 
common and common equivalent shares outstanding.  In computing per-share 
earnings, net income is reduced by $20 million in 1993 for dividends accrued 
on preferred stock, and increased by $2 million in 1995 and 1994, and $19 
million in 1993 for interest (net of tax and profit sharing effect) and 
dividends on the convertible debentures and conversion preferred stock 
considered dilutive common stock equivalents.  Share amounts have been 
retroactively adjusted for the two-for-one stock split in 1995.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debt securities with original maturities within three months are considered 
cash equivalents.  Debt securities with original maturities beyond three 
months have remaining maturities within 13 months and are considered short-
term investments.  These cash equivalent and short-term investment debt 
securities are available for sale and stated at fair value, which approximates 
their specific amortized cost.  Adjustments to fair value are recorded as an 
increase or decrease in stockholders' equity.  At December 31, 1994, this 
adjustment was a decrease of $1 million.  As of December 31, 1995, these debt 
securities consisted primarily of the following types:  U.S. government ($205 
million), corporate ($667 million), and asset-backed commercial paper ($405 
million).  At December 31, 1994, these debt securities consisted primarily of 
the following types:  U.S. government ($217 million), U.S. state and 
municipalities ($187 million), corporate ($434 million), and asset-backed 
commercial paper ($154 million).  Gross realized and unrealized gains and 
losses for each of these security types were immaterial in 1995 and 1994.  
Proceeds from sales of these cash equivalent and short-term investment debt 
securities in 1995 and 1994 were $190 million and $75 million.

Approximately 26% and 31% of the December 31, 1995 and 1994 inventories 
before progress billings related to long-term contracts.

Inventories related to long-term contracts are stated at actual production 
costs, including manufacturing overhead and special tooling and engineering 
costs, reduced by amounts identified with revenues recognized on units 
delivered or with progress completed.  Such inventories are reduced by 
charging any amounts in excess of estimated realizable value to cost of 
revenues.  The costs attributed to units delivered under long-term contracts 
are based on the esti-

AND SUBSIDIARIES

mated average cost of all units to be produced under existing contracts and 
are determined under the learning curve concept, which anticipates a 
predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become 
more efficient through repetition.  Production costs included in inventories 
in excess of the estimated cost of in-process inventories (on the basis of 
estimated average cost of all units to be produced) were not material.

To secure access to additional semiconductor plant capacity, TI participates 
in several joint ventures formed to construct and operate semiconductor 
manufacturing facilities.  Upon formation of the ventures TI contributed 
technology and cash to acquire minority interests and entered into long-term 
inventory purchase commitments with each joint venture.  Under the agreements, 
TI purchases the output of the ventures at prices based upon percentage 
discounts from TI's average selling prices.  Certain co-venturers have the 
right to buy a portion of the output from TI.  Under the ventures' financing 
arrangements, the venturers have provided certain debt and other guarantees.  
At December 31, 1995 and 1994, TI was contingently liable for an aggregate of 
$40 million and $46 million of such guarantees.  Inventory purchases from the 
ventures aggregated $1,779 million in 1995, $908 million in 1994 and $356 
million in 1993.  Receivables from and payables to the ventures were $25 
million and $223 million at December 31, 1995, and $1 million and $94 million 
at December 31, 1994.

The purpose of the joint ventures is to provide semiconductor output for TI 
and other co-venturers.  As a result, TI expects to recover its cost of the 
ventures through sale of the semiconductor output, and is amortizing its cost 
of the ventures over the expected initial output period of 3 to 5 years, and 
recognizing its share of any cumulative venture net losses in excess of 
amortization.  The related expense charged to operations was $15 million in 
1995, $15 million in 1994 and $27 million in 1993.

The convertible subordinated debentures may be redeemed at the company's 
option at specified prices.  The debentures are convertible at the holder's 
option into an aggregate 2,493,031 shares of TI common stock at a common stock 
conversion price of $41.4375 per share.

A portion of the coupon rates for the notes due 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007 have 
been swapped for commercial-paper-based or LIBOR-based variable rates through 
April 1997, resulting in a combination of fixed plus short-term variable rates 
for an effective interest rate of approximately 9.5% and 9.6% as of 
December 31, 1995 and 1994.  The notes due 1999 may be redeemed at par, at the 
company's option, beginning in July 1996.  The Italian lira mortgage notes, 
and related swaps, are due in installments through 2005.  The mortgage notes 
are collateralized by real estate and building equipment.

Interest incurred on loans in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $69 million, $58 million 
and $55 million.  Of these amounts, $21 million in 1995, $13 million in 1994 
and $8 million in 1993 were capitalized as a component of capital asset 
construction costs.  Interest paid on loans (net of amounts capitalized) was 
$48 million in 1995, $53 million in 1994 and $54 million in 1993.

Aggregate maturities of long-term debt due during the four years subsequent to 
December 31, 1996, are as follows:

Unused lines of credit for short-term financing were approximately $538
million at December 31, 1995 and $547 million at December 31, 1994.  Of these 
amounts, $440 million were available to support commercial paper borrowings.

Financial Instruments and Risk Concentration
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial instruments:  In addition to the swaps discussed in the preceding 
note, as of December 31, 1995, the company has forward currency exchange 
contracts outstanding of $303 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures  
(including $78 million to buy deutsche mark, $40 million to buy Singapore 
dollars, and $36 million to buy yen) and $89 million to hedge specific firm 
commit-

ments for multi-year product sale transactions denominated in pound 
sterling.  At December 31, 1994, the company had forward currency exchange 
contracts outstanding of $314 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures 
(including $64 million to buy yen, $47 million to buy deutsche mark, and $39 
million to buy Singapore dollars) and $116 million to hedge specific firm 
commitments for multi-year product sale transactions denominated in pound 
sterling.  As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the carrying amounts and current 
market settlement values of these swaps and forward contracts were not 
significant, except for the interest rate swaps for the notes due 1999, 2001, 
2003 and 2007 for which the year-end 1995 and 1994 carrying amounts are a 
liability of $1 million and $2 million and the settlement values are a 
liability of approximately $3 million and $34 million.

The forward currency exchange contracts, including the currency interest rate 
swaps for the Italian lira mortgage notes, are used to minimize the adverse 
impacts from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company's non-
U.S. net balance sheet exposures (predominantly receivables, payables and 
accrued expenses) and specific commitments to purchase or sell products.  The 
interest rate swaps for the company's notes due 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007 are 
used to change the characteristics of the interest rate stream on the debt 
from fixed rates to a combination of fixed plus short-term variable rates in 
order to achieve a mix of interest rates which, over time, is expected to 
moderate financing costs.  The effect of these interest rate swaps was to 
increase interest expense by $6 million in 1995 and reduce interest expense by 
$8 million and $12 million in 1994 and 1993.  These interest rate swaps are 
sensitive to interest rate changes.  If short-term interest rates increase  
(decrease) by one percentage point from year-end 1995 rates, annual interest 
expense would increase (decrease) by $6 million.

In order to minimize its exposure to credit risk, the company limits its 
counterparties on the forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate 
swaps to investment-grade rated financial institutions.

As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the fair value of long-term debt, based on 
current interest rates, was approximately $902 million and $830 million, 
compared with the carrying amount of $817 million and $820 million. 

Prior to 1995 the company had an agreement to sell, on a revolving basis, up 
to $175 million of an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated 
pool of accounts receivable, with limited recourse.  Accounts receivable are 
shown net of $125 million at December 31, 1994, and $175 million at 
December 31, 1993, representing receivables sold.  The related discount 
expense, which varied with commercial paper rates, is included in other income 
(expense) net.  In January 1995, the company reduced the outstanding balance 
to zero and terminated the agreement.

Risk concentration:  Financial instruments which potentially subject the 
company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash investments and 
accounts receivable.  The company places its cash investments in investment-
grade, short-term debt securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to 
any one commercial issuer.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the 
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers in the company's 
customer base, and their dispersion across different industries and geographic
areas.  The company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the expected 
collectibility of accounts receivable.

Stockholders' Equity
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.  
Prior to 1994, the company had three series of preferred stock outstanding:  
market auction preferred stock (average dividends declared per share in 1993 
were $2,564); money market preferred stock (average dividends declared per 
share in 1993 were $2,729); and Series A conversion preferred stock.  By the 
end of 1993 all preferred shares had been redeemed by the company and none are 
currently outstanding.

Each outstanding share of the company's common stock carries a stock purchase 
right.  Under certain circumstances, each right may be exercised to purchase 
one one-hundredth of a share of the company's participating cumulative 
preferred stock for $200.  Under certain circumstances following the 
acquisition of 20% or more of the company's outstanding common stock by an 
acquiring person (as defined in the rights agreement), each right (other than 
rights held by an acquiring person) may be exercised to purchase common stock 
of the company or a successor company with a market value of twice the $200 
exercise price.  The rights, which are redeemable by the company at 1 cent per 
right, expire in June 1998.

Stock Options
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The company has stock options outstanding to participants under the Texas 
Instruments Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by stockholders on April 15, 
1993.  Options are also outstanding under the 1984 and 1988 Stock Option 
Plans; however, no further options

AND SUBSIDIARIES



<PAGE>
may be granted under these plans.  Under all these stockholder-approved plans, 
the exercise price per share may not be less than 100 percent of the fair 
market value on the date of the grant.  Options granted become exercisable in 
such amounts, at such intervals and subject to such terms and conditions as 
determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors.

Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company may grant stock options, 
including incentive stock options; restricted stock and restricted stock 
units; performance units; and other stock-based awards, including stock 
appreciation rights.  The plan provides for the issuance of 8,000,000 shares 
of the company's common stock; in addition, if any option under the 1984 or 
1988 Stock Option Plans terminates, then any unissued shares subject to the 
terminated option become available for granting awards under the plan.  No 
more than 1,000,000 shares of common stock may be awarded as restricted stock, 
restricted stock units or other stock-based awards under the plan.

The company also has stock options outstanding under an Employees Stock Option 
Purchase Plan approved by stockholders in 1988.  The plan provides for options 
to be offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of 
the employee's prior year's compensation.  If the optionee authorizes and does 
not cancel payroll deductions which, with interest, will be equal to or 
greater than the purchase price, options granted become exercisable 14 months, 
and expire not more than 27 months, from date of grant.

The FASB has recently issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation," which provides in the future for either recognition or 
disclosure of a hypothetical charge for stock options.  The company does not 
intend to record this hypothetical charge, but will instead provide the 
disclosure in next year's annual report.

Stock option transactions during 1995, 1994 and 1993 were as follows:

Plan in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 16,386 shares, 46,330 shares and 207,852

Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The company provides various incentive plans for employees, including general 
profit sharing and savings programs as well as an annual incentive plan for 
key employees.  The company also provides pension and retiree health care 
benefit plans in the U.S. and pension plans in certain non-U.S. locations.  

Profit sharing:  Profit sharing expense was $324 million in 1995, $175 million 
in 1994 and $83 million in 1993.  Under the plans, unless otherwise provided 
by local law, the company and certain of its subsidiaries contribute a portion 
of their net profits equal to 25% of the amount by which consolidated income 
(as defined) before profit sharing and income taxes exceeds 8% of the 
company's consolidated average assets for the year.  Unless otherwise provided 
by local law, contributions are invested as follows.  For worldwide profit 
sharing earned by eligible participants in 1993 and prior, the contributions 
have been invested in TI common stock.  Subsequent to 1993, certain changes to 
the profit sharing plans have been made to align them more closely with 
applicable industry practices.  For profit sharing earned by U.S. employees in 
1994 and thereafter, several investment options in addition to TI common stock 
have been made available.  And, for 1995 and thereafter, a majority of the 
profit sharing plans worldwide have been changed so that, depending on the 
individual plan, from 50% to 100% of the profit sharing earned by employees is 
not contributed to a deferred plan but is paid as cash to the eligible 
participants.

Except in the event of company contributions in stock, investments in TI 
common stock are made by the trustees through purchases of outstanding shares 
or through purchases of shares offered from time to time by the company.  The 
board of directors has authorized the issuance of previously unissued shares 
for purposes of the plans; 4,616,918 of such shares were available for future 
issuance at December 31, 1995.

Notes to Financial Statements
(continued)

The trustees of the profit sharing plans purchased 4,762,460 outstanding 
shares of TI common stock in 1995 (1,881,815 shares in 1994 and 626,670 shares 
in 1993) and no previously unissued shares in 1995 (403,945 shares in 1994 and 
209,464 shares in 1993) for use in the profit sharing plans and savings 
program.

Savings program:  The company provides a matched savings program whereby U.S. 
employees' contributions of up to 4% of their salary are matched by the 
company at the rate of 50 cents per dollar.  Contributions are subject to 
statutory limitations.  The contributions may be invested in several 
investment funds including TI common stock.  The company's expense under this 
program was $22 million in 1995, $21 million in 1994 and $21 million in 1993.

U.S. pension plan:  The company has a defined benefit plan covering most U.S. 
employees with benefits based on years of service and employee's compensation.
The plan is a career-average-pay plan which has been amended periodically in 
the past to produce approximately the same results as a final-pay type plan.  
The board of directors of the company has expressed an intent to make such 
amendments in the future, circumstances permitting, and the expected effects 
of such amendments have been considered in calculating U.S. pension expense.  
The company's funding policy is to contribute to the plan at least the minimum 
amount required by ERISA.  Plan assets consist primarily of common stock, U.S. 
government obligations, commercial paper and real estate.

Pension expense of the U.S. plan includes the following components:

assets was 9.0%.

Non-U.S. pension plans: Retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees of the 
company is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans.
Retirement benefits are based on years of service and employee's compensation, 
generally during a fixed number of years immediately prior to retirement.  
Funding policies are based on local statutes.  Plan assets consist primarily 
of common stock, government obligations and corporate bonds.

Pension expense of the non-U.S. plans includes the following components:

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED        34               1995 ANNUAL REPORT
AND SUBSIDIARIES



<PAGE>
The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. plans reflects the different 
economic environments within the various countries.  The projected benefit 
obligations were determined using a range of assumed discount rates of 3.25% 
to 8.0% in 1995 and 4.75% to 8.0% in 1994 and a range of assumed average long-
term pay progression rates of 3.5% to 6.0% in 1995 and 4.0% to 6.0% in 1994.  
The range of assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets was 8.0% to 
9.0%.  Accrued pension at December 31 includes approximately $101 million in 
1995 and $83 million in 1994 for two non-U.S. plans that are not funded.  
Pension accounting rules require recognition in the balance sheet of an 
additional minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated 
benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets.  A corresponding 
amount is recognized as an intangible asset, not to exceed the amount of 
unrecognized prior service cost, with the balance recorded as a reduction of 
stockholders' equity.  As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the company has 
recorded an additional non-U.S. minimum pension liability of $56 million and 
$9 million and, for 1995, an equity reduction of $45 million.

Retiree health care benefit plan:  The company's U.S. employees are currently 
eligible to receive, during retirement, specified company-paid medical 
benefits.  The plan is contributory and premiums are adjusted annually.  For 
employees retiring on or after January 5, 1993, the company has specified a 
maximum annual amount per retiree, based on years of service, that it will pay 
toward retiree medical premiums.  For employees who retired prior to that 
date, the company maintains a consistent level of cost sharing between the 
company and the retiree.  The company is pre-funding the plan obligation in 
amounts determined at the discretion of management.  Plan assets consist 
primarily of common stock, U.S. government obligations, commercial paper, and 
obligations of U.S. states and municipalities.

Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which required 
the accrual of expected retiree health care benefit costs during the 
employees' working careers, instead of when the claims are incurred.  The 
company recorded an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $454 
million and a related deferred income tax asset of $160 million, which 
resulted in a 1993 charge of $294 million ($1.57 per share) for the cumulative 
effect of the accounting change.

Expense of the retiree health care benefit plan includes the following 
components:

Retiree health care benefit amounts were determined using health care cost 
trend rates of 8.1% for 1996 decreasing to 6.0% by 1999, and assumed discount 
rates of 7.0% for 1995 and 8.5% for 1994.  Increasing the health care cost 
trend rates by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1995 by $32 million and 1995 plan expense by 
$2 million.  A trust holding a portion of the plan assets is subject to 
federal income taxes at a 39.6% rate.  The assumed long-term rate of return on 
plan assets, after taxes, was 7.3%.

Special actions:  In the first quarter of 1994, the company took a pretax 
charge of $83 million for restructuring of its European operations from the 
traditional country-by-country approach to business centers with pan-European 
responsibilities.  This action primarily affected semiconductor activities and 
is expected to result in annual savings of approximately $54 million when 
fully implemented.  Also taken in the first quarter was a pretax charge of 
$49 million for costs related to the divestiture of nonstrategic product 
lines, primarily in digital products.  The total charges of $132 million 
included non-cash asset write-downs of $31 million with the balance for 
expected cash outlays, including $62 million for severance.  The divestitures 
were essentially completed by the end of 1994.  Completion of the 
restructuring action, which was delayed due to extended negotiations with 
certain European works councils, was essentially completed by the end of 1995.
Of the total expected cash outlays, $41 million was expended during 1994 with 
the balance substantially expended in 1995.  Of the approximately 1,000 
employees, primarily in Europe, affected by the severance actions, 383 left 
the company during 1994, and most of those remaining left in 1995.

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The company is engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a variety 
of products in the electrical and electronics industry for industrial, 
government and consumer markets.  These products and their markets consist of 
the following: components (semiconductors, such as integrated circuits, 
discrete devices

and subassemblies, and electrical and electronic control devices) which are 
sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers principally through the 
company's own marketing organizations and to a lesser extent through 
distributors; defense systems and electronics (such as radar systems, 
navigation systems, infrared surveillance and fire control systems, defense 
suppression missiles, missile guidance and control systems, and electronic 
warfare systems) which are sold to the U.S. government (either directly or 
through prime contractors) and to international customers approved by the U.S. 
government; digital products (such as software productivity tools, mobile 
computing products, printers, and electronic calculators) which are marketed 
through various channels, including system suppliers, business equipment 
dealers, distributors, retailers, and direct sales to end-users and original 
equipment manufacturers.  Subsequent to year-end 1995, the company reached an 
agreement to sell substantially all of its custom manufacturing services 
business, which is part of the digital products segment.  The company also 
produces metallurgical materials (including clad metals, precision-engineered 
parts and electronic connectors) which are primarily sold directly to original 
equipment manufacturers.

The company's business is based principally on its broad semiconductor 
technology and application of this technology to selected electronic end 
equipment markets.

Industry segment and geographic area profit (loss) is not equivalent to income 
before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting changes 
due to exclusion of general corporate expenses, net interest, currency 
exchange gains and losses, and other items along with elimination of 
unrealized profit in assets.  Profit sharing expense is allocated to segment 
results based on payroll costs.  Beginning the fourth quarter of 1995, for 
geographic area purposes responsibility for certain interarea product 
transfers was changed consistent with the company's new pan-European 
operations approach.  The effect of this change on 1995 geographic area 
results was to increase Europe profits and decrease U.S. profits by 
approximately $70 million.  Additionally, prior to 1995, for geographic area 
purposes U.S. interarea product transfers for further processing were recorded 
as cost credits.  In 1995, such transfers are recorded as interarea revenues.  
The effect of this change was to increase 1995 U.S. interarea revenues by 
approximately $960 million.  Prior to 1994, for geographic area purposes 
research and development expense was allocated based on revenues.  In 1994, 
research and development expense is generally reported in the geographic area 
where incurred.  The effect of this change on 1994 geographic area results was 
to decrease U.S. profits by $144 million, decrease Europe losses by $28 
million, increase East Asia profits by $113 million and increase other areas 
profit by $3 million.  Royalty revenue from patent license agreements is 
included in the U.S. geographic net revenues and (except for royalty revenue 
from microcomputer system patent license agreements, which is included in the 
digital products segment) is principally included in the components segment.

Identifiable assets are those associated with segment or geographic area 
operations, excluding unallocated cash and short-term investments, internal 
company receivables and deferred income taxes.  Generally, revenues between 
industry segments and between geographic areas are based on prevailing market 
prices or an approximation thereof.

Income Taxes
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes," which required increased recording of deferred income tax 
assets.  As a result, the company recorded additional deferred income tax 
assets of $203 million, after a valuation allowance of $404 million, and 
reduced deferred income tax liabilities by $87 million, which resulted in a 
1993 credit of $290 million ($1.54 per share) for the cumulative effect of the 
accounting change.

With the exception of interarea elimination of unrealized profit in assets, 
which increased $5 million in 1995, increased $18 million in 1994, and 
increased $1 million in 1993, the remaining corporate items consist primarily 
of general corporate expenses which are applicable to both U.S. and non-U.S. 
operations.  These expenses are generally deductible for tax purposes in the 
U.S.

</TABLE>

Included in the effect of non-U.S. rates for 1995 and 1994 is a $93 million 
and a $69 million benefit from tax loss carryforward utilization reduced by 
certain non-U.S. taxes and losses for which no benefit was recognized.  
Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-
U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are 
expected to result in additional tax liability.  The remaining undistributed 
earnings (approximately $600 million at December 31, 1995) have been 
indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due 
upon remittance of these earnings.  Determination of the amount of 
unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not 
practicable.

The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at 
December 31 were as follows:

                                                       ===================
</TABLE>

As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the net deferred income tax asset of $588 
million and $542 million was presented in the balance sheet, based on tax 
jurisdiction, as deferred income tax assets of $682 million and $580 million 
and deferred income tax liabilities of $94 million and $38 million.  The 
valuation allowance shown above reflects the company's ongoing assessment 
regarding the realizability of certain non-U.S. deferred income tax assets.  
The balance of the deferred income tax assets is considered realizable based 
on carryback potential, existing taxable temporary differences, and 
expectation of future income levels comparable to recent results.  Such future 
income levels are not assured because of the nature of the company's 
businesses, which are generally characterized by rapidly changing technology 
and intense competition.

The company has aggregate non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately 
$121 million.  Of this amount, $73 million expires through the year 2005 and 
$48 million has no expiration.

Income taxes paid were $384 million, $399 million and $231 million for 1995, 
1994 and 1993.

Rental Expense and Lease Commitments
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rental and lease expense was $153 million in 1995, $145 million in 1994 and 
$132 million in 1993.  The company conducts certain operations in leased 
facilities and also leases a portion of its data processing and other 
equipment.  The lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal 
provisions and require the company to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance 
costs.

At December 31, 1995, the company was committed under non-cancelable leases 
with minimum rentals in succeeding years as follows:

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
Texas Instruments Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas 
Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 1995 
and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' 
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Texas 
Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and 
the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

As discussed in the "Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans" and "Income Taxes" 
notes to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company changed its method of 
accounting for retiree health care benefits and income taxes.
