                                     PART I

ITEM 1.   Business. 

Semiconductors
- --------------

Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI," or the "Registrant," including 
subsidiaries except where the context indicates otherwise) is a global 
semiconductor company and the world's leading designer and supplier of digital 
signal processing solutions, the engines driving the digitization of 
electronics.  These digital signal processing solutions consist primarily of 
digital signal processors and mixed-signal/analog devices that convert the 
analog signals of the real world into digital data, then back again as analog 
output.  They enable a wide range of new products and features for TI's more 
than 30,000 customers in industrial, commercial and government end-equipment 
markets.

TI also is a world leader in the design and manufacturing of other 
semiconductor products.  Those products include application-specific 
integrated circuits, reduced instruction-set microprocessors, 
microcontrollers, standard logic, and memories. 

Semiconductors comprised 83% of TI's total revenues in 1997.  TI's 
semiconductor products are used in a diverse range of electronic systems, 
including digital cell phones, pagers, computers, printers, mass storage 
devices, modems, networking equipment, digital cameras and video recorders, 
motor controls, autos, and home appliances.  Products are sold primarily to 
original-equipment manufacturers and through distributors.  In addition, TI's 
semiconductor patent portfolio has been established as an ongoing contributor 
to semiconductor revenues.

The semiconductor business is intensely competitive, subject to rapid 
technological change, and requires high rates of investment.  TI faces strong 
competition in all of its semiconductor product lines.  The rapid pace of 
change and technological breakthroughs constantly create new opportunities for 
existing competitors and start-ups, which can quickly render existing 
technologies less valuable.

In digital signal processors, TI competes with a growing number of large and 
smaller companies, both U.S.-based and international.  New product development 
capabilities, applications support, software knowledge and advanced technology 
are the primary competitive factors in this business. 

The market for mixed-signal/analog devices is highly fragmented.  TI competes 
with many large and smaller companies, both U.S.-based and international.   
Primary competitive factors in this business are the availability of 
innovative designs, a broad range of process technologies and applications 
support and in the standard products area, price. 

In memory, TI competes with a number of very large companies, primarily in 
Japan and Korea.  TI is among the smaller competitors in this highly volatile 
market. Competitive factors in this business are primarily price and 
performance.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
- -----------------------------

From time to time TI considers acquisitions and divestitures that may 
strengthen its business portfolio.  TI may effect one or more of these 
transactions at such time or times as it determines to be appropriate. In 

                                       2

1997, as TI tightened its focus on digital signal processing solutions, it 
announced the acquisition of technology companies that brought unique 
expertise to its core business.  In the first quarter, TI acquired Intersect 
Technologies, Inc., a developer and designer of hardware, software and 
firmware for the mass storage market, a market that increasingly uses digital 
signal processing solutions.  In the fourth quarter, TI acquired Amati 
Communications Corporation, the leading developer of technology for high-speed 
Internet connections, a market expected to reach $6 billion over the next 
decade.  TI also acquired GO DSP Corporation, a developer of software for 
digital signal processors, in the first quarter of 1998. 

In 1997 TI divested various business units.  These divestitures included the 
sale of the mobile computing business to The Acer Group in the first quarter, 
the software business to Sterling Software, Inc. in the second quarter, and 
the defense systems and electronics business (DSE) to Raytheon Company 
("Raytheon") in the third quarter. In accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, the consolidated financial statements have been 
restated to classify DSE as discontinued operations.  Operating results, net 
asset and other information for discontinued operations appear in the note to 
the financial statements captioned "Discontinued Operations" on pages 20-21 of 
TI's 1997 annual report to stockholders; unless otherwise indicated, the 
financial amounts in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect continuing 
operations only.

Other TI Businesses
- -------------------

In addition to semiconductors, TI has two other principal segments.   The 
largest, representing 10% of TI's revenues, is materials and controls.  This 
business sells electrical and electronic controls, electronic connectors, 
sensors, radio-frequency identification systems and clad metals into markets 
such as automotive, heating and air conditioning, and home appliances.   While 
the top supplier in some product areas, TI faces strong multinational 
competitors. The primary competitive factors in this business are product 
reliability, manufacturing costs, and engineering expertise.  The products of 
this business are sold directly to original-equipment manufacturers and 
through distributors.

Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) represents 5 percent of TI's 
revenues and consists largely of educational and graphing calculators. This 
business sells primarily through retailers and to schools through 
instructional dealers.  TI's principal competitors in this business are 
several Japanese companies.  Technology expertise, price and infrastructure 
for education and market understanding are primary competitive factors in this 
business.

In addition, TI continues to invest in digital imaging, an emerging business 
that produces micro-mirror-based devices that enable revolutionary brightness 
and clarity in large-screen video displays.  The primary sales route is 
directly to original-equipment manufacturers.  TI faces competition in this 
business primarily from a competing technology known as liquid crystal 
displays from Asian manufacturers. Primary competitive factors in this 
business are price, brightness and performance of the display, and in some 
applications, size and weight.

General Information
- -------------------

TI is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has manufacturing, design or sales 
operations in more than 25 countries.  TI's largest geographic markets are in 
the United States, Japan and Europe.  TI has been in operation since 1930.

                                       3

           The financial information with respect to TI's business segments 
and operations outside the United States, which is contained in the note to 
the financial statements captioned "Business Segment and Geographic Area Data" 
on pages 30-32 of  TI's 1997 annual report to stockholders, is incorporated 
herein by reference to such annual report.

Backlog
- -------
          The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by the Registrant to 
be firm was $1623 million as of December 31, 1997 and 1996. The Registrant's 
backlog does not represent actual revenues and is only an indication of future 
revenues which may be entered on the books of account of the Registrant. 
Backlog orders are, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation by 
the purchaser without penalty and do not reflect any potential adjustments for 
price decreases.

Raw Materials
- -------------
          The Registrant purchases materials, parts and supplies from a number 
of suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to the Registrant's 
business are generally available at present and the Registrant believes at 
this time that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the 
foreseeable future.

Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
          The Registrant owns many patents in the United States and other 
countries in fields relating to its business.  The Registrant has developed a 
strong, broad-based patent portfolio.  The Registrant also has several 
agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that 
other licenses may be negotiated in the future.  The Registrant does not 
consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent 
license, although taken as a whole, the rights of the Registrant and the 
products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to the 
Registrant's business. The Registrant's patent portfolio has been established 
as an ongoing contributor to the revenues of the Registrant.  

          The Registrant owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its 
business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which 
are "Texas Instruments" and the Registrant's corporate monogram. 

Research and Development
- ------------------------
          The Registrant's research and development expense was $1536 million 
in 1997, compared with $1181 million in 1996 and $842 million in 1995. 
Included is a charge for the value of in-process research and development of 
$461 million in 1997 and $192 million in 1996 as a result of the acquisitions 
of Amati Communications Corporation and Silicon Systems, Inc., respectively. 

Seasonality
- -----------
          The Registrant's revenues are subject to some seasonal variation. 

Employees
- ---------
          The information concerning the number of persons employed by the 
Registrant, at December 31, 1997 on page 35 of the Registrant's 1997 annual 
report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual 
report.

          The Registrant's facilities in the United States contained 
approximately 17,900,000 square feet as of December 31, 1997, of which 
approximately 3,700,000 square feet were leased.  The Registrant's facilities 
outside the United States contained approximately 7,000,000 square feet as of 
December 31, 1997, of which approximately 1,700,000 square feet were leased. 

          The Registrant believes that its existing properties are in good 
condition and suitable for the manufacture of its products.  At the end of 
1997, the Registrant utilized substantially all of the space in its 
facilities. 

          Leases covering the Registrant's leased facilities expire at varying 
dates generally within the next 10 years.  The Registrant anticipates no 
difficulty in either retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-
month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or replacing the leased 
facilities with equivalent facilities.

ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings.


          On July 19, 1991, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District 
Court against Fujitsu Limited of Japan ("Fujitsu") seeking injunctive relief, 
alleging that Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of certain DRAMs infringe the 
Registrant's Japanese patent on the invention of the integrated circuit (the 
"Kilby" patent).  Concurrently, Fujitsu brought a lawsuit in the same court 
against the Registrant, seeking a declaration that Fujitsu is not infringing 
the Kilby patent.  On August 31, 1994, the district court ruled that Fujitsu's 
production of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K EPROMs does not infringe 
the Kilby patent.  The Registrant appealed the court's decision to the 
Tokyo High Court.

          In September 1997, the Tokyo High Court upheld the decision that 
Fujitsu's production of such products does not infringe TI's Kilby patent.  
The Registrant has appealed the ruling to the Japan Supreme Court.  In 
November, the Japan Patent Office invalidated the Kilby patent. The Registrant 
plans to appeal this decision to the Tokyo High Court.  Since the Kilby patent 
expires in 2001, the Registrant does not expect the outcome of either appeal 
to be material.

          The Registrant is involved in various investigations and proceedings 
conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain state 
environmental agencies regarding disposal of waste materials.  Although the 
factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, the 
Registrant believes that the amount of its liability will not have a material 
adverse effect upon its financial position or results of operations and, in 
most cases, the Registrant's liability will be limited to sharing clean-up or 
other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties.

ITEM 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

          Not applicable.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effective for the year, as well as the three months ended December 31, 1997, 
the company adopted SFAS No. 128, which requires disclosure of two new 
earnings per share amounts and elimination of prior earnings per share 
amounts, all on a retroactive basis.  The two new amounts are as follows:  
Diluted earnings per share, whose calculation includes not only average 
outstanding common shares but also the impact of dilutive potential common 
shares such as outstanding common stock options.  Basic earnings per share, 
which includes the effect of outstanding common shares but excludes dilutive 
potential common shares.  Of the two, the company believes diluted earnings 
per share to be the most meaningful due to the inclusion of potential shares.  
Also, effective for the year ended December 31, 1997, the company adopted SFAS 
No. 131, which requires a new basis of determining reportable business 
segments, i.e., the management approach.  This approach (as contrasted with 
the prior requirement which utilized a specified classification system for 
determining segments) designates the company's internal organization as used 
by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the 
source of business segments.  On this basis, the company has three principal 
businesses and, therefore, three reportable business segments:  Semiconductor, 
Materials & Controls, and Educational & Productivity Solutions.  Segment 
results, as well as selected geographic data, are presented on this new basis 
in 1997, as well as retroactively.  Neither of these two new accounting 
pronouncements altered reported net income.  Another new standard, SFAS 
No. 130, will be adopted in first quarter, 1998.  It will require disclosure 
of total nonowner changes in stockholders' equity, which is defined as net 
income plus direct adjustments to stockholders' equity such as equity and cash 
investment adjustments and pension liability adjustments.  This disclosure 
will have no effect on reported net income.

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all 
subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of 
estimates from which final results may vary.  Intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated.  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency 
for financial reporting.  With regard to accounts recorded in currencies other 
than U.S. dollars, current assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, 
other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at 
exchange rates in effect at year end.  Inventories, property, plant and 
equipment and depreciation thereon are remeasured at historic exchange rates.
Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are 
remeasured at the appropriate month-end rate of exchange.  Net currency 
exchange gains and losses from remeasurement and forward currency exchange 
contracts to hedge net balance sheet exposures are charged or credited on a 
current basis to other income (expense) net.  Gains and losses from forward 
currency exchange contracts to hedge specific transactions are deferred and 
included in the measurement of the related transactions.  Gains and losses 
from interest rate swaps are included on the accrual basis in interest 
expense.  Gains and losses from terminated forward currency exchange contracts 
and interest rate swaps are deferred and recognized consistent with the terms 
of the underlying transaction.

    As discussed in the Discontinued Operations footnote, the consolidated 
financial statements have been restated to classify TI's Defense Systems and 
Electronics business as discontinued operations.  This business was sold on 
July 11, 1997.

    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value.
Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard (which 
approximates current average costs) or average basis.


    Revenues are generally recognized as products are shipped.  Royalty 
revenue is recognized by the company upon fulfillment of its contractual 
obligations and determination of a fixed royalty amount, or, in the case of 
ongoing royalties, upon sale by the licensee of royalty-bearing products, as 
estimated by the company.

    Depreciation is computed by either the declining-balance method (primarily 
150 percent declining method) or the sum-of-the-years-digits method.  Fully 
depreciated assets are written off against accumulated depreciation.

                                                                            19

    Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was 
$128 million in 1997, $124 million in 1996 and $131 million in 1995.

    Share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for the two-for-one stock 
split in 1997.  Computation of earnings per common share (EPS) amounts for 
income (loss) from continuing operations before extraordinary item are as

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On January 6, 1997, TI and Raytheon Company announced that their boards of 
directors had approved a definitive agreement dated as of January 4, 1997, for 
Raytheon to purchase TI's Defense Systems and Electronics business (DSE) for 
$2.95 billion in cash.  This transaction was closed on July 11, 1997.  The net 
gain on sale of this discontinued operation, after income taxes of $876 
million, was $1473 million.  The consolidated financial statements of TI have 
been restated to present the DSE operations, assets and liabilities as 
discontinued operations.

    The assets and liabilities of DSE were classified on the 1996 balance 
sheet as net assets of discontinued operations and consisted of the following 
(millions of dollars):


  Accounts receivable .........................    $  278
  Inventories (net of progress billings) ......       221
  Prepaid expenses ............................         1

                                                   ======

The net income from operations of DSE was classified on the statement of 
income as income from discontinued operations.  Summarized results of 
discontinued operations prior to the close were as follows:

The Defense Systems and Electronics business included products such as radar 
systems, navigation systems, infrared surveillance and fire control systems, 
defense suppression missiles, missile guidance and control systems, and 
electronic warfare systems, which were sold to the U.S. government (either 
directly or through prime contractors) and to international customers approved 
by the U.S. government.  TI provided various ongoing services to DSE 
including, but not limited to, facilities management, data processing, 
security, payroll and employee benefits administration, insurance 
administration, duplicating and telecommunications services.  Their inclusion 
in discontinued operations was based upon TI's intercorporate allocation 
proce-

20

dures for such services.  The allocation basis of these expenses and all 
other central operating costs was first on the basis of direct usage when 
identifiable, with the remainder allocated among DSE and other TI businesses 
on the basis of their respective revenues, headcount or other measures.  These 
expenses allocated to DSE totaled $76 million in 1997, $163 million in 1996 
and $167 million in 1995.  TI has agreements to receive payments from Raytheon 
for continuing to provide certain of these services on an ongoing basis and 
others on a transition basis to DSE.

    Income from discontinued operations for 1996 includes the effect of a 
fourth quarter pretax charge of $32 million for voluntary and involuntary 
severance actions in the United States.  These actions were essentially 
completed by year-end 1996 and affected approximately 700 DSE employees.

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debt securities with original maturities within three months are considered 
cash equivalents. Debt securities with original maturities beyond three months 
have remaining maturities within 13 months and are considered short-term 
investments.  These cash equivalent and short-term investment debt securities 
are available for sale and stated at fair value, which approximates their 
specific amortized cost.  As of December 31, 1997, these debt securities 
consisted primarily of the following types: corporate ($1943 million), and 
asset-backed commercial paper ($623 million).  At December 31, 1996, these 
debt securities consisted primarily of the following types:  U.S. government 
($9 million), corporate ($413 million), and asset-backed commercial paper 
($300 million). Gross realized and unrealized gains and losses for each of 
these security types were immaterial in 1997, 1996 and 1995.  Proceeds from 
sales of these cash equivalent and short-term investment debt securities in 
1997, 1996 and 1995 were $859 million, $10 million and $190 million.

    Adjustments to fair value of cash equivalent and short-term investments 
as well as noncurrent publicly traded equity investments are recorded as an 
increase or decrease in stockholders' equity.  As of December 31, 1997, this 
adjustment, net of a deferred tax effect of $10 million, was a decrease of $18 
million (zero for cash equivalent and short-term investments and $18 million 
for noncurrent equity investments).  At December 31, 1996, the adjustment, net 
of a deferred tax effect of $15 million, was an increase of $28 million (zero 
for cash equivalent and short-term investments and $28 million for noncurrent 
equity investments).  At year-end 1995 this adjustment was zero.  Gross 
realized and unrealized holding gains and losses and proceeds from sales of 
equity investments were not material in 1997, 1996 and 1995.  The aggregate 
fair value of these noncurrent equity investments at December 31, 1997 and 
1996, was $30 million and $63 million, compared to their original cost of $15 
million and $20 million.

To secure access to additional semiconductor plant capacity, TI participates 
in several joint ventures formed to construct and operate DRAM semiconductor 
manufacturing facilities. TI holds minority interests in, and has long-term 
inventory purchase commitments with, each joint venture.  Under the 
agreements, TI purchases the output of the ventures at prices based upon 
percentage discounts from TI's average selling prices.  This pricing method is 
designed to help reduce the effect of market volatility on TI, although it has 
not been able to comprehend fully a sharp decline in average unit prices.  
Certain co-venturers have the right to buy a portion of the output from TI. 
Under the ventures' financing arrangements, the venturers have provided 
certain debt and other guarantees.  At December 31, 1997 and 1996, TI was 
contingently liable for an aggregate of $19 million and $25 million of such 
guarantees.  TI and other co-venturers are currently exploring further 
measures with respect to the joint venture structures.  In this regard, TI and 
Hitachi, Ltd., major co-venturers in one joint venture, 

                                                                            21

Notes to Financial Statements
(continued)

announced on February 9, 1998, plans to discontinue their joint venture 
arrangement, with TI to purchase the assets of the venture.  In connection 
with this action, TI expects to take a special charge in the first quarter of 
1998.

    Inventory purchases from the ventures aggregated $977 million in 1997, 
$1176 million in 1996 and $1779 million in 1995.  Receivables from and 
payables to the ventures were $135 million and $69 million at December 31, 
1997, and $43 million and $66 million at December 31, 1996.

    The purpose of the joint ventures is to provide semiconductor output for 
TI and other co-venturers.  As a result, TI expects to recover its cost of the 
ventures through sale of the semiconductor output, and is amortizing its cost 
of the ventures over the expected initial output period of 3 to 5 years, and 
recognizing its share of any cumulative venture net losses in excess of 
amortization.  The related expense charged to operations was $88 million in 
1997, $33 million in 1996 and $15 million in 1995.

In the third quarter of 1997, the company gave notice of redemption for the 
$103 million outstanding balance of its 2.75% convertible subordinated 
debentures due 2002.  In response, essentially all of the debenture holders 
elected to convert their debentures into TI common stock.  This resulted in 
the issuance of 2,488,175 shares of TI common stock in the third quarter.  In 
addition, the company announced on October 14, 1997, a fixed-spread tender 
offer for any or all of its 9.0% notes due 2001, its 9.25% notes due 2003 and 
its 8.75% notes due 2007.  As a result of the tender offer, which closed 
October 21, an aggregate of $248 million of such debt principal was tendered 
at a price of $280 million and extinguished by the company through the use of 
existing cash balances.  This resulted in an extraordinary charge of $22 
million in the fourth quarter of 1997, after elimination of deferred issuance 
costs and recognition of an income tax effect of $12 million.

    The coupon rates for the notes due 2006 (in 1996, notes due 2001 and 2007) 
have been swapped for LIBOR-based variable rates through 2006, for an 
effective interest rate of approximately 5.1% and 9.1% as of December 31, 1997 
and 1996.  The Italian lira mortgage notes, and related swaps, are due in 
installments through 2005.  The mortgage notes are collateralized by real 
estate and building equipment.

    Interest incurred on loans in 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $114 million, $108 
million and $69 million.  Of these amounts, $20 million in 1997, $35 million 
in 1996 and $21 million in 1995 were capitalized as a component of capital 
asset construction costs.  Interest paid on loans (net of amounts capitalized) 
was $94 million in 1997, $54 million in 1996 and $48 million in 1995.

    Aggregate maturities of long-term debt due during the four years 
subsequent to December 31, 1998, are as follows:

The company maintains lines of credit to support commercial paper borrowings 
and to provide additional liquidity.  These lines of credit totaled $651 
million at December 31, 1997, and $696 million at December 31, 1996.  Of these 
amounts, at December 31, 1997 and 1996, $600 million existed to support 
outstanding and future commercial paper borrowings or short-term bank loans.  
At December 31, 1996, outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $299 million 
with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.49% were included in current loans 
payable.  No commercial paper borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 
1997.


FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK CONCENTRATION
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  In addition to the swaps discussed in the preceding 
note, as of December 31, 1997, the company had forward currency exchange 
contracts outstanding of $275 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures 
(including $101 million to buy lira, $73 million to buy deutsche marks, and 
$24 million to buy Singapore dollars).  At December 31, 1996, the company had 
forward currency exchange contracts outstanding of $333 million to hedge net 
balance sheet exposures (including $82 million to buy deutsche marks, $48 
million to sell yen, and $36 million to sell French francs).  As of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, the carrying amounts and current market settlement 
values of these swaps and forward contracts were not significant.

    The company uses forward currency exchange contracts, including the lira 
note currency swaps, to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect 
of exchange rate fluctuations on the company's non-U.S. dollar net balance 
sheet exposures.  The interest rate swaps for the company's notes due 2006 (in 
1996, notes due 2001 and 2007) are used to change the characteristics of the 
interest rate stream on the debt from fixed rates to short-term variable rates 
in order to achieve a mix of interest rates which, over time, is expected to 
moderate financing costs.  The effect of these interest rate swaps was to 
reduce interest expense by $2 million in 1997 and increase interest expense by 
$2 million and $6 million in 1996 and 1995.

    In order to minimize its exposure to credit risk, the company limits its 
counterparties on the forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate 
swaps to investment-grade rated financial institutions.

    As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the fair value of long-term debt, based 
on current interest rates, was approximately $1390 million and $1759 million,  
compared with the carrying amount of $1353 million and $1712 million.

RISK CONCENTRATION:  Financial instruments which potentially subject the 
company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash investments and 
accounts receivable.  The company places its cash investments in investment-
grade, short-term debt securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to 
any one commercial issuer.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the 
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers in the company's 
customer base, and their dispersion across different industries and geographic 
areas.  The company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the expected 
collectibility of accounts receivable.


STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. None 
are currently outstanding.

    Each outstanding share of the company's common stock carries one-fourth of 
a stock purchase right.  Under certain circum-

                                                                            23

Notes to Financial Statements

stances, each right may be exercised to purchase one one-hundredth of a share 
of the company's participating cumulative preferred stock for $200.  Under 
certain circumstances following the acquisition of 20% or more of the 
company's outstanding common stock by an acquiring person (as defined in the 
rights agreement), each right (other than rights held by an acquiring person) 
may be exercised to purchase common stock of the company or a successor 
company with a market value of twice the $200 exercise price.  The rights, 
which are redeemable by the company at 1 cent per right, expire in June 1998.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and development expense, which totaled $1536 million in 1997, $1181 
million in 1996 and $842 million in 1995, included a charge in 1997 of $461 
million for the value of acquired in-process research and development as a 
result of the acquisition of Amati Communications Corporation (Amati).  The 
company acquired Amati as a result of an all-cash tender offer which commenced 
on November 25, 1997, and expired on December 23, 1997, through which 
approximately 78% of Amati's outstanding common shares were acquired for an 
aggregate of $306 million, or $20 per share.  As contractually required, the 
company is acquiring the balance of the Amati shares through a second-step 
merger transaction for an aggregate of $89 million, or $20 per share.  In 
addition to these stock purchase costs, the company has incurred approximately 
$121 million of additional acquisition costs, which includes $73 million for 
the value of TI common stock options contractually required to be issued to 
replace outstanding Amati employee stock options.  Research and development 
expense for 1996 included a charge of $192 million for the value of acquired 
in-process research and development in connection with the 1996 acquisition of 
Silicon Systems, Inc. (SSi).  There was no tax offset associated with either 
of these two charges.

STOCK OPTIONS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company has stock options outstanding to participants under the Texas 
Instruments 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by stockholders on 
April 18, 1996.  Options are also outstanding under the 1984 and 1988 Stock 
Option Plans and the Texas Instruments Long-Term Incentive Plan; however, no 
further options may be granted under these plans.  Under all these 
stockholder-approved plans, unless the options are replacement options, e.g., 
acquisition-related, the option price per share may not be less than 100 
percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant.  Substantially all 
the options have a 10-year term.  Options granted in 1997 generally vest 
ratably over four years.  Options granted prior to that are either fully 
vested or will vest within one year.

    Under the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company may grant stock 
options, including incentive stock options; restricted stock and restricted 
stock units; performance units; and other stock-based awards.  The plan 
provides for the issuance of 37,000,000 shares of the company's common stock; 
in addition, if any award under the 1984 or 1988 Stock Option Plans or the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan terminates, then any unissued shares subject to the 
terminated award become available for granting awards under the 1996 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan.  No more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock may be awarded 
as restricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards under 
the plan.  In 1997 and 1996, 201,500 and 110,028 shares of restricted stock 
units, which vest over 1 to 5 years, were granted (weighted-average award-date 
value of $37.78 and $22.65 per share).  In addition, in 1997 and 1996, 5,700 
and 69,812 previously unissued shares were issued as Annual Incentive Plan 
stock awards 

24

(weighted-average award-date value of $22.94 and $23.28 per share).  
Compensation expense for restricted stock units and annual stock awards 
totaled $3.5 million and $1.6 million in 1997 and 1996.

    The company also has stock options outstanding under the Employee Stock  
Purchase Plan approved by stockholders in 1997.  The plan provides for options 
to be offered semiannually to all eligible employees in amounts based on a 
percentage of the employee's compensation.  The option price per share may not 
be less than 85 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant.  If the 
optionee authorizes and does not cancel payroll deductions which will be equal 
to or greater than the purchase price, options granted become exercisable 7 
months, and expire not more than 13 months, from date of grant.  Options are 
also outstanding under the 1988 Employees Stock Option Purchase Plan; however, 
no further options may be granted under this plan.

</TABLE>

In accordance with the terms of APB No. 25, the company records no 
Compensation expense for its stock option awards.  As required by SFAS 
No. 123, the company provides the following disclosure of hypothetical values 
for these awards.  The weighted-average grant-date value of options granted 
during 1997 and 1996 was estimated to be $15.72 and $9.24 under the Long-Term 
Incentive Plans (Long-Term Plans) and $13.47 and $6.05 under the Employee 
Stock and Stock Option Purchase Plans (Employee Plans).  These values were 
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following 
weighted-average assumptions for 1997 and 1996:  expected dividend yields of 
 .93% and 1.48% (Long-Term Plans) and .70% and 1.21% (Employee Plans); expected 
volatility of 39%; risk-free interest rates of 5.76% and 5.42% (Long-Term 
Plans) and 5.69% and 6.15% (Employee Plans); and expected lives of 6 years 
(Long-Term Plans) and .8 years and 1.5 years (Employee Plans).  Had 
compensation expense been recorded based on these hypothetical values, the 
company's 1997 net income would have been $1764 million, or diluted earnings 
per share of $4.43.  A similar computation for 1996 and 1995 would have 
resulted in net income of $40 million and $1078 million, or diluted earnings 
per share of $0.11 and $2.78.  Because options vest over several years and 
additional option grants are expected, the effects of these hypothetical 
calculations are not likely to be representative of similar future 
calculations.

Long-Term Plans and 1984 and 1988 Stock Option Plans at December 31, 1997, is

Notes to Financial Statements
(continued)

At December 31, 1997, the stock options outstanding under the Employee Plans 
have exercise prices of $48.30 or $28.13, depending on the year of grant, and 
a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 8 to 9 months.  Of the total 
outstanding options, 236,771 are exercisable at year-end 1997.

    At year-end 1997, 28,825,652 shares were available for future grants under 
the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 8,907,032 shares under the Employee 
Stock Purchase Plan.  As of year-end 1997, 53,016,852 shares were reserved for 
issuance under the company's stock option and incentive plans and 10,000,000 
shares were reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

    In the third quarter of 1997, the company began a stock repurchase program 
with the goal of neutralizing the dilutive effect of shares to be issued upon 
the exercise of stock options under the new Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 
Long-Term Plans.  Treasury shares acquired in connection with this repurchase 
program and other stock transactions in 1997, 1996 and 1995 were 754,511 
shares, 7,730 shares and 135,001 shares.  Previously unissued common shares 
issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Annual Incentive Plan in 
1997, 1996 and 1995 were 30,174 shares, 98,072 shares and 32,772 shares.  
Treasury shares issued under the Texas Instruments Restricted Stock Unit Plan 
for Directors in 1997 and 1996 were zero shares and 2,334 shares.


PROFIT SHARING AND RETIREMENT PLANS
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company provides various incentive plans for employees, including general 
profit sharing and savings programs as well as annual performance awards.  The 
company also provides pension and retiree health care benefit plans in the U.S.
and pension plans in certain non-U.S. locations.

PROFIT SHARING: Profit sharing expense was $122 million in 1997 and 
$257 million in 1995.  There was no profit sharing expense in 1996.  Under the 
plans, unless otherwise provided by local law, the company and certain of its 
subsidiaries contribute a portion of their net profits equal to 25% of the 
amount by which consolidated income (as defined) before profit sharing and 
income taxes exceeds 8% of the company's consolidated average assets for the 
year.  In 1997, the board of directors of the company amended the plans to 
exclude from consolidated income for purposes of this computation the 1997 
fourth quarter charge of $461 million for acquired in-process research and 
development arising as a result of the acquisition of Amati.

    Beginning January 1, 1998, the profit sharing formula will change in order 
to more closely align it with the company's business objectives.  Under the 
new formula, unless otherwise provided by local law or other plans (e.g., the 
separate profit sharing plan for the materials & controls business), the 
worldwide profit sharing amount will be based on the company's annual 
consolidated profit from operations (PFO) performance including profit 
sharing.  The profit sharing contribution percentage, which is applied to 
employees' earnings worldwide to determine the annual profit sharing amount, 
will vary depending on the PFO percentage attained, i.e., PFO divided by net 
revenues.  For example, for a PFO percentage below 10%, the profit sharing 
contribution percentage is zero; at 10% PFO, the contribution percentage to 
be applied to employees' earnings is 4%.  At 16% PFO, the contribution 
percentage is 16%; at PFO of 20% or above, the contribution percentage is 26%.

    The majority of the profit sharing plans worldwide provide that, depending 
on the individual plan, from 50% to 100% of the profit sharing earned by 
employees is paid in cash to the eligible participants with the balance 
contributed to a deferred plan.  For non-U.S. employees, contributions to a 
deferred plan generally are invested in TI common stock.  For U.S. employees, 
several investment options, including TI common stock, are available.

    Except in the event of company contributions in stock, investments in TI 
common stock are made by the trustees through purchases of outstanding shares 
or through purchases of shares offered from time to time by the company.  The 
board of directors has authorized the issuance of previously unissued shares 
for purposes of the plans; 9,233,836 of such shares were available for future 
issuance at December 31, 1997.

    The trustees of the profit sharing plans purchased 3,535,471 outstanding 
shares of TI common stock in 1997 (3,123,905 shares in 1996 and 4,762,460 
shares in 1995) and no previously unissued 

26

shares in 1997, 1996 and 1995 for use in the profit sharing plans and savings 
program.

SAVINGS PROGRAM:  The company provides a matched savings program whereby a 
U.S. employee's contribution, up to 4% of earnings, is matched by the company 
at the rate of 50 cents per dollar.  Contributions are subject to statutory 
limitations.  The contributions may be invested in several investment funds 
including TI common stock.  The company's expense under this program was 
$15 million in 1997, $17 million in 1996 and $14 million in 1995.

U.S. PENSION PLAN:  The company has a defined benefit plan covering most
U.S. employees with benefits based on years of service and employee's
compensation.  The plan is a career-average-pay plan which has been amended
periodically in the past to produce approximately the same results as a final-
pay type plan.  The board of directors of the company has expressed an intent
to make such amendments in the future, circumstances permitting, and the
expected effects of such amendments have been considered in calculating U.S.
pension expense.  The company's funding policy is to contribute to the plan at
least the minimum amount required by ERISA.  Plan assets consist primarily of
common stock, U.S. government obligations, commercial paper and real estate.  

    Effective January 1, 1998, the company will provide an alternative to the 
combination of the current defined benefit plan and savings program (current 
plan) for U.S. employees employed prior to December 1, 1997.  The alternative 
plan (new plan) is designed to favorably compare with other retirement 
programs in the semiconductor industry.  It consists of a defined contribution 
plan whereby the company will contribute 2% of an employee's earnings, and a 
matched savings program whereby an employee's contribution, up to 4% of the 
employee's earnings, will be matched by the company at a dollar-per-dollar 
rate.  The contributions may be invested in several investment funds including 
TI common stock. During a selection period, which ended December 12, 1997, 
employees irrevocably elected whether to remain in the current plan or choose 
the new plan.  Benefits earned through December 31, 1997, under the current 
plan will be retained by those employees who chose the new plan.  
Approximately 36% chose the new plan.  Employees hired subsequent to 
November 30, 1997, will automatically participate in the new plan.

    As noted in the Discontinued Operations footnote, accrued retirement costs 
of $226 million at year-end 1996, which consisted primarily of the U.S. 
pension plan and the retiree health care benefit plan obligations and assets 
related to DSE employees, were included in the net assets of discontinued 
operations.  The following information on pension and retiree health care 
benefit plans excludes discontinued operations amounts.

Notes to Financial Statements
(continued)

The projected benefit obligations for 1997 and 1996 were determined using 
assumed discount rates of 7.0% and 7.25% and an assumed average long-term pay 
progression rate of 4.25%.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan 
assets was 9.0%.

NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS:  Retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees of the
company is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans.
Retirement benefits are based on years of service and employee's compensation,
generally during a fixed number of years immediately prior to retirement.
Funding policies are based on local statutes.  Plan assets consist primarily
of common stock, government obligations and corporate bonds.

    Pension expense of the non-U.S. plans includes the following components:

The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. plans reflects the 
different economic environments within the various countries.  The projected 
benefit obligations were determined using a range of assumed discount rates of 
2.5% to 7.0% in 1997 and 3.25% to 8.0% in 1996 and a range of assumed average 
long-term pay progression rates of 3.0% to 6.0% in 1997 and 1996.  The range 
of assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets was 7.0% to 9.0%.  Accrued 
pension at December 31 includes approximately $110 million in 1997 and $111 
million in 1996 for two non-U.S. plans that are not funded.  Pension 
accounting rules require recognition in the balance sheet of an additional 
minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated benefit 
obligation over the fair value of the plan assets.  A corresponding amount is 
recognized as an intangible asset, not to exceed the amount of unrecognized 
prior service cost, with the balance recorded as a reduction of stockholders' 
equity.  As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the company has recorded an 
additional non-U.S. minimum pension

28

liability of $69 million and $48 million and an equity reduction of 
$63 million and $39 million.


RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLAN:  The company's U.S. employees are currently 
eligible to receive, during retirement, specified company-paid medical 
benefits.  The plan is contributory and premiums are adjusted annually.  For 
employees retiring on or after January 5, 1993, the company has specified a 
maximum annual amount per retiree, based on years of service, that it will pay 
toward retiree medical premiums.  For employees who retired prior to that 
date, the company maintains a consistent level of cost sharing between the 
company and the retiree.  Any funding of the plan obligation will be at 
amounts determined at the discretion of management.  Effective 
January 1, 1998, new employees will be eligible for this benefit when they 
reach 20 years of service, regardless of age.  For a 15 year transition 
period, current employees may qualify for eligibility under either the new 
20 year rule or the previous requirement, which is based upon retirement 
eligibility under the defined benefit pension plan.  Coverage eligibility 
under the 20 year rule is only available at termination, i.e., no subsequent 
election to participate is allowable.




    Expense of the retiree health care benefit plan includes the following
components:

Retiree health care benefit amounts were determined using health care cost 
trend rates of 6.6% for 1998 decreasing to 5.0% by 2000, and assumed discount 
rates of 7.0% for 1997 and 7.25% for 1996.  Increasing the health care cost 
trend rates by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1997, by $16 million and 1997 plan expense by 
$1 million.

SPECIAL ACTIONS:  In the first quarter of 1997, the company sold its mobile 
computing business and terminated its digital imaging printing development 
program.  As a result of these divestitures, the company took a pretax charge 
of $56 million in the first quarter, of which $27 million was for severance 
for involuntary reductions worldwide.  These severance actions were 
essentially completed by the end of the quarter and affected approximately 
1,045 employees.  The balance, $29 million, was for other costs associated 
with the business sale and program termination, including vendor cancellation 
and lease charges.  In the fourth quarter of 1997, the company took a pretax 
charge of $42 million, primarily for severance costs related to cost reduction 
actions by the materials & controls business.  These actions are expected to 
be completed in 1998 and affected approximately 260 employees.  In the fourth 
quarter of 1996, the company took a pretax charge of $208 million, of which 
$91 million was for severance for cost 

                                                                            29

reduction actions consisting of a voluntary retirement program in the United 
States and selected involuntary employment reductions worldwide.  These 1996 
actions, which primarily involved the semiconductor segment as well as 
activities since divested, were essentially completed by year-end 1996 and 
affected approximately 2,600 employees.  The balance of the charge, 
$117 million, was for asset write-downs on several product lines, primarily 
mobile computing, a divested activity.


BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Texas Instruments develops, manufactures and sells a variety of products used 
in the commercial electronic and electrical equipment industry, primarily for 
industrial and consumer markets.  The company's principal businesses are based 
on TI's broad semiconductor technology and application of this technology to 
digital solutions for the networked society.

TI HAS THREE PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES:  Semiconductor, Materials & Controls, and 
Educational & Productivity Solutions.  Each of these is a business 
segment,with its respective financial performance detailed in this report.

    Semiconductor consists of digital signal processors, mixed-signal/analog 
devices, application-specific integrated circuits, reduced instruction-set 
microprocessors, microcontrollers, standard logic, and memories.  These 
semiconductors are sold primarily to original-equipment manufacturers and 
through distributors.

    Materials & Controls consists primarily of electrical and electronic 
control devices, electronic connectors and clad metals.  They are sold 
primarily to original-equipment manufacturers and through distributors.

    Educational & Productivity Solutions, which includes educational and 
graphing calculators, are marketed primarily through retailers and to schools 
through instructional dealers.

    Operating profits of the three principal businesses include the effects of 
profit sharing and exclude the effects of special charges and gains.  The 
results for semiconductor include the effects of all royalty revenues from 
semiconductor-related cross-license agreements.  Results for semiconductor 
also include expenses charged to operations related to its joint ventures of 
$88 million, $33 million and $15 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995.  Business 
assets are the owned or allocated assets used by each business.

    Included in corporate activities are general corporate expenses, 
elimination of intersegment transactions (which are generally intended to 
approximate market prices), results for TI's emerging digital imaging 
operation, and royalty revenues from computer-related cross-license 
agreements.  Assets of corporate activities include unallocated cash and 
short-term investments and deferred income taxes.

    Divested activities include the historical operating results and assets of 
mobile computing and software (both sold in 1997), custom manufacturing 
services and printers (both sold in 1996), and other smaller divestitures.

Included in the effect of non-U.S. rates for 1996 and 1995 is a $4 million and 
a $93 million benefit from tax loss carryforward utilization reduced by 
certain non-U.S. taxes and losses for which no benefit was recognized.  
Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-
U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are 
expected to result in additional tax liability.  The remaining undistributed 
earnings (approximately $870 million at December 31, 1997) have been 
indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due 
upon remittance of these earnings.  Determination of the amount of 
unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not 
practicable.

    The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
at December 31 were as follows:

Net deferred income tax asset .....................  $  576     $  455
                                                     ======     ======

As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the net deferred income tax asset of $576 
million and $455 million was presented in the balance sheet, based on tax 
jurisdiction, as deferred income tax assets of $711 million and $587 million 
and deferred income tax liabilities of $135 million and $132 million.  The 
valuation allowance shown above reflects the company's ongoing assessment 
regarding the realizability of certain non-U.S. deferred income tax assets.  
The balance of the deferred income tax assets is considered realizable based 
on carryback potential, existing taxable temporary differences, and 
expectation of future income levels comparable to recent results.  Such future 
income levels are not assured because of the nature of the company's 
businesses, which are generally characterized by rapidly changing technology 
and intense competition.

    The company has aggregate U.S. and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of 
approximately $80 million and U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $47 million.  
Of these amounts, $113 million expires through the year 2007 and $14 million 
of the loss carryforwards has no expiration.

    Income taxes paid were $1145 million, $240 million and $384 million for 
1997, 1996 and 1995.


RENTAL EXPENSE AND LEASE COMMITMENTS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rental and lease expense was $168 million in 1997, $175 million in 1996 and 
$151 million in 1995.  The company conducts certain operations in leased 
facilities and also leases a portion of its data processing and other 
equipment.  The lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal 
provisions and require the company to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance 
costs.

    At December 31, 1997, the company was committed under noncancelable
leases with minimum rentals in succeeding years as follows:

1997 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED WITH 1996

UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT FOLLOW ARE FROM CONTINUING 
OPERATIONS AND EXCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS.

TI's orders were $9796 million, compared with $9268 million in 1996.  Net 
revenues in 1997 were $9750 million, compared with $9940 million in 1996.  
Financial results in 1996 included revenues from TI businesses that have since 
been sold, primarily software, mobile computing and printers.  Excluding the 
sold businesses, TI orders were up 19 percent for the year and revenues were 
up 10 percent, primarily due to growth in semiconductor.  

     Profit from operations in 1997 was $1213 million, up from $374 million in 
1996.  The increase was primarily from higher semiconductor profits in the 
non-memory portion of the business and the absence of losses in the sold 
businesses, primarily mobile computing.  In 1996, these sold businesses lost 
$193 million more than in 1997.

     Results for the fourth quarter include a charge of $461 million for in-
process R&D associated with the acquisition of Amati Communications 
Corporation, along with a pretax charge of $42 million for cost reduction 
actions, primarily in the materials & controls business.  In addition to the 
fourth quarter charges, the 1997 earnings include previously announced special 
pretax charges of $56 million, primarily related to the sale of TI's mobile 
computing business, and $44 million for the termination of joint-venture 
agreements in Thailand.

    Results for 1997 also include a $66 million gain for the sale of three 
businesses, the largest of which was software.  The total of the 1997 special 
items is equivalent to $1.27 per share.  In 1996, special charges were $400 
million before taxes, with $208 million being in the fourth quarter.  These 
charges were equivalent to $0.86 per share for the year.


     Income for the year was $809 million, compared with $281 million in 1996. 
TI's diluted earnings per share (EPS) in 1997 were $2.03, compared with $0.74 
in 1996.  Including the effect of the special items, income for the year was 
$302 million compared to a loss of $46 million in 1996, and earnings per share 
were $0.76 compared with a loss per share of $0.12 in 1996.

     Results for 1997 also included an accrual for profit sharing of $122 
million, which was 7.82 percent of eligible payroll.  There was no profit 
sharing in 1996.

     Including the effect of special items, net income for 1997 was $1805 
million, which consisted of income from continuing operations of $302 million, 
income from the discontinued defense business of $52 million, gain on sale of 
the discontinued defense business of $1473 million, and an extraordinary 
charge of $22 million associated with debt retirement.  On a similar basis, 
net income for 1996 was $63 million, which consisted of a loss from continuing 
operations of $46 million and income from the discontinued defense business of 
$109 million. 

36

     Royalty revenues in 1997 were essentially steady with 1996.  Negotiations 
continue with potential licensees.  TI continues to expect a significant 
ongoing stream of royalty revenue into the next century. 

     In September, the Tokyo High Court upheld a ruling that Fujitsu Limited's 
production of certain memory products does not infringe TI's Kilby patent.  
The company has appealed the ruling to the Japan Supreme Court.  In November, 
the Japan Patent Office invalidated the Kilby patent.  TI plans to appeal this 
decision to the Tokyo High Court.  Since the Kilby patent expires in 2001, the 
company does not expect the outcome of either appeal to be material.

     Interest income for 1997 was up $84 million from 1996, primarily as a 
result of investment of net proceeds from the sale of the defense business to 
Raytheon.

     The income tax rate for 1997 was 35 percent.

     TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1997, was $1623 
million, unchanged from year-end 1996. 

     R&D for 1997 was $1075 million, excluding the $461 million charge for in-
process R&D associated with the Amati acquisition, compared with $989 million 
in 1996, excluding the $192 million charge for in-process R&D associated with 
the SSi acquisition.

     Capital expenditures were $1238 million in 1997, compared with $2063 
million in 1996.  Depreciation for 1997 was $1109 million compared with $904 
million in 1996.  Depreciation for 1998 is expected to be $1.3 billion.

     TI management will recommend to the Board of Directors that the timing of 
dividend declarations be moved to the first month of the quarter, with
paydates shifting accordingly to the second month of the quarter.  The change 
is planned to begin in March 1998.

SEMICONDUCTOR:  Orders in semiconductor for 1997 were $8109 million, up 21 
percent from $6723 million in 1996.  The increase resulted from strong demand 
for digital signal processing solutions, as DSPS orders increased over 40 
percent.  Semiconductor revenues were $8087 million, up 10 percent from $7357 
million in 1996.  The increase in semiconductor resulted from an increase of 
more than 35 percent in DSPS revenues due to increased shipments, which more 
than offset a $400 million decrease in memory, as DRAM prices continued to 
decline sharply.

     For the fourth quarter, semiconductor revenues, which include royalties 
from semiconductor patent licenses, represented about 85 percent of TI's 
revenues.  Digital signal processors plus mixed-signal/analog represented 
about 45 percent of semiconductor.  Memory, made up primarily of DRAMs, 
accounted for less than 20 percent of semiconductor.  The remainder of 
semiconductor consists primarily of a broad range of advanced products, 
including application-specific integrated circuits, reduced instruction-set 
microprocessors, microcontrollers and standard logic.

     Revenues reached record levels for digital signal processing for both the 
year and the fourth quarter.  Mixed-signal/analog also had a strong year, with 
record revenues for the year and fourth quarter, growing more than twice as 
fast as the market in 1997.  

     Memory continued to be significantly affected by DRAM price pressures, 
with revenues down by 10 percent in the fourth quarter from the year-ago 
fourth quarter.  TI continues to emphasize aggressive shrinks of DRAM devices 
and the transition to new synchronous DRAMs.  TI believes these improvements 
will help offset some of the financial pressures faced by joint venture 
manufacturing operations in this environment.  TI and other joint venture 
shareholders continue to explore further measures with respect to the joint 
venture structures. In this regard, TI and Hitachi, Ltd., major shareholders 
of one joint venture, announced on February 9, 1998, plans to discontinue 
their joint venture arrangement, with TI to purchase the assets of the 
venture.  In connection with this action, TI expects to take a special charge 
in the first quarter of 1998.

     TI's other semiconductor products, such as microcontrollers and 
application-specific integrated circuits, made good progress in growth and 
profitability in 1997.

                                                                            37

Supplemental Financial Information
(continued)

     Semiconductor profit from operations increased from $783 million in 1996 
to $1354 million in 1997 and operating margins improved from 10.6 percent to
16.7 percent.  The improvement was primarily from higher margins in the non-
memory portion of the business, particularly benefiting from higher DSPS 
shipments.

     The outlook remains positive for longer-term growth of the semiconductor 
market, although TI remains cautious in the near-term as continuing volatility 
in DRAMs and slowing in Asian economies are expected to put pressure on first 
quarter 1998 revenues and margins.  

     TI now believes the 1998 worldwide semiconductor market will grow at 
about 10 percent, up from 4 percent in 1997.  In the non-memory area of the
market, TI expects to see faster growth than the total market, led by about 30 
percent growth for DSPs and mixed-signal devices.

     The U.S. market outlook remains healthy and Europe shows ongoing 
strengthening, although turmoil in Asia could impact these markets as well.  
In addition, new markets are emerging, such as low cost personal computers, 
higher speed internet access and digital consumer products, important to the 
future growth of the industry.  TI continues to see strength in wireless 
communications and networking markets, with semiconductor content rising about 
60 percent over the past four years.

MATERIALS & CONTROLS:  Orders in materials & controls of $972 million were up 
from $896 million in 1996, primarily due to TIRIS.  Revenues of $954 million 
were up $64 million from 1996 due primarily to the growing acceptance of TIRIS 
in automotive applications.  PFO increased from $90 million in 1996 to $123 
million in 1997, with margins improving from 10.1 percent to 12.9 percent.  
The increase was due primarily to manufacturing cost reduction.

EDUCATIONAL & PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS:  Orders in educational & productivity 
solutions were $448 million, up $22 million from 1996 as a result of continued 
growth in instructional calculators.  Revenues were $447 million, an increase 
of $24 million from 1996 also as a result of growth in instructional 
calculators.  PFO increased from $56 million in 1996 to $59 million in 1997 
and operating margins remained flat at 13.2 percent.

DIGITAL IMAGING:  TI's digital imaging business continued to make progress 
throughout 1997, further focusing its strategy on key market opportunities. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION:  During 1997, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term 
investments increased by $2042 million to $3020 million.  The sale of TI's 
defense operations to Raytheon Company on July 11 provided $2950 million of 
cash.  In addition, the sale of three other TI businesses generated $177 
million of cash in the second quarter.  In the fourth quarter, TI used $306 
million of cash to acquire about 78 percent of the issued and outstanding 
shares of Amati Communications Corporation's common stock at a price of $20 
per share.  TI intends to acquire the remaining shares of Amati's common stock 
in the first quarter of 1998.  Additionally, TI used $740 million of cash in 
the fourth quarter to pay 1997 federal income taxes which included taxes of 
$676 million on the gain on the sale of TI's defense operations.  This sale 
and the related accrued income tax liability were recognized in the third 
quarter of 1997.  For 1997, cash flow from operating activities net of 
additions to property, plant, and equipment was $605 million, and 1997 capital 
expenditures totaled $1238 million.

     During the third quarter TI began a stock repurchase program with 
the goal of neutralizing the potential dilutive effect of shares to be 
issued upon the exercise of stock options under the 1997 employee stock 
purchase plan and stock option/incentive plans.  Through December, TI 
used $86 million of cash to repurchase shares of its common stock.

     The outstanding balance of commercial paper was reduced from $300 million 
to zero during the second quarter of 1997.  The company's outstanding 2.75% 
convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 in the principal amount of $103 
million were called for redemption and converted to TI common stock in the 
third quarter of 1997.  In the fourth quarter, TI retired a face amount of 
$248 million of its previously outstanding long-term debt.  At year-end 1997
the debt-to-total-capital ratio was .19, down from the year-end 1996 value of 
 .33.

     Authorizations for future capital expenditures were $1105 million at 
December 31, 1997.  TI's capital expenditures for 1998 are being constrained 
to $1.4 billion, up from $1.2 billion in 1997. 

38

R&D will be increased to $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 1997, primarily 
to support digital signal processing solutions and other advanced 
semiconductor technologies.

     The company maintains lines of credit to support commercial paper 
borrowings and to provide additional liquidity.  These lines of credit totaled 
$651 million at December 31, 1997.  Of this amount, $600 million exists to 
support outstanding and future commercial paper borrowings or short-term bank 
loans.

     TI's financial strength puts the company in an excellent position to 
continue to take strategic actions even in a cautious global economy.


YEAR 2000:  The company is actively engaged in resolving the issues involved 
with the Year 2000 challenge.  These issues result from the use of two-digit 
year dates rather than four-digit year dates in computer code, which could 
cause potential failures in date-sensitive software that does not recognize 
"00" as 2000.  In 1995, TI formed teams to address the company's Year 2000 
challenge.  The company is on schedule to complete assessment, testing, and 
modifications to strategic business systems in 1998.  TI is also assessing the 
scope of Year 2000 issues in its physical plant and infrastructure and will 
soon begin corrective actions.  TI is communicating with its major customers 
and suppliers to resolve Year 2000 interface issues.  While TI expects success 
in this cooperative effort, it cannot guarantee the performance of third 
parties.  The company is developing contingency plans to minimize potential 
disruptions.  Based on assessments to date, the company believes its current 
products are ready for Year 2000.  Obsolete and discontinued products, as well 
as divested product lines, are not included in this assessment.  The estimate 
of overall costs for TI's Year 2000 project is not expected to be material.  
The completion dates and costs are based on management's current best 
estimates.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS:  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency 
for financial reporting.  In this regard, the company uses forward currency 
exchange contracts, including Italian lira note currency swaps, to minimize 
the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on 
the company's non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures.  For example, at 
year-end 1997, the company had forward currency exchange contracts 
outstanding of $275 million (including $101 million to buy lira, $73 million 
to buy deutsche marks, and $24 million to buy Singapore dollars).  Because 
most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by 
these exchange contracts and swaps, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus 
fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates would not be expected to have 
a material earnings impact, e.g., based on year-end 1997 balances and rates, a 
pretax currency exchange gain or loss of $10 million.

     The company has interest rate swaps which change the characteristics of 
the interest payments on its $300 million of 6.125% notes due 2006 from fixed-
rate payments to short-term LIBOR-based variable rate payments in order to 
achieve a mix of interest rates on the company's long-term debt which, over 
time, is expected to moderate financing costs.  The effect of these interest 
rate swaps was to reduce interest expense by $2 million in 1997.  The year-end
1997 effective interest rate for the $300 million of notes due 2006, including 
the effect of the swaps, was approximately 5.1%.  These swaps are sensitive to 
interest rate changes.  For example, if short-term interest rates increase 
(decrease) by one percentage point from year-end 1997 rates, annual pretax 
interest expense would increase (decrease) by $3 million.

     The company's long-term debt has a fair value, based on current interest 
rates, of approximately $1390 million at year-end 1997.  Fair value will vary 
as interest rates change.  The following table presents the aggregate 
maturities and carrying amounts of the debt principal and related weighted

1996 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED WITH 1995

The content of this discussion and analysis was modified in 1997 from its 
original form to be consistent with the company's new business segment 
disclosures.

  Total TI                                     Down 23%          Down 13%

TI's orders for continuing operations for 1996 were $9.3 billion, down 23 
percent from $12.1 billion in 1995.  Significantly reduced DRAM prices in the 
semiconductor segment were the primary contributor to the change.

     TI's net revenues for continuing operations for 1996 were $9.9 billion, 
down 13 percent from $11.4 billion in 1995.  The decrease in the semiconductor 
segment was due to significantly lower DRAM prices and reduced royalties.  
From the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, DRAM prices 
dropped about 80 percent.  Digital signal processors and mixed-signal/analog 
products grew strongly in 1996.  Revenues for all differentiated semiconductor 
products were nearly two-thirds of the company's total semiconductor revenues 
in fourth quarter 1996.  

     PFO from continuing operations for 1996, excluding special charges for 
cost reduction actions and in-process R&D, was $374 million, down from $1439 
million in 1995 primarily because of significantly lower DRAM prices and 
reduced royalties.  Including the special charges, loss from operations was 
$26 million.


     Net loss from continuing operations including special charges in 1996 was 
$46 million, and loss per share was $0.12.  Net income for the year from 
continuing operations, excluding the special charges, was $281 million, 
compared with $996 million in 1995.  Diluted earnings per share from 
continuing operations, excluding the special charges, were $0.74, compared 
with $2.58 in 1995.

     Results from continuing operations for 1995 included $257 million of 
profit sharing.  There was no profit sharing in 1996.

     Net income including discontinued operations for the year was $63 
million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.17.

     Royalty revenues were $300 million lower in 1996 than the record 
royalties received in 1995.  The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in 
royalty rates in exchange for longer-term agreements, expired licenses not yet 
renewed, and licensees' lower DRAM revenues.  Also, first-quarter 1995 royalty 
revenues included a favorable adjustment of $36 million related to higher-
than-estimated licensee shipments in the second half of 1994.

     Payments that licensees will make over the next five years under the ten-
year agreements with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Fujitsu Limited, Oki Ltd. 
and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. are expected to exceed payments 
made under the expired five-year licenses. 

     TI's backlog of unfilled orders for continuing operations as of 
December 31, 1996, was $1623 million, down $671 million from the end of 1995, 
due primarily to decreases in semiconductors and the sale of CMS, a divested 
activity.

     R&D for continuing operations was $1181 million for 1996, compared with 
$842 million for 1995.  The 1996 R&D includes the $192 million charge 
associated with the SSi acquisition.

40

     Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $2063 million in 
1996, compared with $1351 million in 1995.

     Depreciation for continuing operations for 1996 was $904 million, 
compared with $681 million in 1995.  

SEMICONDUCTOR:  For 1996, orders in the semiconductor segment were down 29 
percent, and revenues were down 17 percent from 1995, primarily because of the 
precipitous drop in DRAM prices and lower royalties.  Fourth quarter orders 
for DSPS, comprised of digital signal processors plus mixed-signal/analog 
products, grew more than 30 percent over the fourth quarter of 1995, with 
particular strength in wireless communications and mass storage applications. 
DSPS revenues in 1996 increased strongly from 1995 and were slightly less than 
40 percent of the company's total semiconductor revenues during the fourth 
quarter.

     Semiconductor segment profits for 1996 were down from 1995 because of 
sharply lower DRAM prices and lower royalties.  Semiconductor segment profit 
in the fourth quarter of 1996 was up significantly from the third quarter as 
all product groups showed improvement.  Memory, while improved, operated at a 
loss in the fourth quarter due to continued lower prices and the high level of 
fixed investment.

MATERIALS & CONTROLS:  Compared with 1995, orders in the materials & controls 
segment were up 6 percent in 1996, and revenues were up 7 percent, primarily 
due to strength in sensors and automotive.  PFO increased from $82 million in 
1995 to $90 million in 1996.

EDUCATIONAL & PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS:  Orders in TI's educational & 
productivity solutions segment were up 12 percent in 1996, and revenues were 
up 11 percent, compared with 1995.   As expected, calculators operated at 
break-even in the fourth quarter after achieving substantial seasonal profits 
in the second and third quarters.  PFO improved from $51 million in 1995 to 
$56 million in 1996.

EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES:  TI's digital imaging products continue to make steady 
progress in the transition from R&D to initial production, targeted at the 
very competitive commercial projection display market.  The major long-term 
challenge continues to be cost reduction to levels that will permit 
participation in several markets.

SPECIAL CHARGES/GAINS:   The special charges for continuing operations during 
1996 included $192 million for in-process R&D associated with the purchase of 
SSi in the third quarter, and $91 million in the fourth quarter for severance 
costs related to voluntary retirement and involuntary actions (including $61 
million for semiconductor employees), as well as $117 million for asset write-
downs on certain product lines, principally mobile computing, a divested 
activity.

DIVESTED ACTIVITIES:  These activities operated at a loss during the year, 
mainly due to the high level of marketing expense and intense price 
competition in mobile computing, as well as continued investments and new 
product development in the software business and in communications and 
electronics systems.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:  For discontinued operations, a special pretax charge 
of $32 million was taken for voluntary and involuntary severance actions 
during the fourth quarter of 1996.

In the first quarter of 1997, the company took a pretax charge of $56 million 
related to the sale of its mobile computing business and termination of its 
digital imaging printing development program.  Results for the second quarter 
of 1997 include a pretax operating charge of $44 million for the termination 
of agreements related to proposed Thailand joint ventures and a $66 million 
pretax gain from the sale of three divested activities, principally software.  
As a result of the 1997 acquisition of Amati Communications Corporation, the 
Company took a charge of $461 million in the fourth quarter for the value of 
acquired in-process research and development.  Also in the fourth quarter, the 
company took a pretax charge of $42 million, primarily for severance costs 
related to cost reduction actions by the materials & controls business.

    As a result of the 1996 acquisition of SSi, the company took a charge of 
$192 million in the third quarter of 1996 for the value of acquired in-process 
research and development.  In the fourth quarter of 1996, the company accrued 
$105 million for catch-up royalty revenues due under the new cross-license 
agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.  Also in the fourth quarter, the 
company took a pretax charge of $208 million for cost reduction actions.

    Diluted earnings (loss) per common share are calculated in accordance with
