                                     PART I

ITEM 1.   Business. 

General
- -------
          Texas Instruments Incorporated (hereinafter the "Registrant," 
including subsidiaries except where the context indicates otherwise) is one of
the world's foremost high technology companies, with sales or manufacturing 
operations in more than 30 countries.  The Registrant is engaged in the 
development, manufacture, and sale of a variety of products in the commercial 
electronics and electrical industry primarily for industrial and consumer 
markets.  These products consist of components, digital products and 
metallurgical materials.  In addition, the Registrant's patent portfolio has 
been established as an ongoing contributor to the Registrant's revenues.  The 
Registrant's business is based principally on its broad semiconductor 
technology and application of this technology to digital solutions for the 
networked society.  The Registrant from time to time considers acquisitions 
and divestitures which may alter its business mix.  The Registrant may effect 
one or more such transactions at such time or times as the Registrant 
determines to be appropriate. As discussed below, the Registrant and Raytheon 
Company ("Raytheon") entered into a definitive agreement as of January 4, 1997 
under which Raytheon will purchase the Registrant's defense systems and 
electronics business.  See "ITEM 1. Business, Discontinued Operations."

          The information with respect to net revenues, profit and 
identifiable assets of the Registrant's industry segments and operations 
outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the financial 
statements captioned "Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations" on 
pages 28-30 of the Registrant's 1996 annual report to stockholders, is 
incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

Components
- ----------
          Components consist of semiconductor integrated circuits (such as 
digital signal processors, mixed-signal and analog circuits, microprocessors/ 
microcontrollers, applications processors, memories, and digital circuits), 
semiconductor discrete devices, semiconductor subassemblies (such as custom 
modules for specific applications), and electrical and electronic control 
devices (such as motor protectors, starting relays, circuit breakers, 
thermostats, sensors, and radio-frequency identification systems).

          These components are used in a broad range of products for 
industrial end-use (such as computers and peripheral equipment, 
telecommunications, instrumentation, and industrial motor controls and 
automation equipment), consumer end-use (such as cellular phones, modems, 
televisions, cameras, automobiles, home appliances, and residential air 
conditioning and heating systems), and government end-use (such as defense and 
space equipment).  The Registrant sells these components primarily to original 
equipment manufacturers principally through its own marketing organizations 
and to a lesser extent through distributors.














                                      2

Digital Products
- ----------------
          Digital products include electronic calculators, software 
productivity tools, mobile computing products and other electronic systems. 
In 1996, the Registrant sold substantially all of its custom manufacturing 
services business and its printer business.  Subsequent to year-end 1996, the 
Registrant reached an agreement to sell its mobile computing business. Digital 
products are used in a broad range of enterprise-wide, work group and personal 
information-based applications.  The Registrant markets these products through 
various channels, including system suppliers, business equipment dealers, 
distributors, retailers, and direct sales to end-users and original equipment 
manufacturers.

Metallurgical Materials
- -----------------------
          Metallurgical materials include clad metals, precision-engineered 
parts and electronic connectors for use in a variety of applications such as 
appliances, automobiles, electronic components, and industrial and 
telecommunications equipment.  These metallurgical materials are primarily 
sold directly to original equipment manufacturers.

Discontinued Operations
- -----------------------
          The Registrant's defense systems and electronics business ("DSE") 
consists of radar systems, navigation systems, infrared surveillance and fire 
control systems, defense suppression missiles, other weapon systems (including 
antitank and interdiction weapons), missile guidance and control systems, 
electronic warfare systems, and other defense electronic equipment.  Sales are 
made to the U.S. government (either directly or through prime contractors) and 
to international customers approved by the U.S. government.

          The Registrant and Raytheon entered into a definitive agreement as 
of January 4, 1997 under which Raytheon will purchase DSE. In connection with 
the sale, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the 
Registrant has restated prior financial statements and financial information 
to segregate the results of DSE from detailed financial components.  As such, 
defense-related financial results are reported in the Registrant's 
consolidated financial statements on pages 18-21 of the Registrant's 1996 
annual report to stockholders as discontinued operations. Operating results, 
net asset and other information for discontinued operations appears in the 
note to the financial statements captioned Discontinued Operations; unless 
otherwise indicated, the financial amounts in this Form 10-K have been 
adjusted to reflect continuing operations only.

Competition
- -----------
          The Registrant is engaged in highly competitive businesses.  Its 
competitors include several of the largest companies in the United States, 
Asia, and elsewhere abroad as well as many small, specialized companies.  The 
Registrant is a significant competitor in each of its principal businesses.  
Generally, the Registrant's businesses are characterized by rapidly changing 
technology which has, throughout the Registrant's history, intensified the 
competitive factors, primarily performance and price. 

Backlog
- -------
          The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by the Registrant to 
be firm was $1623 million as of December 31, 1996 and $2294 million as of 
December 31, 1995. The Registrant's backlog does not represent actual revenues 
and is only an indication of future revenues which may be entered on the books 
of account of the Registrant. Backlog orders are, under certain circumstances, 
subject to cancellation by the purchaser without penalty and generally do not 
reflect any potential adjustments for price decreases.


                                  3

Raw Materials
- -------------
          The Registrant purchases materials, parts and supplies from a number 
of suppliers.  The Registrant's silicon materials operation became part of a 
joint venture with MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc., in May 1995.  The 
Registrant retains a minority ownership interest in the joint venture.  The 
materials, parts and supplies essential to the Registrant's business are 
generally available at present and the Registrant believes at this time that 
such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable 
future.

Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
          The Registrant owns many patents in the United States and other 
countries in fields relating to its business.  The Registrant has developed a 
strong, broad-based patent portfolio.  The Registrant also has several 
agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that 
other licenses may be negotiated in the future.  The Registrant does not 
consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent 
license, although taken as a whole, the rights of the Registrant and the 
products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to the 
Registrant's business.  As noted above, the Registrant's patent portfolio has 
been established as an ongoing contributor to the revenues of the Registrant.  
See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations."

          The Registrant owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its 
business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which 
are "Texas Instruments" and the Registrant's corporate monogram. 

Research and Development
- ------------------------
          The Registrant's research and development expense was $1181 million 
in 1996, compared with $842 million in 1995 and $578 million in 1994, and 
included a one-time charge in 1996 of $192 million for the value of acquired 
in-process research and development as a result of the acquisition of Silicon 
Systems, Inc. 

Seasonality
- -----------
          The Registrant's revenues are subject to some seasonal variation. 

Employees
- ---------
          The information concerning the number of persons employed by the 
Registrant, including persons employed in the Registrant's defense business, 
at December 31, 1996 on page 32 of the Registrant's 1996 annual report to 
stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

</TABLE>

          The Registrant's facilities in the United States contained 
approximately 19,600,000 square feet as of December 31, 1996, of which 
approximately 5,400,000 square feet were leased.  The Registrant's facilities 
outside the United States contained approximately 7,000,000 square feet as of 
December 31, 1996, of which approximately 1,800,000 square feet were leased. 

          The Registrant believes that its existing properties are in good 
condition and suitable for the manufacture of its products.  At the end of 
1996, the Registrant utilized substantially all of the space in its 
facilities. 

          Leases covering the Registrant's leased facilities expire at varying 
dates generally within the next 10 years.  The Registrant anticipates no 
difficulty in either retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-
month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or replacing the leased 
facilities with equivalent facilities.
                                  5
ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings.

         As indicated in the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K dated 
November 26, 1996, the Registrant reached agreement on a broad 10-year cross 
license agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., of Korea, which settled 
all pending litigation between the companies, including the litigation 
discussed in ITEM 3 of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 1995 and ITEM 1 of the Registrant's Quarterly Reports 
on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and September 30, 1996.

          On July 19, 1991, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District 
Court against Fujitsu Limited of Japan ("Fujitsu") seeking injunctive relief, 
alleging that Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of certain DRAMs infringe the 
Registrant's Japanese patent on the invention of the integrated circuit (the 
"Kilby" patent).  Concurrently, Fujitsu brought a lawsuit in the same court 
against the Registrant, seeking a declaration that Fujitsu is not infringing 
the Kilby patent.  On August 31, 1994, the district court ruled that Fujitsu's 
production of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K EPROMs does not infringe 
the Kilby patent.  The Registrant has appealed the court's decision to the 
Tokyo High Court.

          The Registrant is involved in various investigations and proceedings 
conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain state 
environmental agencies regarding disposal of waste materials.  Although the 
factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, the 
Registrant believes that the amount of its liability will not have a material 
adverse effect upon its financial position or results of operations and, in 
most cases, the Registrant's liability will be limited to sharing clean-up or 
other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties.

At Texas Instruments, 1996 was a year of challenge.

    Net revenues from continuing operations were $9.9 billion in 1996, down 
from $11.4 billion in 1995. PFO from continuing operations, excluding special 
charges for cost reduction actions and in-process R&D, was $374 million, down 
from $1439 million in 1995. As a result of the announced sale of TI's defense 
business to Raytheon Company, financial figures throughout this report have 
been adjusted to reflect defense as a discontinued business. We have also 
announced the sale of our mobile computing business to The Acer Group.

    In TI's continuing operations, most of the decrease in revenues was due to 
a precipitous drop in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) prices. From the 
fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996, DRAM prices dropped 
about 80 percent. In our differentiated semiconductor business, however, 
revenues for digital signal processing solutions (DSPS), comprised of digital 
signal processors plus mixed-signal/analog products, continued to establish 
new records. Revenues for all differentiated semiconductor products were 
nearly two-thirds of the company's total semiconductor revenues in fourth-
quarter 1996.

    As an extended family, Texas Instruments faced its greatest challenge of 
the year in the sudden death of our leader and our friend, Jerry Junkins. A 
tribute to Jerry immediately follows this letter.

    Our vision.  In last year's annual report, we introduced a new vision for 
Texas Instruments. That vision is World Leadership in Digital Solutions for 
the Networked Society. There are three very significant global trends shaping 
the networked society.

    Number one is the continuing personalization of electronics across 
computing, communication and entertainment. The second trend is 
digitalization. While unknown to most users, this digitalization trend means 
that for the first time all personal electronics 
will be speaking a common digital language. The third trend is connectivity, 
brought on primarily by computer networking and the recent emergence of the 
Internet in the public domain, and by the growing wireless networks of the 
world.

    Personalized electronics for computing, communication and entertainment - 
all speaking a common language - all connected together. These trends will 
create a networked society, with its profound impact on the way we live, 
learn, work and play. The networked society is still more talk than reality 
right now. At TI, we will be a leader in creating the digital solutions that 
shape the networked society. It's the companies who get out in front today 
that will lead that society forward. TI will be one of those companies.

    Our strategic direction.  1996 was a year of strategy development at TI, 
providing a company direction that will help us realize our vision.  It has 
three elements - value, growth and improved financial stability.

    Value.  First, we will deliver high-quality, value-added solutions to our 
customers and to end-users - solutions that provide sustainable 
differentiation. Technology and market understanding are at the core of a 
value-added solution. At TI, we want to have architectural leadership in every 
major market where we compete. Then

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accounting Policies and Practices
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all 
subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of 
estimates from which final results may vary.  Intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated.  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency 
for financial reporting.  With regard to accounts recorded in currencies other 
than U.S. dollars, current assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, 
other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at 
exchange rates in effect at year end.  Inventories, property, plant and 
equipment and depreciation thereon are remeasured at historic exchange rates.  
Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are 
remeasured at the appropriate month-end rate of exchange.  Net currency 
exchange gains and losses from remeasurement and forward currency exchange 
contracts to hedge net balance sheet exposures are charged or credited on a 
current basis to other income (expense) net.  Gains and losses from forward 
currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge specific 
transactions are included in the measurement of the related transactions.

     As discussed in the Discontinued Operations footnote, the consolidated 
financial statements have been restated to classify TI's Defense Systems and 
Electronics business as discontinued operations.  Also, beginning in 1996, the 
company has made reclassifications to its statement of income to conform with 
current industry practices.  Research and development expense, which was 
previously included in cost of revenues, is now presented separately.  Also, 
employees' retirement and profit sharing plans expense, previously separately 
reported, is now allocated throughout operating costs and expenses, consistent 
with other employee benefit costs.  Prior year amounts have been reclassified 
to conform with the 1996 presentation.

     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, current replacement cost or 
estimated realizable value.  Cost is generally computed on a currently 
adjusted standard (which approximates current average costs) or average basis.

     Revenues are generally recognized as products are shipped or services are 
rendered.  Royalty revenue is recognized by the company upon fulfillment of 
its contractual obligations and determination of a fixed royalty amount, or, 
in the case of ongoing royalties, upon sale by the licensee of royalty-bearing 
products, as estimated by the company.

     Substantially all depreciation is computed by either the declining-
balance method (primarily 150 percent declining method) or the sum-of-the-
years-digits method.  Fully depreciated assets are written off against 
accumulated depreciation.

     Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $124 
million in 1996, $131 million in 1995 and $87 million in 1994.

     Earnings per common and common equivalent share are based on average 
common and common equivalent shares outstanding (192,117,119 shares, 
193,630,826 shares and 190,854,565 shares for 1996, 1995 and 1994).  Shares 
issuable upon exercise of dilutive stock options and upon conversion of 
dilutive convertible debentures are included in average common and common 
equivalent shares outstanding.  In computing per-share earnings, net income is 
increased by $2 million in both 1995 and 1994 for interest (net of tax and 
profit sharing effect) on the convertible debentures considered dilutive 
common stock equivalents.





Discontinued Operations
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On January 6, 1997, TI and Raytheon Company announced that their boards of 
directors had approved a definitive agreement dated as of January 4, 1997, for 
Raytheon to purchase TI's Defense Systems and Electronics business (DSE) for 
$2.95 billion in cash.  The transaction is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino 
antitrust review and is expected to close in the second quarter of 1997.  The 
consolidated financial statements of TI have been restated to present the DSE 
operations, assets and liabilities as discontinued operations.

The assets and liabilities of DSE have been classified on the balance sheet as 
net assets of discontinued operations and consist of the following:

     The Defense Systems and Electronics business includes products such as 
radar systems, navigation systems, infrared surveillance and fire control 
systems, defense suppression missiles, missile guidance and control systems, 
and electronic warfare systems, which are sold to the U.S. government (either 
directly or through prime contractors) and to international customers approved 
by the U.S. government.  TI has provided various ongoing services to DSE 
including, but not limited to, facilities management, data processing, 
security, payroll and employee benefits administration, insurance 
administration, duplicating and telecommunications services.  Their inclusion 
in discontinued operations is based upon TI's intercorporate allocation 
procedures for such services.  The allocation basis of these

expenses and all other central operating costs is first on the basis of direct 
usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated among DSE and other TI 
businesses on the basis of their respective revenues, headcount or other 
measures.  These expenses allocated to DSE totaled $163 million in 1996, $167 
million in 1995 and $161 million in 1994.  It is expected that TI will reach 
agreements for payments from Raytheon to continue to provide certain of these 
services on an ongoing basis and others on a transition basis to DSE following 
Raytheon's acquisition.

    Income from discontinued operations for 1996 includes the effect of a 
fourth quarter pretax charge of $32 million for voluntary and involuntary 
severance actions in the United States.  These actions were essentially 
completed by year-end 1996 and affected approximately 700 DSE employees.

Cash Equivalents and Investments
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debt securities with original maturities within three months are considered 
cash equivalents. Debt securities with original maturities beyond three months 
have remaining maturities within 13 months and are considered short-term 
investments.  These cash equivalent and short-term investment debt securities 
are available for sale and stated at fair value, which approximates their 
specific amortized cost.  As of December 31, 1996, these debt securities 
consisted primarily of the following types:  U.S. government ($9 million), 
corporate ($413 million), and asset-backed commercial paper ($300 million). At 
December 31, 1995, these debt securities consisted primarily of the following 
types:  U.S. government ($205 million), corporate ($667 million), and asset-
backed commercial paper ($405 million). Gross realized and unrealized gains 
and losses for each of these security types were immaterial in 1996, 1995 and 
1994.  Proceeds from sales of these cash equivalent and short-term investment 
debt securities in 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $10 million, $190 million and $75 
million.

     Adjustments to fair value of cash equivalent and short-term investments 
as well as noncurrent publicly traded equity investments are recorded as an 
increase or decrease in stockholders' equity.  At December 31, 1996, this 
adjustment, net of a deferred tax effect of $15 million, was an increase of 
$28 million (zero for cash equivalent and short-term investments and $28 
million for noncurrent equity investments).  At year-end 1995 and 1994, this 
adjustment was zero and a decrease of $1 million.  Gross realized and 
unrealized holding gains and losses and proceeds from sales of equity 
investments were immaterial in 1996, 1995 and 1994.  The aggregate fair value 
of these noncurrent equity investments at December 31, 1996 was $63 million 
compared to their original cost of $20 million.  Similar amounts for 1995 were 
immaterial.

     To secure access to additional semiconductor plant capacity, TI 
participates in several joint ventures formed to construct and operate DRAM 
semiconductor manufacturing facilities.  Upon formation of the ventures TI 
contributed technology and cash to acquire minority interests and entered into 
long-term inventory purchase commitments with each joint venture.  Under the 
agreements, TI purchases the output of the ventures at prices based upon 
percentage discounts from TI's average selling prices.  This pricing method is 
designed to help reduce the effect of market volatility on TI, although it may 
not be able to fully comprehend a sharp decline in average unit prices.  
Certain co-venturers have the right to buy a portion of the output from TI. 
Under the ventures' financing arrangements, the venturers have provided 
certain debt and other guarantees.  At December 31, 1996 and 1995, TI was 
contingently liable for an aggregate of $25 million and $40 million of such 
guarantees.  Inventory purchases from the ventures aggregated $1176 million in 
1996, $1779 million in 1995 and $908 million in 1994.   Receivables from and 
payables to the ventures were $43 million and $66 million at December 31, 
1996, and $25 million and $223 million at December 31, 1995.

     The purpose of the joint ventures is to provide semiconductor output for 
TI and other co-venturers.  As a result, TI expects to recover its cost of the 
ventures through sale of the semiconductor output, and is amortizing its cost 
of the ventures over the expected initial output period of 3 to 5 years, and 
recognizing its share of any cumulative venture net losses in excess of 
amortization.   The related expense charged to operations was $33 million in 
1996, $15 million in 1995 and $15 million in 1994.

</TABLE>

    In the first quarter of 1996, the company issued $300 million of 6.125% 
notes due 2006 and, in the third quarter, redeemed, at par, $150 million of 
9.0% notes due 1999.  In July 1996, the company acquired Silicon Systems, 
Inc., via a stock purchase agreement for $340 million in cash plus the 
assumption of $235 million 4.0% long-term notes ($217 million, as imputed to 
the then prevailing market interest rate of 6.65%) to TDK Corp. of Japan.  The 
cash payment, initially financed by a draw down on TI's existing line of bank 
credit, was permanently financed through the company's issuance on July 26 of 
$400 million of notes due 1999 and 2000.

    The convertible subordinated debentures may be redeemed at the company's 
option at specified prices. The debentures are convertible at the holder's 
option into an aggregate 2,493,031 shares of TI common stock at a common stock 
conversion price of $41.4375 per share.

    A portion of the coupon rates for the notes due 2001 and 2007 (in 1995, 
notes due 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007) have been swapped for commercial-paper-
based or LIBOR-based variable rates through March 1997, resulting in a 
combination of fixed plus short-term variable rates for an effective interest 
rate of approximately 9.1% and 9.5% as of December 31, 1996 and 1995.  The 
Italian lira mortgage notes, and related swaps, are due in installments 
through 2005.  The mortgage notes are collateralized by real estate and 
building equipment.

    Interest incurred on loans in 1996, 1995 and 1994 was $108 million, $69 
million and $58 million.  Of these amounts, $35 million in 1996, $21 million 
in 1995 and $13 million in 1994  were capitalized as a component of capital 
asset construction costs.  Interest paid on loans (net of amounts capitalized) 
was $54 million in 1996, $48 million in 1995 and $53 million in 1994.

    Aggregate maturities of long-term debt due during the four years 
subsequent to December 31, 1997, are as follows:

    The company maintains lines of credit to support commercial paper 
borrowings and to provide additional liquidity.  These lines of credit totaled 
$696 million at December 31, 1996 and $538 million at December 31, 1995.  Of 
these amounts, at December 31, 1996 and 1995, $600 million and $440 million 
exist to support outstanding and future commercial paper borrowings or short-
term bank loans.  At December 31, 1996, outstanding commercial paper 
borrowings of $299 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.49% are 
included in current loans payable.

Financial Instruments and Risk Concentration
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial instruments:  In addition to the swaps discussed in the preceding 
note, as of December 31, 1996, the company had forward currency exchange 
contracts outstanding of $333 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures 
(including $82 million to buy deutsche mark, $48 million to sell yen, and $36 
million to sell French francs).  At December 31, 1995, the company had forward 
currency exchange contracts outstanding of $303 million to hedge net balance 
sheet exposures (including $78 million to buy deutsche mark, $40 million to 
buy Singapore dollars, and $36 million to buy yen).  As of December 31, 1996 
and 1995, the carrying amounts and current market settlement values of these 
swaps and forward contracts were not significant.

    The company uses forward currency exchange contracts, including the 
lira note swaps, to minimize the adverse impacts from the effect of exchange 
rate fluctuations on the company's underlying non-U.S. net balance sheet 
exposures. The interest rate swaps for the company's notes due 2001 
and 2007 (in 1995, notes due 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007) are used to change the 
characteristics of the interest rate stream on the debt from fixed rates to a 
combination of fixed plus short-term variable rates in order to achieve a mix 
of interest rates which, over time, is expected to moderate financing costs.  
The effect of these interest rate swaps was to increase interest expense by $2 
million and $6 million in 1996 and 1995 and reduce interest expense by $8 
million in 1994.  These interest rate swaps are sensitive to interest rate 
changes.  If short-term interest rates increase (decrease) by one percentage 
point from year-end 1996 rates, annual interest expense would increase 
(decrease) by $3 million.

    In order to minimize its exposure to credit risk, the company limits its 
counterparties on the forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate 
swaps to investment-grade rated financial institutions.

    As of December 31, 1996, and 1995, the fair value of long-term debt, based 
on current interest rates, was approximately $1759 million and $902 million,  
compared with the carrying amount of $1712 million and $817 million.

    Risk concentration:  Financial instruments which potentially subject the 
company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash investments and 
accounts receivable.  The company places its cash investments in investment-
grade, short-term debt securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to 
any one commercial issuer.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the 
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers in the company's


24  Texas Instruments Incorporated and Subsidiaries  1996 Annual Report






















































customer base, and their dispersion across different industries and geographic 
areas.  The company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the expected 
collectibility of accounts receivable.

Stockholders' Equity
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. None 
are currently outstanding.

    Each outstanding share of the company's common stock carries half a stock
purchase right.  Under certain circumstances, each right may be exercised to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of the company's participating
cumulative preferred stock for $200.  Under certain circumstances following
the acquisition of 20% or more of the company's outstanding common stock by an
acquiring person (as defined in the rights agreement), each right (other than
rights held by an acquiring person) may be exercised to purchase common stock
of the company or a successor company with a market value of twice the $200
exercise price.  The rights, which are redeemable by the company at 1 cent per
right, expire in June 1998.

Research and Development Expense
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and development expense, which totaled $1181 million in 1996, $842 
million in 1995 and $578 million in 1994, included a one-time charge in 1996 
of $192 million for the value of acquired in-process research and development 
as a result of the acquisition of Silicon Systems, Inc., a semiconductor 
enterprise.  There was no tax offset associated with this one-time charge.

Stock Options
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The company has stock options outstanding to participants under the Texas 
Instruments 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by stockholders on 
April 18, 1996.  Options are also outstanding under the 1984 and 1988 Stock 
Option Plans and the Texas Instruments Long-Term Incentive Plan; however, no 
further options may be granted under these plans.  Under all these 
stockholder-approved plans, the exercise price per share may not be less than 
100 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant.  Substantially 
all the options have a 10-year term and do not become exercisable until after 
eight years, although exercisability may be accelerated to the extent that 
earnings per share goals are achieved.

    Under the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company may grant stock 
options, including incentive stock options; restricted stock and restricted 
stock units; performance units; and other stock-based awards, including stock 
appreciation rights.  The plan provides for the issuance of 18,500,000 shares 
of the company's common stock; in addition, if any award under the 1984 or 
1988 Stock Option Plans or the Long-Term Incentive Plan terminates, then any 
unissued shares subject to the terminated award become available for granting 
awards under the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  No more than 2,000,000 shares 
of common stock may be awarded as restricted stock, restricted stock units or 
other stock-based awards under the plan.  In 1996, 55,014 shares of restricted 
stock units, which vest over 1 to 5 years, were granted (weighted-average 
award-date value of $45.31 per share).  In addition, 34,906 previously 
unissued shares were issued as Annual Incentive Plan stock awards in 1996 
(weighted-average award-date value of $46.56 per share).  Compensation expense 
for restricted stock units and annual stock awards totaled $1.6 million in 
1996.

    The company also has stock options outstanding under an Employees Stock
Option Purchase Plan approved by stockholders in 1988.  The plan provides for
options to be offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a
percentage of the employee's prior year's compensation.  If the optionee
authorizes and does not cancel payroll deductions which, with interest, will
be equal to or greater than the purchase price, options granted become
exercisable 14 months, and expire not more than 27 months, from date of grant.

    Stock option transactions during 1996, 1995 and 1994 were as follows:

     In accordance with the terms of APB No. 25, the company records no 
compensation expense for its stock option awards.  As required by SFAS 
No. 123, the company provides the following disclosure of hypothetical values 
for these awards.  The weighted-average grant-date value of options granted 
during 1996 was estimated to be $18.47 under the Long-Term Incentive Plans 
(Long-Term Plans) and $12.10 under the Employees Stock Option Purchase Plan 
(Employees Plan).  These values were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  expected

      1996 Annual Report    Texas Instruments Incorporated and Subsidiaries 25
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)

dividend yields of 1.48% (Long-Term Plans) and 1.21% (Employees Plan), 
expected volatility of 39%, risk-free interest rates of 5.42% (Long-Term 
Plans) and 6.15% (Employees Plan); and expected lives of 6 years (Long-Term 
Plans) and 1.5 years (Employees Plan).  Had compensation expense been recorded 
based on these hypothetical values, the company's 1996 net income would have 
been $40 million, or $0.21 per share.  A similar computation for 1995 would 
have resulted in net income of $1078 million, or $5.57 per share.  Because 
options vest over several years and additional option grants are expected, the 
effects of these hypothetical calculations are not likely to be representative 
of similar future calculations.

Term Plans and Stock Option Plans at December 31, 1996, is as follows:

At December 31, 1996, the stock options outstanding under the Employees Plan 
have exercise prices of $56.25 or $59.32, depending on the year of grant, and 
a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 1.3 years.  Of the total 
outstanding options, 412,022 are exercisable at year-end 1996.

     In connection with the purchase of DSE by Raytheon Company, vested TI 
options held by DSE employees under the Long-Term Plans and Stock Option Plans 
will be modified by TI to retain their full contractual life instead of 
expiring within three months of the DSE transaction.  As a result, an expense 
charge to discontinued operations will be recorded at the time of the 
transaction closing.  Unvested Long-Term Plan options will be canceled and 
replaced by Raytheon Company with Raytheon options.  Vested Employees Plan 
options will expire three months after closing.  Unvested Employees Plan 
options will be canceled and payroll deductions, with interest, will be 
refunded.  At December 31, 1996, options held by DSE employees were as 
follows:

At year-end 1996, 18,415,865  shares were available for future grants under 
the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2,237,858 shares under the Employees 
Stock Option Purchase Plan.  As of year-end 1996, 28,765,675 shares were 
reserved for issuance under the company's stock option and incentive plans and 

3,434,042 shares were reserved for issuance under the Employees Stock Option 
Purchase Plan.

    The company acquires its common stock from time to time for use in 
connection with exercise of stock options and other stock transactions.  
Treasury shares acquired in 1996, 1995 and 1994 were 7,730 shares, 135,001 
shares and 59,198 shares.  Previously unissued common shares issued under the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Annual Incentive Plan in 1996, 1995 and 1994  
were 49,036 shares, 16,386 shares and 46,330 shares.  Treasury shares issued 
under the Texas Instruments Restricted Stock Unit Plan for Directors in 1996 
were 2,334 shares.

Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company provides various incentive plans for employees, including general
profit sharing and savings programs as well as an Annual Incentive Plan for
key employees.  The company also provides pension and retiree health care
benefit plans in the U.S. and pension plans in certain non-U.S. locations.

    Profit sharing:  There was no profit sharing expense in 1996.  Profit 
sharing expense was $257 million in 1995 and $133 million in 1994.  Under the 
plans, unless otherwise provided by local law, the company and certain of its 
subsidiaries contribute a portion of their net profits equal to 25% of the 
amount by which consolidated income (as defined) before profit sharing and 
income taxes exceeds 8% of the company's consolidated average assets for the 
year.  Effective 1995, the majority of the profit sharing plans worldwide 
provide that, depending on the individual plan, from 50% to 100% of the profit 
sharing earned by employees is paid in cash to the eligible participants with 
the balance contributed to a deferred plan.  For non-U.S. employees, 
contributions to a deferred plan generally are invested in TI common stock.  
For U.S. employees, several investment options, including TI common stock, are 
available. 

    Except in the event of company contributions in stock, investments in TI 
common stock are made by the trustees through purchases of outstanding shares 
or through purchases of shares offered from time to time by the company.  The 
board of directors has authorized the issuance of previously unissued shares 
for purposes of the plans; 4,616,918 of such shares were available for future 
issuance at December 31, 1996.

    The trustees of the profit sharing plans purchased 3,123,905 outstanding 
shares of TI common stock in 1996 (4,762,460 shares in 1995 and 1,881,815 
shares in 1994) and no previously unissued shares in 1996 and 1995 (403,945 
shares in 1994) for use in the profit sharing plans and savings program.

    Savings program:  The company provides a matched savings program whereby 
U.S. employees' contributions of up to 4% of their salary are matched by the 
company at the rate of 50 cents per dollar.  Contributions are subject to 
statutory limitations.  The contributions may be invested in several 
investment funds including TI common stock.  The company's expense under this 
program was $17 million in 1996, $14 million in 1995 and $13 million in 1994.

    U.S. pension plan:  The company has a defined benefit plan covering most
U.S. employees with benefits based on years of service and employee's
compensation.  The plan is a career-average-pay plan which has been amended
periodically in the past to produce approximately the same results as a final-
pay type plan.  The board of directors of the company has expressed an intent
to make such amendments in the future, circumstances permitting, and the

26   Texas Instruments Incorporated and Subsidiaries   1996 Annual Report

expected effects of such amendments have been considered in calculating U.S.
pension expense.  The company's funding policy is to contribute to the plan at
least the minimum amount required by ERISA.  Plan assets consist primarily of
common stock, U.S. government obligations, commercial paper and real estate.

    As noted in the Discontinued Operations footnote, accrued retirement costs 
of $226 million at year-end 1996 and $207 million at year-end 1995, consisting 
primarily of the U.S. pension plan and the retiree health care benefit plan 
obligations and assets related to DSE employees, is included in discontinued 
operations.  The following information on pension and retiree health care 
benefit plans excludes discontinued operations amounts.

    Pension expense of the U.S. plan includes the following components:

    The projected benefit obligations for 1996 and 1995 were determined using 
assumed discount rates of 7.25% and 7.0% and an assumed average long-term pay 
progression rate of 4.25%.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan 
assets was 9.0%.

    Non-U.S. pension plans:  Retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees of the
company is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans.
Retirement benefits are based on years of service and employee's compensation,
generally during a fixed number of years immediately prior to retirement.
Funding policies are based on local statutes.  Plan assets consist primarily
of common stock, government obligations and corporate bonds.

    Pension expense of the non-U.S. plans includes the following components:

    The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. plans reflects the 
different economic environments within the various countries.  The projected 
benefit obligations were determined using a range of assumed discount rates of 
3.25% to 8.0% in 1996 and 1995 and a range of assumed average long-term pay 
progression rates of 3.0% to 6.0% in 1996 and 3.5% to 6.0% in 1995.   The 
range of assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets was 7.0% to 9.0%.  
Accrued pension at December 31 includes approximately $111 million in 1996 and 
$101 million in 1995 for two non-U.S. plans that are not funded.  Pension 
accounting rules require recognition in the balance sheet of an additional 
minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated benefit 
obligation over the fair value of the plan assets.  A corresponding amount is 
recognized as an intangible asset, not to exceed the amount of unrecognized 
prior service cost, with the balance recorded as a reduction of stockholders' 
equity.  As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the company has recorded an 
additional non-U.S. minimum pension liability of $48 million and $56 million 
and an equity reduction of $39 million and $45 million.

    Retiree health care benefit plan:  The company's U.S. employees are 
currently eligible to receive, during retirement, specified company-paid 
medical benefits.  The plan is contributory and premiums

are adjusted annually.  For employees retiring on or after January 5, 1993, 
the company has specified a maximum annual amount per retiree, based on years 
of service, that it will pay toward retiree medical premiums.  For employees 
who retired prior to that date, the company maintains a consistent level of 
cost sharing between the company and the retiree.  Any funding of the plan 
obligation will be at amounts determined at the discretion of management.

    Expense of the retiree health care benefit plan includes the following
components:

    Retiree health care benefit amounts were determined using health care cost 
trend rates of 7.3% for 1997 decreasing to 5.0% by 2000, and assumed discount 
rates of 7.25% for 1996 and 7.0% for 1995.  Increasing the health care cost 
trend rates by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1996, by $16 million and 1996 plan expense by $2  
million.

    Special actions:  In the fourth quarter of 1996, the company took a pretax 
charge of $208 million, of which $91 million was for severance for cost 
reduction actions consisting of a voluntary retirement program in the United 
States and selected involuntary employment reductions worldwide.  These 
actions, which primarily involved the components and digital products segments 
were essentially completed by year-end 1996 and affected approximately 2,600 
employees.  The balance of the charge, $117 million, was for asset write-downs 
on several product lines, primarily the mobile computing business.  In 1994, 
the company took a pretax charge of $126 million for restructuring of its 
European operations and divestiture of certain non-strategic product lines.  
These actions were essentially completed by year-end 1995.

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company is engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a variety 
of products in the commercial electronic and electrical industry primarily for 
industrial and consumer markets.  These products and their markets consist of 
the following:  components (semiconductors, such as integrated circuits, 
discrete devices and subassemblies, and electrical and electronic control 
devices) which are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers 
principally through the company's own marketing organizations and to a lesser 
extent through distributors; digital products (such as electronic calculators, 
software productivity tools, mobile computing products and other electronic 
systems) which are marketed through various channels, including system 
suppliers, business equipment dealers, distributors, retailers and direct 
sales to end-users and original equipment manufacturers. In 1996, the company 
sold substantially all of its custom manufacturing services business and its 
printer business, which were part of the digital products segment.  Subsequent 
to year-end 1996, the company entered into an agreement to sell its mobile 
computing business.  The company also produces metallurgical materials 
(including clad metals, precision-engineered parts and electronic connectors) 
which are primarily sold directly to original equipment manufacturers.

    The company's business is based principally on its broad semiconductor 
technology and application of this technology to digital solutions for the 
networked society.

    Industry segment and geographic area profit (loss) is not equivalent to 
income (loss) before provision for income taxes due to exclusion of general 
corporate expenses, net interest, currency exchange gains and losses, and 
other items along with elimination of unrealized profit in assets.  Profit 
sharing expense is allocated to segment results based on payroll costs.  
Beginning the fourth quarter of 1995, for geographic area purposes 
responsibility for certain interarea product transfers was changed consistent 
with the company's pan-European operations approach.  The effect of this 
change on 1995 geographic area results was to increase Europe profits and 
decrease U.S. profits by approximately $70 million.  Additionally, prior to 
1995, for geographic area purposes U.S. interarea product transfers for 
further processing were recorded as cost credits.  In 1995, such transfers are 
recorded as interarea revenues.  The effect of this change was to increase 
1995 U.S. interarea revenues by approximately $960 million. Royalty revenue 
from patent license agreements is included in the U.S. geographic net revenues 
and (except for royalty revenue from microcomputer system patent license 
agreements, which is included in the digital products segment) is principally 
included in the components segment.

    Identifiable assets are those associated with segment or geographic area
operations, excluding unallocated cash and short-term investments, internal
company receivables and deferred income taxes.  Generally, revenues between
industry segments and between geographic areas are based on prevailing market
prices or an approximation thereof.

    With the exception of interarea elimination of unrealized profit in 
assets, which increased $3 million in 1996, increased $5 million in 1995 and 
increased $18 million in 1994, the remaining corporate items consist primarily 
of general corporate expenses which are applicable to both U.S. and non-U.S.

    Included in the effect of non-U.S. rates for 1996, 1995 and 1994 is a $4 
million, a $93 million and a $69 million benefit from tax loss carryforward 
utilization reduced by certain non-U.S. taxes and losses for which no benefit 
was recognized.  Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed 
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from 
such companies are expected to result in additional tax liability.  The 
remaining undistributed earnings (approximately $760 million at December 31, 
1996) have been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made 
for taxes due upon remittance of these earnings.  Determination of the amount 
of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not 
practicable.

    The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
at December 31 were as follows:

</TABLE>
    As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the net deferred income tax asset of 
$455 million and $438 million was presented in the balance sheet, based on tax 
jurisdiction, as deferred income tax assets of $587 million and $532 million 
and deferred income tax liabilities of $132 million and $94 million.  The 
valuation allowance shown above reflects the company's ongoing assessment 
regarding the realizability of certain non-U.S. deferred income tax assets.  
The balance of the deferred income tax assets is considered realizable based 
on carryback potential, existing taxable temporary differences, and 
expectation of future income levels comparable to recent results.  Such future 
income levels are not assured because of the nature of the company's 
businesses, which are generally characterized by rapidly changing technology 
and intense competition.

    The company has aggregate non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately 
$95 million.  Of this amount, $38 million expires through the year 2006 and 
$57 million has no expiration.

    Income taxes paid were $240 million, $384 million and $399 million for 
1996, 1995 and 1994.

Rental Expense and Lease Commitments
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rental and lease expense was $175 million in 1996, $151 million in 1995 and 
$143 million in 1994.  The company conducts certain operations in leased 
facilities and also leases a portion of its data processing and other 
equipment.  The lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal 
provisions and require the company to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance 
costs.

    At December 31, 1996, the company was committed under non-cancelable
leases with minimum rentals in succeeding years as follows:

The Board of Directors
Texas Instruments Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas

and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' 
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 1996.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Texas 
Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and 
the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

1996 Results of Operations Compared with 1995
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TI's orders for continuing operations for 1996 were $9.3 billion, down 23 
percent from $12.1 billion in 1995.  Significantly reduced DRAM prices in the 
components segment were the primary contributor to the change.

    TI's net revenues for continuing operations for 1996 were $9.9 billion, 
down 13 percent from $11.4 billion in 1995.  The decrease in the components 
segment was due to significantly lower DRAM prices and reduced royalties.  
Digital signal processors and mixed-signal/analog products grew strongly in 
1996.  In the digital products segment, the sale of substantially all the 
Custom Manufacturing Services (CMS) business in the first quarter and the sale 
of the printer business in the third quarter accounted for most of the 
decrease.

    PFO from continuing operations for 1996, excluding the special charges, 
was $374 million, down from $1439 million in 1995 primarily because of 
significantly lower DRAM prices and reduced royalties.  Including the special 
charges, loss from operations was $26 million.

    The special charges for continuing operations during 1996 include $192 
million for in-process R&D associated with the purchase of Silicon Systems, 
Inc. (SSi) in the third quarter, and $91 million in the fourth quarter for 
severance costs related to voluntary retirement and involuntary actions, as 
well as $117 million for asset write-downs on certain product lines, 
principally mobile computing.

    Net loss from continuing operations including special charges in 1996 was 
$46 million, and loss per share was $0.24.  Net income for the year from 
continuing operations, excluding the special charges, was $281 million, 
compared with $996 million in 1995.  Earnings per share from continuing 
operations, excluding the special charges, were $1.46, compared with $5.15 in 
1995.

    Results from continuing operations for 1995 included $257 million of 
profit sharing.  There was no profit sharing in 1996.

    Net income including discontinued operations for the year was $63 million, 
and earnings per share were $0.33.

    Royalty revenues were $300 million lower in 1996 than the record royalties 
received in 1995.  The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in royalty 
rates in exchange for longer-term agreements, expired licenses that have not 
yet been renewed, and licensees' lower DRAM revenues.  Also, first-quarter 
1995 royalty revenues included a favorable adjustment of $36 million related 
to higher-than-estimated licensee shipments in the second half of 1994.

    Payments that licensees will make over the next five years under the 
recently negotiated ten-year agreements with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., 
Fujitsu Limited, Oki Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. are 
expected to exceed payments made under the expired five-year licenses.  
Negotiations continue with NEC Corporation and several smaller firms, 
including firms not previously licensed.  TI continues to expect a significant 
ongoing stream of royalty revenue into the next century.

    The Tokyo High Court has not yet decided TI's appeal of a ruling that 
Fujitsu's production of certain memory products does not infringe TI's Kilby 
patent.  The decision should not have any significant effect on existing 
licenses.

    For 1997, the estimated effective tax rate for continuing operations is 
about 35 percent.

    TI's backlog of unfilled orders for continuing operations as of 
December 31, 1996, was $1623 million, down $671 million from the end of 1995, 
due primarily to decreases in semiconductors and the CMS sale.

    R&D for continuing operations was $1181 million for 1996, compared with 
$842 million for 1995.  The 1996 R&D includes the $192 million charge 
associated with the SSi acquisition.

    Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $2063 million in 1996, 
compared with $1351 million in 1995.

    Depreciation for continuing operations for 1996 was $904 million, compared 
with $681 million in 1995.  Depreciation in 1997 is expected to be about $1.2 
billion.

Components Segment:  For 1996, orders in the components segment were down 27 
percent, and revenues were down 15 percent from 1995, primarily because of the 
precipitous drop in DRAM prices and lower royalties.  TI's semiconductor 
orders for the fourth quarter were up solidly from the third quarter of 1996.  
Fourth quarter orders for DSPS, comprised of digital signal processors plus 
mixed-signal/analog products, grew more than 30 percent over the fourth 
quarter of 1995, with particular strength in wireless communications and mass 
storage applications.  TI's semiconductor revenues for the fourth quarter of 
1996 were up sequentially from the prior quarter.  DSPS revenues in 1996 
increased strongly from 1995 and exceeded 40 percent of the company's total 
semiconductor revenues during the fourth quarter.


    Components segment profits for 1996 were down from 1995 because of sharply 
lower DRAM prices and lower royalties.  Results for the components segment 
include a charge of $192 million in the third quarter of 1996 related to the 
SSi acquisition and a charge of $61 million in the fourth quarter of 1996 for 
cost reduction actions.  Excluding charges, semiconductor operating profit in 
the fourth quarter of 1996 was up significantly from the third quarter as all 
product groups showed improvement.  Memory, while improved,

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(continued)

operated at a loss in the fourth quarter due to continued lower prices and the 
high level of fixed investment.

    TI's plans for 1997 are based on a moderate recovery in the world 
semiconductor market, with sustainable growth in electronic end equipment.  
Customer inventories of semiconductors are at historically low levels.  DRAM 
prices remain volatile and the near-term memory market environment is expected 
to be difficult, although the bit growth rate remains strong.

Digital Products Segment:  Orders in TI's digital products segment were down 
13 percent in 1996, and revenues were down seven percent, compared with 1995.  
Excluding the CMS and printer businesses, which were sold during the year, 
revenues were up 37 percent.  The segment operated at a loss during the year, 
due to the high level of marketing expense and intense price competition in 
mobile computing, as well as continued investments and new product development 
in the software business and in communications and electronics systems.  
Fourth quarter operations include the impact of sharply lower mobile computing 
revenues, compared with the third quarter of 1996, which negatively impacted 
fourth quarter earnings per share by about $0.08 per share from the running 
rate of the prior quarter.  Results for the digital products segment include a 
charge of $125 million in the fourth quarter for cost reduction actions and 
asset write-downs.  As expected, calculators operated at break-even in the 
fourth quarter after achieving substantial seasonal profits in the second and 
third quarters.

    In addition to the charge for asset write-downs taken in the fourth 
quarter, TI expects to take a charge in the first quarter of 1997 for 
severance and other costs associated with the sale of the mobile computing 
business.  As a result of the sale agreement, TI will not reflect operating 
results of the mobile computing business subsequent to 1996.

Emerging Opportunities:  TI's digital imaging products continue to make steady 
progress in the transition from R&D to initial production, targeted at the 
very competitive commercial projection display market.  The major long-term 
challenge continues to be cost reduction to levels that will permit 
participation in several markets.  The company remains positive about the 
opportunity to build a high-growth business and expects to continue 
significant investments in 1997.

Discontinued Operations:  For discontinued operations, a special pretax charge 
of $32 million was taken for voluntary and involuntary severance actions 
during the fourth quarter of 1996.

Financial Condition:  TI's financial condition remains sound.  During the 
year, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments decreased by $575 
million to $978 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities was 
negatively impacted by the payout of 1995 profit sharing in the first quarter.  
Investments in property, plant and equipment were $2063 million for the year, 
and the sale of TI's CMS business generated $132 million of cash in the first 
half of 1996.

    In the third quarter, TI acquired Silicon Systems, Inc. via a stock 
purchase agreement for $340 million in cash plus the assumption of a $235 
million long-term note to TDK Corp. of Japan.  The cash payment, initially 
financed by a draw down on TI's existing line of bank credit, was permanently 
financed through the company's issuance on July 26 of $400 million of three- 
and four-year notes.

    On January 6, 1997, TI and Raytheon Company announced that their boards of 
directors had approved a definitive agreement for Raytheon to purchase the 
assets of TI's defense operations for $2.95 billion in cash.  The transaction 
is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust review and is expected to close in 
the second quarter of 1997.  TI plans to use the net proceeds from the sale to 
strengthen its focus on digital solutions for the networked society.

    The outstanding balance of commercial paper was $299 million at the end of 
the year, up from zero at the end of 1995.  Other financing activities 
included the first quarter issuance of $300 million of 6.125% notes due in 
2006, the balance increase of Italian lira mortgage notes of $102 million in 
the second quarter, and the August 28 redemption, at par, of $150 million of 
9.0% notes due in 1999.  At year-end, the debt-to-total-capital ratio was .33, 
up from .17 at the end of 1995.

    Unused authorizations for future capital expenditures were $795 million at 
December 31, 1996.  Capital expenditures are planned to be about $1.1 billion 
in 1997, compared with $2.1 billion in 1996.  Excluding the one-time charge 
associated with the SSi acquisition, R&D will be increased to about $1.1 
billion in 1997, up from $1.0 billion in 1996, primarily to support digital 
signal processing solutions and other advanced semiconductor technology.

    The company maintains lines of credit to support commercial paper 
borrowings and to provide additional liquidity.  These lines of credit totaled 
$696 million at December 31, 1996.  Of this amount, $600 million exists to 
support outstanding and future commercial paper borrowings or short-term bank 
loans.

    The company believes that its financial condition provides the foundation 
for continued support of the programs essential to TI's future.

1995 Results of Operations Compared with 1994

TI's orders for 1995 were $12.1 billion, up 39 percent from $8.7 billion in 
1994.  Significantly higher semiconductor orders in the components segment 
were the primary contributor to the change.

     TI's net revenues for 1995 were $11.4 billion, up 33 percent from $8.6 
billion in 1994.  The increase was due primarily to higher semiconductor 
revenues in the components segment, resulting from increased shipments and new 
products.  Demand was particularly strong for digital signal processors, 
mixed-signal products and memory.  Profit from operations was $1439 million, 
up 55 percent from $926 million in 1994.  Higher semiconductor operating 
profits accounted for much of the increase; higher royalties also contributed.  
Results for 1995 included a profit sharing accrual of $257 million compared 
with $133 million accrued in 1994.  Results for 1994 included $126 million in 
pretax restructuring and divestiture charges taken in the first quarter.

     Net income from continuing operations for 1995 was $996 million, compared 
with $592 million in 1994, an increase of 68 percent.  Earnings per share from 
continuing operations were $5.15, 



34   Texas Instruments Incorporated and Subsidiaries   1996 Annual Report












versus $3.12 for 1994.  Consistent with its goal of increasing shareholder 
value, TI posted a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 24.8 percent, up from 
19.5 percent in 1994 (including the effect of discontinued operations).

     Results for 1995 included significantly higher royalty revenues.

     TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1995, was $2294 
million, up $678 million from the end of 1994, due to an increase in 
semiconductor backlog.

    TI R&D was $842 million for 1995 compared with $578 million in 1994.  
Capital expenditures were $1351 million in 1995, compared with $1020 million 
in 1994.

     Depreciation for 1995 was $681 million, compared with $580 million in 
1994.

Components Segment:  Orders in the components segment were up 45 percent for 
1995, and revenues up 39 percent from 1994, with particular strength in 
semiconductors, which grew faster than the segment.  Components segment 
profits were up 66 percent, primarily due to improved semiconductor 
manufacturing productivity and higher royalties.

    Semiconductor revenues reached record levels in 1995, primarily due to 
growth in memory and application specific products.  Profits, up substantially 
in 1995 over 1994, also reached record levels.  Semiconductor operating 
margins improved in 1995, primarily due to increased manufacturing 
productivity.

Digital Products Segment:  Orders in TI's digital products segment were up 14 
percent in 1995, and revenues up 11 percent, compared with 1994.  The segment 
operated at a loss during 1995, due to increased marketing expenses and 
intense price competition in notebook computers, as well as continued 
investments and new product development in communications and electronic 
systems, and in the software business.

    TI significantly increased marketing investments in the notebook computer 
business to increase brand awareness and aggressively communicate a strategic 
shift that emphasized mobility and connectivity in the networked society.  
These investments, coupled with intense price competition, caused the business 
to operate at a loss for 1995.  TI software also operated at a loss for 1995.
