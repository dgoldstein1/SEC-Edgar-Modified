              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1.     These interim condensed  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited
       but  reflect,  in  the  opinion   of  management,  all  normal  recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  (the "Company") as  of September 30,
       1999,  the results of  operations  for the three and nine  month  periods
       ended  September 30, 1999 and 1998 and cash  flows  for  the  nine  month
       periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998.  Because  all the  disclosures
       required by  generally accepted  accounting  principles are not included,
       these  interim  condensed   consolidated  financial  statements should be
       read  in  conjunction  with the audited  financial  statements  and notes
       thereto in the Company's  annual report on Form 10-K/A as of, and for the
       year ended December 31, 1998. The condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet
       data  as  of  December 31, 1998  was  derived  from the audited financial
       statements.

       The  results of  operations  for the three and nine month  periods  ended
       September  30,  1999  and cash  flows  for the nine  month  period  ended
       September  30,  1999  are  not  necessarily   indicative  of  results  of
       operations and cash flows for any future period.

2.     The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31, and
       each fiscal  quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, and
       September  30.  The  third  fiscal  quarter  of 1999  and  1998  ended on
       September 26, 1999 and September 27, 1998, respectively. Fiscal year 1998
       was 52 weeks long and ended on December 27, 1998.  Fiscal year 1999 is 53
       weeks long and ends on January 2,  2000.  For ease of  presentation,  the
       accompanying  financial  statements have been shown as ending on the last
       day of the calendar month.

3.     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4.     The components of inventory consist of the following:

                        September 30,     December 31,
                                 1999             1998

       For the three and nine month periods ending  September 30, 1999,  options
       to purchase 25,926 and 54,857 shares of common stock,  respectively  have
       been excluded from the earnings per share calculation, as their effect is
       antidilutive.  For the three and nine month periods  ended  September 30,
       1998,  options to purchase  1,484,466 and 767,049 shares of common stock,
       respectively, have been excluded from the earnings per share calculation,
       as their effect is antidilutive.

6.     To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be  necessary  to  initiate  litigation  with one or more third  parties,
       including  but not limited to those the Company has  notified of possible
       patent  infringement.  In  addition,  one or more of  these  parties,  or
       others, may bring suit against the Company.

       In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal  court  against
       Lexar Media,  Inc.  ("Lexar") for  infringement  of a  fundamental  flash
       memory card  patent.  Lexar has disputed  the  Company's  claim of patent
       infringement,  claimed  SanDisk's patent is invalid or unenforceable  and
       asserted various counterclaims including unfair competition, violation of
       the Lanham Act, patent misuse,  interference  with  prospective  economic
       advantage,  trade defamation and fraud. SanDisk has denied all of Lexar's
       counterclaims.

       In  July 1998, the federal  district court denied Lexar's request to have
       the case  dismissed  on the  grounds  the  Company  failed to  perform an
       adequate prefiling  investigation.  Discovery in the Lexar suit commenced
       in August 1998. On February 22, 1999, the court considered  arguments and
       papers   submitted  by  the  parties   regarding  the  scope  and  proper
       interpretation of the asserted claims in SanDisk's patent at issue in the
       Lexar suit.  On March 4, 1999,  the  Federal  District  Court  issued its
       ruling on the proper construction of the claim terms in SanDisk's patent.
       On July 30, 1999, the Company filed a motion for partial summary judgment
       that Lexar  CompactFlash and PC Cards  contributorily  infringe SanDisk's
       patent.  A hearing on this  motion has been  deferred  by the court until
       January  2000.  In August 1999 the  Company  had a  mandatory  settlement
       meeting with Lexar.  No settlement  was reached  through this meeting.  A
       trial  date has not yet been  set.  The  Company  intends  to  vigorously
       enforce its  patents,  but there can be no assurance  that these  efforts
       will be successful.


                                     Page 7
<PAGE>

       In May 1999, Lexar filed a complaint against the Company in federal court
       for claims of unfair  competition,  false  advertising,  trade  libel and
       intentional  and  negligent   interference   with  prospective   business
       advantage.  In Lexar's  complaint,  Lexar alleged that  statements by the
       Company  regarding the  comparative  performance of SanDisk's and Lexar's
       CompactFlash  products in digital cameras were false, and further alleged
       that  SanDisk had  interfered  with the  certification  of certain  Lexar
       products by the  CompactFlash  Association.  On July 1, 1999, the Company
       filed a motion to dismiss the Lexar complaint.  Also, in July 1999, Lexar
       filed a  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  seeking  to  stop  certain
       advertising  practices that Lexar alleges were misleading.  On August 26,
       1999, the parties  executed and filed with the court a joint  stipulation
       withdrawing the Company's motion to dismiss and granting Lexar permission
       to amend its  complaint.  Lexar has amended its  complaint  to remove any
       allegations  and  causes  of  action  based  on  the  Company's   alleged
       interference  in  certification  by  the  CompactFlash  Association.   On
       September 17, 1999,  the court  conducted a hearing on Lexar's motion for
       preliminary injunction.  On September 24, 1999, the court issued an order
       granting a limited preliminary  injunction which enjoins the Company from
       using or  implying  certain  terminology  in  advertising  regarding  the
       comparative  performance of its memory  products in digital  cameras.  On
       October 1, 1999, the Company filed counterclaims  against Lexar asserting
       causes of action including unfair competition and false advertising under
       both federal and California law.  Although the Company cannot predict the
       ultimate outcome of the case, it believes that Lexar's claims are without
       merit and that it has meritorious counterclaims against Lexar.

       From  time to  time  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  certain  of its
       suppliers  and customers for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances  include  indemnification
       for damages and expenses, including attorneys' fees. The Company may from
       time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of such indemnification
       obligations. Third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from
       coverage  under  the  Company's  insurance  policies.  There  can  be  no
       assurance that any future obligation to indemnify the Company's customers
       or suppliers,  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
       business, financial condition and results of operations.

       Any  litigation,  whether as a plaintiff or as a  defendant,  will likely
       result in  significant  expense to the  Company and divert the efforts of
       the Company's  technical and  management  personnel,  whether or not such
       litigation is ultimately determined in favor of the Company. In the event
       of an  adverse  result  in any  such  litigation,  the  Company  could be
       required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture,  use and sale
       of  infringing   products,   expend  significant   resources  to  develop
       non-infringing   technology   or  obtain   licenses  to  the   infringing
       technology,  or discontinue  the use of certain  processes.  Accordingly,
       there  can be no  assurance  that any of the  foregoing  matters,  or any
       future  litigation,  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
       Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

       Compaq Corporation has opposed in several countries, including the United
       States, the Company's  attempts to register  CompactFlash as a trademark.
       The Company does not believe that its failure to obtain  registration for
       the CompactFlash mark will materially harm our business.

7.     Certain of the Company's balance sheet accounts and purchase  commitments
       are denominated in Japanese Yen. The Company enters into foreign exchange
       contracts to hedge against  changes in foreign  currency  exchange rates.
       The effects of movements in currency  exchange rates on these instruments
       are  recognized  when the related  operating  revenues  and  expenses are
       recognized. The impact of movements in currency exchange rates on foreign
       exchange  contracts  substantially  mitigates  the related  impact on the
       underlying items hedged. At September 30, 1999,  forward contracts with a
       notional amount of $3.1 million were outstanding. In the third quarter of
       1999,  the Company had a net foreign  currency  transaction  gain of $1.3
       million,  primarily  due to  transaction  gains on its Japanese yen based
       assets.

9.   In October  1999,  the Company  entered  into a  nonbinding  memorandum  of
     understanding   with  Toshiba  providing  for  the  joint  development  and
     manufacturing  of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit  flash  memory chips and Secure
     Digital Memory Card controllers. Further, the Company and Toshiba intend to
     form  and fund a joint  venture  to  equip  and  operate  a  silicon  wafer
     manufacturing  line in Virginia.  The cost of equipping the Virginia  wafer
     manufacturing  line is estimated at between $700 million and $800  million.
     The Company,  as part of its 50% ownership of the joint venture,  expect to
     invest up to $150 million in cash, and, if necessary,  guarantee  equipment
     lease lines for an additional $250 million. The Company does not expect any
     material revenues from the 512 megabit technology for at least one year and
     from  the 1  gigabit  technology  for at  least  two  years.  A  definitive
     agreement based upon this memorandum of  understanding  is being negotiated
     and is expected to be concluded by January 2000,  subject to final approval
     by the Company's board of directors and that of Toshiba.

10.  In  August  1999 the  Company  filed a Form S-3  with  the  Securities  and
     Exchange  Commission for the registration of 3,000,000 shares of its common
     stock. The Company plans to close this transaction in the fourth quarter of
     1999.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    Certain  statements  in this  discussion  and analysis  are forward  looking
statements  based  on  current  expectations,   and  entail  various  risks  and
uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from those
expressed in such forward looking  statements.  Such risks and uncertainties are
discussed  below and in our Form  10-K/A for the year ended  December  31,  1998
under  the  heading  "Factors  That May  Affect  Future  Results."  Readers  are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which
speak only as of the date hereof.  We undertake  no  obligation  to update these
forward looking  statements to reflect events or  circumstances  occurring after
the date hereof. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

OVERVIEW

    We were founded in 1988 to develop and market flash data storage systems. We
sell our  products to the  consumer  electronics  and  industrial/communications
markets.  During the course of 1998,  the  percentage  of our  product  revenues
attributable  to  the  consumer   electronics  market,   particularly  sales  of
CompactFlash for use in digital camera applications, increased substantially. In
the first nine months of 1999,  consumer  electronics  continued  to represent a
significant  portion of our  product  revenues.  This  increase  in sales to the
consumer market resulted in a shift to lower capacity products,  which typically
have  lower  average  selling  prices and gross  margins  than  higher  capacity
products.  In  addition,  these  products  are  frequently  sold into the retail
channel,  which usually has shorter  customer  order  lead-times  than the other
channels we use,  thereby  decreasing our ability to accurately  forecast future
production needs. We believe sales of our CompactFlash products will continue to
represent a majority of our sales as the  popularity  of consumer  applications,
including  digital  cameras,  increases.  Historically,  the percentage of sales
attributable  to orders  received  and  fulfilled  in the same  quarter has been
significant.  In response,  we are  continuing to work to shorten  manufacturing
cycle times.

     Our  operating  results are affected by a number of factors  including  the
volume of product sales, the timing of significant  orders,  competitive pricing
pressures,  our  ability to match  supply  with  demand,  changes in product and
customer mix,  market  acceptance  of new or enhanced  versions of our products,
changes in the channels  through which our products are  distributed,  timing of
new product  announcements  and  introductions  by us and our  competitors,  the
timing  of  license  and  royalty  revenues,   fluctuations  in  product  costs,
availability  of foundry  capacity,  variations  in  manufacturing  cycle times,
fluctuations in manufacturing  yields and manufacturing  utilization,  increased
research and development expenses, and exchange rate fluctuations.  In addition,
as  the  proportion  of our  products  sold  for  use  in  consumer  electronics
applications increases,  our revenues may become subject to seasonal declines in
the first quarter of each year.  See "Factors That May Affect Our Future Results
- - Our operating results may fluctuate  significantly  which may adversely affect
our stock price."

     Beginning  in late  1995,  we  adopted a strategy  of  licensing  our flash
technology,   including   our  patent   portfolio,   to  selected   third  party
manufacturers  of  flash  products.   To  date,  we  have  entered  into  patent
cross-license  agreements  with  several  companies,  and we  intend  to  pursue
opportunities to enter into additional licenses.  Our current license agreements
provide for the payment of license fees, royalties, or a combination thereof, to
us. The timing and amount of these payments can vary  substantially from quarter
to quarter,  depending on the terms of each  agreement  and, in some cases,  the
timing of sales of  products  by the other  parties.  As a result,  license  and
royalty  revenues have  fluctuated  significantly  in the past and are likely to
continue to fluctuate in the future.  Given the  relatively  high gross  margins
associated with license and royalty  revenues,  gross margins and net income are
likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty  revenues than with
changes in product revenues.

     We market our  products  using a direct sales  organization,  distributors,
manufacturers'  representatives,  private label partners, OEMs and retailers. We
expect that sales and  distribution  through the retail channel will comprise an
increasing share of total revenues in the future, and that a substantial portion
of


                                    Page 10
<PAGE>

our sales through the retail channel will be made to participants that will have
the right to return unsold  products.  We do not  recognize  revenues from these
sales until the products are sold to the end customers.

     Historically,  a  majority  of our sales  have been to a limited  number of
customers. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers
will continue to account for a substantial  portion of our product  revenues for
the foreseeable  future.  We have also  experienced  significant  changes in the
composition  of our  customer  base from year to year and expect this pattern to
continue as market demand for such customers' products fluctuates.  The loss of,
or significant reduction in purchases by major customers,  could have a material
adverse effect on our business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
See  "Factors  That May Affect Our Future  Results - Sales to a small  number of
customers represent a significant portion of our revenues."

     Due to the  emerging  nature of our  target  markets  and  certain  planned
product transitions,  we have had difficulty forecasting future inventory levels
required to meet customer demand.  As a result of both  contractual  obligations
and  manufacturing  cycle times,  we have been required to order wafers from our
wafer  suppliers  several  months in advance  of the  ultimate  shipment  of our
products.  Under our wafer supply agreements,  there are limits on the number of
wafers we can order and our  ability  to change  that  quantity  is  restricted.
Accordingly,  our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our
products is limited.  As a result,  we have not been able to match our purchases
of wafers to specific  customer  orders and  therefore we have from time to time
taken write-downs for potential excess inventory  purchased prior to the receipt
of customer  orders.  For example,  in the second  quarter of 1998,  our product
gross  margins  were  negatively  impacted  by an  inventory  write-down.  These
adjustments  decrease  gross margins in the quarter  reported and have resulted,
and could in the future result, in fluctuations in gross margins on a quarter to
quarter  basis.  See "Factors  That May Affect  Future  Results - Our  operating
results may adversely affect our stock price."

     Export sales are an important part of our business. While a majority of our
revenues  from sales to Japan and other Asian  countries  are  derived  from OEM
customers who plan to export a portion of their products to countries outside of
Asia, the Asian economic crisis may continue to adversely affect our revenues to
the extent  that  demand for our  products  in Asia  declines.  Given the recent
economic  conditions in Asia and the weakness of many Asian currencies  relative
to the United States  dollar,  our products may be relatively  more expensive in
Asia, which could result in a decrease in our sales in that region.  We may also
experience  pressure  on our  gross  margins  as a  result  of  increased  price
competition from Asian  competitors.  While most of our sales are denominated in
U.S.  dollars,  we invoice  certain  Japanese  customers in Japanese yen and are
subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these  transactions.  See "Factors That
May Affect Our Future Results - Our international  operations make us vulnerable
to changing conditions and currency fluctuations."

     For the foreseeable  future, we expect to realize a significant  portion of
our revenues from recently  introduced and new products.  Typically new products
initially  have lower  gross  margins  than more  mature  products  because  the
manufacturing  yields are  typically  lower at the start of  manufacturing  each
successive product generation.  In addition,  manufacturing yields are generally
lower at the start of  manufacturing  any  product at a new  foundry.  To remain
competitive,  we are focusing on a number of programs to lower our manufacturing
costs,  including  development of future  generations of Double  Density,  or D2
flash, and advanced  technology  wafers. We cannot assure you that such products
or processes will be  successfully  developed by us or that  development of such
processes will lower manufacturing costs. In addition,  we anticipate that price
competition will increase in the future, which could result in decreased average
selling  prices and lower gross  margins.  See "Factors  That May Affect  Future
Results - In  transitioning to new processes and products we face production and
market acceptance risks."

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE


                                    Page 11
<PAGE>

     We are aware of problems  associated with computer systems as the Year 2000
approaches.  Year 2000  problems are the result of common  computer  programming
techniques   that  result  in  systems  that  do  not  function   properly  when
manipulating  dates  later than  December  31,  1999.  The issue is complex  and
wide-ranging.   The  problem   may  affect   transaction   processing   computer
applications we use for accounting,  distribution,  manufacturing,  planning and
communications.  The problem may also affect  embedded  systems such as building
security systems,  machine  controllers and production testing  equipment.  Year
2000 problems with these systems may affect the ability or efficiency with which
we can perform many  significant  functions,  including but not limited to order
processing  and  fulfillment,   material  planning,  product  assembly,  product
testing,  invoicing and financial reporting.  While there can be no guarantee of
unaffected  operation,  the  completed  implementation  of  our  new  management
information  system,  and  the  completed  assessment  of our  embedded  systems
indicates limited exposure in these areas. The Year 2000 problem may also affect
the computer  systems of our suppliers  and  customers,  potentially  disrupting
their  operations.  Year 2000 problems with our business partners may impact our
sources of supply and demand.

      YEAR 2000 READINESS. We have a Year 2000 risk management program to assess
the  impact  of the  Year  2000  issue  on us,  and  to  coordinate  remediation
activities. We completed the evaluation of our products for Year 2000 compliance
in the  third  quarter  of  1998.  Our  FlashDisk,  FlashDrive,  Flash  ChipSet,
CompactFlash,  MultiMediaCard  and  ImageMate  product lines do not perform date
related processing and do not contain real time clock circuitry and,  therefore,
are  Year  2000  ready.  Our  storage  and  connectivity  products  are  used as
components in a variety of host  systems.  The  firmware,  operating  system and
application  software of these host  systems are designed  and  manufactured  by
others.  We make no claim with regard to the Year 2000 readiness of host systems
designed by others in which our products are used.  Independent system designers
make  derivative  works from our Host  Developer's  Toolkit source code product.
Sample date related  subroutines and data structures are included in the Toolkit
for use by system  designers.  Designers  modify the sample routines in order to
fit the specific  requirements of their host operating  system.  The designer is
responsible  for the formatting and processing  logic  associated  with the date
values that pass through the Toolkit  subsystem and for the Year 2000  readiness
of the  systems in which the  Toolkit is used.  We make no claims with regard to
the Year 2000  readiness of host  firmware  and  operating  systems  designed by
others that contain derivative works of the Toolkit.

      The Year  2000  remediation  of our  transaction  processing  systems  was
completed with the  installation  and testing of our new management  information
system  in the  fourth  quarter  of  1998.  The  new  system  is a  commercially
available, fully integrated materials requirement planning and accounting system
software  application.  This system is used for  accounting,  order  processing,
planning, inventory control, shop floor control and distribution.

     In the second quarter of 1999, we completed all of the primary  elements of
our Year 2000 assessment and remediation  program for our principal hardware and
software.  Tests of software  applications,  which have been identified by their
vendors  as Year 2000  compliant,  and  several  minor  software  upgrades  were
successfully  completed  in the  third  quarter  of 1999.  Well  over 90% of our
investment  in  desktop  personal  computer  hardware  is known to be Year  2000
compliant,  and  proven  remediation  solutions  are being  implemented  for the
remaining  10%. The majority of the software  used on these  systems and network
servers  are  recent  versions  of  vendor  supported,   commercially  available
products.  Upgrading  these  applications  as Year 2000  compliant  patches  are
released by the respective  vendors has not been a significant  burden on us and
is expected to be completed before the end of 1999.

       Our assessment and remediation of Year 2000 problems in computer  systems
used for  facilities  control,  machine  control  and  manufacturing  testing is
complete. The most significant Year 2000 issue in this area has been found to be
related to older wafer testing  equipment.  This equipment is not expected to be
used in the year 2000. We are phasing in new Year 2000  compliant  wafer testing
equipment in  conjunction  with the  introduction  of new  generations  of flash
memory.


                                    Page 12
<PAGE>

       Our  assessment  of  Year  2000  risks  related  to  material  suppliers,
customers and other third parties is substantially complete. Inquiries were made
of all critical suppliers and an assessment of their Year 2000 readiness was the
basis for strategic  decisions  regarding  alternate  material  sourcing  and/or
increasing  inventory  safety  stocks.  The survey of our service  suppliers  is
ongoing,  as many of these suppliers have fourth quarter 1999 target  compliance
dates for their  Year 2000  programs.  We are also  contacting  our  significant
customers  regarding  their  Year  2000  readiness  in order to  understand  the
potential for any  disruptions in their ordering  patterns.  Completion of these
reviews will depend on the  responsiveness  of our vendors and  customers,  over
which we have no control.

       YEAR  2000  RISK  MANAGEMENT  PROGRAM  COSTS.  The cost of the Year  2000
project  related  to  upgrading  our  core  management  information  system  was
approximately  $1.0  million,  $400,000 of which was related to the  purchase of
software and hardware which we capitalized. In the first nine months of 1999, we
spent  approximately  $175,000 for  application  software  upgrades and computer
hardware.  We estimate that costs to upgrade or replace any  remaining  software
applications  and  non-compliant  computer  hardware will not be material to our
operating results.  We would have incurred the majority of these costs, in spite
of Year 2000  issues,  due to the need to  upgrade  our  management  information
system,  application  software and personal computers to support our growth. Our
Year 2000  remediation  projects  were funded  from  operating  cash  flows.  No
material  projects were  deferred in order to complete our Year 2000  assessment
and remediation  project.  The additional  expenses related to the management of
the Year 2000 compliance program and completing the remaining  assessment of our
internal  and external  risks are not  expected to be material to our  quarterly
operating results.

       The costs and time schedule for the Year 2000 problem abatement are based
on  management's  best  estimates  for the  remediation  of Year  2000  problems
uncovered to date. These estimates were derived utilizing numerous  assumptions,
including  that  the  most   significant  Year  2000  risks  have  already  been
identified,  that certain  resources  will continue to be available,  that third
party plans will be fulfilled and other factors.  However,  we cannot  guarantee
that these estimates will be achieved or that the anticipated time schedule will
be met and actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated.

     CONTINGENCY  PLANS.  Specific  contingency  plans  for  systems  that  pose
significant risk to ongoing operations are being developed under the auspices of
our Year 2000 risk management  program.  Should previously  undetected Year 2000
problems be found in other  systems,  these  systems  will  either be  upgraded,
replaced,  turned off or operated in place with manual  procedures to compensate
for their  deficiencies.  While we believe that these alternative plans would be
adequate to meet our needs  without  materially  impacting  our  operations,  we
cannot  assure  you that  these  alternatives  would be  successful  or that our
results  of  operations  would not be harmed by the  delays  and  inefficiencies
inherent in conducting operations in this manner.

     RISKS RELATED TO YEAR 2000  READINESS.  Success of our Year 2000 compliance
effort  depends,  in part,  on the success of our key suppliers and customers in
dealing  with  their  Year  2000  issues.  We do not have any  control  over the
remediation  efforts  of our  key  suppliers  and  customers  and  cannot  fully
determine  the extent to which  they have  resolved  their Year 2000  compliance
issues.  We currently  purchase several critical  components from single or sole
source vendors. While this issue is being carefully managed,  disruptions in the
supply of  components  from any of these sole source  suppliers due to Year 2000
issues,  could cause delays in our  fulfillment  of customer  orders which could
result in reduced or lost  revenues.  Furthermore,  our sales have  historically
been to a limited number of customers. Any disruption in the purchasing patterns
of these customers or potential  customers due to Year 2000 issues could cause a
decline in our revenues.  We cannot assure you that we and our key suppliers and
customers  will identify and remediate all  significant  Year 2000 problems on a
timely basis.  Furthermore,  we cannot assure you that our insurance  will cover
losses from business  interruptions  arising from Year 2000 problems or those of
our suppliers.  If our key suppliers and customers have Year 2000 problems,  our
business could be harmed.

    The foregoing  statements  regarding our Year 2000  readiness are based upon
management's  best estimates at the present time,  which were derived  utilizing
assumptions  regarding  future events,  including the continued  availability of
certain resources,  third party modification plans and other factors.  We cannot
guarantee that these  estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ
materially  from those  anticipated.  Specific  factors  that  might  cause such
material differences include, but are not limited to:

       the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area;

       the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes;

       the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each
       of the affected programs;

       the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs; and

       the  success of  our external  customers and suppliers in addressing the
       Year 2000 issue.

    Our  evaluation is ongoing and we expect that new and different  information
will become available to us as the evaluation continues. Consequently, we cannot
guarantee that all material elements will be Year 2000 ready in time.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    PRODUCT  REVENUES.  Our  product  revenues  were $57.6  million in the third
quarter  of 1999,  up $33.5  million  or 139%  from the third  quarter  of 1998.
Product  revenues  for the nine  months  ended  September  30,  1999 were $135.9
million,  up $62.8 million or 86% from the same period in 1998. During the three
and nine month periods ended  September 30, 1999,  units shipped  increased 136%
and 147%,  respectively  over the same periods in 1998. The largest  increase in
both periods came from sales of  CompactFlash  which  represented 63% and 60% of
product  revenues,  respectively,  for the three and nine  month  periods  ended
September 30, 1999.  Average  selling prices declined 2% in the third quarter of
1999  compared  to the same  period of 1998.  A shift in  product  mix to higher
capacity  cards  partially  offset a decline in the  average  selling  price per
megabyte of capacity  shipped.  The average  megabyte  capacity per unit shipped
increased  78% while the average  selling  price per  megabyte  of flash  memory
shipped declined 48% in the third quarter of 1999 compared to the same period of
the previous  year.  The mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and
will  continue to vary in the future,  affecting  our  overall  average  selling
prices and gross margins. Average selling prices declined 27% for the first nine
months of 1999 compared to the first nine months of 1998.

    In September 1999,  both USIC and USC, the foundries that currently  produce
all of our flash memory  wafers,  were damaged and  temporarily  shut down by an
earthquake in Taiwan.  As a result, 8 to 10% of our silicon wafers in production
at the time of the  earthquake  had to be  discarded  and no new wafers could be
manufactured  for 11 days,  resulting in the loss or destruction of a portion of
our fourth  quarter  wafer  supply.  We expect that our existing  silicon  wafer
inventory,  combined with our planned output from USIC and USC, will allow us to
ship more  megabytes in the fourth  quarter of 1999 than in the third quarter of
1999. However,  due to this disruption in wafer supply, we expect fourth quarter
financial  results to be affected by spot  shortages  and  increased  expediting
costs  and that  our  quarter-over-quarter  revenue  growth  rate in the  fourth
quarter  will be lower than in the third  quarter.  This  expectation  is based,
however, on the assumption that resumed production at USIC and USC will continue
at  historical  rates.  Additional  earthquakes,  aftershocks  or other  natural
disasters in Taiwan could preclude us from obtaining  adequate  supply of wafers
to fill customer orders, and could  significantly  harm our business,  financial
condition and results of operations. Due to a number of factors described herein
and in  "Factors  That May Affect  Future  Results,"  our  ability to adjust our
operating  expenses  is  limited  in the short  term.


                                    Page 14
<PAGE>

     As a result, if product revenues are lower than anticipated, our results of
operations will be adversely affected.

    Export sales represented 50% and 46%, respectively,  of our product revenues
for the three and nine month  periods  ended  September 30, 1999 compared to 47%
and 46% for the same periods of the previous year. We expect international sales
to continue to represent a significant portion of our product revenues.  For the
three and nine month  periods ended  September  30, 1999,  our top ten customers
represented  approximately  55% of our product revenues compared to 65% and 62%,
respectively,  for the same periods in 1998.  In the first nine months of fiscal
1999, one customer  accounted for more than 10% of product sales.  Two customers
each  accounted  for more than 10% of product  sales in the first nine months of
1998.  We expect that sales to a limited  number of customers  will  continue to
represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.

    LICENSE AND ROYALTY  REVENUES.  We  currently  earn patent  license fees and
royalties under several cross-license  agreements.  License and royalty revenues
from patent  cross-license  agreements were $9.9 million in the third quarter of
1999,  up from  $7.9  million  in the same  period  of the  previous  year,  due
primarily to an increase in royalty revenues.  In the first nine months of 1999,
revenue  from patent  license and  royalties  was $28.4  million,  up from $24.5
million  in the same  period of the  prior  year.  Revenues  from  licenses  and
royalties  decreased to 15% of total  revenues in the third quarter of 1999 from
25% in the third quarter of 1998. For the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,
patent license and royalty revenues represented 17% of total revenues,  compared
to 25% for the first nine months of 1998.

     GROSS  PROFITS.  In the third  quarter of 1999,  gross  profits  were $23.6
million,  or 35% of total revenues  compared to $13.2  million,  or 41% of total
revenues in the same period of 1998.  Gross profits for the first nine months of
1999 were $63.0  million  compared  to $40.4  million for the same period of the
previous  year.  Gross margin was 38% compared to 41% of total  revenues for the
nine month periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     Product  gross  margin  increased  to 24% of product  revenues in the third
quarter of 1999 from 22% in the third  quarter of 1998  primarily due to a lower
cost per megabyte of our flash memory products in 1999. During the third quarter
of 1999, we accelerated the production  ramp up of our 128Mbit  products to meet
increased demand.  However,  lower than anticipated  yields on our 128Mbit flash
memory  contributed  to a decline  in  product  gross  margins to 24% of product
revenues in the third quarter of 1999 from 27% of product revenues in the second
quarter of 1999. We also experienced  higher than  anticipated  production costs
due to spot shortages of critical  components  during the quarter.  We completed
internal  qualification of our 256Mbit  technology during the third quarter.  We
will  begin  shipping   CompactFlash,   MultiMediaCard  and  FlashDisk  products
utilizing our new 256Mbit flash chip in the fourth  quarter of 1999. The 256Mbit
flash chip has a lower  manufacturing  cost per megabyte and we currently expect
it to contribute to improved  product gross margins in the fourth  quarter.  The
initial  production period of each new generation of flash technology is subject
to many risks and  uncertainties as described in "Factors That May Affect Future
Results - In  transitioning to new processes and products we face production and
market  acceptance  risks."  There  can be no  assurance  that we  will  realize
expected cost reductions in the fourth quarter of 1999.

    RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT.   Research  and  development   expenses  consist
principally of salaries and payroll related  expenses for design and development
engineers,  prototype supplies and contract  services.  Research and development
expenses  were $6.9 million in the third quarter of 1999, up $2.1 million or 44%
from $4.8 million in the same period of 1998.  In the first nine months of 1999,
research and development  expenses increased to $18.2 million up $4.6 million or
33% from $13.6 million in the same period of 1998.  The increases were primarily
due to increased salary and related expenses and higher nonrecurring engineering
and project related expenses.  Research and development expenses represented 10%
of total  revenues  in the third  quarter of 1999  compared  to 15% in the third
quarter of 1998.  For the first nine months of 1999,  research  and  development
expenses  represented 11% of total revenues  compared to 14% for the same period
of the prior  year.  We expect that our  research  and  development  expenses to
continue  to  increase  in  absolute  dollars to  support  the  development  and
introduction  of new


                                    Page 15
<PAGE>

generations of flash data storage products,  including the 512Mbit and 1 Gigabit
flash memory co-development and manufacturing joint venture with Toshiba.

    SALES AND MARKETING.  Sales and marketing  expenses include salaries,  sales
commissions,  benefits and travel  expenses for our sales,  marketing,  customer
service and  applications  engineering  personnel.  These  expenses also include
other  selling  and  marketing  expenses,  such  as  independent  manufacturer's
representative  commissions,  advertising  and  tradeshow  expenses.  Sales  and
marketing  expenses  were  $6.6  million  in the third  quarter  of 1999 up $2.7
million or 68% from $4.0 million in the third quarter of 1998. In the first nine
months of 1999, sales and marketing expenses were $17.6 million, up $5.4 million
or 44%  from the same  period  of 1998.  The  increases  were  primarily  due to
increased  salary  and  related  expenses,  higher  commission  expenses  due to
increased  product revenues and higher marketing  expenses.  Sales and marketing
expenses represented approximately 10% of total revenues in the third quarter of
1999 compared to 12% in the third quarter of 1998.  For the first nine months of
1999, sales and marketing expenses represented 11% of total revenues compared to
12% for the same  period  of the prior  year.  We  expect  sales  and  marketing
expenses to increase as sales of our products grow and as we continue to develop
the retail channel for our products.

    GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative expenses include the
cost  of  our  finance,   information  systems,  human  resources,   shareholder
relations,  legal  and  administrative  functions.  General  and  administrative
expenses  were $3.1 million in the third quarter of 1999, up $1.3 million or 68%
from $1.8  million  in the third  quarter of 1998.  In the first nine  months of
1999, general and administrative  expenses were $8.4 million, up $2.8 million or
50% from the same period in 1998.  The increases were primarily due to increased
salary and related expenses,  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts
and  higher  consulting  expenses.  For the three and nine month  periods  ended
September 30, 1999, general and administrative  expenses represented 5% of total
revenues  compared  to 6% for the same  period in 1998.  We expect  general  and
administrative expenses to increase as our general and administrative  functions
grow to support our overall growth.  General and  administrative  expenses could
also increase substantially in the future if we continue to pursue litigation to
defend our patent portfolio. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results - Risks
Associated with Patents, Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation."

    INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME,  NET.  Interest and other  income,  net, was $2.8
million  in the third  quarter  of 1999  compared  to $1.3  million in the third
quarter of 1998. The increase was due primarily to foreign currency  transaction
gains of $1.3 million on our Japanese yen based assets.

    PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  We recorded a provision for income taxes at a
33% effective tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended  September 30,
1999  compared to a 36%  effective  tax rate for the same  periods of 1998.  The
lower  effective  tax rate in 1999  reflects  greater  benefits from federal and
state tax credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    As of September 30, 1999, we had working  capital of $145.8  million,  which
included  $22.5  million  in cash and cash  equivalents  and  $116.7  million in
short-term  investments.  Operating activities provided $15.7 million of cash in
the first nine  months of 1999  primarily  from net income  and an  increase  in
current  liabilities of $29.7 million,  which were partially offset by increases
in accounts receivable of $23.3 million and inventory of $11.8 million.

    Net cash used in  investing  activities  of $15.6  million in the first nine
months of 1999  consisted of net proceeds of  investments  of $1.7 million which
were offset by capital equipment  purchases and leasehold  improvements of $17.3
million. In the first nine months of 1999, cash provided by financing activities
of $7.0 million came  primarily  from the sale of common stock through our stock
option and employee stock purchase plans.


                                    Page 16

    In October,  1999, we entered into a nonbinding  memorandum of understanding
with  Toshiba  providing  for the joint  development  and  manufacturing  of 512
megabit  and 1  gigabit  flash  memory  chips and  Secure  Digital  Memory  Card
controllers.  Further, we and Toshiba intend to form and fund a joint venture to
equip and operate a silicon wafer  manufacturing  line in Virginia.  The cost of
equipping  the Virginia  wafer  manufacturing  line is estimated at between $700
million and $800 million. We, as part of our 50% ownership of the joint venture,
expect  to invest up to $150  million  in cash,  and,  if  necessary,  guarantee
equipment lease lines for an additional $250 million.

    Depending  on the  future  demand  for our  products,  we may decide to make
additional  investments,  which  could  be  substantial,  in  assembly  and test
manufacturing  equipment  or foundry  capacity  to support  our  business in the
future.

IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

    A portion of our revenues  are  denominated  in Japanese  yen. We enter into
foreign exchange forward  contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. At September 30, 1999,  forward contracts with a notional amount
of $3.1 million were outstanding. Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a
material  adverse  effect on our  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
STOCK PRICE.

       Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  significantly
in the past and we expect that they will  continue to  fluctuate  in the future.
This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors, including the following:

       unpredictable demand for our products;

       decline in the average selling prices of our products due to competitive
       pricing pressures;

       seasonality in sales of our products;

       adverse changes in product and customer mix;

       slower than anticipated market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of
       our products;

       competing flash memory card standards which displace the standards used
       in our products;

       changes in our distribution channels;

       timing of license and royalty revenue;

       fluctuations in product costs, particularly due to fluctuations in
       manufacturing yields and utilization;

       availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity to meet
       customer demand;

       significant yield losses which could affect our ability to fulfill
       customer orders and could increase our costs;

       lengthening in manufacturing cycle times due to our suppliers operating
       at peak capacity;


                                    Page 17

<PAGE>


       increased research and development expenses;

       exchange rate fluctuations, particularly the U.S. dollar to Japanese yen
       exchange rate;

       changes in general economic conditions, in particular the economic
       recession in Japan;

       natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our
       business, particularly Taiwan, Japan and the United States;

       difficulty of forecasting and management of inventory levels; and

       expenses related to obsolescence of unsold inventory.

    DIFFICULTY OF ESTIMATING SILICON WAFER NEEDS

    When we order  silicon  wafers from our  foundries,  we have to estimate the
number of silicon  wafers needed to fill product  orders several months into the
future. If we overestimate  this number, we will build excess  inventories which
could harm our gross margins and operating results.  For example,  in the second
quarter of 1998,  our  product  gross  margins  declined  to 12% from 30% in the
previous  quarter  due in part  to a write  down of  inventory  to  reflect  net
realizable  value.  If we  underestimate  the number of silicon wafers needed to
fill  product  orders,  we may be unable to obtain an adequate  supply of wafers
which could harm our product  revenues.  Because  our  largest  volume  product,
CompactFlash,  is sold into an emerging consumer market, it is very difficult to
accurately forecast future sales. A substantial  majority of our quarterly sales
have  historically  been from orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter.
In addition, our product order backlog may fluctuate  substantially from quarter
to quarter.

    ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN EXPENSE LEVELS

    Due to anticipated growth, we increased our expense levels in the first nine
months of 1999. We expect operating expenses to continue to increase as a result
of the need to hire  additional  personnel to support  expected  growth in sales
unit  volumes,   sales  and  marketing  efforts  and  research  and  development
activities,   including  our  recently  announced   collaboration  with  Toshiba
providing  for the joint  development  of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory
chips. In addition, we have significant fixed costs and we cannot readily reduce
these expenses over the short term. If revenues do not increase  proportionately
to operating expenses, or if revenues decrease or do not meet expectations for a
particular period, our business,  financial  condition and results of operations
will be harmed.

    VARIABILITY OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND GROSS MARGIN

    Our product mix varies quarterly,  which affects our overall average selling
prices and gross margins. Our CompactFlash  products,  which currently represent
the majority of our product  revenues,  have lower  average  selling  prices and
gross margins than our higher  capacity  FlashDisk and FlashDrive  products.  We
believe that sales of CompactFlash  products may become an even more significant
percentage  of our product  revenues as consumer  applications,  such as digital
cameras,  become more popular.  Dependence on CompactFlash sales,  together with
lower  pricing  caused by  increased  competition,  caused  average unit selling
prices to decline 28% during  fiscal  1998,  and 27% in the first nine months of
1999 compared to the same period in 1998. We expect this trend to continue.

    VARIABILITY OF LICENSE FEES AND ROYALTIES

    Our intellectual  property strategy is to cross-license our patents to other
manufacturers of flash products. Under these arrangements,  we earn license fees
and  royalties  on  individually   negotiated   terms.  The  timing  of  revenue
recognition  from these  payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and


                                    Page 18
<PAGE>

on the timing of product shipments by the third parties.  This may cause license
and royalty revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Because
these  revenues have higher gross margins than product  revenues,  gross margins
and net income  fluctuate  significantly  with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues.  See "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations."

IN  TRANSITIONING  TO NEW PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS WE FACE  PRODUCTION  AND MARKET
ACCEPTANCE RISKS.

    GENERAL

       Successive  generations of our products have  incorporated  semiconductor
devices with greater memory capacity per chip. Two important factors that enable
us to decrease the costs per megabyte of our flash data storage products are the
development of higher capacity  semiconductor  devices and the implementation of
smaller  geometry  manufacturing  processes.  A number  of  challenges  exist in
achieving a lower cost per megabyte, including:

       overcoming lower yields often experienced in the early production of new
       semiconductor devices;

       problems with design and manufacturing of products that will incorporate
       these devices; and

       production delays.

    Because our products are complex,  we  periodically  experience  significant
delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products. Similar
delays  could  occur  in the  future  and  could  harm our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

    128 MEGABIT TECHNOLOGY

    We began shipments of 128 megabit products in the second quarter of 1999. In
the third  quarter of 1999, we  accelerated  the  production  ramp up of our 128
megabit flash memory technology to meet increased demand. Lower than anticipated
yields on our 128 megabit flash memory contributed to a decline in gross margins
in the third  quarter of 1999.  If we continue  to  experience  unplanned  yield
problems,  we may be  unable to meet our  customers'  demand  for high  capacity
MultiMediaCard  and  CompactFlash  products which could result in lost sales and
reduced revenues.  In addition,  our gross margins may be harmed by any problems
we encounter in the production of our 128 megabit flash memory.

    D2 FLASH TECHNOLOGY

    We have  developed new products  based on D2 flash  technology,  a new flash
architecture  designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell. High density
flash memory,  such as D2 flash,  is a complex  technology  that requires strict
manufacturing  controls and effective test screens.  Problems encountered in the
shift to volume  production for new flash products could impact both reliability
and  yields,   and  result  in   increased   manufacturing   costs  and  reduced
availability.  We may not be able to manufacture  reliable and cost effective D2
flash  products in  commercial  volumes and with yields  sufficient to result in
lower costs per megabyte.  Furthermore,  D2 flash technology needs significantly
improved write speed so that it can be usefully  applied to market  applications
such as digital  cameras.  It is possible that we may not be able to achieve the
targeted write speed for our 256 megabit product.

    In the fourth  quarter of 1999, we expect to increase  production of our 256
megabit  flash memory  technology,  which has a lower cost per megabyte than the
128 megabit  technology.  If we are unable to bring our 256 megabit flash memory
into full  production as quickly as planned or if we experience  unplanned yield


                                    Page 19
<PAGE>

problems,  we will not be able to meet our customers'  forecasted  demand in the
fourth  quarter of 1999 and beyond,  which would  result in lost sales,  reduced
revenues and reduced margins.

    We expect the majority of products  shipped in the fourth quarter of 1999 to
be built with our 128 megabit and 256 megabit flash memory.  If we are unable to
successfully  achieve the planned yields for these designs, we will be unable to
meet our forecasted  customer needs,  and  consequently our revenues and profits
may fall significantly below our expectations.

    MULTIMEDIACARD PRODUCTS

    We expect to increase the  MultiMediaCard  product family production volumes
in the fourth quarter of 1999. This product  presents new challenges in assembly
and testing.  During the startup  phase,  we have  experienced  fluctuations  in
yields  which  have  reduced  MultiMediaCard  product  availability,   increased
manufacturing  costs and reduced product margins for this product family. We are
currently unable to meet customer demand for  MultiMediaCard  products.  This is
primarily  due to  demand  exceeding  previous  forecasts  from  our  customers.
Although we are steadily  resolving the assembly  manufacturing  issues, we have
not yet  achieved  the  production  assembly  yields  necessary  for high volume
production.  In the third  quarter of 1999,  these  lower-than-planned  assembly
yields constrained MultiMediaCard  availability and adversely impacted our gross
margins.

    SECURE DIGITAL MEMORY CARD PRODUCTS

    We recently  announced a memorandum of understanding,  under which we, along
with Matsushita and Toshiba, will jointly develop and promote the Secure Digital
Memory  Card.  The Secure  Digital  Memory  Card is an  enhanced  version of our
MultiMediaCard that will incorporate  advanced security and copyright protection
features  required by the emerging  markets for the electronic  distribution  of
music, video and other copyrighted works. We expect to begin shipping our Secure
Digital Memory Card products in the second quarter of 2000.  Negotiations  for a
definitive agreement  concerning this collaboration are underway,  but we cannot
assure you that these negotiations will be successful or that we, Matsushita and
Toshiba will enter into a definitive agreement.

The  Secure  Digital  Memory  Card will  incorporate  a number of new  features,
including  SDMI  compliant  security and copy  protection,  a  mechanical  write
protect  switch and a high data  transfer  rate.  We have never  built  products
incorporating these features. Any problems or delays in establishing  production
capabilities or ramping up production  volumes of our Secure Digital Memory Card
products could result in lost sales or increased manufacturing costs in 2000. In
addition,  we cannot be sure that manufacturers of consumer  electronic products
will develop new products that use the Secure Digital  Memory Card.  Conversely,
broad  acceptance  of our Secure  Digital  Memory Card by  consumers  may reduce
demand for our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash card products. See "--The success
of our business depends on emerging markets and new products."

WE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES FOR SILICON WAFERS.

       All of our products  require silicon  wafers.  We rely on USC and USIC in
Taiwan to supply all of our  silicon  wafers.  We depend on these  foundries  to
allocate a portion of their capacity to our needs,  produce  acceptable  quality
wafers with acceptable  manufacturing  yields and deliver our wafers on a timely
basis at a  competitive  price.  If these  foundries are unable to satisfy these
requirements,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  operating  results may
suffer.  For  example,  in  September  1999,  both USIC and USC were damaged and
temporarily  shut down by an earthquake in Taiwan.  As a result, 8 to 10% of our
silicon  wafers in production at the time of the  earthquake had to be discarded
and no new wafers could be  manufactured  for 11 days,  resulting in the loss or
destruction of a portion of our fourth quarter wafer supply.  We expect that our
existing silicon wafer inventory, combined with our planned output from USIC and
USC, will allow us to ship more  megabytes in the fourth quarter of 1999 than in
the third quarter of 1999.  However,  due to this disruption in wafer supply, we


                                    Page 20
<PAGE>

expect fourth  quarter  financial  results to be affected by spot  shortages and
increased  expediting  costs, and that our  quarter-over-quarter  revenue growth
rate in the  fourth  quarter  will be  lower  than in the  third  quarter.  This
expectation is based, however, on the assumption that resumed production at USIC
and USC will continue at historical rates. Additional  earthquakes,  aftershocks
or other  natural  disasters  in Taiwan  could  preclude  us from  obtaining  an
adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders, and could  significantly harm
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Currently, demand for semiconductor wafers has increased significantly,  due
to increased  demand in the consumer  electronics  and cellular  phone  markets.
Increased demand for advanced  technology silicon wafers is increasing the price
of these wafers as supply becomes constrained.  We expect this trend to continue
throughout 1999 and 2000 which could adversely  impact the rate of growth of our
business, either through reduced supply, higher wafer prices or a combination of
the two.

     USC and USIC are  subsidiaries  of UMC. We currently own 10% of USIC,  have
the right to appoint one of its directors and are entitled to 12.5% of its total
wafer  production.  In the second quarter of 1999, UMC announced  plans to merge
the USC and USIC  foundries  into the UMC  parent  company.  When the  merger is
complete,  which is currently  expected to occur in early 2000,  we will receive
UMC shares in exchange for the USIC shares we currently  own.  However,  we will
not have a right to a seat on the board of directors of the combined company. We
have received  assurances  from the senior  management of UMC that it intends to
continue to supply us the same wafer  capacity at the prices we currently  enjoy
under our agreement with USIC.  However,  there can be no assurance that we will
be  able  to  maintain  our  current  wafer  capacity  and  competitive  pricing
arrangement in our future supply negotiations with UMC.

    Under the wafer supply  agreements  with our foundries,  we are obligated to
provide  monthly  rolling   forecasts  for  our  anticipated   wafer  purchases.
Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each forecast are binding
commitments.  The estimates  for the  remaining  months may only be changed by a
certain  percentage from the previous month's forecast.  This limits our ability
to react to  fluctuations in demand for our products.  For example,  if customer
demand falls below our forecast  and we are unable to  reschedule  or cancel our
wafer orders, we may end up with excess wafer inventories, which could result in
higher  operating  expenses and reduced gross margins.  Conversely,  if customer
demand exceeds our forecasts,  we may be unable to obtain an adequate  supply of
wafers to fill  customer  orders,  which  could  result in lost  sales and lower
revenues. In addition, if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers
with  acceptable  price and yields from any  foundry,  our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations could be harmed.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON EMERGING MARKETS AND NEW PRODUCTS.

     In order for demand for our products to grow,  the markets for new products
that use CompactFlash and the MultiMediaCard, such as MP3 portable music players
and smart phones, must develop and grow. If sales of these products do not grow,
our revenues and profit margins could level off or decline.

     Because  we sell  our  products  for use in many  new  applications,  it is
difficult to forecast demand. For example, in the second quarter of 1999, demand
for our 32 megabyte  capacity  MultiMediaCard  for use in MP3  portable  digital
music  players  grew  faster  than  anticipated  and we were  unable to fill all
customer orders during the quarter. Although we are increasing production of the
MultiMediaCard,  if we are unable to fulfill  customer demand for these products
in the future, we may lose sales to our competitors.

      SECURE DIGITAL MEMORY CARD PRODUCTS

    We recently  announced a  collaboration  under which we will jointly develop
our Secure Digital Memory Card, an enhanced version of our MultiMediaCard, which
will incorporate advanced security and copyright protection features required by
the emerging markets for the electronic  distribution of music,  video and other
copyrighted  works.  We expect to begin shipping our Secure Digital Memory Cards
in 32 and 64  megabyte  capacities  in the second  quarter  of 2000.  The Secure
Digital Memory Card is slightly thicker and uses a different  interface than our


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>

MultiMediaCard.  Because of these  differences,  the Secure  Digital Memory Card
will not work in current products that include a  MultiMediaCard  slot. In order
for the market for our Secure Digital Memory Card to develop,  manufacturers  of
digital  audio/video  and  portable  computing  products  must  include a Secure
Digital Memory Card  compatible  slot in their products and acquire a license to
the security  algorithms.  If OEMs do not incorporate Secure Digital Memory Card
slots in their  products  or do not buy our Secure  Digital  Memory  Cards,  our
business,  financial  condition  and  results of  operations  may be harmed.  In
addition,  consumers  may postpone or  altogether  forego  buying  products that
utilize  our  MultiMediaCard  and  CompactFlash  cards  in  anticipation  of new
products that will  incorporate  the Secure Digital Memory Card. If this occurs,
sales of our  MultiMediaCard  and CompactFlash  products may be harmed. The main
competition for the Secure Digital Memory Card is expected to come from the Sony
Memory Stick. Sony has  substantially  greater  resources,  financial and other,
than we do and extensive marketing and sales channels and brand recognition.  We
cannot assure you that our Secure  Digital Memory Card will be successful in the
face of such competition.

     In addition,  the market for MP3 portable digital music players is very new
and it is uncertain how quickly  consumer demand for these players will grow. If
this market does not grow as quickly as  anticipated  or our  customers  are not
successful  in  selling  their MP3  portable  music  players to  consumers,  our
revenues could be adversely affected. In addition, it is often the case with new
consumer  markets  that after an  initial  period of new  market  formation  and
initial acceptance by early adopters,  the market enters a period of slow growth
as standards emerge and infrastructure  develops.  In the event that this occurs
in the MP3 music market or other emerging  markets,  sales of our products would
be harmed.

    The  success of our new  product  strategy  will  depend  upon,  among other
things, the following:

       our ability to successfully develop new products with higher memory
       capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte;

       the development of new applications or markets for our flash data
       storage products;

       the extent to which prospective customers design our products into their
       products and successfully introduce their products; and

       the extent to which our products or technologies become obsolete or
       noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others.

    512 MEGABIT AND 1 GIGABIT SCALE FLASH MEMORY CARD PRODUCTS

In October 1999, we entered into a nonbinding  memorandum of understanding  with
Toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit and 1
gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card  controllers.  As part
of this  collaboration,  we and  Toshiba  plan to employ  Toshiba's  future 0.16
micron and 0.13 micron NAND flash integrated  circuit  manufacturing  technology
and  SanDisk's  multilevel  cell flash and  controller  system  technology.  The
development  of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory chips and Secure  Digital
Memory Card  controllers is expected to be complex and may  incorporate  SanDisk
and Toshiba  technology  that is still under  development.  We cannot assure you
that  we and  Toshiba  will  successfully  develop  these  new  products  or the
underlying technology,  or that any development will be completed in a timely or
cost-effective  manner.  If we are  not  successful  in any  of the  above,  our
business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE.

    We may be unable to increase our production  volumes at a sufficiently rapid
rate so as to maintain our market share. Ultimately,  our growth rate depends on


                                    Page 22
<PAGE>

our ability to obtain  sufficient flash memory wafers to meet demand.  If we are
unable to do so in a timely manner, we may lose market share to our competitors.

OUR  INTERNATIONAL  OPERATIONS  MAKE US  VULNERABLE TO CHANGING  CONDITIONS  AND
CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.

    POLITICAL RISKS

    Currently,  all of our flash memory  wafers are produced by two foundries in
Taiwan.  We also use a third-party  subcontractor in Taiwan for the assembly and
testing of our  MultiMediaCard  products.  We may  therefore  be affected by the
political,  economic  and  military  conditions  in Taiwan.  Taiwan is currently
engaged  in  various  political  disputes  with  China and both  countries  have
recently conducted military exercises in or near the other's  territorial waters
and airspace.  The Taiwanese  and Chinese  governments  may continue to escalate
these  disputes,  resulting in an economic  embargo,  a  disruption  in shipping
routes  or  even  military   hostilities.   This  could  harm  our  business  by
interrupting  or delaying the  production  or shipment of flash memory wafers or
MultiMediaCard products by our Taiwanese foundries and subcontractor. See "-- We
depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors."

    In addition,  in the second  quarter of 1999,  we began using a  third-party
subcontractor  in  China  for  the  assembly  and  testing  of our  CompactFlash
products.  As a result, our business could be harmed by the effect of political,
economic,  legal and other uncertainties in China. Under its current leadership,
the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the
encouragement   of  foreign   trade  and   investment   and   greater   economic
decentralization.  The  Chinese  government  may not  continue  to pursue  these
policies and, even if it does  continue,  these  policies may not be successful.
The Chinese government may also significantly  alter these policies from time to
time. In addition,  China does not  currently  have a  comprehensive  and highly
developed  legal  system,   particularly  with  respect  to  the  protection  of
intellectual  property rights.  As a result,  enforcement of existing and future
laws and contracts is uncertain,  and the  implementation  and interpretation of
such laws may be  inconsistent.  Such  inconsistency  could  lead to piracy  and
degradation of our intellectual property protection.

    ECONOMIC RISKS

    We price our products  primarily in U.S. dollars.  As a result, if the value
of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies,  our products could
become less competitive in international  markets. For example, our products are
relatively  more  expensive  in Asia  because  of the  weakness  of  many  Asian
currencies relative to the US dollar. In addition,  we currently invoice some of
our  customers  in Japanese  yen.  Therefore,  fluctuations  in the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

    Our sales are also highly  dependent  upon global  economic  conditions.  In
fiscal 1998,  sales to Japan declined to 31.6% of total product sales from 38.1%
in 1997. In the first nine months of 1999, sales to Japan  represented  25.2% of
product revenue  compared to 31.7% for the same period of 1998. We believe these
declines  were  primarily  due  to  the  Japanese  economic  crisis  and  market
recession.  If the current market conditions in Japan do not improve, or if they
decline  further,  our  results of  operations  may  suffer.  See  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

    GENERAL RISKS

    Our international  business activities could also be limited or disrupted by
any of the following factors:

       the need to comply with foreign government regulation;

       general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability,
       potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;


                                    Page 23
<PAGE>

       natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our
       business, particularly Taiwan and Japan;

       imposition of regulatory requirements, tariffs, import and export
       restrictions and other barriers and restrictions;

       longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable
       collection;

       potentially adverse tax consequences;

       less protection of our intellectual property rights; and

       delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions.

WE DEPEND ON OUR SUPPLIERS AND THIRD PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS.

    We rely on our vendors, some of which are sole source suppliers, for several
of our critical components. We do not have long-term supply agreements with some
of these vendors. Our business,  financial condition and operating results could
be harmed by delays or  reductions  in  shipments  if we are  unable to  develop
alternative  sources or obtain sufficient  quantities of these  components.  For
example,  we rely  on USIC  and USC  for  all of our  flash  memory  wafers  and
Motorola,  Inc.  and NEC to  supply  certain  designs  of  microcontrollers.  In
September 1999,  both USIC and USC were damaged and temporarily  shut down by an
earthquake in Taiwan.  In addition,  due to industry-wide  increasing demand for
semiconductors, we have recently experienced resistance to price reductions from
some of our important  suppliers.  See "--We depend on third party foundries for
silicon wafers."

    We also rely on third-party  subcontractors  to assemble and test the memory
components  for  our  products.  We  have  no  long-term  contracts  with  these
subcontractors  and cannot directly  control product  delivery  schedules.  This
could lead to  product  shortages  or quality  assurance  problems  which  could
increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our
operating results.

    During the second and third  quarters of 1999, we  transferred a substantial
portion of wafer testing,  packaged memory final testing, card assembly and card
testing to Silicon Precision Industries Co., Ltd. in Taiwan and Celestica,  Inc.
in China.  By the end of the year we expect  that  they will be  assembling  and
testing a majority of our mature,  high-volume products. This increased reliance
on subcontractors is expected to reduce  manufacturing  costs and give us access
to  increased  production  capacity.  During  this  transition  period,  we will
continue   full   operations  at  our  Sunnyvale   production   facility   while
simultaneously  transferring  testing  equipment  and training  personnel of our
subcontractors.  However,  we do  not  have  sufficient  duplicative  production
testing  equipment  at  Sunnyvale  and at  our  subcontractors.  Therefore,  any
significant  problems in this  complex  transfer of  operations  may result in a
disruption  of production  and a shortage of product to meet customer  demand in
the fourth quarter of 1999 and beyond.

CONTINUING  DECLINES IN OUR AVERAGE  SALES  PRICES MAY RESULT IN DECLINES IN OUR
GROSS MARGINS.

     In 1998,  the average  unit  selling  prices of our  products  declined 28%
compared to 1997.  In the first nine months of 1999,  the average  unit  selling
prices of our products declined 27% compared to the same period of 1998. Because
flash data storage markets are  characterized  by intense  competition and price
reductions  for our products are  necessary to meet consumer  price  points,  we
expect that  market-driven  pricing  pressures will  continue.  This will likely
result in a further decline in average sales prices for our products. We believe
that we can offset  declining  average  sales prices by achieving  manufacturing
cost  reductions  and  developing  new products that  incorporate  more advanced
technology,  include more  advanced  features and can be sold at stable  average
gross margins despite continued  declines in average selling price per megabyte.


                                    Page 24
<PAGE>

However,  if we are unable to achieve  such cost  reductions  and  technological
advances,  this could result in lost sales and declining gross margins, and as a
result,  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of  operations  could
suffer.

    The  semiconductor  industry is cyclical and we believe it is currently in a
recovery from one of its most severe down cycles.  During most of 1997 and 1998,
the semiconductor  industry  experienced  significant  production over capacity,
which reduced margins for substantially all flash memory suppliers.

OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

      FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURERS AND MEMORY CARD ASSEMBLERS

    We compete  in an  industry  characterized  by  intense  competition,  rapid
technological  changes,  evolving industry standards,  declining average selling
prices  and rapid  product  obsolescence.  Our  competitors  include  many large
domestic and international  companies that have greater access to advanced wafer
foundry capacity,  substantially  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing and
other resources,  broader product lines and longer standing  relationships  with
customers. Our primary competitors include:

        storage flash chip producers, such as Hitachi Ltd., Samsung Electronics
        Company Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation;

        socket flash, linear flash and component manufacturers, such as Advanced
        Micro Devices,  Inc., Atmel  Corporation,  Intel  Corporation,  Macronix
        International Co., Ltd., Micron Technology,  Inc., Mitsubishi Electronic
        Corporation,  Sharp Electronics  Corporation and  STMicroelectronics NV;
        and

        module or card assemblers,  such as Lexar Media, Inc., M-Systems,  Inc.,
        Pretec  Electronics   Corp.,   Simple  Technology  Inc.,  SMART  Modular
        Technologies,  Inc.,  Sony  Corporation,  Kingston  Technology  Company,
        Panasonic Consumer Electronic Company, Silicon Storage Technology, Inc.,
        TDK Corporation,  Matsushita Battery, Inc. and Viking Components,  Inc.,
        who combine  controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into
        flash storage cards.

In  addition,  over  25  companies  have  been  certified  by  the  CompactFlash
Association to manufacture and sell their own brand of CompactFlash.  We believe
additional manufacturers will enter the CompactFlash market in the future.

    We have announced a memorandum of understanding  under which we,  Matsushita
and Toshiba will jointly develop and promote a next generation flash memory card
called the Secure  Digital  Memory Card.  Under this  agreement,  Secure Digital
Memory Card licenses  will be granted to other flash memory card  manufacturers,
which  will  increase  the  competition  for our  Secure  Digital  Memory  Card,
CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard  products.  In addition,  Matsushita and Toshiba
will sell  Secure  Digital  Memory  Cards that will  compete  directly  with our
products. While other flash card manufacturers will be required to pay the three
companies license fees and royalties, there will be no royalties or license fees
payable  among the three  companies  for their  respective  sales of the  Secure
Digital Memory Card.

    In October  1999, we entered into a nonbinding  memorandum of  understanding
with Toshiba  providing for the joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit
and 1 gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers.  We
and Toshiba  will each  separately  market and sell any products  developed  and
manufactured under this relationship. Accordingly, we will compete directly with
Toshiba for sales of these  advanced chips and  controllers  and no royalties or
license  fees will be payable  between the two  companies  for their  respective
sales.


                                    Page 25
<PAGE>

    We have entered  into patent  cross-license  agreements  with several of our
leading competitors including, Hitachi, Samsung, Toshiba, Intel and Sharp. Under
these agreements,  each party may manufacture and sell products that incorporate
technology covered by the other party's patents related to flash memory devices.
As we continue to license our patents to certain  competitors,  competition will
increase  and  may  harm  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.

    ALTERNATIVE STORAGE MEDIA

    Competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that
are different  from our  CompactFlash  and  MultiMediaCard  products,  including
Toshiba's  SmartMedia,  Sony Corporation's  Memory Stick, Sony's standard floppy
disk used for digital storage in its Mavica digital  cameras,  Panasonic's  Mega
Storage cards, Iomega's Clik drive, a miniaturized,  mechanical,  removable disk
drive  and  M-Systems'  Diskonchip  for  embedded  storage  applications.   Each
competing  standard  is  mechanically  and   electronically   incompatible  with
CompactFlash and  MultiMediaCard.  If a manufacturer of digital cameras or other
consumer  electronic  devices  designs  in one of  these  alternative  competing
standards,  CompactFlash or  MultiMediaCard  will be eliminated from use in that
product.

    In September 1998, IBM introduced the microdrive, a rotating disk drive in a
Type II CompactFlash format.  Initially, this product will compete directly with
our Type II CompactFlash memory cards, which we introduced in the second quarter
of 1999,  for use in high-end  professional  digital  cameras.  In October 1998,
M-Systems  introduced  their  Diskonchip 2000 Millennium  product which competes
against our Flash ChipSet products in embedded storage  applications such as set
top boxes and networking appliances.

    According to  independent  industry  analysts,  Sony's Mavica digital camera
captured a considerable  portion of the United States market for digital cameras
in 1998.  The Mavica  uses a standard  floppy disk to store  digital  images and
therefore uses no  CompactFlash,  or any other flash cards.  Our sales prospects
for  CompactFlash  cards  have been  adversely  impacted  by the  success of the
Mavica.

    Our  MultiMediaCard  products also have faced  significant  competition from
Toshiba's  SmartMedia  flash cards and we expect to face  similarly  significant
competition  from Sony's Memory Stick.  Although the Memory Stick is proprietary
to Sony, if it is adopted and achieves widespread use in future products,  sales
of our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash products may decline.

    ALTERNATIVE FLASH TECHNOLOGIES

    We also face  competition  from  products  based on  multilevel  cell  flash
technology  such as Intel's 64 megabit  and 128  megabit  StrataFlash  chips and
Hitachi's 256 megabit  multilevel cell flash chip.  These products  compete with
our  D2  multilevel   cell  flash   technology.   Multilevel  cell  flash  is  a
technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of
information  instead  of the  traditional  single  bit  stored  by the  industry
standard flash technology.  In the second quarter of 1999, Intel announced their
new 128 megabit multilevel cell chip and Hitachi began shipping customer samples
of  CompactFlash  cards  employing  their new  multilevel  cell flash  chip.  In
addition,  Toshiba has begun customer shipments of 32 megabyte  SmartMedia cards
employing  their  new  256  megabit  flash  chip.   Although   Toshiba  has  not
incorporated  multilevel cell flash  technology in their 256 megabit flash chip,
their  use  of  more  advanced  lithographic  design  rules  has  resulted  in a
comparably-sized  die and may  allow  them to  achieve a more  competitive  cost
structure than that of our 256 megabit D2 flash chip.

    Furthermore,  we expect to face  competition  from existing  competitors and
from other  companies  that may enter our  existing or future  markets that have
similar  or  alternative  data  storage  solutions  which may be less  costly or
provide  additional  features.  Price is an important  competitive factor in the
market for consumer  products.  Increased  price  competition  could lower gross
margins if our average  selling prices  decrease faster than our costs and could
also result in lost sales.


                                    Page 26
<PAGE>

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

    In 1998 and the first nine months of 1999, we received more product  revenue
and  shipped  more  units  of  products   destined   for  consumer   electronics
applications,  principally digital cameras,  than for any other application.  We
believe that these products will encounter intense competition and be more price
sensitive than products sold into our other target markets. In addition, we must
spend more on marketing  and  promotion in consumer  markets to establish  brand
name recognition and preference.

    A significant  portion of sales to the consumer  electronics  market is made
through  distributors and to retailers.  Sales through these channels  typically
include  rights to return  unsold  inventory.  As a result,  we do not recognize
revenue  until  after  the  product  has  been  sold  to the  end  user.  If our
distributors  and  retailers are not  successful in this market,  there could be
substantial product returns, which would harm our business,  financial condition
and results of operations.

SALES TO A SMALL  NUMBER OF  CUSTOMERS  REPRESENT A  SIGNIFICANT  PORTION OF OUR
REVENUES.

    More than half of our revenues  come from a small number of  customers.  For
example, sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 59%, 67%, and
71%,  respectively,  of our product  revenues for 1998,  1997,  and 1996. In the
first nine months of 1999, our top 10 customers represented approximately 55% of
product revenues. In the first nine months of fiscal 1999 one customer accounted
for more than 10% of product  sales.  In fiscal year 1998,  two  customers  each
accounted for 10% or more of our product sales.  If we were to lose any of these
customers or experience any material  reduction in orders from these  customers,
our revenues and operating results would suffer. Our sales are generally made by
standard  purchase  orders rather than  long-term  contracts.  In addition,  the
composition  of our major  customer base changes from year to year as the market
demand for our customers'  products  change.  See  "Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

OUR MULTIPLE SALES CHANNELS MAY COMPETE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SALES.

    Web based sales of our products today  represent a small but growing portion
of our overall  sales.  Sales on the Internet  tend to undercut the  traditional
distribution  channels and may dramatically change the way our consumer products
are  purchased in future years.  We cannot assure you that we will  successfully
manage the inherent channel  conflicts  between our retail channel customers and
customers that wish to purchase directly on the Internet.

THERE IS SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS.

    Sales of our products,  in particular the sale of CompactFlash  products, in
the consumer  electronics  applications market are subject to seasonality.  As a
result,  product sales are impacted by seasonal  purchasing patterns with higher
sales generally  occurring in the second half of each year. In addition,  in the
past we have  experienced  a decrease  in orders in the first  quarter  from our
Japanese OEM customers  primarily  because most  customers in Japan operate on a
fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of
their next fiscal year. For example,  our product revenues were 24% lower in the
first  quarter of 1998 than in the fourth  quarter of 1997,  mostly due to these
seasonal factors and the Asian economic  crisis.  Although we did not experience
this seasonality in the first quarter of 1999, we cannot assure you that we will
not  experience  seasonality  in  the  future.  See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

WE MUST ACHIEVE ACCEPTABLE WAFER MANUFACTURING YIELDS.

    The  fabrication of our products  requires wafers to be produced in a highly
controlled and ultra clean environment.  Semiconductor companies that supply our
wafers  sometimes  have   experienced   problems   achieving   acceptable  wafer
manufacturing yields.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both
our design technology and the foundry's  manufacturing  process technology.  Low


                                    Page 27
<PAGE>

yields may result from design errors or manufacturing  failures.  Yield problems
may not be  determined  or improved  until an actual  product is made and can be
tested.  As a result,  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are
well into the  production  process.  The risks  associated  with yields are even
greater because we rely on independent  offshore  foundries for our wafers which
increases  the effort and time  required to  identify,  communicate  and resolve
manufacturing  yield  problems.  If the  foundries  cannot  achieve  the planned
yields, this will result in higher costs and reduced product  availability,  and
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Under the terms of our nonbinding  memorandum of understanding with Toshiba,
we and Toshiba will jointly form and fund a joint  venture  which will equip and
operate a silicon  wafer  manufacturing  line in  Virginia  to  manufacture  512
megabit  and 1  gigabit  flash  memory  chips and  Secure  Digital  Memory  Card
controllers.  However,  we cannot assure you that this  manufacturing  line will
produce satisfactory quantities of wafers with acceptable prices and yields. Any
failure in this regard could materially harm our business,  financial  condition
and results of operations.  In addition,  the construction and operation of this
line will cause us to incur significant  expense and may result in the diversion
of resources from other important  areas of business.  We cannot assure you that
we or  Toshiba  will  be able to  secure  sufficient  funding  to  support  this
manufacturing  line.  In addition,  we have no  experience  in operating a wafer
manufacturing  line  and we  cannot  assure  you that we will be  successful  in
operating it on a cost-effective basis or at all.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENTS, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

    GENERAL

    We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks,  copyright and trade secret
laws,  confidentiality  procedures  and  licensing  arrangements  to protect our
intellectual  property rights. In the past, we have been involved in significant
disputes  regarding our  intellectual  property rights and claims that we may be
infringing third parties' intellectual property rights. We expect that we may be
involved in similar disputes in the future. We cannot assure you that:

       any of our existing patents will not be invalidated;

       patents will be issued for any of our pending applications;

       any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient
       scope or strength; or

       our patents will be issued in the primary  countries  where our products
       are  sold in  order to  protect  our  rights  and  potential  commercial
       advantage.

In addition,  our  competitors  may be able to design their products  around our
patents.

    We intend to  vigorously  enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that our
efforts  will  be  successful.  If we were to  have  an  adverse  result  in any
litigation,  we  could  be  required  to  pay  substantial  damages,  cease  the
manufacture,  use and sale of infringing products,  expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing  technology,  discontinue the use of certain processes
or obtain  licenses to the  infringing  technology.  Any litigation is likely to
result  in  significant  expense  to us, as well as divert  the  efforts  of our
technical and management  personnel.  For example the Lexar litigation described
below has resulted in cumulative litigation expenses approaching $1 million.

    CROSS-LICENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS

    If we decide to incorporate  third party  technology into our products or if
we are found to infringe on others' intellectual  property, we could be required
to license intellectual property from a third party. We may also need to license


                                    Page 28
<PAGE>

some of our  intellectual  property  to  others  in order to enable us to obtain
cross-licenses to third party patents.  Currently,  we have patent cross-license
agreements with several companies,  including Hitachi, Intel, Samsung, Sharp and
Toshiba  and we are in  discussions  with other  companies  regarding  potential
cross-license  agreements.  We cannot be certain that  licenses  will be offered
when we need them, or that the terms offered will be acceptable. If we do obtain
licenses from third  parties,  we may be required to pay license fees or royalty
payments. In addition, if we are unable to obtain a license that is necessary to
the manufacture of our products, we could be required to suspend the manufacture
of products or stop our wafer  suppliers from using  processes that may infringe
the rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in
redesigning our products or that the necessary  licenses will be available under
reasonable terms.

    We have historically agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for
alleged patent  infringement.  The scope of such indemnity  varies,  but may, in
some  instances,  include  indemnification  for damages and expenses,  including
attorney's fees. We may  periodically  engage in litigation as a result of these
indemnification   obligations.   We  are  not  currently  engaged  in  any  such
indemnification  proceedings.  Our insurance policies exclude coverage for third
party claims for patent  infringement.  Any future  obligation  to indemnify our
customers or suppliers could harm our business,  financial  condition or results
of operations.

    LITIGATION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

    From time to time, it may be necessary to initiate  litigation against third
parties to preserve our  intellectual  property  rights.  These parties could in
turn bring suit against us. For  example,  in March 1998 we filed a complaint in
federal  court against Lexar Media,  Inc. for  infringement  of one of our flash
card patents. Lexar disputed this claim and asserted that our patent was invalid
or unenforceable,  as well as asserting various  counterclaims  including unfair
competition,  violation  of the Lanham Act,  patent  misuse,  interference  with
prospective  economic advantage,  trade defamation and fraud. We have denied all
of these  counterclaims.  In July 1998, the court denied Lexar's request to have
the case dismissed. Discovery in this suit began in August 1998. On February 22,
1999,  the court  considered  arguments  and  papers  submitted  by the  parties
regarding  the scope and proper  interpretation  of the  asserted  claims in our
patent at issue in the Lexar suit. On March 4, 1999, the court issued its ruling
on the proper  construction of the claim terms in our patent.  On July 30, 1999,
we filed a motion for partial summary  judgment that Lexar  CompactFlash  and PC
Cards  contributorily  infringe  our  patent.  A hearing on this motion has been
deferred by the court until  January  2000.  In August 1999,  we had a mandatory
settlement meeting with Lexar. No settlement was reached through this meeting. A
trial date has not yet been set.

OUR RAPID GROWTH MAY STRAIN OUR OPERATIONS.

    We are currently  experiencing rapid growth, which has placed, and continues
to  place,  a  significant  strain on our  personnel  and  other  resources.  To
accommodate this growth,  we must continue to hire,  train,  motivate and manage
our employees. We are having difficulty hiring the necessary engineering,  sales
and  marketing  personnel  to support our growth.  In  addition,  we must make a
significant  investment in our existing internal information  management systems
to support increased  manufacturing,  as well as accounting and other management
related functions.  Our systems,  procedures and controls may not be adequate to
support  our rapid  growth,  which  could in turn harm our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE LOSS
OF WHOM COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

    Our success  greatly  depends on the continued  contributions  of our senior
management  and  other  key  research  and  development,  sales,  marketing  and
operations personnel, including Dr. Eli Harari, our founder, President and Chief
Executive  Officer.  Our  success  will also  depend on our  ability  to recruit


                                    Page 29
<PAGE>

additional  highly  skilled  personnel.  We  cannot  assure  you that we will be
successful  in hiring or retaining  such key  personnel,  or that any of our key
personnel will remain employed with us.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

    Many existing  computer systems and  applications may not function  properly
when using dates beyond December 31, 1999. We have  established a Year 2000 Risk
Management program to assess the impact that the Year 2000 issue may have on our
business.  Based  on  our  assessment  to  date,  all of our  flash  memory  and
connectivity  products are Year 2000  compliant.  Other Year 2000 issues that we
face  include  assessment  and  remediation  of the  computer  systems  used for
facilities  control,  machine  control and  manufacturing  testing and Year 2000
compliance of our key suppliers and customers.

    Our estimated total costs for Year 2000  compliance  issues are not expected
to have a material adverse affect on our business.  However,  the failure of our
key  suppliers  and  customers to take proper  remedial  efforts  could harm our
business,  financial  condition  and results of  operations.  See  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations--Year
2000 Readiness Disclosure."

ANTI-TAKEOVER  PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS,  STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND
IN  DELAWARE  LAW COULD  PREVENT OR DELAY A CHANGE IN CONTROL  AND, AS A RESULT,
NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR STOCKHOLDERS.

    We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging
a takeover attempt.  For example, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that
would cause substantial  dilution to a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on
terms not approved by our board of directors.  In addition,  our  certificate of
incorporation  grants the board of  directors  the  authority to fix the rights,
preferences  and  privileges  of and issue up to  4,000,000  shares of preferred
stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue
shares of preferred  stock,  such an issuance could have the effect of making it
more  difficult and less  attractive  for a third party to acquire a majority of
our  outstanding  voting  stock.  Preferred  stock may also have  other  rights,
including  economic rights senior to the common stock that could have a material
adverse  effect on the market value of the common  stock.  In  addition,  we are
subject to the  anti-takeover  provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation  Law. This section  provides that a corporation  shall not engage in
any business  combination with any interested  stockholder during the three-year
period  following  the  time  that  such   stockholder   becomes  an  interested
stockholder.  This  provision  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a
change of control of SanDisk.

OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE.

    The market price of our stock has fluctuated  significantly  in the past and
is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future.  For example,  between July 1,
1998 and October 20, 1999, our closing stock price has fluctuated  from a low of
$5 7/8 to a high of $94 1/8. We believe that such  fluctuations will continue as
a result of future  announcements  concerning  us, our  competitors or principal
customers  regarding  technological  innovations,   new  product  introductions,
governmental  regulations,  litigation  or  changes  in  earnings  estimates  by
analysts.  In  addition,  in  recent  years  the stock  market  has  experienced
significant  price  and  volume  fluctuations  and  the  market  prices  of  the
securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile, often for
reasons outside the control of the particular  companies.  These fluctuations as
well as general  economic,  political and market  conditions may have an adverse
affect on the market price of our common stock.
