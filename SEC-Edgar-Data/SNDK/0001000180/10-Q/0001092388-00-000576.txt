              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1.     These interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited
       but reflect, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2000, and
       the results of operations for the three and six month periods ended June
       30, 2000 and 1999 and cash flows for the six month periods ended June 30,
       2000 and 1999. Because all the disclosures required by generally accepted
       accounting principles are not included, these interim condensed
       consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
       audited financial statements and notes thereto in the Company's annual
       report on Form 10-K as of, and for, the year ended December 31, 1999. The
       condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 1999 was
       derived from the audited financial statements.

       The Company's results of operations for the three and six month periods
       ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 and cash flows for the six month periods
       ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 are not necessarily indicative of results of
       operations and cash flows for any future period.

2.     The Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December
       31, and each fiscal quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June
       30, and September 30. The second fiscal quarter of 2000 and 1999 ended on
       July 2, 2000 and June 27, 1999, respectively. Fiscal year 2000 is 52
       weeks long and ends on December 31, 2000. Fiscal year 1999 was 53 weeks
       long and ended on January 2, 2000. For ease of presentation, the
       accompanying financial statements have been shown as ending on the last
       day of the calendar month.

3.     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
       accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4.     The components of inventory consist of the following:

       For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000, options to
       purchase 340,086 and 214,232 shares of common stock, respectively have
       been excluded from the earnings per share calculation, as their effect
       is antidilutive. For the three and six month periods ended June 30, 1999,
       options to purchase 100,465 and 55,609 shares of common stock,
       respectively have been excluded from the earnings per share calculation,
       as their effect is antidilutive.

6.     The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and
       trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements
       to protect its intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance
       that there will not be any disputes regarding the Company's intellectual
       property rights. Specifically, there can be no assurance that any patents
       held by the Company will not be invalidated, that patents will be issued
       for any of the Company's pending applications or that any claims allowed
       from existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength
       or be issued in the primary countries where the Company's products can be
       sold to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the
       Company. Additionally, competitors of the Company may be able to design
       around the Company's patents.

       To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be necessary to initiate litigation with one or more third parties,
       including but not limited to those the Company has notified of possible
       patent infringement. In addition, one or more of these parties may bring
       suit against the Company.

       In March 1998, the Company filed a complaint in federal court against
       Lexar for infringement of a fundamental flash memory card patent. Lexar
       disputed this claim and asserted that our patent was invalid or
       unenforceable, as well as asserted various counterclaims including unfair
       competition, violation of the Lanham Act, patent misuse, interference
       with prospective economic advantage,


                                     Page 7
<PAGE>


       trade defamation and fraud. The Company has denied all of these
       counterclaims. In July 1998, the court denied Lexar's request to have the
       case dismissed. Discovery in this suit began in August 1998. On February
       22, 1999, the court considered arguments and papers submitted by the
       parties regarding the scope and proper interpretation of the asserted
       claims in the Company's patent at issue in the Lexar suit. On March 4,
       1999, the court issued its ruling on the proper construction of the claim
       terms in our patent. On July 30, 1999, the Company filed a motion for
       partial summary judgment that Lexar CompactFlash and PC Cards
       contributorily infringe the Company's patent. In December 1999, Lexar
       filed a counter motion for partial summary judgment for invalidity of the
       Company's patent. Both motions were heard by the court on March 17, 2000
       and on March 28, 2000 the court found that the accused Lexar flash cards
       contributarily infringed SanDisk's patent and granted SanDisk's motion
       for partial summary judgement. Additionally, the court denied Lexar's
       summary judgement motion for non-infringement and invalidity.

       In May 1999, Lexar filed a complaint against us in federal court for
       claims of unfair competition, false advertising, trade libel and
       intentional and negligent interference with prospective business
       advantage. In Lexar's complaint, Lexar alleged that statements by the
       Company regarding the comparative performance of its products and Lexar's
       in digital cameras were false, and further alleged that the Company had
       interfered with the certification of certain Lexar products by the
       CompactFlash Association. On July 1, 1999, the Company filed a motion to
       dismiss the Lexar complaint. Also, in July 1999, Lexar filed a motion for
       preliminary injunction seeking to stop certain advertising practices that
       Lexar alleges were misleading. On August 26, 1999, the parties executed
       and filed with the court a joint stipulation withdrawing our motion to
       dismiss and granting Lexar permission to amend its complaint. Lexar has
       amended its complaint to remove any allegations and causes of action
       based on our alleged interference in certification by the CompactFlash
       Association. On September 17, 1999, the court conducted a hearing on
       Lexar's motion for preliminary injunction. On September 24, 1999, the
       court issued an order granting a limited preliminary injunction which
       enjoins the Company from using or implying certain terminology in
       advertising regarding the comparative performance of our memory products
       in digital cameras. On October 1, 1999, the Company filed counterclaims
       against Lexar asserting causes of action including unfair competition and
       false advertising under both federal and California law. Although the
       Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the case, it believes that
       Lexar's claims are without merit and that we have meritorious
       counterclaims against Lexar.

       The trial date for the Company's patent case, filed in March 1998, has
       been set for October 2000. No trial date has been set for the case filed
       by Lexar in May 1999. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
       these cases, we believe that Lexar's claims are without merit and that
       SanDisk's counterclaims are meritorious.

       On March 21, 2000, Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. (Mitsubishi Electric) filed
       a complaint in Tokyo District Court against SanDisk K.K., SanDisk's
       wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan. The complaint alleges that SanDisk
       K.K., based in Yokohama, Japan, infringes on three Mitsubishi Japanese
       patents. The Mitsubishi patents in question are #JP2099342, #JP2129071
       and # JP2138047. Based on preliminary information, SanDisk believes that
       these patents are related primarily to the mechanical construction of
       memory cards built with a separate connector. In the complaint,
       Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary injunction halting the sale
       of SanDisk CompactFlash and flash ATA memory cards in Japan. Although the
       Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the case, it believes that
       Mitsubishi's claims are without merit. The Company and SanDisk K.K. will
       vigorously defend itself against Mitsubishi's claims.

       From time to time, the Company has been contacted by various other
       parties who have alleged that certain of the Company's products infringe
       on patents that such parties claim to hold. To date no legal actions have
       been filed in connection with any such infringement, other than as
       discussed above.

       In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, the Company
       could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use
       and sale of infringing products, expend significant


                                     Page 8
<PAGE>

       resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to the
       infringing technology, or discontinue the use of certain processes.

       From time to time the Company agrees to indemnify certain of its
       suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement. The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances include indemnification
       for damages and expenses, including attorneys fees. The Company may from
       time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of such indemnification
       obligations. Third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from
       coverage under the Company's insurance policies. There can be no
       assurance that any future obligation to indemnify the Company's customers
       or suppliers, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
       business, financial condition and results of operations.

       Compaq Corporation has opposed in several countries, including the United
       States, our attempting to register CompactFlash as a trademark. We do not
       believe that our failure to obtain registration for the CompactFlash mark
       will materially harm our business.

       Litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require
       significant management attention, even if the Company ultimately
       prevails. In addition, the results of any litigation matters are
       inherently uncertain. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of
       the foregoing matters, or any future litigation, will not have a material
       adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results
       of operations.

7.     Certain of the Company's balance sheet accounts and purchase commitments
       are denominated in Japanese Yen. The Company enters into foreign exchange
       contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
       The effects of movements in currency exchange rates on these instruments
       are recognized when the related operating revenues and expenses are
       recognized. The impact of movements in currency exchange rates on foreign
       exchange contracts substantially mitigates the related impact on the
       underlying items hedged. At June 30, 2000, forward contracts to sell
       Japanese Yen with a notional amount of $18.4 million were outstanding. In
       the second quarter of 2000, the Company had a net foreign currency
       transaction gain of $0.6 million, primarily due to transaction gains on
       its Japanese yen based assets.

8.     Accumulated other comprehensive income presented in the accompanying
       balance sheet consists of the accumulated unrealized gains and losses on
       available-for-sale marketable securities, net of the related tax effects,
       for all periods presented.

       Accumulated other comprehensive income was $11.1 million and $0.2 million

9.     On June 30, 2000, the Company and Toshiba closed a transation providing
       for the joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit
       flash memory chips and Secure Digital


                                     Page 9
<PAGE>

       Memory Card controllers. As a part of this transaction, the Company and
       Toshiba formed and contributed initial funding to FlashVision LLC, a
       joint venture to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line in
       Virginia. The cost of equipping the Virginia wafer manufacturing line is
       estimated at between $700 million and $800 million. The Company, as part
       of its 50% ownership of the joint venture, expects to invest up to $150
       million in cash and, if necessary, guarantee equipment lease lines up to
       an additional $250 million. SanDisk contributed the first $15.0 million
       of this investment in FlashVision LLC in the second quarter of 2000. The
       Company does not expect any material revenues from the 512 megabit
       technology for at least one year and from the 1 gigabit technology for at
       least two years.

10.    On January 3, 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into UMC. The Company had
       invested $51.2 million in USIC. In exchange for its USIC shares, the
       Company received 111 million UMC shares. These shares were valued at
       approximately $396 million at the time of the merger, resulting in a
       pretax gain of $344.2 million ($203.9 million after-tax) in the first
       quarter of 2000. All of the UMC shares received by the Company as a
       result of the merger are subject to trading restrictions imposed by UMC
       and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The trading restrictions expired on
       one-half of the shares on July 3, 2000. The remaining shares will become
       available for sale over a two year period beginning in January 2002. When
       the shares are ultimately sold, it is likely that the Company will
       recognize additional gains or losses due to fluctuations in the price of
       the UMC shares.

       In May 2000, the Company received a stock dividend from UMC of 200 shares
       for every 1000 shares of UMC owned, resulting in its ownership of 22
       million additional shares of UMC. The shares received as a stock dividend
       and the 50% of the shares received as a result of the merger that became
       unrestricted in July 2000 were treated as available-for-sale securities
       under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 115, Accounting for
       Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, at June 30, 2000. At
       June 30, 2000, these shares were adjusted to market value and the
       resulting unrealized net gain of $0.9 million dollars in the second
       quarter was included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The
       remaining 50% of the shares received as a result of the merger, that will
       be restricted from sale until 2002, are accounted for at their
       historical cost until such time as the related restrictions lapse.

11.    In July 2000, SanDisk entered into a definitive agreement to make a $75
       million equity investment in Tower Semiconductor ("Tower") in Israel,
       resulting in approximately 10% ownership of Tower. In exchange for its
       investment, SanDisk will receive one seat on the board of directors and a
       guaranteed portion of the wafer output from the advanced fab Tower plans
       to build in Migdal Haemek, Israel. Under the terms of the agreement,
       SanDisk will make its investment over a period of approximately 18 months
       as key milestones related to the construction, equipping and wafer
       production at the new wafer fab are met. First wafer production is
       expected at the new fab in 2002. The closing of the transaction is
       subject to several conditions including, the timely approval of a
       financial incentive package for Tower from the Israeli government,
       Tower's ability to secure additional financing from other foundry
       partners and financial institutions, timely commencement of fab
       construction and the approval of Tower's board.

12.    On August 9, 2000, SanDisk entered into a joint venture with Photo-Me
       International ("PMI") for the manufacture, installation and service of
       self-service digital photo printing labs, or kiosks, bearing the SanDisk
       brand name. Under the agreement, SanDisk and PMI will each make an
       initial investment of $4 million and secure lease financing for the
       purchase of the kiosks. The total value of the lease financing will
       depend on the number of kiosks deployed by the joint venture. We estimate
       that we will guarantee equipment lease arrangements of approximately $40
       million over the first two years of the agreement. PMI will manufacture
       the kiosks for the joint venture and will install and maintain the kiosks
       under contract with the joint venture. The first kiosks are expected to
       be deployed in retail stores in the United States in early 2001.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    Certain statements in this discussion and analysis are forward looking
statements under Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as
amended based on current expectations, and entail various risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in such forward looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties are
discussed below and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999 under
the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results." Readers are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as
of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

     SanDisk was founded in 1988 to develop and market flash data storage
systems. We sell our products to the consumer electronics and
industrial/communications markets. In the first half of fiscal 2000,
approximately 70% of our product sales were attributable to the consumer
electronics market, particularly sales of CompactFlash for use in digital camera
applications. Our CompactFlash products have lower average selling prices and
gross margins than our higher capacity FlashDisk and FlashDrive products. In
addition, a substantial portion of our CompactFlash products are sold into the
retail channel, which usually has shorter customer order lead-times than our
other channels. A majority of our sales to the retail channel are turns
business, with orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter, thereby
decreasing our ability to accurately forecast future production needs. We
believe sales to the consumer market will continue to represent a majority of
our sales as the popularity of consumer applications, including digital cameras,
increases.

    Our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the
volume of product sales, availability of foundry capacity, variations in
manufacturing cycle times, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and
manufacturing utilization, the timing of significant orders, competitive pricing
pressures, our ability to match supply with demand, changes in product and
customer mix, market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products,
changes in the channels through which our products are distributed, timing of
new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors, the
timing of license and royalty revenues, fluctuations in product costs, increased
research and development expenses, and exchange rate fluctuations. In addition,
as the proportion of our products sold for use in consumer electronics
applications increases, our revenues may become subject to seasonal declines in
the first quarter of each year. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results -
Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly Which May Adversely Affect Our
Stock Price" and "-There is Seasonality in Our Business."

    Beginning in late 1995, we adopted a strategy of licensing our flash
technology, including our patent portfolio, to selected third party
manufacturers of flash products. To date, we have entered into patent
cross-license agreements with several companies, and intend to pursue
opportunities to enter into additional licenses. Our current license agreements
provide for the payment of license fees, royalties, or a combination thereof.
The timing and amount of these payments can vary substantially from quarter to
quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and, in some cases, the timing
of sales of products by the other parties. As a result, license and royalty
revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to
fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high gross margins associated with
license and royalty revenues, gross margins and net income are likely to
fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in
product revenues.

    We market our products using a direct sales organization, distributors,
manufacturers' representatives, private label partners, OEMs and retailers. We
expect that sales through the retail channel will comprise an increasing share
of total revenues in the future, and that a substantial portion of our sales
into the retail channel will be made to participants that will have the right to
return unsold products. We do not recognize revenues from these sales until the
products are sold to the end customers.


                                    Page 11
<PAGE>

    Historically, a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of
customers. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers
will continue to account for a substantial portion of our product revenues for
the foreseeable future. We have also experienced significant changes in the
composition of our customer base from year to year and expect this pattern to
continue as market demand for our customers' products fluctuates. The loss of,
or significant reduction in purchases by major customers, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
See "Factors That May Affect Future Results - Sales to a Small Number of
Customers Represent a Significant Portion of Our Revenues" and "Business - Sales
and Distribution."

    All of our products require silicon wafers, which are all currently
manufactured by UMC in Taiwan. Industry-wide demand for semiconductors increased
significantly in 1999 and the first half of 2000, due to increased demand in the
consumer electronics and cellular phone markets. This increased demand is
expected to continue throughout 2000 causing supply to become constrained and
prices to increase. Under our wafer supply agreements, there are limits on the
number of wafers we can order and our ability to change that quantity is
restricted. Accordingly, our ability to react to significant fluctuations in
demand for our products is limited. If customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we
may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders,
which could result in lost sales and lower revenues. If we are unable to obtain
adequate quantities of flash memory wafers with acceptable prices and yields
from our current and future wafer foundries, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be harmed. If customer demand falls below our
forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our wafer orders, we may end
up with excess wafer inventories, which could result in higher operating
expenses and reduced gross margins. We have from time to time taken write downs
for excess inventories. These adjustments decrease gross margins in the quarter
reported and have resulted, and could in the future result, in fluctuations in
gross margins on a quarter to quarter basis. See "Factors That May Affect Future
Results - Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly."

    Export sales are an important part of our business. Our sales may be
impacted by changes in economic conditions in our international markets. While a
majority of our revenues from sales to Japan and other Asian countries are
derived from OEM customers who plan to export a portion of their products to
countries outside of Asia, economic conditions in Asia may continue to adversely
effect our revenues to the extent that demand for our products in Asia declines.
Given the recent economic conditions in Asia and the weakness of many Asian
currencies relative to the United States dollar, our products may be relatively
more expensive in Asia, which could result in a decrease of our sales in that
region. We may also experience pressure on our gross margins as a result of
increased price competition from Asian competitors. While most of our sales are
denominated in U.S. Dollars, we invoice certain Japanese customers in Japanese
Yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions which
could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See
"Factors That May Affect Future Results - Our international operations make us
vulnerable to changing conditions and currency fluctuations."

    For the foreseeable future, we expect to realize a significant portion of
our revenues from recently introduced and new products. Typically, new products
initially have lower gross margins than more mature products because the
manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive
product generation. In addition, manufacturing yields are generally lower at the
start of manufacturing any product at a new foundry. To remain competitive, we
are focusing on a number of programs to lower manufacturing costs, including
development of future generations of D2 flash and advanced technology wafers.
There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop such products or
processes or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs.
In addition, if the industry wide supply of flash memory products grows faster
than customer demand, we could experience increased price competition in the
future, which could result in decreased average selling prices and lower gross
margins. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results -We Must Achieve Acceptable
Manufacturing Yields."

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     PRODUCT REVENUES. Our product revenues were $122.6 million in the second
quarter of 2000, up $80.3 million or 190% from the second quarter of 1999.
Product revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2000 were $219.8 million, up
$141.6 million or 181% from the same period of the prior year. During the three
and six month periods ended June 30, 2000, total unit sales increased
approximately 167% over the same periods in 1999. The largest increases in both
periods came from sales of MultiMediaCard, CompactFlash and Flash Chipset
products. CompactFlash products represented 43% of product revenues,
MultiMediaCards 22% of product revenues for the second quarter of 2000. For the
six month period ended June 30, 2000, CompactFlash products represented 46% of
product revenues and MultiMediaCards represented 19% of product revenues.
Average selling prices increased 8% in the second quarter of 2000 and 5% for the
first six months of 2000 compared to the same periods of the prior year due
primarily to a shift in product mix to higher capacity cards in our CompactFlash
and MultimediaCard product lines. Sales to the consumer market represented
approximately 70% of product revenues and sales to the
telecommunications/industrial market accounted for the remaining 30% during the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000. Sales to the retail channel
represented 28% of product revenues in the second quarter of 2000, up from 18%
for the same period of the previous year. The mix of products sold varies from
quarter to quarter and will continue to vary in the future, affecting our
overall average selling prices and gross margins.

     Export sales represented 53% and 52%, respectively, of our product revenues
for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000 compared to 43% for the
same periods of the previous year. We expect international sales to continue to
represent a significant portion of our product revenues. For the three month
period ended June 30, 2000, our top ten customers represented approximately 49%
of our product revenues compared to 57% for the same period in 1999. One
customer accounted for more than 10% of product sales in the second quarter of
1999. We expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to
represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.

     LICENSE AND ROYALTY REVENUES. We currently earn patent license fees and
royalties under several cross-license agreements. License and royalty revenues
from patent cross-license agreements were $21.4 million in the second quarter of
2000, up from $10.2 million in the same period of the previous year, due
primarily to an increase in royalty revenues. Certain of our licensees report
royalty revenues to us only twice a year. The increase in royalty revenues for
the second quarter of 2000 included an adjustment to reconcile the estimated
royalty revenues recognized in the first half of 2000 with the actual royalties
reported by our licensees. In the first six months of 2000, revenue from patent
license and royalties was $33.5 million, up from $18.5 million for the same
period of the prior year. Revenues from licenses and royalties decreased to 15%
of total revenues in the second quarter of 2000 from 20% in the second quarter
of 1999.

    GROSS PROFITS. In the second quarter of 2000, gross profits were $59.4
million, or 41% of total revenues compared to $21.7 million, or 41% of total
revenues in the same period of 1999. Gross profits for the first half of 2000
were $101.0 million compared to $39.3 million for the same period of the
previous year. Gross margin was 40% of total revenues for the six month period
ended June 30, 2000 compared to 41% for the same period of 1999.

    Product gross margin increased to 31% of product revenues for the three and
six month periods ended June 30, 2000 compared to 27% for the same periods in
1999, primarily due to the lower cost per megabyte of our 256 Mbit flash memory
products which represented more than half of our shipments in the first six
months of 2000. We expect product gross margins to further improve in the second
half of 2000 as we complete the transition to our 256 Mbit technology for the
majority of our shipments and wafer production at the third UMC fab ramps into
volume production.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses consist
principally of salaries and payroll related expenses for design and development
engineers, prototype supplies and contract services. Research and development
expenses were $11.1 million in the second quarter of 2000, up $5.0 million or
84% from $6.0 million in the same period of 1999. In the first six months of
2000, research and development expenses increased to $19.8 million, up $8.6
million or 77% from $11.2 million in the same period of 1999. These increases
were primarily due to increased salary and related expenses and increased


                                    Page 13
<PAGE>

depreciation and amortization expenses. Research and development expenses
represented 8% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2000 compared to 11%
in the second quarter of 1999. For the first six months of 2000, research and
development expenses represented 8% of total revenues compared to 12% for the
same period of the prior year. We expect our research and development expenses
to continue to increase in absolute dollars to support the development and
introduction of new generations of flash data storage products, including the
512Mbit and 1 Gigabit flash memory co-development and manufacturing joint
venture with Toshiba and the development of advanced controller chips. We
currently expect our incremental research and development expenses related to
the Toshiba joint development project to be in the range of $6.0 million to $8.0
million in fiscal 2000.

    SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, sales
commissions, benefits and travel expenses for our sales, marketing, customer
service and applications engineering personnel. These expenses also include
other selling and marketing expenses, such as independent manufacturer's
representative commissions, advertising and tradeshow expenses. Sales and
marketing expenses were $11.5 million in the second quarter of 2000, up $5.8
million or 100% from $5.8 million in the second quarter of 1999. In the first
six months of 2000, sales and marketing expenses increased to $22.1 million, up
$11.1 million or 102% from $10.9 million in the same period of 1999. These
increases were primarily due to higher commission expenses due to increased
product revenues, increased salary and related expenses and higher marketing
expenses. Sales and marketing expenses represented approximately 8% of total
revenues in the second quarter of 2000 compared to 11% in the second quarter of
1999. For the first six months of 2000, sales and marketing expenses represented
9% of total revenues compared to 11% for the same period of the prior year. We
expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as sales of our
products grow and as we continue to develop the retail channel for our products
and as we increase our market development activities for our Secure Digital
Memory Card products.

    GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses include the
cost of our finance, information systems, human resources, shareholder
relations, legal and administrative functions. General and administrative
expenses were $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2000, up $3.1 million or
108% from $2.9 million in the second quarter of 1999. In the first six months of
2000, general and administrative expenses increased to $10.8 million, up $5.5
million or 103% from $5.3 million in the same period of 1999. These increases
were primarily due to increased salary and related expenses, increased legal
fees and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. General and
administrative expenses represented 4% of total revenues in the second quarter
of 2000 compared to 6% in the second quarter of 1999. For the first six months
of 2000, general and administrative expenses represented 4% of total revenues
compared to 5% for the same period of the prior year. We expect general and
administrative expenses to continue to increase as our general and
administrative functions grow to support our overall growth. General and
administrative expenses could also increase substantially in the future if we
continue to pursue litigation to defend our patent portfolio. See "Factors That
May Affect Future Results - Risks Associated with Patents, Proprietary Rights
and Related Litigation."

    INTEREST INCOME. Interest income was $5.8 million in the second quarter of
2000 compared to $1.4 million in the second quarter of 1999. The increase in
2000 was due primarily to higher interest income due to the investment of the
proceeds from the sale of common stock in our November 1999 follow-on public
offering.

    GAIN ON INVESTMENT IN FOUNDRY. In the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a
gain of $344.2 million as a result of the merger of United Silicon, Inc.
("USIC") and United Microelectronics Corporation ("UMC"). We had invested $51.2
million in USIC. We received 111 million shares of UMC in exchange for our USIC
shares. These shares were valued at $396 million at the time of the merger. All
of the UMC shares are subject to trading restrictions imposed by UMC and the
Taiwan Stock Exchange. The trading restrictions expired on one-half of the
shares on July 3, 2000. The remaining shares will become available for sale over
a two year period beginning in January 2002. When the shares are ultimately
sold, it is likely that we will recognize additional gains or losses. In May
2000, we received a stock dividend 200 UMC shares for every 1000 shares of UMC
owned, resulting in our ownership of 22 million additional UMC shares.


                                    Page 14
<PAGE>

OTHER INCOME, NET. Other income, net was $665,000 in the second quarter of
2000 compared to $29,000 for the same period of the prior year. The
increase was primarily due to increased foreign currency transaction gains in
the second quarter of 2000.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. In the first half of 2000 our effective tax
rate, exclusive of the gain on foundry investment, was 35% compared to 33% for
the same period of the prior year. In the first quarter of 2000, an additional
tax of $140.2 million was provided for the gain on foundry investment. The lower
effective tax rate in 1999 reflects greater benefits from federal and state tax
credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    As of June 30, 2000, we had working capital of $645.6 million, which
included $175.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $305.7 million in
short-term investments. Operating activities provided $40.9 million of cash in
the six month period ended June 30, 2000 primarily from net income and an
increase in accounts payable of $11.9 million and income taxes payable of $16.2
million, which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of
$31.2 million and inventories of $11.1 million.

    Net cash used in investing activities in the first half of 2000 of $19.4
million consisted of our $15.0 million investment in FlashVision LLC, our
foundry joint venture with Toshiba, and capital equipment purchases of $10.9
million. These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds from short
term investments of $6.4 million. In the first half of 2000, cash provided by
financing activities of $8.2 million came primarily from the sale of common
stock through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans.

    On June 30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba providing for the
joint development and manufacturing of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory
chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. As part of this transaction,
we and Toshiba formed FlashVision LLC, a joint venture to equip and operate a
silicon wafer manufacturing line in Virginia. The cost of equipping the Virginia
wafer manufacturing line is estimated at between $700 million and $800 million.
We, as part of our 50% ownership of the joint venture, expect to invest up to
$150 million in cash, and, if necessary, guarantee equipment lease lines up to
an additional $250 million. We made our first contribution of $15.0 million to
the joint venture during the second quarter of 2000.

          In July 2000, we entered into a definitive agreement to make a $75
million equity investment in Tower Semiconductor in Israel resulting in
approximately 10% ownership of Tower. In exchange for its investment, SanDisk
will receive one seat on the board of directors and a guaranteed portion of the
wafer output from the advanced fab Tower plans to build in Migdal Haemek,
Israel. Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will make its investment over
a period of approximately 18 months as key milestones related to the
construction, equipping and wafer production at the new wafer fab are met. First
wafer production is expected at the new fab in 2002. The closing of the
transaction is subject to several conditions including, the timely approval of a
financial incentive package for Tower from the Israeli government, Tower's
ability to secure additional financing from other foundry partners and financial
institutions, timely commencement of fab construction and the approval of
Tower's board.

     On August 9, 2000, SanDisk entered into a joint venture with Photo-Me
International ("PMI") for the manufacture, installation and service of
self-service digital photo printing labs, or kiosks, bearing the SanDisk brand
name. Under the agreement, SanDisk and PMI will each make an initial investment
of $4 million in the joint venture, called Digital Portal, Inc., and secure
lease financing for the purchase of the kiosks. The total value of the lease
financing will depend on the number of kiosks deployed by the joint venture. We
estimate that we will guarantee equipment lease arrangements of approximately
$40 million over the first two years of the agreement. PMI will manufacture the
kiosks for the joint venture and will install and maintain the kiosks under
contract with the joint venture. The first kiosks are expected to be deployed in
retail stores in the United States in early 2001.

     Depending on future demand for our products, we may make additional
investments, which could be substantial, in assembly and test manufacturing
equipment or foundry capacity to support our business in the future. We believe
our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments along with the
planned capital equipment lease arrangements currently in negotiation related to
our FlashVision LLC and Digital Portal, Inc. joint


                                    Page 15
<PAGE>

ventures will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital
and capital equipment expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.

    On January 3, 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into UMC. We previously
invested $51.2 million in USIC. In exchange for our USIC shares, we received 111
million UMC shares. These shares were valued at approximately $396 million at
the time of the merger, resulting in a pretax gain of $344 million ($204 million
after-tax). All the UMC shares we received as a result of the merger are subject
to trading restrictions imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The
trading restrictions expired on one-half of the shares on July 3, 2000. The
remaining shares will become available for sale over a two year period beginning
in January 2002. In addition, in May 2000 we received a stock dividend of 200
UMC shares for every 1000 shares owned, resulting in the ownership of an
additional 22 million shares. When the shares are ultimately sold, it is likely
that we will report additional gains or losses. To the extent we can liquidate
the UMC shares, we will plan to use such funds to support our operations and
capital expenditures.

IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

    A portion of our revenues are denominated in Japanese yen. We enter into
foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. At June 30, 2000, forward contracts with a notional amount of
$18.4 million were outstanding. Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
STOCK PRICE.

       Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly
in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future.
This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors, including the following:

       o      unpredictable demand for our products;

       o      decline in the average selling prices of our products due to
              competitive pricing pressures;

       o      seasonality in sales of our products;

       o      adverse changes in product and customer mix;

       o      slower than anticipated market acceptance of new or enhanced
              versions of our products;

       o      competing flash memory card standards which displace the standards
              used in our products;

       o      changes in our distribution channels;

       o      timing of license and royalty revenue;

       o      fluctuations in product costs, particularly due to fluctuations in
              manufacturing yields and utilization;

       o      availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity to meet
              customer demand;

       o      shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit
              boards required for the manufacturing of our products;

       o      excess capacity of flash memory from our competitors and our own
              new flash wafer capacity;


                                    Page 16
<PAGE>

       o      significant yield losses which could affect our ability to fulfill
              customer orders and could increase our costs;

       o      lengthening in manufacturing cycle times due to our suppliers
              operating at peak capacity;

       o      increased research and development expenses;

       o      exchange rate fluctuations, particularly the U.S. dollar to
              Japanese yen exchange rate;

       o      changes in general economic conditions, in particular the economic
              recession in Japan;

       o      natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our
              business, particularly Taiwan, Japan and the United States;

       o      difficulty of forecasting and management of inventory levels; and

       o      expenses related to obsolescence of unsold inventory.

    DIFFICULTY OF ESTIMATING SILICON WAFER NEEDS

    When we order silicon wafers from our foundries, we have to estimate the
number of silicon wafers needed to fill product orders several months into the
future. If we overestimate this number, we will build excess inventories, which
could harm our gross margins and operating results. For example, in the second
quarter of 1998, our product gross margins declined to 12% from 30% in the
previous quarter due in part to a write down of inventory to reflect net
realizable value. If we underestimate the number of silicon wafers needed to
fill product orders, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers,
which could harm our product revenues. Because our largest volume products,
CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard, are sold into emerging consumer markets, it has
been difficult to accurately forecast future sales. A substantial majority of
our quarterly sales have historically been from orders received and fulfilled in
the same quarter. In addition, our product order backlog may fluctuate
substantially from quarter to quarter.

    ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN EXPENSE LEVELS

    We increased our expense levels in the first half of fiscal 2000 to support
our growth. We expect operating expenses to continue to increase in fiscal 2000
as a result of the need to hire additional personnel to support expected growth
in sales unit volumes, sales and marketing efforts and research and development
activities, including our collaboration with Toshiba providing for the joint
development of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory chips. For example in
fiscal 2000, the incremental research and development expenses related to the
Toshiba joint development project are expected to be in the range of $6 million
to $8 million. In addition, we have significant fixed costs and we cannot
readily reduce these expenses over the short term. If revenues do not increase
proportionately to operating expenses, or if revenues decrease or do not meet
expectations for a particular period, our business, financial condition and
results of operations will be harmed.

    VARIABILITY OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND GROSS MARGIN

    Our product mix varies quarterly, which affects our overall average selling
prices and gross margins. Our CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products, which
currently represent the majority of our product revenues, have lower average
selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity FlashDisk and
FlashDrive products. We believe that sales of CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard
products will continue to represent a significant percentage of our product
revenues as consumer applications, such as digital cameras and Internet music
players, become more popular. Dependence on CompactFlash sales, together with
lower pricing caused by increased competition, caused average unit selling
prices to decline 22% during fiscal 1999 compared to a decline of 28% during
fiscal 1998. In the first six months of 2000, average selling


                                    Page 17
<PAGE>

prices increased 5% compared to the same period in 1999 primarily due to a shift
in product mix to higher capacity cards in our CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard
product lines.

    VARIABILITY OF LICENSE FEES AND ROYALTIES

    Our intellectual property strategy is to cross-license our patents to other
manufacturers of flash products. Under these arrangements, we earn license fees
and royalties on individually negotiated terms. The timing of revenue
recognition from these payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and
on the timing of product shipments by the third parties. This may cause license
and royalty revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Because
these revenues have higher gross margins than product revenues, gross margins
and net income fluctuate significantly with changes in license and royalty
revenues.

IN TRANSITIONING TO NEW PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS, WE FACE PRODUCTION AND MARKET
ACCEPTANCE RISKS.

    GENERAL

       Successive generations of our products have incorporated semiconductor
devices with greater memory capacity per chip. Two important factors that enable
us to decrease the costs per megabyte of our flash data storage products are the
development of higher capacity semiconductor devices and the implementation of
smaller geometry manufacturing processes. A number of challenges exist in
achieving a lower cost per megabyte, including:

       o      overcoming lower yields often experienced in the early production
              of new semiconductor devices;

       o      problems with design and manufacturing of products that will
              incorporate these devices; and

       o      production delays.

    Because our products are complex, we periodically experience significant
delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products. Similar
delays could occur in the future and could harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

    D2 FLASH TECHNOLOGY

    We have developed new products based on D2 flash technology, a new flash
architecture designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell. High density
flash memory, such as D2 flash, is a complex technology that requires strict
manufacturing controls and effective test screens. Problems encountered in the
shift to volume production for new flash products could impact both reliability
and yields, and result in increased manufacturing costs and reduced product
availability. We may not be able to manufacture future generations of our D2
products with yields sufficient to result in lower costs per megabyte. In fiscal
2000, we expect to rely on our 256 megabit flash memory technology, which has a
lower cost per megabyte than the 128 megabit technology for the majority of our
product shipments. If we are unable to bring future generations of our 256
megabit flash memory into full production as quickly as planned or if we
experience unplanned yield problems, we will not be able to meet our customers'
forecasted demand, which would result in lost sales, reduced revenues and
reduced margins.

    MULTIMEDIACARD PRODUCTS

    The MultiMediaCard presents new challenges in assembly and testing. For
example, in the third quarter of 1999, during the MultiMediaCard production
startup phase, we experienced fluctuations in yields which reduced
MultiMediaCard product availability, increased manufacturing costs and reduced
product margins for this product family. We are currently unable to meet all
customer demand for MultiMediaCard products. Future yield problems with our
MultiMediaCard products could result in lost sales and reduced revenues. In
addition, our gross margins may be harmed by any problems we encounter in the
production of our MultiMediaCard products.


                                    Page 18
<PAGE>

    SECURE DIGITAL MEMORY CARD PRODUCTS

    In the third quarter of 1999, we announced a memorandum of understanding
under which we, along with Matsushita and Toshiba, will jointly develop and
promote the Secure Digital Memory Card. The Secure Digital Memory Card is an
enhanced version of our MultiMediaCard that will incorporate advanced security
and copyright protection features required by the emerging markets for the
electronic distribution of music, video and other copyrighted works. We expect
to begin sampling our Secure Digital Memory Card products to key customers in
the second half of 2000. Negotiations for a definitive agreement with Matsushita
and Toshiba concerning this collaboration were concluded in the second quarter.

    The Secure Digital Memory Card will incorporate a number of new features,
including SDMI compliant security and copy protection, a mechanical write
protect switch and a high data transfer rate. We have never built products
incorporating these features. Any problems or delays in establishing production
capabilities or ramping up production volumes of our Secure Digital Memory Card
products could result in lost sales or increased manufacturing costs in 2000 and
beyond. In addition, we cannot be sure that manufacturers of consumer electronic
products will develop new products that use the Secure Digital Memory Card or
that content providers such as music studios will agree to distribute their
copyrighted content for storage on Secure Digital Memory Cards. Furthermore,
there is no assurance that consumers will widely adopt Secure Digital Memory
Cards because of the requirement to purchase copyrighted content. Conversely,
broad acceptance of our Secure Digital Memory Card by consumers may reduce
demand for our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash card products. See "--The success
of our business depends on emerging markets and new products."

WE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES FOR SILICON WAFERS.

       All of our products require silicon wafers. We rely on UMC in Taiwan to
supply all of our silicon wafers. We depend on UMC to allocate a portion of its
capacity to our needs, produce acceptable quality wafers with acceptable
manufacturing yields and deliver our wafers on a timely basis at a competitive
price. If UMC is unable to satisfy these requirements, our business, financial
condition and operating results may suffer. For example, in September 1999, both
UMC foundries producing our flash memory wafers were damaged and temporarily
shut down by an earthquake in Taiwan. Future earthquakes, aftershocks or other
natural disasters in Taiwan could preclude us from obtaining an adequate supply
of wafers to fill customer orders, and could significantly harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

    Industry-wide demand for semiconductor wafers has increased significantly
due to increased demand in the consumer electronics and cellular phone markets.
Increased demand for advanced technology silicon wafers is increasing the price
of these wafers as supply becomes constrained. We expect this trend to continue
throughout 2000 and possibly through 2001, which could adversely impact the rate
of growth of our business, either through reduced supply, higher wafer prices or
a combination of the two.

     In January 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into UMC. Before the merger,
we owned 10% of USIC, had the right to appoint one of its directors and were
entitled to 12.5% of its total wafer production. As a result of the merger, we
received UMC shares in exchange for our USIC shares. However, we do not have a
right to a seat on the board of directors of the combined company. We have
received assurances from the senior management of UMC that it intends to
continue to supply us the same wafer capacity at the prices we currently enjoy
under our agreement with USIC. However, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to maintain our current wafer capacity and competitive pricing
arrangement in our future supply negotiations with UMC.

    Under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with UMC, we are obligated to
provide a rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders for the next six
calendar months. Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each
forecast are binding commitments. The estimates for the remaining months may
only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month's forecast. This
limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products. For
example, if customer demand falls below our forecast and


                                    Page 19
<PAGE>

we are unable to reschedule or cancel our wafer orders, we may end up with
excess wafer inventories, which could result in higher operating expenses and
reduced gross margins. Conversely, if customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we
may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders,
which could result in dissatisfied customers, lost sales and lower revenues. In
addition, in February 2000, we entered into a capacity and reservation deposit
agreement with UMC. To reserve additional foundry capacity under this agreement,
we paid UMC a reservation deposit. This deposit will be refunded to us on a
quarterly basis, over the agreement term, if we purchase the full wafer capacity
reserved for us. We may forfeit part of our deposit if we are unable to utilize
our reserved capacity within four quarters of the end of the agreement term. If
we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers with acceptable price and
yields from any foundry, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be harmed.

    In the second quarter of 2000 we completed qualifications and began volume
production of the 256 Mbit D2 .24 micron technology in one UMC fab. In the third
quarter of 2000 we plan to complete similar .24 micron qualification and
commence volume production in a second UMC fab. In the third quarter of 2000 we
also plan to complete .24 micron qualification in a third UMC fab in time to
commence volume production in the fourth quarter of 2000. This third fab is a
brand new UMC fab, and there can be no assurances that we will not experience
startup difficulties, delays in wafer availabilty, and potentially initial low
yields, all of which are quite frequently encountered with new advanced
semiconductor wafer fabs. Any such difficulties may adversely impact our product
availability and gross margins.

OUR INVESTMENT IN NEW FLASH MEMORY WAFER PRODUCTION MAY RESULT IN INCREASED
EXPENSES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS.

    On June 30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba to jointly develop
future flash memory products and jointly manufacture such product, once
developed. Under this agreement, we expect to invest $150 million in cash and
guarantee up to $250 million in equipment leaselines to equip Toshiba's Dominion
Semiconductor manufacturing clean room with advanced wafer processing equipment.
Toshiba is obligated to invest an equal amount and each of us will equally share
the startup expenses and the wafer output. We will use the new production
capacity at Dominion to manufacture primarily flash memory wafers with minimum
lithographic feature size of 0.16 micron initially, moving to 0.13 micron in the
future. Such minimum feature sizes are considered today to be the most advanced
for mass production of silicon wafers and have never been used for the high
volume manufacture of flash memory chips. Therefore, it is difficult to predict
how long it will take to equip and commence production at the new facility and
achieve adequate yields and economically attractive product costs based on our
new designs. We have not operated our own wafer fabrication facility in the past
and therefore do not have any experience in addressing these challenges. With
our investments in the Dominion facility, we are now exposed to the adverse
financial impact of any delays or manufacturing problems associated with the
wafer production line. Any problems or delays in commencing production at the
new Dominion facility could adversely impact our operating results in fiscal
years 2000 and 2001.

     We expect to share with Toshiba the expected startup costs
associated with flash memory production at the Dominion facility. We expect to
incur substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of
manufacturing personnel, facilitizing the clean room and installing equipment.
During the ramp-up period, equipment depreciation begins and line operating
expenses increase substantially. While the wafer output is still relatively low,
the cost of wafers from the Dominion facility is expected to be significantly
higher than the cost of wafers from our other suppliers. This may negatively
impact our overall product gross margins until flash wafer output from Dominion
reaches an optimum level, which may never occur. Under the agreement with
Toshiba, we are committed to purchase 50% of the output from the Dominion
facility. We will incur startup costs and pay our share of


                                    Page 20
<PAGE>

ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize our full share of the
Dominion output. Should customer demand for Nand flash products be below our
available supply, we may suffer from reduced revenues and increased expenses
which could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, in order for us
to sell Nand based CompactFlash, MultiMediaCards and SD Cards, we will have to
develop new controllers, printed circuit boards and test algorithms because the
architecture of Nand flash is significantly different from our current Nor flash
designs. Any delays in the development of these elements could prevent us from
taking advantage of the available Nand output and could adversely affect our
results of operations.

     In July 2000, SanDisk entered into a definitive agreement to make a $75
million equity investment in Tower Semiconductor in Israel. In exchange for its
investment, SanDisk will receive one seat on the board of directors and a
guaranteed portion of the wafer output from the advanced fab Tower plans to
build in Migdal Haemek, Israel with .18 mircon process technology which Tower
licensed from Toshiba. We plan to use the Tower wafers for the future
manufacture of a portion of our controller chips that are being designed at our
design center in Isreal. Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will make its
investment over a period of approximately 18 months as key milestones related to
the construction, equipping and wafer production at the new wafer fab are met.
First wafer production is expected at the new fab in 2002. The closing of the
transaction is subject to several conditions including, the timely approval of a
financial incentive package for Tower from the Israeli government, Tower's
ability to secure additional financing from other foundry partners and financial
institutions, timely commencement of fab construction and the approval of
Tower's board. We cannot assure you that the Tower facility will be completed or
will begin production as scheduled or that the processes needed to fabricate our
wafers will be qualified at the new facility. Moreover, we cannot assure you
that this new facility will be able to achieve acceptable yields or deliver
sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis at a competitive price.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON EMERGING MARKETS AND NEW PRODUCTS.

     In order for demand for our products to grow, the markets for new products
that use CompactFlash and the MultiMediaCard, such as portable digital music
players and smart phones, must develop and grow. If sales of these products do
not grow, our revenues and profit margins could level off or decline.

     Because we sell our products for use in many new applications, it is
difficult to forecast demand. For example, in 1999 and the first half of 2000,
demand for our MultiMediaCard for use in portable digital music players grew
faster than anticipated and we were unable to fill all customer orders .
Although we are increasing production of the MultiMediaCard, if we are unable to
fulfill customer demand for these products in the future, we may lose sales to
our competitors.

      SECURE DIGITAL MEMORY CARD PRODUCTS

    In the third quarter of 1999, we announced a collaboration under which we
will jointly develop the Secure Digital Memory Card, an enhanced version of our
MultiMediaCard, which will incorporate advanced security and copyright
protection features required by the emerging markets for the electronic
distribution of music, video and other copyrighted works. We expect to begin
shipping customer samples of our Secure Digital Memory Cards in 32 and 64
megabyte capacities in the second half of 2000. The Secure Digital Memory Card
is slightly thicker and uses a different interface than our MultiMediaCard.
Because of these differences, the Secure Digital Memory Card will not work in
current products that include a MultiMediaCard slot. In order for the market for
our Secure Digital Memory Card to develop, manufacturers of digital audio/video
and portable computing products must include a Secure Digital Memory Card
compatible slot in their products and acquire a license to the security
algorithms. If OEMs do not incorporate Secure Digital Memory Card slots in their
products or do not buy our Secure Digital Memory Cards, our business, financial
condition and results of operations may be harmed. In addition, consumers may
postpone or altogether forego buying products that utilize our MultiMediaCard
and CompactFlash cards in anticipation of new products that will incorporate the
Secure Digital Memory Card. If this occurs, sales of our MultiMediaCard and
CompactFlash products may be harmed. The main competition for the Secure Digital
Memory Card is expected to come from the Sony Memory Stick. Sony has
substantially greater financial and other resources than we do and extensive
marketing and sales channels and brand recognition. We cannot assure you that
our Secure Digital Memory Card will be successful in the face of such
competition.


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>

     In addition, the market for portable digital music players is very new and
it is uncertain how quickly consumer demand for these players will grow. If this
market does not grow as quickly as anticipated or our customers are not
successful in selling their portable digital music players to consumers, our
revenues could be adversely affected. In addition, it is often the case with new
consumer markets that after an initial period of new market formation and
initial acceptance by early adopters, the market enters a period of slow growth
as standards emerge and infrastructure develops. In the event that this occurs
in the portable digital music player market or other emerging markets, sales of
our products would be harmed.

    The success of our new product strategy will depend upon, among other
things, the following:

    o   our ability to successfully develop new products with higher memory
        capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte;

    o   the development of new applications or markets for our flash data
        storage products;

    o   the extent to which prospective customers design our products into their
        products and successfully introduce their products; and

    o   the extent to which our products or technologies become obsolete or
        noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others.

    512 MEGABIT AND 1 GIGABIT FLASH MEMORY CARD PRODUCTS

    On June 30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba providing for the
joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory
chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. As part of this collaboration,
we and Toshiba plan to employ Toshiba's future 0.16 micron and 0.13 micron NAND
flash integrated circuit manufacturing technology and SanDisk's multilevel cell
flash and controller system technology. The development of 512 megabit and 1
gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers is
expected to be complex and incorporates SanDisk and Toshiba technology that is
still under development. We cannot assure you that we and Toshiba will
successfully develop these new products or the underlying technology, or that
any development will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner. If we
are not successful in any of the above, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could suffer.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE.

    We may be unable to increase our production volumes at a sufficiently rapid
rate so as to maintain our market share. Ultimately, our growth rate depends on
our ability to obtain sufficient flash memory wafers and other components to
meet demand. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may lose market
share to our competitors. Currently, our supply constraints are forcing some of
our largest customers to seek alternate sources of supply to meet their growing
flash memory product needs.

OUR SELLING PRICES MAY BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE EXCESS CAPACITY IN THE MARKET FOR
FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS.

    Currently industry wide demand for flash memory products far exceeds the
available supply. This is primarily driven by an explosion in the growth of
cellular phones and Internet appliances and the accelerating shift in consumer
electronics from analog to digital devices. This strong demand had manifested
itself in improved bookings visibility and a more stable pricing environment.
All major flash memory suppliers, including SanDisk, are responding to this
strong demand by significantly increasing investments in new advanced flash
memory production capacity due to the broadly held assumption that our industry
is entering a prolonged growth phase which will be able to absorb the new flash
production output. If this assumption should prove to be erroneous, or if one or
several of our target markets experience delays


                                    Page 22
<PAGE>

in anticipated growth, there may be excess supply in market for our products.
This excess capacity, even if temporary in nature, could cause average selling
prices to drop significantly, thereby adversely impacting our product gross
margins and operating results in future quarters.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS MAKE US VULNERABLE TO CHANGING CONDITIONS AND
CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.

    POLITICAL RISKS

    Currently, all of our flash memory wafers are produced by two UMC foundries
in Taiwan. We also use a third-party subcontractor in Taiwan for the assembly
and testing of our MultiMediaCard products. We may therefore be affected by the
political, economic and military conditions in Taiwan. Taiwan is currently
engaged in various political disputes with China and in the past both countries
have conducted military exercises in or near the other's territorial waters and
airspace. The Taiwanese and Chinese governments may escalate these disputes,
resulting in an economic embargo, a disruption in shipping routes or even
military hostilities. This could harm our business by interrupting or delaying
the production or shipment of flash memory wafers or MultiMediaCard products by
our Taiwanese foundries and subcontractor. See "-- We depend on our suppliers
and third party subcontractors."

    In addition, in the second quarter of 1999, we began using a third-party
subcontractor in China for the assembly and testing of our CompactFlash
products. As a result, our business could be harmed by the effect of political,
economic, legal and other uncertainties in China. Under its current leadership,
the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the
encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic
decentralization. The Chinese government may not continue to pursue these
policies and, even if it does continue, these policies may not be successful.
The Chinese government may also significantly alter these policies from time to
time. In addition, China does not currently have a comprehensive and highly
developed legal system, particularly with respect to the protection of
intellectual property rights. As a result, enforcement of existing and future
laws and contracts is uncertain, and the implementation and interpretation of
such laws may be inconsistent. Such inconsistency could lead to piracy and
degradation of our intellectual property protection.

    ECONOMIC RISKS

    We price our products primarily in U.S. dollars. As a result, if the value
of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, our products could
become less competitive in international markets. For example, our products are
relatively more expensive in Asia because of the weakness of many Asian
currencies relative to the US dollar. In addition, we currently invoice some of
our customers in Japanese yen. Therefore, fluctuations in the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Similarly, the weakness of the Euro may make our products less
competitive in Europe relative to Japanese flash memory suppliers.

    Our sales are also highly dependent upon global economic conditions. In
fiscal 1998, sales to Japan declined to 31.6% of total product sales from 38.1%
in 1997. In 1999, sales to Japan represented 22.4% of product revenue. We
believe these declines were primarily due to the Japanese recession.

    GENERAL RISKS

Our international business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any
of the following factors:

    o   the need to comply with foreign government regulation;

    o   general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability,
        potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;

    o   natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our
        business, particularly Taiwan and Japan;


                                    Page 23
<PAGE>


    o   imposition of regulatory requirements, tariffs, import and export
        restrictions and other barriers and restrictions, particularly in China;

    o   longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable
        collection, particularly as we increase our sales through the retail
        distribution channel;

    o   potentially adverse tax consequences;

    o   less protection of our intellectual property rights; and

    o   delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions.


WE DEPEND ON OUR SUPPLIERS AND THIRD PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS.

    We rely on our vendors, some of which are sole source suppliers, for several
of our critical components. We do not have long-term supply agreements with some
of these vendors. Our business, financial condition and operating results could
be significantly harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to
develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components.
For example, we rely on UMC for all of our flash memory wafers and NEC to supply
certain designs of microcontrollers. In September 1999, both UMC foundries
producing our flash memory wafers were damaged and temporarily shut down by an
earthquake in Taiwan. In addition, due to industry-wide increasing demand for
semiconductors, we have been unable to achieve price reductions from some of our
important suppliers. See "--We depend on third party foundries for silicon
wafers." We have begun to experience longer order lead times and spot shortages
on standard components due to high industry demand. Shortages of any of these
standard components could result in higher manufacturing costs or lower revenues
due to production delays or reduced product shipments. Additionally, where
possible, we are building buffer inventories of critical components. If we
accumulate excess inventories or these buffer inventories become obsolete, we
will have to write down inventories which will adversely affect our gross
margins and results of operations.

    We also rely on third-party subcontractors to assemble and test the memory
components for our products. We have no long-term contracts with these
subcontractors and cannot directly control product delivery schedules. This
could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems which could
increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our
operating results.

    During the second half of 1999, we transferred a substantial portion of
wafer testing, packaged memory final testing, card assembly and card testing to
Silicon Precision Industries Co., Ltd. in Taiwan and Celestica, Inc. in China.
In the second quarter of 2000, we will began using Amkor, in the Philippines, as
an additional subcontractor for card assembly and testing. In fiscal 2000, we
expect that these three subcontractors will be assembling and testing a majority
of our mature, high-volume products. This increased reliance on subcontractors
is expected to reduce manufacturing costs and give us access to increased
production capacity. During the transition period, we will continue full
operations at our Sunnyvale production facility while simultaneously
transferring test equipment and training personnel of our subcontractors.
However, we do not have sufficient duplicative production testing equipment at
Sunnyvale and at our subcontractors. Therefore, any significant problems in this
complex transfer of operations may result in a disruption of production and a
shortage of product to meet customer demand in the second half of 2000.

CONTINUING DECLINES IN OUR AVERAGE SALES PRICES MAY RESULT IN DECLINES IN OUR
GROSS MARGINS.

     In 1999, the average unit selling prices of our products declined 22%
compared to 1998. In 1999, the average price per megabyte shipped declined 52%
compared to 1998. Because flash data storage markets are characterized by
intense competition and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet


                                    Page 24
<PAGE>

consumer price points, we expect that market-driven pricing pressures will
continue. This will likely result in a further decline in average sales prices
for our products. We believe that we can offset declining average sales prices
by achieving manufacturing cost reductions and developing new products that
incorporate more advanced technology, include more advanced features and can be
sold at stable average gross margins despite continued declines in average
selling price per megabyte. However, if we are unable to achieve such cost
reductions and technological advances, this could result in lost sales and
declining gross margins, and as a result, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could suffer.

    The semiconductor industry is cyclical and we believe it is currently in a
recovery from one of its most severe down cycles. During most of 1997 and 1998,
the semiconductor industry experienced significant production over capacity,
which reduced margins for substantially all flash memory suppliers. Currently,
the markets for our products are supply constrained and our selling prices have
stayed relatively stable. There can be no assurance that this trend will
continue throughout 2000.

OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

      FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURERS AND MEMORY CARD ASSEMBLERS

    We compete in an industry characterized by intense competition, rapid
technological changes, evolving industry standards, declining average selling
prices and rapid product obsolescence. Our competitors include many large
domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer
foundry capacity, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and
other resources, broader product lines and longer standing relationships with
customers. Our primary competitors include:

    o   storage flash chip producers, such as Hitachi Ltd., Samsung Electronics
        Company Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation;

    o   socket flash, linear flash and component manufacturers, such as Advanced
        Micro Devices, Inc., Atmel Corporation, Fujitsu Corporation, Intel
        Corporation, Macronix International Co., Ltd., Micron Technology, Inc.,
        Mitsubishi Electronic Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corporation and
        STMicroelectronics NV; and

    o   module or card assemblers, such as Lexar Media, Inc., M-Systems, Inc.,
        Pretec Electronics Corp., Simple Technology Inc., Sony Corporation,
        Kingston Technology Company, Panasonic Consumer Electronic Company,
        Silicon Storage Technology, Inc., TDK Corporation, Matsushita Battery,
        Inc. Delkin Devices, Inc., Silicon Tek and Viking Components, Inc., who
        combine controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into
        flash storage cards.

In addition, over 25 companies have been certified by the CompactFlash
Association to manufacture and sell their own brand of CompactFlash. We believe
additional manufacturers will enter the CompactFlash market in the future.

    We have announced an agreement with Matsushita and Toshiba to jointly
develop and promote a next generation flash memory card called the Secure
Digital Memory Card. Under this agreement, Secure Digital Memory Card
royalty-bearing licenses will be granted to other flash memory card
manufacturers, which will increase the competition for our Secure Digital Memory
Card, CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products. In addition, Matsushita and
Toshiba will sell Secure Digital Memory Cards that will compete directly with
our products. While other flash card manufacturers will be required to pay the
SD Association license fees and royalties which will be shared between
Matsushita, Toshiba and SanDisk, there will be no royalties or license fees
payable among the three companies for their respective sales of the Secure
Digital Memory Card. Thus, we will forfeit potential royalty income from Secure
Digital Memory Card sales by Matsushita and Toshiba.


                                    Page 25
<PAGE>

    On June 30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba providing for the
joint development and manufacture of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory
chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. We and Toshiba will each
separately market and sell any products developed and manufactured under this
relationship. Accordingly, we will compete directly with Toshiba for sales of
these advanced chips and controllers.

    We have entered into patent cross-license agreements with several of our
leading competitors including, Hitachi, Samsung, Toshiba, Intel, SST and Sharp.
Under these agreements, each party may manufacture and sell products that
incorporate technology covered by the other party's patents related to flash
memory devices. As we continue to license our patents to certain of our
competitors, competition will increase and may harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Currently, we are engaged in licensing
discussions with several of our competitors. There can be no assurance that we
will be successful in concluding licensing agreements under terms which are
favorable to us.

    ALTERNATIVE STORAGE MEDIA

    Competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that
are different from our CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products, including
Toshiba's SmartMedia, Sony Corporation's Memory Stick, Sony's standard floppy
disk used for digital storage in its Mavica digital cameras, Panasonic's Mega
Storage cards, Iomega's Clik drive, a miniaturized, mechanical, removable disk
drive and M-Systems' Diskonchip for embedded storage applications and the Secure
MultiMediaCard from Hitachi and Infineon. Each competing standard is
mechanically and electronically incompatible with CompactFlash and
MultiMediaCard. If a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer
electronic devices designs in one of these alternative competing standards,
CompactFlash or MultiMediaCard will be eliminated from use in that product.

    IBM's microdrive, a rotating disk drive in a Type II CompactFlash format
competes directly with our Type II CompactFlash memory cards, for use in
high-end professional digital cameras. M-Systems' Diskonchip 2000 Millennium
product competes against our Flash ChipSet products in embedded storage
applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances.

    According to independent industry analysts, Sony's Mavica digital camera
captured a considerable portion of the United States market for digital cameras
in 1998 and 1999. The Mavica uses a standard floppy disk to store digital images
and therefore uses no CompactFlash, or any other flash cards. Our sales
prospects for CompactFlash cards have been adversely impacted by the success of
the Mavica. Recently, Sony has shifted its focus to the use of its flash Memory
Stick in its latest digital camera models.

    Our MultiMediaCard products also have faced significant competition from
Toshiba's SmartMedia flash cards and we expect to face similarly significant
competition from Sony's Memory Stick. Sony has licensed its proprietary memory
stick to other companies. If it is adopted and achieves widespread use in future
products, sales of our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash products may decline.
Recently, Hitachi, Infineon, Sanyo and Fujitsu have proposed their Secure
MultiMediaCard which provides the copy protection function that is included in
our Secure Digital Memory Card. Should this initiative gain industry wide
acceptance, it may reduce the widespread adoption of the Secure Digital Memory
Card.

    In the first quarter of 2000, Sanyo announced that it is developing a
miniature magneto-optical storage device for use in future digital cameras,
music players and camcorders. There can be no assurance that this device will
not be adopted by some of our OEM customers.

    ALTERNATIVE FLASH TECHNOLOGIES

    We also face competition from products based on multilevel cell flash
technology such as Intel's 64 megabit and 128 megabit StrataFlash chips and
Hitachi's 256 megabit multilevel cell flash chip. These products compete with
our D2 multilevel cell flash technology. Multilevel cell flash is a
technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of
information instead of the traditional


                                    Page 26
<PAGE>

single bit stored by the industry standard flash technology. In the second
quarter of 1999, Intel announced their new 128 megabit multilevel cell chip and
Hitachi is currently shipping CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products employing
their multilevel cell 256 megabit flash chip. In addition, Toshiba has begun
customer shipments of 32 and 64 megabyte SmartMedia cards employing their new
256 megabit flash chip. Although Toshiba has not incorporated multilevel cell
flash technology in their 256 megabit flash chip, their use of more advanced
lithographic design rules may allow them to achieve a more competitive cost
structure than that of our 256 megabit D2 flash chip.

    Furthermore, we expect to face competition from existing competitors and
from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets that have
similar or alternative data storage solutions which may be less costly or
provide additional features. Price is an important competitive factor in the
market for consumer products. Increased price competition could lower gross
margins if our average selling prices decrease faster than our costs and could
also result in lost sales.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

    In 1999 and the first half of 2000, we received more product revenue and
shipped more units of products destined for consumer electronics applications,
principally digital cameras, than for any other application. We believe that
these products will encounter intense competition and be more price sensitive
than products sold into our other target markets. In addition, we must spend
more on marketing and promotion in consumer markets to establish brand name
recognition and preference.

    A significant portion of sales to the consumer electronics market is made
through distributors and to retailers. Sales through these channels typically
include rights to return unsold inventory. As a result, we do not recognize
revenue until after the product has been sold to the end user. If our
distributors and retailers are not successful in this market, there could be
substantial product returns, which would harm our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

SALES TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR
REVENUES.

    More than half of our revenues come from a small number of customers. For
example in the first half of 2000, sales to our top 10 customers accounted
for approximately 50% of our product revenues. In fiscal 1999 sales to our top
10 customers represented 57% of our product revenues, with sales to one customer
accounting for more than 10% of product sales. If we were to lose any of these
customers or experience any material reduction in orders from these customers,
our revenues and operating results would suffer. Our sales are generally made by
standard purchase orders rather than long-term contracts. In addition, the
composition of our major customer base changes from year to year as the market
demand for our customers' products change.

OUR MULTIPLE SALES CHANNELS MAY COMPETE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SALES.

    Web based sales of our products today represent a small but growing portion
of our overall sales. Sales on the Internet tend to undercut the traditional
distribution channels and may dramatically change the way our consumer products
are purchased in future years. We cannot assure you that we will successfully
manage the inherent channel conflicts between our retail channel customers and
customers that wish to purchase directly on the Internet.

THERE MAY BE SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS.

    Sales of our products, in particular the sale of CompactFlash products, in
the consumer electronics applications market may be subject to seasonality. As a
result, product sales may be impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with
higher sales generally occurring in the second half of each year. In addition,
in the past we have experienced a decrease in orders in the first quarter from
our Japanese OEM customers primarily because most customers in Japan operate on
a fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning
of their next fiscal year. For example, our product revenues were 24% lower


                                    Page 27
<PAGE>

in the first quarter of 1998 than in the fourth quarter of 1997, mostly due to
these seasonal factors. Although we did not experience this seasonality in the
first quarter of 2000, we cannot assure you that we will not experience
seasonality in the future.

WE MUST ACHIEVE ACCEPTABLE WAFER MANUFACTURING YIELDS.

    The fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly
controlled and ultra clean environment. Semiconductor companies that supply our
wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer
manufacturing yields. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both
our design technology and the foundry's manufacturing process technology. Low
yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures. Yield problems
may not be determined or improved until an actual product is made and can be
tested. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are
well into the production process. The risks associated with yields are even
greater because we rely on independent offshore foundries for our wafers which
increases the effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve
manufacturing yield problems. If the foundries cannot achieve the planned
yields, this will result in higher costs and reduced product availability, and
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Under the terms of our definitive agreement with Toshiba, we and Toshiba
formed FlashVision LLC, a joint venture which will equip and operate a silicon
wafer manufacturing line in Virginia (the Dominion facility) to manufacture 512
megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory chips. However, we cannot assure you that
this manufacturing line will produce satisfactory quantities of wafers with
acceptable prices and yields. Any failure in this regard could materially harm
our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the
construction improvements and operation of this line will cause us to incur
significant expense and may result in the diversion of resources from other
important areas of business. We cannot assure you that we or Toshiba will be
able to secure sufficient funding to support this manufacturing line. In
addition, we have no experience in operating a wafer manufacturing line and we
intend to rely on the existing manufacturing organization at the Dominion
facility. This organization will be trained in Nand flash manufacturing by
Toshiba, but we cannot assure you that they will be successful in manufacturing
these advanced Nand flash products on a cost-effective basis or at all. We are
committed to purchase 50% of the output from the Dominion facility, and
therefore, should the customer demand for Nand flash products be below our
available supply, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Furthermore, in order for us to sell Nand based CompactFlash, MultiMediaCards
and SD Cards, we will have to develop new controllers, printed circuit boards
and test algorithms because the architecture of Nand flash is significantly
different from our current Nor flash designs. Any delays in the development of
these elements could prevent us from taking advantage of the available Nand
output and could adversely affect our results of operations.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENTS, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

    GENERAL

    We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret
laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our
intellectual property rights. In the past, we have been involved in significant
disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and claims that we may be
infringing third parties' intellectual property rights. We expect that we may be
involved in similar disputes in the future. We cannot assure you that:

    o   any of our existing patents will not be invalidated;

    o   patents will be issued for any of our pending applications;

    o   any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient
        scope or strength;


                                    Page 28
<PAGE>

    o   our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products
        are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial
        advantage; or

    o   any of our products may infringe on the patents of other companies.

In addition, our competitors may be able to design their products around our
patents.

    We intend to vigorously enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that our
efforts will be successful. If we were to have an adverse result in any
litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the
manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes
or obtain licenses to the infringing technology. Any litigation is likely to
result in significant expense to us, as well as divert the efforts of our
technical and management personnel. For example, the Lexar litigation described
below has resulted in cumulative litigation expenses of approximately $1.9
million.

    CROSS-LICENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS

    If we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or if
we are found to infringe on others' intellectual property, we could be required
to license intellectual property from a third party. We may also need to license
some of our intellectual property to others in order to enable us to obtain
cross-licenses to third party patents. Currently, we have patent cross-license
agreements with several companies, including Hitachi, Intel, Samsung, Sharp,
SST, SmartDisk and Toshiba and we are in discussions with other companies
regarding potential cross-license agreements. We cannot be certain that licenses
will be offered when we need them, or that the terms offered will be acceptable.
If we do obtain licenses from third parties, we may be required to pay license
fees or royalty payments. In addition, if we are unable to obtain a license that
is necessary to the manufacture of our products, we could be required to suspend
the manufacture of products or stop our wafer suppliers from using processes
that may infringe the rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that we
would be successful in redesigning our products or that the necessary licenses
will be available under reasonable terms.

    We have historically agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for
alleged patent infringement. The scope of such indemnity varies, but may, in
some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including
attorney's fees. We may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these
indemnification obligations. We are not currently engaged in any such
indemnification proceedings. Our insurance policies exclude coverage for third
party claims for patent infringement. Any future obligation to indemnify our
customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition or results
of operations.

    LITIGATION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

    From time to time, it may be necessary to initiate litigation against third
parties to preserve our intellectual property rights. These parties could in
turn bring suit against us. For example, in March 1998 we filed a complaint in
federal court against Lexar Media, Inc. for infringement of one of our flash
card patents. Lexar disputed this claim and asserted that our patent was invalid
or unenforceable, as well as asserting various counterclaims including unfair
competition, violation of the Lanham Act, patent misuse, interference with
prospective economic advantage, trade defamation and fraud. We have denied all
of these counterclaims. In July 1998, the court denied Lexar's request to have
the case dismissed. Discovery in this suit began in August 1998. On February 22,
1999, the court considered arguments and papers submitted by the parties
regarding the scope and proper interpretation of the asserted claims in our
patent at issue in the Lexar suit. On March 4, 1999, the court issued its ruling
on the proper construction of the claim terms in our patent. On July 30, 1999,
we filed a motion for partial summary judgment that Lexar CompactFlash and PC
Cards contributorily infringe our patent. Lexar filed a motion for summary
judgement that our patent is invalid in view of prior art. A hearing on both of
these motions was held on March 17, 2000 and on March 28, 2000 the court found
that the accused Lexar flash cards contributarily infringed SanDisk's patent and
granted SanDisk's motion for partial summary judgement. Additionally, the court
denied Lexar's summary


                                    Page 29
<PAGE>

judgement motion for non-infringement and invalidity. The trial date for our
patent case, filed in March 1998 has been set for October 2000. No trial date
has been set for the case filed by Lexar in May 1999.

    On March 21, 2000, Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. (Mitsubishi Electric) filed a
complaint in Tokyo District Court against SanDisk K.K., SanDisk's wholly-owned
subsidiary in Japan. The complaint alleges that SanDisk K.K., based in Yokohama,
Japan, infringes on three Mitsubishi Japanese patents. The Mitsubishi patents in
question are #JP2099342, #JP2129071 and # JP2138047. Based on preliminary
information, we believe that these patents are related primarily to the
mechanical construction of memory cards built with a separate connector. In the
complaint, Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary injunction halting the
sale of our CompactFlash and flash ATA memory cards in Japan. SanDisk and
SanDisk K.K. will vigorously defend itself against Mitsubishi's claims. From
time to time, we have been contacted by various parties who have alleged that
certain of our products infringe on patents that such parties claim to hold. To
date no legal actions have been filed in connection with any such infringement,
other than as discussed above.

    In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be
required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of
infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing
technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology, or discontinue the
use of certain processes. Litigation frequently involves substantial
expenditures and can require significant management attention, even if we
ultimately prevail. In addition, the results of any litigation matters are
inherently uncertain. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the
foregoing matters, or any future litigation, will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

OUR RAPID GROWTH MAY STRAIN OUR OPERATIONS.

    We are currently experiencing rapid growth, which has placed, and continues
to place, a significant strain on our personnel and other resources. To
accommodate this growth, we must continue to hire, train, motivate and manage
our employees. We are having difficulty hiring the necessary engineering, sales
and marketing personnel to support our growth. In addition, we must make a
significant investment in our existing internal information management systems
to support increased manufacturing, as well as accounting and other management
related functions. Our systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to
support our rapid growth, which could in turn harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE LOSS
OF WHOM COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

    Our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior
management and other key research and development, sales, marketing and
operations personnel, including Dr. Eli Harari, our founder, President and Chief
Executive Officer. Our success will also depend on our ability to recruit
additional highly skilled personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be
successful in hiring or retaining such key personnel, or that any of our key
personnel will remain employed with us.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS, STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND
IN DELAWARE LAW COULD PREVENT OR DELAY A CHANGE IN CONTROL AND, AS A RESULT,
NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR STOCKHOLDERS.

    We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging
a takeover attempt. For example, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that
would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on
terms not approved by our board of directors. In addition, our certificate of
incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights,
preferences and privileges of and issue up to 4,000,000 shares of preferred
stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue
shares of preferred stock, such an issuance could have the effect of making it
more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of
our outstanding voting stock. Preferred stock may also have other rights,
including economic rights senior to the common stock that could have a material
adverse effect on the market value of the common stock. In addition, we are
subject to the anti-

                                    Page 30
<PAGE>

takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This
section provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination
with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time
that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. This provision could
have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of SanDisk.

OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE.

    The market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and
is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. For example in the twelve
month period ending June 30, 2000 our stock price has fluctuated from a low of
$18.875 to a high of $169.625. We believe that such fluctuations will continue
as a result of future announcements concerning us, our competitors or principal
customers regarding technological innovations, new product introductions,
governmental regulations, litigation or changes in earnings estimates by
analysts. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the
securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile, often for
reasons outside the control of the particular companies. These fluctuations as
well as general economic, political and market conditions may have an adverse
affect on the market price of our common stock.

     SECTION 1.03 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION AND DOCUMENTARY CONVENTIONS. The rules
of construction and documentary conventions set forth in APPENDIX A shall apply
to this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.04 ADDITIONAL RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The terms and provisions of
this Agreement are binding on the parties hereto; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that to the
extent that a description in this Agreement of another agreement (whether an
Operative Document or otherwise) conflicts with or differs from the provisions
of that agreement, then the provisions of that agreement shall control as to
such conflict or difference.

                                   ARTICLE II

                               FORMATION OF NEWCO

     SECTION 2.01 FORMATION OF NEWCO. SENA and SanDisk (the "MEMBERS") will form
Newco by filing or causing to be filed the Articles in the form of Exhibit A in
accordance with the Act. At the Closing, the Members will also enter into the
Operating Agreement (as further described in Section 2.03 below), with respect
to Newco.

     SECTION 2.02 PURPOSE. Newco will, through a series of relationships and
agreements, be engaged in the manufacture, by one or more subcontract
arrangements, and sale of NAND (both binary and MLC Flash Memory) Flash Memory
Integrated Circuits excluding any products with process design rules generally
greater than 0.25 microns (collectively, "NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS") for the
Parents and SENA (whether directly or indirectly through their respective
Affiliates). Except as specifically provided for in Articles VII and VIII, all
NAND Flash Memory Products of the Parents and their Affiliates will be acquired
through Newco. Embedded Integrated Circuits ("ICS") incorporating NAND Flash
Memory Products as well as logic circuitry (i) will be included in the
definition of NAND Flash Memory Products if the main function and value of such
IC is Flash Memory and (ii) will not be included in the definition of NAND Flash
Memory Products if the main function and value of such IC is logic. SCHEDULE
2.02 sets forth the formula Toshiba and SanDisk shall use to determine the main
function and value of ICs. Toshiba and SanDisk each are permitted to market and
sell NAND Flash Memory Products manufactured by and for Toshiba and/or SanDisk,
as provided for in this Agreement, to any third party in any form, including but
not limited to chips, packaged devices and cards.

     SECTION 2.03 OPERATING AGREEMENT. In accordance with the Act, at the
Closing, the Members will enter into an Operating Agreement in the form of
EXHIBIT B providing for (i) the business of Newco, (ii) the conduct of Newco's

     SECTION 3.01 CLOSING.


                                       3
<PAGE>

     (a) At the Closing, in reliance upon the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Agreement and the other Operative Documents and
subject to and upon the fulfillment to the satisfaction of, or written waiver
by, the applicable party of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties shall deliver the closing certificates to be delivered by such party
at Closing that are referred to in Section 4.06.

     (b) The Members agree that Newco shall be formed as soon as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement. Except as provided in this Section,
Newco shall not conduct any activities prior to the Closing, except for
organizational activities.

     (c) Prior to the Closing, each Parent shall make capital contributions *
in proportion to their respective Percentages for the purchase of the capital
equipment to be set forth in a capital equipment Schedule to be agreed by the
Parents prior to Closing. Such capital contributions shall be in an aggregate
amount equal to the aggregate price for such capital equipment and shall be made
on such date as is agreed by the Parents. The officers of Newco shall be
authorized to (i) use such capital contributions only for the purpose of
acquiring such capital equipment, and (ii) enter into one or more lease
arrangements with DSC with respect to such capital equipment prior to Closing.
In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(d) or
9.01(e), SENA shall acquire SanDisk's Membership Interest for a purchase price
equal to the amount of the capital contribution made by SanDisk pursuant to this
Section 3.01(b). Such purchase price shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five Business Days of such termination. The
parties agree that Newco shall have all right, title and interest in, to and
under Capital Equipment installed at Module II and the building improvements
purchased by Newco in connection with preparing the facility and Module II for
the installation of the Capital Equipment. In the event Newco is dissolved
pursuant to Article XI of the Operating Agreement, then unless DSC has already
purchased the building improvements from Newco, Toshiba shall cause DSC, at such
time after an event of dissolution, as demanded by SanDisk, to purchase such
building improvements for a purchase price payable to Newco in immediately
available U.S. Dollars, in an amount equal to the net book value of such
improvements (not reduced by any liabilities), as the same is recorded in
Newco's financial statements at the time of such demand by SanDisk.

     (d) At Closing, Toshiba shall assign and delegate to Newco, and the Parents
shall cause Newco to accept such assignment and delegation, the rights and
obligations under the purchase orders for capital equipment made by Toshiba on
behalf of Newco. Such assignment and delegation shall be effected pursuant to an
assignment agreement mutually agreed by the Parents.

     SECTION 3.02 TIME AND PLACE OF CLOSING. The Closing shall take place by
telecopy exchange of the closing certificates referred to in Section 4.06.

                                   ARTICLE IV

             COVENANTS CONCERNING NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCT BUSINESS

     SECTION 7.01 TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.

     (a) Toshiba shall use all reasonable efforts to develop, and, in exchange
for the payments made by SanDisk under the Common R&D Agreement, upon successful
development of 0.21, 0.16, 0.13           *           micron process
technology applicable to the manufacturing and testing of NAND Flash Memory
Products ("NAND PROCESS TECHNOLOGY") that can be implemented in a commercially
viable manner, Toshiba shall deliver such technology and all improvements
thereto            *             developed by Toshiba during the term of the
Common R&D Agreement, to each of the DSC and Yokkaichi foundry facilities and
such other manufacturing facilities as may hereafter be agreed upon by the
Parents. Timing of the delivery of technology transfers shall be based on, among

be made from time to time by the Management Committee. The

*    INDICATES THAT CERTAIN INFORMATION ON THIS PAGE HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED
     SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2. CONFIDENTIAL
     TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS.


                                       15
<PAGE>

parties intend that the Yokkaichi and DSC facilities should run the same
technologies in similar time frames.

     (b) Whenever a technology transfer is required hereunder, Toshiba shall
deliver such level of NAND Process Technology to the applicable manufacturing
facility as would be normal practice by the Toshiba Semiconductor Company
whenever it transfers a technology to a new manufacturing facility or transfers
a new or advanced technology to an existing manufacturing facility in order to
achieve successful implementation of the newly transferred technology.

     (c) A technology transfer hereunder shall be deemed complete when the
transferred technology passes a reasonable qualification procedure to be
mutually agreed upon by Toshiba and SanDisk.

     (d) Following the Closing, Toshiba shall use its best efforts to assist DSC
in achieving the same productivity in the manufacturing of Products as achieved
at the Yokkaichi facility. However, the parties understand and agree that
Toshiba does not warrant that the DSC facility will be able to manufacture the
same quality and yield as experienced at the Yokkaichi facility.

     (e) The costs of all technology transfers described in this Section 7.01
shall be borne by Toshiba or by DSC as set forth in SCHEDULE 7.01, and such
expenses to be borne by DSC shall be included in Start-Up Costs as defined in
Section 7.02.

     SECTION 7.02 START-UP SERVICES AT MODULE II.

     (a) During the Start-Up Period (as hereinafter defined), various activities
will be undertaken with the intent to prepare Module II for wafers in, and
during such period, equipment will be set up, modified and processes refined to
achieve reasonable manufacturing yield and overall quality (such activities, the
"START-UP SERVICES"). The costs of the Start-Up Services (the "START-UP COSTS")
shall be DSC's actual expenses for operations together with an allocation
(approved by the Parents) of common indirect costs incurred during the Start-Up
Period, and shall include, but are not limited to, personnel costs, material
costs, Module II occupancy costs and other operating expenses. Start-Up Costs
shall expressly exclude claims, damages or liabilities indemnified under the
Environmental Indemnity Agreement. The "START-UP PERIOD" shall mean the period
commencing on the execution of this Agreement and ending on the Production Wafer
Start Date. The "PRODUCTION WAFER START DATE" shall mean the date of the start
of the first production wafers in Module II, such date to be determined by
mutual agreement of the Management Committee. The parties intend that the
Production Wafer Start Date shall occur on or about the end of the first quarter
of 2001.

     (b) The parties recognize the risks and uncertainties inherent in building
a new manufacturing facility and transferring a prototypical, advanced,
never-before-commercialized, 0.16 micron NAND manufacturing process that is
intended to incorporate multi-level cell technology, an unproven and untested
technology in NAND format. Given the uncertainty of (i) successfully
implementing such technology at Module II, (ii) Module II being capable of
producing NAND Flash Memory Products at commercially viable costs, and (iii)
such


                                       16

NAND Flash Memory Products being competitive and accepted in the marketplace
          *          .

     (c) Toshiba will (and will ensure that DSC will also) keep internal records
of all Start-Up Costs.

     SECTION 7.03 EXPANDED CAPACITY.

     (a) Toshiba and SanDisk intend to meet demand for increased capacity by
equally investing in, and jointly building (except for the expansion of the
Yokkaichi facility, unless otherwise agreed upon by Toshiba and SanDisk ), and
sharing, on equal or substantially equal terms, equal amounts of new capacity
for NAND Flash Memory Products. SCHEDULE 7.03(A) sets forth a list in order of
priority of expanding the manufacturing capacity of NAND Flash Memory Products.
Initially, Toshiba shall be allocated NAND Flash Memory Product capacity of
          *           L/M and SanDisk shall be allocated NAND Flash Memory
Product manufacturing capacity of           *           L/M at the Yokkaichi
facility. Module II shall be constructed with a targeted maximum manufacturing
capacity for NAND Flash Memory Products of           *           L/M, to be
allocated to Toshiba and SanDisk on an equal basis. Toshiba shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, to expand the manufacturing capacity for NAND
Flash Memory Products of the Yokkaichi facility, by up to a maximum of
          *           L/M; PROVIDED, THAT, SanDisk shall have the right to
have allocated up to           *           of any such expanded capacity so
long as SanDisk commits to load such additional capacity for six (6) months, and
provided, further, that Toshiba may, in its sole discretion, decrease the
manufacturing capacity of the Yokkaichi facility, subject to Section 8.02(b).

     (b) Once Module II has achieved NAND Flash Memory Products manufacturing
capacity of           *           L/M, and after such time as the Yokkaichi
facility has achieved NAND Flash Memory Products manufacturing capacity of
          *           L/M, the Management Committee will determine whether to
convert all or a portion of DSC Module I to the production of NAND Flash Memory
Products at a targeted maximum capacity to be determined by the Management
Committee, not to exceed           *           L/M, or whether to establish
another facility with capacity to manufacture NAND Memory Products at a targeted
capacity to be determined by the Management Committee, not to exceed
*           L/M. SanDisk shall have the option to commit to an allocation of
such converted capacity to manufacture NAND Flash Memory Products, up to a
maximum of           *           L/M. In considering the conversion of DSC
Module I, the Management Committee will discuss the possible sale of a fifty
percent interest in DSC Module I to SanDisk. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
SanDisk's purchase of the DSC Module I interest is not a condition to the
conversion of DSC Module I to manufacturing NAND Flash Memory Products;
PROVIDED, THAT, if no DSC Module I interest is purchased by SanDisk, SanDisk
acknowledges that SanDisk's purchase price for such NAND Flash Memory Products
manufactured at DSC Module I may not be equal to that for Toshiba.

     (c) Until (i) the Yokkaichi facility has achieved the expansion of its
manufacturing capacity for NAND Flash Memory Products, if any, determined by
Toshiba in accordance with Section 7.03(a), (ii) Module II has achieved a NAND
Flash Memory Product manufacturing capacity of           *           L/M, and
(iii) either DSC Module I has converted all or

<PAGE>

a portion of its capacity to the production of NAND Flash Memory Products and
DSC Module I has achieved a capacity to manufacture NAND Flash Memory Products
in an amount determined by the Management Committee (not to exceed a targeted
maximum capacity of            *            L/M) or the parties have
established another facility with a capacity to manufacture NAND Flash Memory
Products in an amount determined by the Management Committee (not to exceed a
targeted maximum capacity of            *            L/M), the Parties shall
not make or cause to be made any other increases in the manufacturing capacity
for NAND Flash Memory Products. After the capacity expansions in the clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence have been achieved, either Parent
shall have the one-time option to expand its capacity to manufacture NAND Flash
Memory Products; PROVIDED, THAT, in no event shall such Parent's capacity exceed
60% of the total combined committed capacity to manufacture NAND Flash Memory
Products, after giving effect to such additional expansion.

     (d) After the capacity expansions described in Section 7.03(a), (b) and
(c), any additional capacity expansion shall be determined by the Management
Committee and shall be made jointly by the Parents on an equal basis.

     (e) All NAND Flash Memory Products will be obtained by the Parents or for
the Parents through their Affiliates from Newco, except that each Parent may
obtain, directly or indirectly, a combined total of up to            *
           L/M of NAND Flash Memory Products produced at the Yokkaichi facility,
which shall be obtained according to agreed upon allocations in accordance with
this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all orders for NAND Flash Memory
Products not ordered through Newco shall be reported to Newco on a quarterly
basis.

     (f) If the Parents mutually agree to secure external manufacturing sources
other than DSC and Yokkaichi through joint investment or investment by either
Parent in accordance with this Section, Newco and Toshiba will jointly transfer
the applicable manufacturing technology and know-how to such source. Newco will
conduct all negotiations with the external manufacturing source; PROVIDED,
however, that the terms and conditions of any agreement shall be subject to
prior consultation with and the approval of Toshiba. Toshiba and SanDisk may
purchase NAND Flash Memory Products manufactured at an external source only from
Newco. In connection with any technology transfer to an external source, Toshiba
will be reimbursed its mutually agreed transfer costs for assisting in the
transfer of manufacturing technology and know-how. If the new capacity secured
at the external manufacturing source is requested by only one of the Members,
such Member will pay the transfer costs and be entitled to purchase the full
output of NAND Flash Memory Products purchased by Newco from the external
manufacturing source. If both Members request the new external capacity, then
Newco will pay the transfer costs to Toshiba. Neither Toshiba nor the Members
have the right to grant manufacturing licenses to an external manufacturing
source or to disclose or transfer to any external manufacturing source
manufacturing know-how related to the manufacture of NAND Flash Memory Products,
except through Newco.

     SECTION 7.04 CAPACITY SHARING ARRANGEMENT.

     (a) Each of the Members through Newco will have the right and obligation to
utilize 50% of Module II's manufacturing capacity based on a measure of
equivalent wafer starts per day with the equivalency being weighed based on the
process complexity factors (as

*    INDICATES THAT CERTAIN INFORMATION ON THIS PAGE HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED
     SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2. CONFIDENTIAL
     TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS.


                                       18
<PAGE>

calculated by a formula to be mutually determined by the Parents) of the
Products being produced for such Members. Where the Members purchase the same
output volume (up to and including 50% of the DSC Target Capacity) for
equivalent NAND Flash Memory Products supplied by Newco, the Members will pay
the same purchase price per die or packaged unit. If a Member is unable to
utilize 50% of the U.S. Foundry Parties' manufacturing capacity for NAND Flash
Memory Products, such Member may contract with Newco to utilize its surplus
capacity to manufacture such Member's proprietary products, including but not
limited to controllers or Flash Memory products that are not NAND Flash Memory
Products, PROVIDED, THAT, such Member installs the necessary process technology
and bears all incremental costs (measured as incremental costs above DSC Cost at
the then-current DSC maximum capacity) associated with the adverse impact on the
manufacture of NAND Flash Memory Products. If either Member is unable to use its
allocated capacity, the Members may negotiate the terms of a transfer of such
capacity shortfall to the Member not experiencing such shortfall. To the extent
that a Member is not able to utilize excess capacity or transfer such capacity
to the other Member, the Member experiencing such shortfall will bear the
incremental cost increase to the Member not experiencing a shortfall (or pay to
Newco an under-utilization fee in accordance with a formula to be mutually
determined by the parties).

     (b) Each Member may use a portion of its total allocated capacity to cause
to be manufactured (in the case of SanDisk, at DSC) NAND Flash Memory Products
which are proprietary to that Member ("PROPRIETARY NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS")
and which need not be shared with the other Member. Any adverse incremental
costs (measured as incremental costs above DSC Cost at the then-current DSC
maximum capacity) associated with the manufacture and production of such
Proprietary NAND Flash Memory will be borne by the initiating Member. Each
Member shall give the other Member at least ninety (90) days advance written
notice of its intention to use a portion of its allocated capacity to
manufacture Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products and the parties shall refer
the matter to the Steering Committee for consultation and planning, with the
intention to minimize the impact of such allocation. Such notifying Member will
limit the output volume of such Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products to
one-third (1/3) of such Member's total allocated output unless it receives the
consent of the other Member to an increase in such output volume above such
limit.

     (c) Each Parent (the "ORIGINATING PARENT") shall inform the other (the
"NON-ORIGINATING PARENT") of the development plans by the Originating Parent to
develop NAND Flash Memory Products or NAND Flash Memory-related controllers, and
the Originating Parent and the Non-Originating Parent shall each refer such
matter to the Coordinating Committee. If the Coordinating Committee unanimously
decides that such planned development shall be undertaken jointly, then the cost
of such joint development shall be borne by each Parent in accordance with the
Product Development Agreement, and the NAND Flash Memory Products manufactured
following such joint development shall be considered non-Proprietary NAND Flash
Memory Products for purposes of Section 7.04(b) above; PROVIDED, THAT, the NAND
Flash Memory Products set forth in Exhibit A to the Products Development
Agreement shall be deemed to be non-Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products
without any action by the Coordinating Committee. Subject to the foregoing, if
the Coordinating Committee does not unanimously decide that such planned
development shall be undertaken jointly, then the Originating Parent may, at its
sole discretion, either (i) transfer to the Non-Originating Parent the
technology, including the items in Exhibit C to the Product Development
Agreement relating to

                                       19
<PAGE>

such technology, used to manufacture such NAND Flash Memory Products on a
royalty-free basis, whereupon such NAND Flash Memory Products shall be
considered non-Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products, or (ii) treat such NAND
Flash Memory Products as Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products for purposes of
Section 7.04(b) above. In the event the Originating Party elects to treat any
NAND Flash Memory Products as Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products in
accordance with the preceding sentence, but thereafter the Coordinating
Committee unanimously determines that such Proprietary NAND Flash Memory
Products should be developed jointly, the Originating Party may transfer to the
other Parent the technology used to manufacture such NAND Flash Memory Products
on reasonable terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the parties,
whereupon such Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products shall be treated as
non-Proprietary NAND Flash Memory Products.

     (d) Each Member may use a portion of its total allocated capacity to cause
to be manufactured at DSC or any other facility (other than Yokkaichi)
controllers, including NAND Flash Memory-related controllers, and non-NAND Flash
Memory-related products which are proprietary to that Member and which need not
be shared with the other Member. Any adverse incremental costs (measured as
incremental costs above DSC Cost at the then-current DSC maximum capacity)
associated with the manufacture and production of such proprietary designs will
be borne by the initiating Member. Each Member shall give the other Member at
least ninety (90) days advance written notice of its intention to use a portion
of its allocated capacity to manufacture such proprietary products, and the
parties shall refer the matter to the Steering Committee for consultation and
planning, with the intention to minimize the impact of such allocation.

Representative, in the absence of one or more other Committee Representatives
appointed by the same Appointing Party or an alternate Committee Representative,
may cast the vote such absent Committee Representatives would otherwise be
entitled to cast.

          (vii) The quorum necessary for any meeting of the Management Committee
shall be those Committee Representatives entitled to cast all of the votes held
by the members of the Management Committee. A quorum shall be deemed not to be
present at any meeting for which notice was not properly given under Section
7.05(c) (Meetings, Notice, etc.), unless the Committee Representative or
Committee Representatives as to whom such notice was not properly given
attend(s) such meeting without protesting the lack of notice or duly execute(s)
and deliver(s) a written waiver of notice or a written consent to the holding of
such meeting.

          (viii) Each appointment by an Appointing Party to the Management
Committee shall remain in effect until the Appointing Party making such
appointment notifies the other Appointing Party and Newco in writing of a change
in such appointment. The resignation or removal of a Committee Representative
shall not invalidate any act of such Committee Representative taken before the
giving of such written notice of the removal or resignation of such Committee
Representative (or alternate Committee Representative).

     (c) MEETINGS, NOTICE, ETC.

     SECTION 7.06 CREATION OF DSC NAND STEERING COMMITTEE. Immediately following
the Closing, Toshiba, SanDisk and DSC shall form a DSC NAND Steering Committee
(the "STEERING COMMITTEE") comprised of two senior individuals from each of
Toshiba and SanDisk and three senior individuals from DSC. Each of Toshiba,
SanDisk and DSC shall be responsible for appointing their designated members to
the Steering Committee. One individual shall be appointed to chair the Steering
Committee, on alternating one-year terms, if requested by any of Toshiba,
SanDisk or DSC. The Steering Committee shall be responsible for (i) measuring
DSC's performance against plan, (ii) developing performance based incentive
plans for consideration by Newco's Operating Committee, (iii) drafting annual
Business Plans for consideration by Newco's Operating Committee and DSC's
Operating Committee, and (iv) advising DSC's management. Toshiba shall insure
that the Steering Committee shall have (a) access on a regular basis to DSC
financial information relating to NAND operations, (b) access to the portion of
the DSC management meetings during which NAND operations are reviewed, and (c)
beginning in January 2001 (after the closing contemplated under the agreement
between Toshiba and IBM referred to in Section 5.13), access to the portion of
the DSC Operating Committee meetings during which NAND operations are reviewed.
The Steering Committee shall meet monthly or at such other times as decided by a
unanimous decision of the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee shall
report from time to time to the Operating Committee of Newco. Information
learned by the members of the Steering Committee may be shared with other
individuals within their member companies, on a need-to-know basis.

     SECTION 7.07 PERSONNEL.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section, each Parent may
assign to Newco, as Seconded Employees, employees whom such Parent believes are
capable of performing the assignment and likely to contribute to the success of
Newco and to have a


                                       23
<PAGE>

positive impact on Newco's business environment. Any liabilities in respect of
the employment of Seconded Employees for periods prior to the commencement or
following the termination of their assignment to Newco shall be retained by the
relevant Parent (or Subsidiary) that assigned such Seconded Employee to the
Company.

     (b) Toshiba and SanDisk agree that it is in the best interests of Newco to
attract capable and qualified potential employees to work at Newco. Newco's
management will decide what type of promotional activities and personal
incentives are desirable to help achieve this goal and shall be responsible for
hiring decisions.

     (c) The parties hereby agree that, during their period of assignment to
Newco, all Seconded Employees are expected to devote their best efforts to
promote the interests and success of Newco and to perform their work for Newco
in good faith under the direction of management of Newco. Toshiba and SanDisk
each agrees to encourage Seconded Employees assigned to Newco to be dedicated to
the best interests and success of Newco.

     (d) Toshiba and SanDisk will mutually agree on the total number and cost of
Seconded Employees assigned to Newco at any time. Newco shall reimburse (from
profits retained by Newco) the Parent that assigned a Seconded Employee for the
salaries, employment-related Taxes and customary and reasonable additional
expenses of such Seconded Employee associated with the temporary nature of such
Seconded Employee's duties; PROVIDED, THAT, such additional expense must be
approved in advance by the Members, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the costs and
expenses associated with any stock-based compensation (including, but not
limited to, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units and dividend equivalent rights) provided to such Seconded
Employees shall be borne solely by the assigning Parent. These costs will be
reflected in the Business Plans. Newco shall also bear the cost of standard
benefits of each Seconded Employee during the period such Seconded Employee is
assigned to Newco, such benefits to be consistent in amount and scope with the
benefits provided such Seconded Employee by the assigning Parent prior to such
assignment. Newco shall bear such costs either by providing such benefits
directly to the Seconded Employee or by reimbursing the assigning Parent;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that without the approval of the Operating Committee, the
total cost of salaries plus all benefits, including without limitation, hiring
expenses and relocation expenses, for Seconded Employees assigned by either
Member may not exceed, as an average or in the aggregate for all such Seconded
Employees assigned by such Member, the applicable maximum amount reflected
therefor in the then-current Business Plan.

     (e) Newco shall be responsible for paying any expenses associated with
hiring its employees, including moving and living expenses and signing bonuses,
subject to approval of the Operating Committee after the Closing.

     SECTION 7.08 NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. So long as the business of
Newco is being continued, each Parent (and each of its respective Affiliates)
shall not, without the prior written consent of the other Parent, directly
recruit or solicit any employee or officer of Newco (other than a Seconded
Employee of such Parent or one of its Affiliates) to leave his or her employment
with Newco prior to the period ending twenty-four (24) months after the
termination of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that placement of employment
advertisements or other general solicitation for employees not specifically
targeted to the


                                       24
<PAGE>

employees or officers of Newco shall not be deemed to constitute direct
recruitment. In the event of the dissolution and upon the liquidation of Newco,
either Parent (or any Affiliate of either Parent) may solicit any employee or
former employee of Newco, but neither Parent (nor any of its Affiliates) shall
be required to employ any such Person. In the event that the Membership Interest
of one of the Members is purchased by the other Member or by the designee of the
other Member, the parties shall reach agreement on a reasonable transition plan
of up to six months in connection with the services provided to Newco by
Seconded Employees.

     SECTION 7.09 EXTERNAL FINANCING; ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT.

       (a) Funding in excess of capital contributions required pursuant to
Section 6.01(Capital Contributions) of the Operating Agreement (but not to
exceed US $500 million without the written consent of each Parent) will
be obtained by Newco through loans, equipment leasing transactions and other
methods of financing agreed by the Members. The types and amount of funding will
continue to be evaluated until the time the financing is required and will be
based on, among other things, asset lives, lease terms and cost of capital.
The funding obligations of the Parents shall be several and not joint, unless
otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by both Parents. It is the intent of
each of the Parents that such obligations be incurred in proportion to their
respective Percentages. The Parents shall provide several but not joint
guarantees of institutional Indebtedness in proportion to their Membership
Interest if such guarantees are required by third parties from which Newco will
obtain such funding or if such guarantees would substantially reduce the
interest rate applicable to such Indebtedness. The actual cost of, and
liabilities arising from, each such guarantee shall be borne by the Parent that
provides such guarantee or shared proportionately in the event the Parents have
agreed in writing to make such guarantee jointly. In no event shall the Parents
be obligated to provide any joint and several guarantees to third parties or
otherwise be liable to any third party on a joint and several basis. If either
Parent is unable to provide guarantees for any Indebtedness of Newco for any
reason whatsoever, such Parent (or its Affiliates) shall make loans to Newco;
PROVIDED, THAT the interest rate for such loans shall not exceed competitive
interest rates denominated in U.S. dollars.

     (b) It is anticipated that a definitive list of the specific equipment to
be owned by Newco will not be completed by the Closing. Immediately after the
Closing, the Steering Committee shall establish the process and mechanism for
obtaining such equipment. Such process and mechanism shall include procedures
for obtaining equipment pursuant to arms-length negotiations on the most
favorable terms and conditions available.

     SECTION 7.10 OTHER ACTIVITIES. During the term of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates shall: (i) fabricate NAND Flash
Memory Integrated Circuits at any location other than Yokkaichi, DSC Module I,
Module II or any other fabrication facility agreed upon by the parties; (ii)
have any third party fabricate NAND Flash Memory Integrated Circuits; or (iii)
have any right to fabricate NAND Flash Memory Integrated Circuits beyond the
capacity as limited pursuant to Article VII, as such capacity limitations may be
amended from time to time in accordance with Article VII. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing contained in the foregoing shall restrict the parties from
engaging in any other activities, including, without limitation, (i) designing
any NAND Flash Memory Product; (ii) selling any NAND Flash Memory Product to any
customer; (iii) entering into any equipment purchase or


                                       25
<PAGE>

material supply agreements; or (iv) entering into any patent licensing
arrangement, and nothing in the foregoing shall restrict Toshiba from installing
any manufacturing line in Yokkaichi (subject to the capacity limitations set
forth in Article VII, as such capacity limitations may be amended from time to
time in accordance with Article VII). For purposes of this Section, "NAND FLASH
MEMORY INTEGRATED CIRCUITS" shall mean ICs included in the definition of NAND

success of the Company during the period of their assignment and to performing

               (i) The Members acknowledge that the Initial Business Plan and
each successive Business Plan will represent the Company's then current forecast
of the proposed operations of the Company.

               (ii) An updated Business Plan complying with Section 3.04(b)
(Form and Scope) in respect of each successive Fiscal Year shall be prepared
under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with the
active participation of the President and the Executive Vice President of the
Company and of DSC and submitted to the Operating Committee for review and
approval not later than the January 15 preceding the commencement of such Fiscal
Year.

               (iii) When the proposed Business Plan in respect of a Fiscal Year
is approved by the Operating Committee, it shall constitute the Business Plan
and the Company and its officers and employees shall implement such Business
Plan, which shall be the basis of the Company's operations for such Fiscal Year.
Upon approval, the approved Business Plan shall constitute the approved
operational, financing and capital expenditure budget. The Operating Committee
shall have the authority pursuant to Section 5.01(d) (Matters Requiring Approval
of Operating Committee) to amend the Business Plan for any Fiscal Year,
including the operating budget contained therein, and either Member may request
that the Operating Committee review the Company's operating results and

Operating Committee; PROVIDED THAT the timing of such Capital Contributions
shall be the same for each Member and the amount of such Capital Contributions
shall be in proportion to their respective Percentages.

          (b) No Member shall be obligated to make any capital contributions to
the Company in excess of $150 million or after the end of the second quarter of

Profits and Net Losses) to the extent necessary to meet the Members' aggregate
U.S. Federal, state and local income tax liabilities with respect to such Fiscal
Year (including estimated payments), calculated as if the highest marginal
statutory U.S. Federal and the Commonwealth of Virginia and local corporate tax

         CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND ALLOCATIONS OF NET PROFITS AND NET LOSSES

     SECTION 7.01 CAPITAL ACCOUNTS.

          (a) The Company shall establish and maintain for each Member on the
books of the Company a capital account ("Capital Account") in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(b). A Member's initial Capital
Account shall be increased (without duplication) by (i) the amount of any cash
contributions made by or on behalf of such Member to the Company, (ii) the
agreed value of any property contributed by or on behalf of such Member to the
Company (net of any liabilities secured by such property that the Company is
considered to assume or take subject to under Code Section 752), and (iii) the
amount of all Net Profits (or items thereof) allocated to such Member pursuant
to Sections 7.02 (Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses) and 7.04
(Depreciation Recapture); and a Member's Capital Account shall be decreased by
(x) the amount of any Net Losses (or items thereof) allocated to such Member
pursuant to Section 7.02 (Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses) and (y) all
amounts distributed by the Company to such Member with respect to its Membership
Interest (including the fair market value of any property distributed in kind,
net of all liabilities secured by such property that such Member is considered
to assume or take subject to under Code Section 752). The Capital Account of
each Member shall also be adjusted appropriately to reflect any other
adjustments required pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1 and
1.704-2.

          (b) Upon the occurrence of any event specified in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), the Capital Accounts of the Members may (subject
to both Members' consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld) be adjusted to reflect the fair market value of the Company's property
at such time and in such manner as provided in such Regulation.

          (c) In the event that any interest in the Company in accordance with
the provisions hereof is transferred, the transferee of such interest shall
succeed to the portion of the transferor's Capital Account attributable to such
interest.

     SECTION 7.02 ALLOCATION OF NET PROFITS AND NET LOSSES.


                                       18
<PAGE>


          (a) GENERAL. Subject to Section 7.02(b) (Special Allocations) and
Section 7.04 (Depreciation Recapture), the Net Profits and Net Losses of the
Company for each Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the Members pro rata in
accordance with their respective Percentages.

          (b) SPECIAL ALLOCATIONS. Special allocations of specific items of
income, gain, loss or deduction may be required for any Fiscal Year as follows:

               (i) items of income and gain shall be allocated between the
Members at such time and in such amounts as necessary to satisfy the "minimum
gain chargeback" requirements of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code
Section 704(b) (the "704(b) Regulations");

               (ii) nonrecourse deductions attributable to a "partner
non-recourse liability" (as defined in the 704(b) Regulations) of the Company
shall be allocated among the Members that bear the economic risk of loss for
such partner nonrecourse liability in accordance with the ratios in which such
Members share such economic risk of loss and in a manner consistent with the
requirements of the 704(b) Regulations; and

               (iii) items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be
allocated to the extent required to satisfy the "qualified income offset"
provisions of the 704(b) Regulations.

               (iv) The allocations set forth in Sections 7.02(b)(i) through
(iii) (the "Regulatory Allocations") are intended to comply with certain
requirements of the U.S. Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the Members
that, to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either
with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of
Company income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this Section 7.02(b)(iv).
Therefore, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article VII (other than
the Regulatory Allocations), the Members shall make such offsetting special
allocations of Company income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner they
determine appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each
Member's Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the
Capital Account balance such Member would have had if the Regulatory Allocations
were not part of the Agreement and all Company items were allocated pursuant to
Sections 7.02(a) (Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses) and 7.04
(Depreciation Recapture).

          (c) AUTHORITY TO MODIFY ALLOCATIONS. In the event that the Tax Matters
Partner determines that the allocations otherwise required pursuant to this
Section do not properly reflect the economic arrangement of the Members or do
not comply with the requirements of Code Section 704(b), the Tax Matters Partner
shall be authorized to modify such allocations as appropriate to more properly
reflect the economic arrangement of the Members or to comply with Code Section
704(b).

     SECTION 7.03 DISTRIBUTION IN KIND. Neither Member shall be obligated to
receive distributions in kind, except pursuant to Section 11.07 (Liquidation
Proceeds).

     SECTION 7.04 DEPRECIATION RECAPTURE. Any Net Profits arising from a Capital
Transaction that is characterized as ordinary income pursuant to Code Section
1245 or


                                       19
<PAGE>


1250 or any other applicable Code provision shall, to the extent possible, be
allocated to the Member who was allocated the depreciation deductions giving
rise to such ordinary income; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the ordinary income
that would otherwise be allocated to a Member pursuant to this sentence would
exceed the Net Profits otherwise allocable to such Member pursuant to Section
7.02 (Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses), such excess shall instead be
allocated to the other Member.

     SECTION 7.05 ALLOCATION BETWEEN TRANSFEROR AND TRANSFEREE MEMBERS. If any
interest in the Company is Transferred during any Fiscal Year in accordance with
this Agreement, then the transferor and transferee shall each be entitled to
receive distributions pursuant to Article VI (Capital Contributions;
Distributions) and allocations of Net Profits and Net Losses pursuant to this
Article VII (Capital Accounts and Allocations of Net Profits and Net Losses), as
follows:

          (a) unless the transferor and transferee shall agree otherwise and so
provide in the instruments of transfer, distributions shall be made to the
Person owning such interest on the date of the distribution; and

          (b) subject to applicable Treasury Regulations, Net Profits and Net
Losses shall be allocated based upon the number of days each Person holds such
interest during such Fiscal Year.

     SECTION 7.06 FEDERAL INCOME TAX ALLOCATIONS. Sections 7.02 through 7.05
provide for the allocation of items of income, gain, losses and deductions for
Capital Account maintenance purposes. The Company's ordinary income and losses
and capital gains and losses as determined for Federal income tax purposes (and
each item of income, gain, loss or deduction entering into the computation
thereof) shall be allocated to the Members in the same proportions as the
corresponding Capital Account items are allocated pursuant to this Article VII.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Federal income tax items relating to
Section 704(c) Property shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with
Code Section 704(c) and Treas. Reg. Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) to take into
account the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of such
Section 704(c) Property as of the date of its contribution to the Company or
revaluation pursuant to Section 7.01(b). Items described in this Section shall
not be credited or charged to Capital Accounts.

     SECTION 7.07 FISCAL YEAR. Unless otherwise required by the Code or
applicable Treasury Regulations, the Fiscal Year of the Company shall end on the
last day of March of each year.

     SECTION 7.08 ELECTIONS.

          (a) In the event of a Transfer of all of a Member's interest in the
Company, the Tax Matters Partner shall at the request of the transferee cause
the Company to elect (if such election is not already in effect) pursuant to
Code Section 754 to adjust the basis of the Company's property in the manner
provided in Code Section 743, provided that any such basis adjustment shall be
allocated solely to such transferee.

     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all other elections required
or


                                       20
<PAGE>


permitted to be made by the Company under the Code or other applicable tax
law, and all material decisions with respect to the calculation of its taxable
income or other applicable tax law, shall be made in such manner as may be
reasonably determined by the Tax Matters Partner.

          (b) For tax purposes, the most accelerated method of depreciation
acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service will be used by the Company.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

          (a) The books and records of the Company shall be kept on an accrual

     SECTION 8.03 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

          (a) ANNUAL STATEMENTS. As soon as practicable following the end of
each Fiscal Year (and in any event not later than 60 days after the end of such

Member Representative, audited consolidated and consolidating balance sheets of
the Company as of the end of such Fiscal Year and the related consolidated and

shall be accompanied by (i) the report of the Accountants to the effect that
such financial statements (except for the comparison to the budget) have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with prior years
(except as otherwise specified in such report) and that the audit of such
financial statements has been performed in accordance with GAAS and (ii) a
report as to all transactions (including the nature, type and amount) between
the Company and each Member, its Parent and its other Affiliates. The Company

contain


                                       21
<PAGE>


any qualifications as to the scope of the audit or with respect to the Company's
compliance with GAAP consistently applied, except for changes in methods of
accounting in which such Accountants concur and except that the foregoing shall
not be deemed to obligate either Member to contribute any capital to the Company
other than as provided in Section 6.01 (Capital Contributions). At the same
time, the Company shall deliver at the Company's sole expense to each Member a
report indicating such Member's share of all items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of the Company for such Fiscal Year on a GAAP basis for
financial reporting purposes. At the time specified in Section 8.05(c)

related unaudited consolidated and consolidating statements of operations,
Members' capital accounts and cash flows of the Company for such Fiscal Quarter
and for the Fiscal Year to date (or similar statements if such statements change
as the result of changes in GAAP), in each case setting forth in comparative
form the corresponding figures for the preceding Fiscal Quarter, for the
corresponding Fiscal Quarter of the prior Fiscal Year and for the budget for
such Fiscal Quarter and for the Fiscal Year to date. At such time, the Company
shall deliver at the Company's sole expense to each Member an estimate of such
Member's share of all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the
Company for such Fiscal Quarter and for the Fiscal Year to date for Federal
income tax purposes. Such financial statements shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the principal accounting or financial officer of the Company to
the effect that such financial statements have been prepared under such
officer's supervision and that, although such financial statements do not
contain the footnotes and other disclosures required to be presented in interim
financial statements by GAAP, such financial statements, in such officer's
judgment, fairly present the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company as of the date and for the periods indicated, subject to normal
recurring year-end audit adjustments.

     SECTION 8.04 OTHER REPORTS AND INSPECTION. The Company shall furnish
promptly to each Member such other reports, financial data and information
relating to the Company as such Member may reasonably request and shall require
the Accountants to provide to each Member copies of any document related to the
Company in the possession of the Accountants as such Member may reasonably
request. The Company shall, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal
business hours, make available to each Member and its professional advisors from
time to time as requested by such Member all properties, assets, books of
account, corporate records, contracts and documentation, if any, relating to
employee benefits of the Company, and any other material requested by such

of reasonable and appropriate confidentiality agreements. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company will not make available to either Member information
provided to the Company on a confidential basis by the other Member without the
consent of such other Member.

     SECTION 8.05 TAXATION.

          (a) CHARACTERIZATION. The Members intend that the Company shall be
treated as a partnership for Federal, state, local and foreign income and

the Tax Matters Partner of the Company within the meaning of Code Section

or foreign law (in such capacity, the "Tax Matters Partner"). All reasonable out
of pocket expenses incurred by SENA (or its permitted transferee) while acting
in such capacity shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company. The Tax Matters
Partner shall take such action, if any, as may be reasonably necessary to
constitute SanDisk (or its permitted transferee) as a "notice partner" within
the meaning of Code Section 6231(a)(8).

          (c) TAX RETURNS. The Tax Matters Partner shall prepare or cause the
Accountants to prepare and file on a timely basis the Federal tax returns of the
Company and shall cause all such federal, state, local and any other tax returns
to be transmitted to SanDisk for its review and comment thirty (30) days prior
to the due date therefor (including extensions) if the relevant information is
received by the Tax Matters Partner from the Accountants by April 1 preceding
the date such return is to be filed, or if the information is not received by
the Tax Matters Partner by April 1, as soon as practicable following its receipt
of such information; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in any event such information shall be
transmitted to SanDisk (or its permitted transferee) not later than 15 days
before the tax return is to be filed. The Tax Matters Partner will consider in
good faith reasonable comments proposed by SanDisk (or its permitted
transferee). The Company will contract with the Accountants to receive the
information or the completed tax returns for delivery by April 1. The Tax
Matters Partner shall cause state, local


                                       23
<PAGE>


and any other tax returns required to be filed by the Company to be prepared and
filed on a timely basis. SanDisk (or its permitted transferee) shall be advised
in advance of such preparation and filing, and, to the extent appropriate, the
Accountants or other accounting firms shall assist with such preparation and
filing. When indicated, the Tax Matters Partner will use tax elections specified
in the Business Plan and the Initial Business Plan. No Member shall file any tax
return that is inconsistent with the tax returns filed by the Company.

Subsidiaries not otherwise employed shall be deposited from time to time to its
credit in such banks or trust companies or other depositories or invested in
such other investments held as cash equivalents as the Operating Committee shall
authorize. The funds of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be commingled
with the funds of either Member or any Affiliate of either Member.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

                 MEMBERSHIP; DISPOSITION OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS

     SECTION 9.01 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS.

          (a) Neither SanDisk nor SENA (nor their respective permitted
transferees) shall Transfer any interest in the Company including any of such
Member's Membership Interest, to any Person, except by a Change of Control;
PROVIDED, THAT a Member may transfer all its interest in the Company, including
all its Membership Interest, to an Affiliate and, in the case of SENA, to
Toshiba or an Affiliate of Toshiba, with the prior written consent of the other
Member, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and PROVIDED, FURTHER,
that (i) the transferee agrees in writing to become a party hereto and assumes
all the obligations of the transferring Member hereunder and under each other
Operative Document to which the transferring Member is a party and (ii)
immediately after giving effect to such Transfer, no Event of Default or an
event or condition that with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute an Event of Default with respect to the transferee Member shall
exist. Following the effectiveness of any such Transfer, the transferring Member
shall no longer have the transferred right, title or interest in the Company or
any rights under this Agreement and the transferee shall be substituted as a
Member for all purposes of this Agreement. The transferring Member shall,
however, remain responsible for all obligations under this Agreement and the
other Operative Documents for any transferee which is an Affiliate and shall not
be released or discharged from any existing liability or obligation to any
Person. Any subsequent Transfer of an ownership interest in such transferee
Affiliate shall be deemed to constitute a Transfer of a Membership Interest in
the Company requiring compliance with this Section.

          (b) If a Member Transfers its entire interest in the Company pursuant
to Section 9.01(a) (Restriction on Transfer of Membership Interest), the
transferee shall succeed to all the rights and obligations under this Agreement
of such Member.

          (c) A Member may agree to pay amounts equal to distributions received
from the Company to a third party in its sole discretion pursuant to a
Permissible


                                       24
<PAGE>


Assignment Agreement. "Permissible Assignment Agreement" means an agreement
between a Member and another Person (the "Permissible Assignee") if such
agreement:

entire interest in the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(a) (Restriction on

          (a) The Members shall endeavor to settle through their representatives
in the Operating Committee any disputes which may arise between them, including
without limitation, failure by the Operating Committee to reach agreement (or
failure to take a vote) on any matter requiring Operating Committee approval
pursuant to Section 5.01(d) (Matters Requiring Approval of Operating Committee).
The Members shall attempt to resolve the issue or proposed action in question,
to the extent practicable, in a manner consistent with the Company's
then-effective Business Plan, unless the issue in dispute is the adoption of a
new Business Plan, in which case provisions of Sections 10.04(c) through (e)
shall apply.

          (b) If (i) the Members are unable to agree on (i) any matter requiring
the approval of the Members pursuant to Section 4.01(a) (Matters Requiring the
Consent of the Members), (ii) the Operating Committee is unable to agree on any
matter requiring the approval of the Operating Committee pursuant to Section
5.01(d) (Matters Requiring the Approval of Operating Committee) (other than the
approval of any Business Plan, with respect to which the failure to agree shall
be governed by Section 10.04(c), (d) and (e)) or (iii) the Members or the
Operating Committee are otherwise unable to resolve a dispute on any other item
(other than the approval of any Business Plan, with respect to which the failure
to agree shall be governed by Section 10.04(c), (d) and (e)), then either Member
may bring the matter to the attention of the Vice President, Semiconductor
Company of Toshiba, and the SanDisk General Manager, NAND Division (the
"Designated Individuals"), who will attempt to find a resolution. If the matter
has not been resolved within 30 days of referral to the Designated Individuals,
the matter will be referred to the Management Committee (as defined in the
Master Agreement) for a final decision, which decision will be final and binding
on the Company and the Members with respect to any matter specified in Sections
10.04(b)(i) and (ii) above. If agreement is reached by the Management Committee,
the mutually agreed resolution shall be implemented by the Company. Should no
solution be agreed upon within thirty (30) days after submission of the matter
to the Management Committee with respect to the matters specified in (iii)
above, such matter shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section
10.03(b) (Dispute Resolution) of the Master Agreement. Should no solution be
agreed upon within sixty (60) days after submission of the matter to the
Management Committee with respect to the matters specified in Sections
10.04(b)(i) and (ii) above, then the action being requested will not occur,
unless it is already included in the then current Business Plan.

          (c) If by February 15 of any calendar year during the term of this
Agreement, commencing February 15, 2004, the Operating Committee and the Members
have not approved and agreed upon a Business Plan for the upcoming Fiscal Year,
then either Member may refer the dispute to the Management Committee for a
decision, which decision shall be final and binding on the Company and the
Members. If a decision is reached by mutual agreement of the Management
Committee, the decision shall be implemented by the Company. Should no decision
be reached within ninety (90) days after submission, then, unless the Members
have agreed to continue operations under the existing Business Plan until a new
Business Plan is approved, then within ten (10) Business Days thereafter either
Member may elect by written notice to the other Member to declare a deadlock
("Deadlock").

          (d) Within thirty (30) days after a Member has notified the other
Member of a Deadlock, either Member (the "Initiating Member") may submit to the
other Member (the "Responding Member") a written irrevocable notice (the
"Deadlock Dissolution


                                       27
<PAGE>


Notice") to the effect that the Initiating Member offers to sell to the
Responding Member or its designee the Initiating Member's Membership Interest
for a cash purchase price equal to the Net Book Value of the Company multiplied
by that fraction of the Members' aggregate Capital Accounts represented by the
Capital Account of the Initiating Member.

          (e) The Responding Member may accept such offer by written response to
the Initiating Member within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Deadlock
Dissolution Notice indicating that the Responding Member elects to purchase the
Membership Interest of the Initiating Member. If the Responding Member declines
to exercise its right to purchase the Membership Interest of the Initiating
Member pursuant to this Section or fails to respond (or if both Members submit
Deadlock Dissolution Notices), the Company shall be dissolved pursuant to
Section 11.01(d) (Events of Dissolution), at the end of a one-year period for
the wind-down of operations commencing with the receipt of the Deadlock
Dissolution Notice by the Responding Member. During said one-year period, the
Company's business shall be conducted in accordance with the most recently
approved Business Plan except that additional capital expenditures will not be
made except as required for line maintenance.

     SECTION 10.05 REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT; TERMINATION ON BREACH. If
there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default with respect to a
Member (upon such occurrence, such Member is referred to herein as the
"Defaulting Member"), in addition to all other remedies available to the Company
or the other Member (the "Nondefaulting Member"), whether under any of the
Operative Documents or other agreements or by law (including pursuant to Section
13.1-1027 of the Act), the Nondefaulting Member shall have the option to take
one or more of the following actions:

          (a) give written notice to the Defaulting Member of its intention to
acquire the entire Membership Interest of the Defaulting Member for a payment in
cash of an amount equal to that portion of the Company's Net Book Value equal to
the Defaulting Member's Percentage; and/or

          (b) elect to dissolve the Company pursuant to Section 11.03
(Dissolution Upon Event of Default), in which case the affairs of the Company
shall be wound up and the Company shall be dissolved in accordance with Article
XI (Dissolution).

pursuant to Section 10.04(e) (Dispute Resolution; Deadlock Respecting Business
Plan), 10.05(a) (Remedies Upon Event of Default; Termination on Breach), 11.04
(Dissolution by Unilateral Option) or 11.05 (Dissolution Upon Notice) shall take
place not later than the thirtieth (30th) Business Day after notice of the
purchase is given, as the case may be, except that such period shall be extended
as necessary in order to comply with any Governmental Rule. The purchasing
Member shall pay for the Membership Interest being acquired by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the selling Member. The
selling Member shall execute all documents necessary to effect the conveyance of
such interest in the Company, free


                                       28
<PAGE>


and clear of all Liens, to the purchasing Member. In addition, the Members shall
enter into an indemnity and release agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory
to each Member indemnifying and holding harmless the selling Member and its
Parent and Affiliates for liabilities or claims made after the date of the
purchase and sale under any guarantees or other agreements supporting the
obligations of the Company which may have been extended by the selling Member,
its Parent or any of its Affiliates. The Members shall also reach agreement on a
reasonable transition plan of up to six months in connection with services
provided to the Company by Seconded Employees.

          (b) If a Member elects to acquire all the interest of the other Member
in the Company pursuant to Section 10.04(e) (Deadlock), 10.05(a) (Event of
Default), 11.04 (Dissolution by Unilateral Option) or 11.05 (Dissolution Upon
Notice), such Member shall be obligated to take all actions required of it to
consummate the applicable purchase and sale on the date determined pursuant to
Section 10.07(a) (Mechanics of Sale). If a Member has the right to purchase the
Membership Interest of the other Member, such Member shall have the right to
assign the right to purchase to any other Person.

Defaulting Member to dissolve the Company, in which event the Company shall be
dissolved and the Members shall forthwith take all actions necessary to wind up
the affairs of the Company in accordance with Section 11.06 (Winding Up). This
Section shall not be construed to limit the rights of the Nondefaulting Member
under Section 10.05 (Remedies Upon Event of Default) or to seek damages from the
Defaulting Member or any other Person for the breach of its obligations under
any of the Operative Documents.

     SECTION 11.04 DISSOLUTION BY UNILATERAL OPTION. At any time between April

to extend the terms of any Operative Document or to offer to enter into any
other agreement with a prospective purchaser of the Company for the purchase or

Capital Accounts, as adjusted pursuant to Section 7.01 (Capital Accounts) to
reflect all prior Company operations (including any gains or losses arising from
the sale of any assets of the Company in connection with such dissolution and
liquidation and any hypothetical gains or losses as provided in this Section
with respect to any asset distributed in kind). If any asset of the Company is
to be distributed in kind, such asset shall be valued to determine the amount of
Net Profits or Net Losses that would result if such asset were to be sold at its
fair market value, and such Net Profits or Net Losses shall be allocated to the
Capital Accounts of the Members in accordance with Section 7.02 (Allocation of
Net Profits and Net Losses).

          (b) Unless otherwise agreed by the Members and to the extent permitted
under any agreements with third parties, all assets to be distributed upon the

               (i) first, to creditors, including Members who are creditors, to
the extent permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the Company,

               (ii) second, to Members in accordance with their positive Capital
Account Balance as described in Section 11.07(a) (Liquidation Proceeds);


                                       31
<PAGE>


For purposes of this Section, instruments of transfer and other documents
reasonably requested by the distributee shall be executed by the Company or the
other Member, or both.

          (c) Any distribution made pursuant to this Section shall be made no
later than the later of (i) the end of the calendar year during which the
liquidation is completed and (ii) ninety (90) days after the completion of the
liquidation.

     SECTION 11.08 DEFICIT CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, and notwithstanding any custom or rule of
law to the contrary, the deficit, if any, in the Capital Account of any Member
upon dissolution of the Company shall not be an asset of the Company and such
Member shall not be obligated to contribute such amount to the Company to bring
the balance of such Member's Capital Account to zero.

     SECTION 11.09 ARTICLES OF DISSOLUTION. On completion of the winding-up of
the Company pursuant to Section 13.1-1050 of the Act and the distribution of
Company assets as provided herein, the Company is terminated, and the Members
(or such other Person or Persons as the Act may require or permit) shall file a
certificate of cancellation with the State Corporation Commission of the
Commonwealth of Virginia pursuant to Section 13.1-1050 of the Act and take such
other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Company.

                                  ARTICLE XII.

                          INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     SECTION 12.01 INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a) Subject to Section 12.01(c), the Company shall indemnify each
Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including an action by or in the
right of a Member or the Company), by reason of the fact that such Person is or
was a Member or is or was or has agreed to become a Member Representative or is
or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or of another partnership,
corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, arising from any action
alleged to have been taken in any such capacity or by reason of any liability or
obligation of the Company, against any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
costs, charges, expenses (including interest, penalties and reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, "Losses") actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his
behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
therefrom. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any of such Losses
shall be deemed to arise out of a Company liability or obligation if it arises
out of or is based upon the conduct of the business of the Company (or any of
its Subsidiaries) or the ownership of the property of the Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries).

          (b) The indemnification provided under this Section shall inure to the
benefit of the successors, heirs and personal representatives of any Person
entitled to the benefit of such indemnification. Such indemnification shall be a
contract right and shall include the


                                       32
<PAGE>


right to be paid advances of reasonable expenses incurred by any such Person in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding.

          (c) The indemnification provided under this Section shall not inure to
the benefit of any Person in respect of Losses to the extent that such Losses
(i) arise out of or are based upon the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of
such Person or (ii) constitute a tax, levy or similar governmental charge not
imposed upon the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) or on their respective
properties. The indemnification provided under this Section shall also not be
available to any Person in respect of any Losses if a judgment or other final
adjudication adverse to such Person establishes (x) that such Person's acts were
committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty
and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated or (y) that such Person
gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which such Person was
not legally entitled. It is understood and agreed that, for the purposes of this
Section, Losses shall be deemed not to arise out of or be based upon the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of a Person solely because it arises out of or
is based upon the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or active and
deliberate dishonesty of a director, officer or employee of such Person if at
the time of such gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or active and
deliberate dishonesty, such director, officer or employee was also a Seconded
Employee or a Member Representative acting in his capacity as such.

          (d) The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of NOLO CONTENDERE or its
equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the indemnified
Person did not meet the standard set forth in Section 12.01(c)
(Indemnification).

     SECTION 12.02 INSURANCE. The Company may, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, purchase and maintain insurance against any liability that may be
asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity pursuant to Section 12.01.

     SECTION 12.03 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE MEMBERS.

          (a) Each Member agrees to, and does hereby, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and the other Member from and against any and all Losses
arising out of, or based upon, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Member under this Agreement or such Member exceeding its authority under
this Agreement.

          (b) The provisions of this Section shall survive each of the
termination of this Agreement, the dissolution of the Company and the withdrawal
of either Member.

     SECTION 12.04 ASSERTION OF CLAIMS.

          (a) In the event that a Person (the "Indemnified Party") desires to
assert its right to indemnification from a Person (an "Indemnifying Party")
required to indemnify such Indemnified Party under this Article XII, the
Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of the claim
giving rise thereto (a "Claim"), and the Indemnifying Party shall undertake the
defense thereof (unless the Claim is asserted against or related to or results
from any action or failure to take action by such Indemnifying Party). The
failure to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party hereunder shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its


                                       33
<PAGE>


obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced by the failure to so notify promptly.

          (b) The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party unless the Indemnified
Party agrees in writing to forego any and all claims for indemnification from
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Claim. However, if the Indemnifying
Party, within a reasonable time after notice of any such Claim, fails to defend
such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk
of the Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to
assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or
final determination thereof.

          (c) If the Indemnifying Party has undertaken the defense of a Claim
and (i) if there is a reasonable expectation that (x) a Claim may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments or (y) the Indemnified Party or Parties may have legal
defenses available to it or them that are different from or additional to the
defenses available to the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) if the Indemnifying Party

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the termination of this Agreement
(i) on or before March 31, 2002, SanDisk shall be obligated immediately to pay
its share of the allocated Common R&D expenses accrued through the date of such
termination (pro-rated in the event such termination occurs prior to the end of
a quarter) as set forth in Table A, (ii) after March 31, 2002 but prior to
December 31, 2002, SanDisk's shall be obligated immediately to pay any unpaid
amount set forth in Table B.

         (ii)     After March 31, 2002:

                  The parties acknowledge that after March 31, 2002, it will be
                  difficult to predetermine Toshiba's total Common R&D
                  expenditures and a fixed allocation of Common R&D expenditures
                  for SanDisk. Therefore, after March 31, 2002, the payment by
                  SanDisk to Toshiba for Common R&D expenditures will be based
                  on a percentage of SanDisk's Net Sales (as hereinafter
                  defined), and calculated and paid as follows:

                  Within thirty days of the end of each calendar quarter based
                  on SanDisk's Net Sales of NAND Flash Memory Products for the
                  quarter just ended as follows:

                    a)   * of the first US $ 100 million for the quarter
                           reported;

                    b)   * of the next US $ 100 million for the quarter
                           reported; and

                    c)   * of net sales in excess of US $ 200 million per
                           quarter.

                  For the purpose of this Article, "Net Sales" shall mean the
                  invoice price for NAND Flash Memory Products billed by
                  SanDisk.

          (iii)    Notwithstanding (ii) above, SanDisk's quarterly
contribution for Common R&D pursuant to (i) and (ii) above shall not exceed the
sum of (a)       *      of the total Common R&D annual expenditure of
the Semiconductor Company of Toshiba, as notified to SanDisk by Toshiba at the
beginning of each of Toshiba fiscal year ("Total R&D Budget") for the first
  *      of the Total R&D Budget and (b)          *           of the
portion of such Total R&D Budget in excess of        *        .

          (iv)      Notwithstanding (iii) above, in the event that the Total
R&D Budget is likely to substantially exceed      *       for any calendar
year due to the development of the NAND Flash Memory technology with design
rules of          *            micron or less and/or development of such
technology applicable to twelve inches wafer, both parties shall discuss in good
faith to determine the fair methodology to share such Toshiba's Common R&D
expenditures.

          (v) The amount of the Total R&D Budget shall be subject to
verification if requested by SanDisk by disclosing internal Toshiba documents to
an independent certified public accountant appointed by SanDisk which shall
verify the stated amount of the Total R&D Budget, by written certification to
SanDisk by the appropriate officer of the Semiconductor Company of Toshiba. Such
verification shall be conducted, at SanDisk's cost and expense, during normal
business hours of Toshiba and not more frequently than annually.

          (vi) Within 45 days of the start of each of its fiscal years, Toshiba
shall provide SanDisk with a 1-2 day detailed presentation of Toshiba's process
development activity at AMC and other Toshiba facilities for the previous
calendar year and forecasted activity for the new fiscal year as such activity
relates to or affects NAND Flash Memory. Any expenses incurred for such
presentation shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses.

5.2      Payments of the fees provided for in Article 5.1 (other than
         Article 5.1(i), which payments shall be made on or before the dates
         specified therein) shall be made by SanDisk within sixty (60) days
         after receiving the invoice to be issued by Toshiba at the end of each
         applicable calendar quarter. For the purpose of Toshiba's issuance of
         such invoices, SanDisk shall submit to Toshiba, within 30 days
         following the end of each quarter after April 1, 2002, a written report
         stating the quantity and Net Sales of NAND Flash Memory Products sold
         or otherwise disposed of by SanDisk during the applicable quarter.

5.3      All payments under Article 5.1 shall be made in Japanese yen by
         wire transfer of immediately available funds to the following account
         or such other account as may be designated by Toshiba to SanDisk in
         writing:

         Toshiba Corporation, Account No. 0949155, The Sakura Bank, Ltd., Tokyo
         Main Office 1-1-2, Yuraku-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100, Japan (Tel:
         81-3-3501-1111)

         Where the provisions of this Agreement require the conversion of an
         amount initially computed in another currency into Japanese Yen, the
         Japanese Yen amount payable shall be calculated using the New York
         foreign exchange mid range rates (Currency per US Dollars) published in
         THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, Western Edition, on the last business day such
         journal is published in the calendar quarter immediately preceding the
         date of payment.

5.4      All payments provided for in Article 5.1 shall be made without
         deduction of taxes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event any
         withholding income tax is imposed by U.S. tax authorities on any amount
         payable to Toshiba hereunder, SanDisk may withhold such income tax from
         such amount to the extent that Toshiba may obtain a tax credit against
         its Japanese income tax. SanDisk shall without undue delay obtain and
         send to Toshiba tax certificates evidencing the tax amount withheld and
         paid to U.S. tax authorities.

5.5      In the event any compensation payable to Toshiba by SanDisk
         under this Agreement becomes overdue other than as a result of any
         action or inaction on the part of Toshiba, Toshiba shall be entitled to
         request SanDisk to pay interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum until
         such compensation is paid.

5.6      Toshiba shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to
         have an independent certified public accountant conduct during normal
         business hours and not more frequently than annually, an audit of the
         appropriate records of SanDisk to verify the number of units of NAND
         Flash Memory Products sold or otherwise disposed of by SanDisk and
         SanDisk's calculation of the fees and Net Sales pursuant to Article 5.1
         above.

ARTICLE 6.        WARRANTY

6.1      Each party provides to the other party its technical information
         on an "as-is" basis only, and does not make any warranty or
         representation with respect to such technical information for any
         purpose.

6.2      Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as:

         (b)      conferring the other party any right to use in advertising,
                  publicity or otherwise any trademark, trade name or names,
                  or any contraction, abbreviation or simulations thereof of
                  either party;

         (c)      conferring the other party, by implication, estoppel or
                  otherwise, any license or other right, except for the
                  licenses and rights expressly granted hereunder; and

         (d)      an obligation to furnish any technical information or
                  know-how except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

ARTICLE 7.        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGE OF ANY KIND, (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFIT OR DATA) WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH LOSS.

ARTICLE 8.        CONFIDENTIALITY

8.1      As used in this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information"
         shall mean any information disclosed by Toshiba to SanDisk pursuant to
         this Agreement which is in written, graphic, machine readable or other
         tangible form and is marked "Confidential", "Proprietary" or in some
         other manner to indicate its confidential nature. Confidential
         Information may also include oral information disclosed by Toshiba to
         SanDisk pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such information is
         designated in a manner to indicate its confidential nature at the time
         of disclosure and reduced to a written summary by Toshiba within thirty
         (30) days after its oral disclosure. For avoidance of doubt, all
         information observed by or disclosed to Assignees at Toshiba's
         facilities shall be treated as Toshiba Confidential Information.

                                       7

<PAGE>

8.2      During the ten (10) year period following receipt of such
         information, the receiving party shall keep any Confidential
         Information, including but not limited to the technical information
         SanDisk has access to at AMC during the course of the development of
         the Contract Technology hereunder, in strict confidence, and shall not
         disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without prior
         written consent of the disclosing party. The receiving party shall
         maintain the Confidential Information with at least the same degree of
         care that the receiving party uses to protect its own strictly
         confidential information, but no less care than is reasonable under the
         circumstances. Further, the receiving party shall not use the
         Confidential Information for any purposes other than for the
         development of the Contract Technology hereunder, except as otherwise
         provided herein.

8.3      Neither party shall disclose the terms and conditions of this
         Agreement to any third party other than in compliance with any
         government regulation, without prior written consent of the other
         party.

8.4      The confidentiality obligation set forth in Articles 8.2 and 8.3
         above shall not apply to any information which:

         (a)      is already known by the receiving party at the time of
                  disclosure;

         (b)      is or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving
                  party;

         (c)      is rightfully received by the receiving party from a third
                  party without any restriction on disclosure;

         (d)      is independently developed by the receiving party;

         (e)      is disclosed with the prior written consent of the disclosing
                  party hereunder; or

         (f)      is disclosed pursuant to applicable laws, regulations
                  or court order; provided, that the receiving party shall give
                  the disclosing party prompt notice of such request so that the
                  disclosing party has an opportunity to defend, limit or
                  protect such disclosure.

8.5      Each party understands that any disclosure or dissemination of
         the other party's Confidential Information not expressly authorized
         hereunder would cause irreparable injury to such other party, for which
         monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and said other party
         shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies the
         other party may have hereunder or at law. In the event SanDisk is to
         enter into any joint development work with any third party, SanDisk
         warrants that Toshiba Confidential Information provided to SanDisk in
         connection with the development of the Contract Technology shall
         neither be used for such joint development work nor be disclosed to any
         third party unless expressly otherwise provided hereunder.

         (e)      the making by such other party of any assignment of whole or
                  substantial assets for the benefit of creditors.

         This Agreement shall terminate on the thirtieth (30th) day after such
         notice of termination is given.

9.4      The provisions of Articles 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall survive

     SECTION 2.02 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of any agreement or instrument
incorporating these Rules of Construction and Documentary Conventions or the
application of any such provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision of such agreement or instrument (except as may be expressly
provided in such agreement or instrument) or invalidate or render unenforceable
such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the parties waive any provision of law that renders any provision of such
agreement or instrument invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect. The
parties shall, to the extent lawful and practicable, use their reasonable
efforts to enter into arrangements to reinstate the intended benefits, net of
the intended burdens, of any such provision held invalid,

TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGE
OF ANY KIND, (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFIT OR DATA) WHETHER OR
NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS.

ARTICLE 10. CONFIDENTIALITY

10.1 As used in this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" shall mean
     any information disclosed by one party to other party pursuant to this
     Agreement which is in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible
     form and is marked Confidential, Proprietary or in some other manner to
     indicate its confidential nature. Confidential Information may also include
     oral information disclosed by one party to the other party pursuant to this
     Agreement; provided that such information is designated in a manner to
     indicate its confidential nature at the time of disclosure and reduced to a
     written summary by the disclosing party within thirty (30) days after its
     oral disclosure.

10.2 During the ten (10) year period following receipt of such information, the
     receiving party shall keep, and cause its Subsidiaries, its sublicensees
     and subcontractors who have access to Confidential Information as permitted
     in this Agreement to keep any Confidential Information, including but not
     limited to Background Technology and Developed Technology provided by the
     disclosing party hereunder, in strict confidence, and shall not disclose
     such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written
     consent of the disclosing party. The receiving party shall maintain the
     Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that the
     receiving party uses to protect its own strictly confidential information,
     but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances.
     Further, the receiving party shall not use the Confidential Information for
     any purpose other than for the Development Projects, except as otherwise
     provided herein.

10.3 Each party shall not disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement to
     any third party without the prior written consent of the other party.


                                       8
<PAGE>


10.4 The confidentiality obligation set forth in Articles 10.2 and 10.3 above
     shall not apply to any information which:

     (a)  is already known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure;

     (b)  is or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party;

     (c)  is rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party
          without any restriction on disclosure;

     (d)  is independently developed by the receiving party;

     (e)  is disclosed with the prior written consent of the disclosing party
          hereto; or

     (f)  is disclosed pursuant to applicable laws, regulations or court order,
          provided that the receiving party shall give the disclosing party
          prompt notice of such request so that the disclosing party has an
          opportunity to defend, limit or protect such disclosure.

10.5 Each party understands that disclosure or dissemination of the other
     party's Confidential Information, specifically Toshiba Background
     Technology provided to SanDisk in connection with the Development Projects,
     not expressly authorized hereunder would cause irreparable injury to such
     other party, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and
     said other party shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any
     remedies the other party may have hereunder or at law. In the event SanDisk
     is to enter into any joint development work with any third party, SanDisk
     warrants that Toshiba Background Technology provided to SanDisk in
     connection with the Development Projects shall neither be used for such
     joint development work nor be disclosed to any third party unless expressly
     otherwise provided hereunder.

10.6 The Technical Coordinator of each party shall ensure that the other party's
     Technical Coordinator are informed of and receive in sufficient detail and
     completeness the Background and Developed Technology that are exchanged
     under Article 2 hereof. Each Technical Coordinator shall also monitor
     within their company the distribution of Confidential Information received
     from the other party only to those who have a need to know and, further, to
     assist in preventing the unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential
     Information to personnel within the company who do not have a need to know,
     or to third parties. The Technical Coordinator for each party shall
     maintain pertinent records and the like, and acknowledge the receipt from
     the other party of all Confidential Information.

     failure or breach specified in the notice has been cured during the sixty
     (60) day period. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article
     11.2 shall not relieve the breaching party from any liability arising from
     any breach of this Agreement and such termination shall be without
     prejudice to any other rights and remedies of the non-breaching party
     provided at law or in equity, in addition to the rights and remedies set
     forth in this Agreement.

11.3 Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving
     written notice to the other party upon the occurrence of any of the
     following events:

     (c)  the filing by such other party of any legal action or document seeking
          reorganization, readjustment or arrangement of its business under any
          law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency;

     (d)  the appointment of a receiver for all or substantially all of the
          property of such other party; or

     (e)  the making by such other party of any assignment of whole or
          substantial assets for the benefit of creditors.

This Agreement shall terminate on the thirtieth (30th) day after such notice of
termination is given.

11.4 In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, the rights and
     licenses granted to each party specified in Article 7 shall survive such
     termination or expiration, except that if this Agreement is terminated by
     either party for any of the events specified in Articles 11.2 and 11.3
     above, then the licenses granted to the defaulting party or the
     non-terminating party, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate. The
     provisions of Articles 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 shall survive any termination
     or expiration of this Agreement.
