                               SanDisk Corporation

              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


1.     These interim condensed  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited
       but  reflect,  in  the  opinion  of  management,   all  normal  recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of March 31, 2000,
       and the results of operations  and cash flows for the three month periods
       ended March 31, 2000 and 1999.  Because all the  disclosures  required by
       generally accepted accounting principles are not included,  these interim
       condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
       with the audited financial  statements and notes thereto in the Company's
       annual  report on Form 10-K as of, and for,  the year ended  December 31,
       1999.  The condensed  consolidated  balance sheet data as of December 31,
       1999 was derived from the audited financial statements.

       The  results of  operations  and cash flows for the three  month  periods
       ended  March  31,  2000 are not  necessarily  indicative  of  results  of
       operations and cash flows for any future period.

2.     The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31, and
       each fiscal  quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, and
       September 30. The first fiscal quarter of 2000 and 1999 ended on April 2,
       2000 and March 28, 1999, respectively.  Fiscal year 2000 is 52 weeks long
       and ends on  December  31,  2000.  Fiscal year 1999 was 53 weeks long and
       ended on January  2, 2000.  For ease of  presentation,  the  accompanying
       financial  statements  have  been  shown as ending on the last day of the
       calendar month.

3.     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4.     The components of inventory consist of the following:

       For the three month  periods  ended  March 31, 2000 and 1999,  options to
       purchase 81,564 and 21,506 shares of common stock, respectively have been
       excluded  from the  earnings  per share  calculation,  as their effect is
       antidilutive.

6.     The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and
       trade secret laws,  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements
       to protect its intellectual  property  rights.  There can be no assurance
       that there will not be any disputes regarding the Company's  intellectual
       property rights. Specifically, there can be no assurance that any patents
       held by the Company will not be invalidated,  that patents will be issued
       for any of the Company's pending  applications or that any claims allowed
       from existing or pending patents will be of sufficient  scope or strength
       or be issued in the primary countries where the Company's products can be
       sold to provide meaningful  protection or any commercial advantage to the
       Company.  Additionally,  competitors of the Company may be able to design
       around the Company's patents.

       To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be  necessary  to  initiate  litigation  with one or more third  parties,
       including  but not limited to those the Company has  notified of possible
       patent infringement.  In addition, one or more of these parties may bring
       suit against the Company.

       In March 1998,  we filed a complaint in federal  court  against Lexar for
       infringement  of a fundamental  flash memory card patent.  Lexar disputed
       this claim and asserted that our patent was invalid or unenforceable,  as
       well as asserted  various  counterclaims  including  unfair  competition,
       violation of the Lanham Act, patent misuse, interference with prospective
       economic  advantage,  trade  defamation and fraud.  We have denied all of
       these counterclaims. In July 1998, the court

                                     Page 7
<PAGE>


       denied Lexar's request to have the case dismissed. Discovery in this suit
       began in  August  1998.  On  February  22,  1999,  the  court  considered
       arguments  and papers  submitted by the parties  regarding  the scope and
       proper  interpretation  of the asserted  claims in our patent at issue in
       the Lexar  suit.  On March 4,  1999,  the court  issued its ruling on the
       proper  construction of the claim terms in our patent.  On July 30, 1999,
       we filed a motion for partial  summary  judgment that Lexar  CompactFlash
       and PC Cards contributorily  infringe our patent. In December 1999, Lexar
       filed a counter motion for partial summary judgment for invalidity of our
       patent.  Both  motions  were heard by the court on March 17,  2000 and on
       March  28,  2000 the court  found  that the  accused  Lexar  flash  cards
       contributarily  infringed  SanDisk's patent and granted  SanDisk's motion
       for partial  summary  judgement.  Additionally,  the court denied Lexar's
       summary judgement motion for non-infringement and invalidity.

       In May 1999,  Lexar  filed a  complaint  against us in federal  court for
       claims  of  unfair  competition,   false  advertising,  trade  libel  and
       intentional  and  negligent   interference   with  prospective   business
       advantage.  In Lexar's  complaint,  Lexar  alleged that  statements by us
       regarding  the  comparative  performance  of our  products and Lexar's in
       digital  cameras were false,  and further  alleged that we had interfered
       with the  certification  of certain  Lexar  products by the  CompactFlash
       Association.  On July 1,  1999,  we filed a motion to  dismiss  the Lexar
       complaint.  Also,  in July 1999,  Lexar  filed a motion  for  preliminary
       injunction  seeking  to stop  certain  advertising  practices  that Lexar
       alleges were  misleading.  On August 26, 1999,  the parties  executed and
       filed  with the  court a joint  stipulation  withdrawing  our  motion  to
       dismiss and granting Lexar  permission to amend its complaint.  Lexar has
       amended  its  complaint  to remove any  allegations  and causes of action
       based on our alleged  interference in  certification  by the CompactFlash
       Association.  On  September  17, 1999,  the court  conducted a hearing on
       Lexar's  motion for  preliminary  injunction.  On September 24, 1999, the
       court issued an order  granting a limited  preliminary  injunction  which
       enjoins us from using or  implying  certain  terminology  in  advertising
       regarding the  comparative  performance of our memory products in digital
       cameras.  On  October  1,  1999,  we filed  counterclaims  against  Lexar
       asserting  causes  of  action  including  unfair  competition  and  false
       advertising  under both federal and  California  law.  Although we cannot
       predict the ultimate  outcome of the case, we believe that Lexar's claims
       are  without  merit and that we have  meritorious  counterclaims  against
       Lexar.

       A trial  date has been set for both of these  matters  in  October  2000.
       Although we cannot predict the ultimate  outcome of the cases, we believe
       that Lexar's  claims are without merit and that  SanDisk's  counterclaims
       are meritorious.

       On March 21, 2000,  Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. (Mitsubishi Electric) filed
       a complaint in Tokyo  District  Court  against  SanDisk  K.K.,  SanDisk's
       wholly-owned  subsidiary  in Japan.  The  complaint  alleges that SanDisk
       K.K., based in Yokohama,  Japan,  infringes on three Mitsubishi  Japanese
       patents.  The Mitsubishi  patents in question are #JP2099342,  #JP2129071
       and # JP2138047. Based on preliminary information,  SanDisk believes that
       these patents are related  primarily to the  mechanical  construction  of
       memory  cards  built  with  a  separate  connector.   In  the  complaint,
       Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary  injunction halting the sale
       of SanDisk CompactFlash and flash ATA memory cards in Japan. Although the
       Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the case, it believes that
       Mitsubishi's  claims are without merit. The Company and SanDisk K.K. will
       vigorously defend itself against  Mitsubishi's claims. From time to time,
       the Company has been  contacted by various  parties who have alleged that
       certain of the Company's  products  infringe on patents that such parties
       claim to hold.  To date no legal  actions  have been filed in  connection
       with any such infringement, other than as discussed above.

       In the event of an adverse  result in any such  litigation,  the  Company
       could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture,  use
       and sale of infringing products,  expend significant resources to develop
       non-infringing   technology   or  obtain   licenses  to  the   infringing
       technology, or discontinue the use of certain processes.

       From  time to  time  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  certain  of its
       suppliers  and customers for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances include

                                     Page 8
<PAGE>


       indemnification  for damages and expenses,  including attorneys fees. The
       Company  may from time to time be  engaged in  litigation  as a result of
       such   indemnification   obligations.   Third  party  claims  for  patent
       infringement  are excluded  from coverage  under the Company's  insurance
       policies.  There  can be no  assurance  that  any  future  obligation  to
       indemnify the Company's customers or suppliers,  will not have a material
       adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results
       of operations.

       Compaq Corporation has opposed in several countries, including the United
       States, our attempting to register CompactFlash as a trademark. We do not
       believe that our failure to obtain registration for the CompactFlash mark
       will materially harm our business.

       Litigation  frequently involves substantial  expenditures and can require
       significant   management  attention,   even  if  the  Company  ultimately
       prevails.  In  addition,  the  results  of  any  litigation  matters  are
       inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of
       the foregoing matters, or any future litigation, will not have a material
       adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results
       of operations.

7.     Certain of the Company's balance sheet accounts and purchase  commitments
       are denominated in Japanese Yen. The Company enters into foreign exchange
       contracts to hedge against  changes in foreign  currency  exchange rates.
       The effects of movements in currency  exchange rates on these instruments
       are  recognized  when the related  operating  revenues  and  expenses are
       recognized. The impact of movements in currency exchange rates on foreign
       exchange  contracts  substantially  mitigates  the related  impact on the
       underlying  items hedged.  At March 31, 2000,  forward  contracts  with a
       notional amount of $16.2 million were  outstanding.  In the first quarter
       of 2000, the Company had a net foreign currency  transaction gain of $0.5
       million,  primarily  due to  transaction  gains on its Japanese yen based
       assets.

8.     Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  presented in the  accompanying
       balance sheet consists of the accumulated  unrealized  gains and loses on
       available-for-sale marketable securities, net of the related tax effects,
       for all periods presented.

9.     On May 9, 2000,  the Company  signed a definitive  agreement with Toshiba
       providing for the joint  development and manufacturing of 512 megabit and
       1 gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card  controllers.
       Further,  the  Company and  Toshiba  will form and fund a joint  venture,
       FlashVision LLC, to equip and operate a silicon wafer  manufacturing line
       in Virginia.  The cost of equipping the Virginia wafer manufacturing line
       is estimated at between $700 million and $800  million.  The Company,  as
       part of its 50% ownership of the joint  venture,  expects to invest up to
       $150 million in cash and, if necessary,  guarantee  equipment lease lines
       for an additional $250 million.  The Company does not expect any material
       revenues from the 512 megabit  technology  for at least one year and from
       the 1  gigabit  technology  for at least  two  years.  The  agreement  is
       expected

       to close no later than June 30, 2000,  pending  satisfactory  completion
       of due diligence by SanDisk and Toshiba.

10.    On January 3, 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into UMC. The Company had
       invested  $51.2  million in USIC.  In exchange for its USIC  shares,  the
       Company  received  111 million UMC  shares.  These  shares were valued at
       approximately  $396  million at the time of the  merger,  resulting  in a
       pretax gain of $344.2 million ($203.9 million after-tax).  All of the UMC
       shares  received  by the  Company  are  subject to  trading  restrictions
       imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock  Exchange.  The trading  restrictions
       will  expire on  one-half  of the shares on July 3, 2000.  The  remaining
       shares will become available for sale over a two year period beginning in
       January 2002. When the shares are ultimately  sold, it is likely that the
       Company will report additional gains or losses.

       The 50% of the  shares  that  will  become  unrestricted  in 2000 will be
       treated  as  available-for-sale  securities  under  FASB 115 at March 31,
       2000.  At March 31, 2000,  these shares were adjusted to market value and
       the resulting  unrealized net gain of $10.1 million  dollars was included
       in other comprehensive income. The remaining 50% of the shares, that will
       be  restricted  from sale  until  2002,  will be  accounted  for at their
       historical  cost. In April 2000,  UMC  announced a stock  dividend of 200
       shares for every 1000 shares of UMC owned,  resulting in our ownership of
       22 million shares additional shares of UMC.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

    Certain  statements  in this  discussion  and analysis  are forward  looking
statements  based  on  current  expectations,   and  entail  various  risks  and
uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from those
expressed in such forward looking  statements.  Such risks and uncertainties are
discussed  below and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999 under
the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results."  Readers are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as
of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to update these forward  looking
statements to reflect events or  circumstances  occurring after the date hereof.
The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with our  consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

    SanDisk  was  founded in 1988 to  develop  and  market  flash  data  storage
systems.   We   sell   our   products   to   the   consumer    electronics   and
industrial/communications   markets.  In  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2000,
approximately  70%of  our  product  sales  were  attributable  to  the  consumer
electronics market, particularly sales of CompactFlash for use in digital camera
applications.  Our  CompactFlash  products have lower average selling prices and
gross margins than our higher  capacity  FlashDisk and FlashDrive  products.  In
addition,  a substantial portion of our CompactFlash  products are sold into the
retail  channel,  which usually has shorter  customer order  lead-times than our
other  channels.  A  majority  of our  sales to the  retail  channel  are  turns
business,  with orders  received  and  fulfilled  in the same  quarter,  thereby
decreasing  our ability to  accurately  forecast  future  production  needs.  We
believe  sales to the consumer  market will  continue to represent a majority of
our sales as the popularity of consumer applications, including digital cameras,
increases.

    Our  operating  results are  affected by a number of factors  including  the
volume of  product  sales,  availability  of  foundry  capacity,  variations  in
manufacturing   cycle   times,   fluctuations   in   manufacturing   yields  and
manufacturing utilization, the timing of significant orders, competitive pricing
pressures,  our  ability to match  supply  with  demand,  changes in product and
customer mix,  market  acceptance  of new or enhanced  versions of our products,
changes in the channels  through which our products are  distributed,  timing of
new product  announcements  and  introductions  by us and our  competitors,  the
timing of license and royalty revenues, fluctuations in product costs, increased
research and development expenses, and exchange rate fluctuations.  In addition,
as  the  proportion  of our  products  sold  for  use  in  consumer  electronics
applications increases,  our revenues may become subject to seasonal declines in
the first quarter of each year.  See "Factors  That May Affect Future  Results -
Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly Which May Adversely Affect Our
Stock Price" and "-There is Seasonality in Our Business."

    Beginning  in late  1995,  we  adopted a  strategy  of  licensing  our flash
technology,   including   our  patent   portfolio,   to  selected   third  party
manufacturers  of  flash  products.   To  date,  we  have  entered  into  patent
cross-license   agreements  with  several   companies,   and  intend  to  pursue
opportunities to enter into additional licenses.  Our current license agreements
provide for the payment of license fees,  royalties,  or a combination  thereof.
The timing and amount of these payments can vary  substantially  from quarter to
quarter  depending on the terms of each agreement and, in some cases, the timing
of sales of  products  by the other  parties.  As a result,  license and royalty
revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to
fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high gross margins associated with
license  and  royalty  revenues,  gross  margins  and net  income  are likely to
fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in
product revenues.

    We market our  products  using a direct  sales  organization,  distributors,
manufacturers'  representatives,  private label partners, OEMs and retailers. We
expect that sales through the retail  channel will comprise an increasing  share
of total  revenues in the future,  and that a  substantial  portion of our sales
into the retail channel will be made to participants that will have the right to
return unsold products.  We do not recognize revenues from these sales until the
products are sold to the end customers.


                                    Page 11
<PAGE>


    Historically,  a  majority  of our sales  have  been to a limited  number of
customers. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers
will continue to account for a substantial  portion of our product  revenues for
the foreseeable  future.  We have also  experienced  significant  changes in the
composition  of our  customer  base from year to year and expect this pattern to
continue as market demand for our customers' products  fluctuates.  The loss of,
or significant reduction in purchases by major customers,  could have a material
adverse effect on our business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
See  "Factors  That May  Affect  Future  Results  - Sales to a Small  Number  of
Customers Represent a Significant Portion of Our Revenues" and "Business - Sales
and Distribution."

    All of our products require silicon wafers, which are currently manufactured
by  UMC  in   Taiwan.   Industry-wide   demand  for   semiconductors   increased
significantly  in 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, due to increased demand in
the consumer  electronics and cellular phone markets.  This increased  demand is
expected to continue in 2000 causing supply to become  constrained and prices to
increase.  Under our wafer supply agreements,  there are limits on the number of
wafers we can order and our  ability  to change  that  quantity  is  restricted.
Accordingly,  our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our
products is limited. If customer demand exceeds our forecasts,  we may be unable
to obtain an  adequate  supply of wafers to fill  customer  orders,  which could
result in lost sales and lower  revenues.  If we are  unable to obtain  adequate
quantities  of flash memory  wafers with  acceptable  prices and yields from our
current and future  wafer  foundries,  our  business,  financial  condition  and
results of  operations  could be harmed.  If  customer  demand  falls  below our
forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our wafer orders,  we may end
up with  excess  wafer  inventories,  which  could  result in  higher  operating
expenses and reduced gross margins.  We have from time to time taken write downs
for excess inventories.  For example, in the second quarter of 1998, our product
gross margins were negatively  impacted by such an inventory  write down.  These
adjustments  decrease  gross margins in the quarter  reported and have resulted,
and could in the future result, in fluctuations in gross margins on a quarter to
quarter  basis.  See "Factors  That May Affect  Future  Results - Our  Operating
Results May Fluctuate Significantly."

    Export  sales  are an  important  part of our  business.  Our  sales  may be
impacted by changes in economic  conditions in our  international  markets.  For
example,  in 1998,  product sales to Japan declined 19% from the prior year, due
in part to the Asian  economic  crisis.  While a majority of our  revenues  from
sales to Japan and other Asian countries are derived from OEM customers who plan
to export a portion of their  products to  countries  outside of Asia,  economic
conditions  in Asia may continue to adversely  effect our revenues to the extent
that  demand  for our  products  in Asia  declines.  Given the  recent  economic
conditions  in Asia and the  weakness of many Asian  currencies  relative to the
United States  dollar,  our products may be relatively  more  expensive in Asia,
which  could  result  in a  decrease  of our sales in that  region.  We may also
experience  pressure  on our  gross  margins  as a  result  of  increased  price
competition from Asian  competitors.  While most of our sales are denominated in
U.S.  Dollars,  we invoice  certain  Japanese  customers in Japanese Yen and are
subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these  transactions  which could affect
our business,  financial condition and results of operations.  See "Factors That
May Affect Future Results - Our  international  operations make us vulnerable to
changing conditions and currency fluctuations."

    For the foreseeable  future,  we expect to realize a significant  portion of
our revenues from recently introduced and new products.  Typically, new products
initially  have lower  gross  margins  than more  mature  products  because  the
manufacturing  yields are lower at the start of  manufacturing  each  successive
product generation. In addition, manufacturing yields are generally lower at the
start of manufacturing any product at a new foundry. To remain  competitive,  we
are  focusing on a number of programs to lower  manufacturing  costs,  including
development of future  generations of D2 flash and advanced  technology  wafers.
There can be no assurance  that we will  successfully  develop such  products or
processes or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing  costs.
In addition,  if the industry wide supply of flash memory  products grows faster
than customer  demand,  we could experience  increased price  competition in the
future,  which could result in decreased  average selling prices and lower gross
margins. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results -We Must Achieve Acceptable
Manufacturing Yields."

Results of Operations

    Product  Revenues.  Our  product  revenues  were $97.2  million in the first
quarter of 2000, up $61.3 million or 171% from the first quarter of 1999. During
the three month period ended March 31, 2000, flash memory product unit shipments
increased  168% over the same  period in 1999.  The largest  increase  came from
sales  of  CompactFlash   which  represented  50%  of  product   revenues,   and
MultiMediaCards  which  represented 15% of product  revenues for the three month
period ended March 31, 2000. Average selling prices were relatively unchanged in
the first  quarter  of 2000  compared  to the same  period  in 1999.  A shift in
product mix to higher  capacity  cards  offset a decline in the average  selling
price per megabyte of capacity shipped. Sales to the consumer market represented
approximately     70%    of    product     revenues    and    sales    to    the
telecommunications/industrial  market accounted for the remaining 30% during the
three month periods ended March 31, 2000 and 1999.  Sales to the retail  channel
represented  26% of product  revenues in the first  quarter of 2000, up from 20%
for the same period of the previous  year.  The mix of products sold varies from
quarter  to quarter  and will  continue  to vary in the  future,  affecting  our
overall average selling prices and gross margins.

    Export  sales  represented  50% of our product  revenues for the three month
period ended March 31, 2000  compared to 42% for the same period of the previous
year.  We expect  international  sales to  continue to  represent a  significant
portion of our  product  revenues.  For the three month  period  ended March 31,
2000,  our  top  ten  customers  represented  approximately  52% of our  product
revenues  compared to 61% for the same period in 1999. In the first three months
of fiscal 2000, one customer  accounted for more than 10% of product sales.  Two
customers  each  accounted for more than 10% of product sales in the first three
months of 1999.  We expect  that  sales to a limited  number of  customers  will
continue to represent a substantial  portion of our revenues for the foreseeable
future.

    License and Royalty  Revenues.  We  currently  earn patent  license fees and
royalties under several cross-license  agreements.  License and royalty revenues
from patent cross-license  agreements were $12.1 million in the first quarter of
2000,  up from  $8.2  million  in the same  period  of the  previous  year,  due
primarily  to an  increase  in royalty  revenues.  Revenues  from  licenses  and
royalties  decreased to 11% of total  revenues in the first quarter of 2000 from
19% in the first quarter of 1999.

    Gross  Profits.  In the first  quarter  of 2000,  gross  profits  were $41.6
million,  or 38% of total revenues  compared to $17.6  million,  or 40% of total
revenues in the same period of 1999.  Product  gross margin  increased to 30% of
product  revenues in the first  quarter of 2000 from 26% in the first quarter of
1999,  primarily  due to a lower cost per  megabyte  of our  128Mbit and 256Mbit
flash memory products. We plan to decrease production of our 128Mbit products in
the second quarter of 2000 as we ramp up production of our 256Mbit products. The
256Mbit flash chip has a lower  manufacturing cost per megabyte and we currently
expect it to contribute to improved product gross margins in the second quarter.
The initial  production  period of each new  generation  of flash  technology is
subject to many risks and uncertainties as described in "Factors That May Affect
Future  Results  - In  transitioning  to new  processes  and  products  we  face
production and market acceptance risks."

    Research  and  Development.   Research  and  development   expenses  consist
principally of salaries and payroll related  expenses for design and development
engineers,  prototype supplies and contract  services.  Research and development
expenses  were $8.8 million in the first quarter of 2000, up $3.6 million or 68%
from $5.2 million in the same period of 1999. This increase was primarily due to
increased  salary and  related  expenses  and  increased  depreciation  expense.
Research and development  expenses represented 8% of total revenues in the first
quarter of 2000  compared  to 12% in the first  quarter  of 1999.  We expect our
research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars to
support  the  development  and  introduction  of new  generations  of flash data
storage   products,   including   the  512Mbit  and  1  Gigabit   flash   memory
co-development  and  manufacturing  joint  venture with  Toshiba.  We expect the
incremental  research  and  development  expenses  related to the Toshiba  joint
development project to be in the range of $6.0 million to $8.0 million in fiscal
2000.


                                    Page 13
<PAGE>


    Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing  expenses include salaries,  sales
commissions,  benefits and travel  expenses for our sales,  marketing,  customer
service and  applications  engineering  personnel.  These  expenses also include
other  selling  and  marketing  expenses,  such  as  independent  manufacturer's
representative  commissions,  advertising  and  tradeshow  expenses.  Sales  and
marketing  expenses  were $10.5  million in the first  quarter of 2000,  up $5.4
million or 104% from $5.2 million in the first quarter of 1999. The increase was
primarily due to higher  commission  expenses due to increased product revenues,
increased salary and related expenses and higher marketing  expenses.  Sales and
marketing expenses represented  approximately 10% of total revenues in the first
quarter of 2000  compared to 12% in the first  quarter of 1999.  We expect sales
and  marketing  expenses  to increase  as sales of our  products  grow and as we
continue to develop the retail channel for our products.

    General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses include the
cost  of  our  finance,   information  systems,  human  resources,   shareholder
relations,  legal  and  administrative  functions.  General  and  administrative
expenses  were $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2000, up $2.4 million or 98%
from $2.4 million in the first  quarter of 1999.  The increase was primarily due
to  increased  salary and related  expenses,  an increase in the  allowance  for
doubtful accounts and increased legal expenses. For the three month period ended
March 31, 2000,  general and  administrative  expenses  represented  4% of total
revenues  compared  to 5% for the same  period in 1999.  We expect  general  and
administrative expenses to increase as our general and administrative  functions
grow to support our overall growth.  General and  administrative  expenses could
also increase substantially in the future if we continue to pursue litigation to
defend our patent portfolio. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results - Risks
Associated with Patents, Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation."

    Interest  Income.  Interest  income was $5.6 million in the first quarter of
2000 compared to $1.4 million in the first quarter of 1999. The increase in 2000
was due  primarily  to  higher  interest  income  due to the  investment  of the
proceeds  from the sale of common stock in our November  1999  follow-on  public
offering.

    Gain on Investment in Foundry. In the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a
gain of $344.2  million  as a result  of the  merger  of  United  Silicon,  Inc.
("USIC") and United Microelectronics  Corporation ("UMC"). We had invested $51.2
million in USIC. We received 111 million  shares of UMC in exchange for our USIC
shares.  These shares were valued at $396 million at the time of the merger. All
of the UMC shares are  subject  to trading  restrictions  imposed by UMC and the
Taiwan Stock Exchange.  The trading  restrictions will expire on one-half of the
shares on July 3, 2000. The remaining shares will become available for sale over
a two year period  beginning  in January  2002.  When the shares are  ultimately
sold,  it is likely that we will  report  additional  gains or losses.  In April
2000,  UMC announced a stock dividend of 200 shares for every 1000 shares of UMC
owned, resulting in our ownership of 22 million additional UMC shares.

    Other Income,  net. Other income,  net was $0.4 million in the first quarter
of 2000  compared to $0.2  million  for the same  period of the prior year.  The
increase was primarily due to increased  foreign currency  transaction  gains in
the first quarter of 2000.

    Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $8.3
million, or a 35% effective tax rate for the three month period ending March 31,
2000.  We  recorded  an  additional  tax  provision  of  $140.2  million,  or an
approximate tax rate of 41% on the gain in foundry investment. The effective tax
rate in 1999 was 33%.  The lower  effective  tax rate in 1999  reflects  greater
benefits from federal and state tax credits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    As of March 31,  2000,  we had  working  capital  of $636.5  million,  which
included  $107.6  million in cash and cash  equivalents  and  $353.1  million in
short-term  investments.  Operating  activities provided $0.2 million of cash in
the first quarter of 2000  primarily  from net income and an increase in current
liabilities  of $12.6  million,  which were  partially  offset by an increase in
accounts receivable of $26.5 million.


                                    Page 14
<PAGE>


    Net cash used in investing  activities of $44.9 million in the first quarter
of 2000  consisted of net purchases of  investments of $41.2 million and capital
equipment purchases of $3.7 million. In the first quarter of 2000, cash provided
by financing  activities of $6.1 million came  primarily from the sale of common
stock through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans.

    In May 2000, we signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba providing for the
joint  development and  manufacturing  of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory
chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers.  Further,  we and Toshiba will
form and fund a joint venture,  FlashVision  LLC, to equip and operate a silicon
wafer  manufacturing line in Virginia.  The cost of equipping the Virginia wafer
manufacturing line is estimated at between $700 million and $800 million. We, as
part of our 50%  ownership  of the  joint  venture,  expect to invest up to $150
million in cash,  and,  if  necessary,  guarantee  equipment  lease lines for an
additional  $250 million.  The agreement is expected to close no later than June
30,  2000,  pending  satisfactory  completion  of due  diligence  by SanDisk and
Toshiba.

    Depending  on the  future  demand  for our  products,  we may decide to make
additional  investments,  which  could  be  substantial,  in  assembly  and test
manufacturing  equipment  or foundry  capacity  to support  our  business in the
future.

    On January 3, 2000,  the USIC  foundry was merged  into UMC.  We  previously
invested $51.2 million in USIC. In exchange for our USIC shares, we received 111
million UMC shares.  These shares were valued at  approximately  $396 million at
the time of the merger, resulting in a pretax gain of $344 million ($204 million
after-tax). All the UMC shares we received as a result of the merger are subject
to  trading  restrictions  imposed  by UMC and the Taiwan  Stock  Exchange.  The
trading  restrictions will expire on one-half of the shares on July 3, 2000. The
remaining shares will become available for sale over a two year period beginning
in January 2002. When the shares are ultimately  sold, it is likely that we will
report  additional  gains or  losses.  To the  extent we can  liquidate  the UMC
shares,  we will plan to use such funds to support  our  operations  and capital
expenditures.

Impact of Currency Exchange Rates

    A portion of our revenues  are  denominated  in Japanese  yen. We enter into
foreign exchange forward  contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. At March 31, 2000,  forward  contracts with a notional amount of
$16.2 million were outstanding.  Future exchange rate fluctuations  could have a
material  adverse  effect on our  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

Our operating results may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our
stock price.

       Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  significantly
in the past and we expect that they will  continue to  fluctuate  in the future.
This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors, including the following:

o      unpredictable demand for our products;

o      decline in the average selling prices of our products due to
       competitive pricing pressures;

o      seasonality in sales of our products;

o      adverse changes in product and customer mix;

o      slower than anticipated  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of
       our products;

o      competing  flash memory card standards  which displace the standards used
       in our products;

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>



o      changes in our distribution channels;

o      timing of license and royalty revenue;

o      fluctuations  in  product  costs,  particularly  due to  fluctuations  in
       manufacturing yields and utilization;

o      availability  of  sufficient  silicon  wafer  foundry  capacity  to  meet
       customer demand;

o      excess  capacity  of flash  memory from our  competitors  and our own new
       flash wafer capacity;

o      significant  yield  losses  which  could  affect  our  ability to fulfill
       customer orders and could increase our costs;

o      lengthening in manufacturing  cycle times due to our suppliers  operating
       at peak capacity;

o      increased research and development expenses;

o      exchange rate fluctuations,  particularly the U.S. dollar to Japanese yen
       exchange rate;

o      changes  in general  economic  conditions,  in  particular  the  economic
       recession in Japan;

o      natural  disasters  affecting  the  countries  in  which we  conduct  our
       business, particularly Taiwan, Japan and the United States;

o      difficulty of forecasting and management of inventory levels; and

o      expenses related to obsolescence of unsold inventory.

o      Difficulty of estimating silicon wafer needs

    When we order  silicon  wafers from our  foundries,  we have to estimate the
number of silicon  wafers needed to fill product  orders several months into the
future. If we overestimate this number, we will build excess inventories,  which
could harm our gross margins and operating results.  For example,  in the second
quarter of 1998,  our  product  gross  margins  declined  to 12% from 30% in the
previous  quarter  due in part  to a write  down of  inventory  to  reflect  net
realizable  value.  If we  underestimate  the number of silicon wafers needed to
fill product  orders,  we may be unable to obtain an adequate  supply of wafers,
which could harm our product  revenues.  Because  our  largest  volume  product,
CompactFlash, is sold into an emerging consumer market, it has been difficult to
accurately forecast future sales. A substantial  majority of our quarterly sales
have  historically  been from orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter.
In addition, our product order backlog may fluctuate  substantially from quarter
to quarter.

    Anticipated growth in expense levels

    We increased our expense levels in 1999 and the first quarter of fiscal 2000
to support our growth.  We expect operating  expenses to continue to increase in
fiscal  2000 as a result of the need to hire  additional  personnel  to  support
expected growth in sales unit volumes,  sales and marketing efforts and research
and development  activities,  including our collaboration with Toshiba providing
for the joint  development of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory chips.  For
example in fiscal  2000,  the  incremental  research  and  development  expenses
related to the Toshiba joint development project are expected to be in the range
of $6 million to $8 million. In addition, we have significant fixed costs and we
cannot  readily  reduce these  expenses  over the short term. If revenues do not
increase  proportionately to operating  expenses,  or if revenues decrease or do
not meet expectations for a particular period, our business, financial condition
and results of operations will be harmed.

    Variability of average selling prices and gross margin

    Our product mix varies quarterly,  which affects our overall average selling
prices and gross margins.  Our CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard  products,  which
currently  represent  the majority of our product  revenues,  have lower average
selling  prices  and  gross  margins  than our  higher  capacity  FlashDisk  and
FlashDrive  products.  We believe that sales of CompactFlash and  MultiMediaCard
products  will  continue to represent a  significant  percentage  of our product
revenues as consumer  applications,  such as digital  cameras and Internet music
players,  become more popular.  Dependence on CompactFlash sales,  together with
lower  pricing  caused by  increased  competition,  caused  average unit selling
prices to decline  22% during  fiscal  1999  compared to a decline of 28% during
fiscal 1998.  In addition,  average  unit selling  prices  declined in the first
quarter of 2000 compared to the fourth  quarter of 1999 and we expect this trend
to continue.

    Variability of license fees and royalties

    Our intellectual  property strategy is to cross-license our patents to other
manufacturers of flash products. Under these arrangements,  we earn license fees
and  royalties  on  individually   negotiated   terms.  The  timing  of  revenue
recognition  from these  payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and
on the timing of product shipments by the third parties.  This may cause license
and royalty revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Because
these  revenues have higher gross margins than product  revenues,  gross margins
and net income  fluctuate  significantly  with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues.

In  transitioning  to new processes and products,  we face production and market
acceptance risks.

    General

       Successive  generations of our products have  incorporated  semiconductor
devices with greater memory capacity per chip. Two important factors that enable
us to decrease the costs per megabyte of our flash data storage products are the
development of higher capacity  semiconductor  devices and the implementation of
smaller  geometry  manufacturing  processes.  A number  of  challenges  exist in
achieving a lower cost per megabyte, including:

o      overcoming lower yields often  experienced in the early production of new
       semiconductor devices;

o      problems with design and  manufacturing of products that will incorporate
       these devices; and

o      production delays.

    Because our products are complex,  we  periodically  experience  significant
delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products. Similar
delays  could  occur  in the  future  and  could  harm our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

    128 megabit technology

    We began shipments of 128 megabit products in the second quarter of 1999. In
the third  quarter of 1999, we  accelerated  the  production  ramp up of our 128
megabit flash memory  technology to meet increased  demand. In the third quarter
of 1999, during the production ramp up of our 128 megabit technology, lower than
anticipated yields  contributed to a decline in gross margins.  If we experience
unplanned yield problems on our 128 megabit  technology in the future, we may be
unable  to meet our  customers'  demand  for high  capacity  MultiMediaCard  and
CompactFlash  products which could result in lost sales and reduced revenues. In
addition,  our gross  margins may be harmed by any  problems we encounter in the
production of our 128 megabit flash  memory.  We plan to decrease  production of
our 128 megabit  products in the second quarter of 2000 as we ramp up production
of our 256 megabit products.


                                    Page 17
<PAGE>


    D2 flash technology

    We have  developed new products  based on D2 flash  technology,  a new flash
architecture  designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell. High density
flash memory,  such as D2 flash,  is a complex  technology  that requires strict
manufacturing  controls and effective test screens.  Problems encountered in the
shift to volume  production for new flash products could impact both reliability
and yields,  and result in  increased  manufacturing  costs and reduced  product
availability.  We may not be able to  manufacture  future  generations of our D2
products with yields sufficient to result in lower costs per megabyte. In fiscal
2000,  we  expect  to  increase  production  of our  256  megabit  flash  memory
technology, which has a lower cost per megabyte than the 128 megabit technology.
If we are unable to bring  future  generations  of our 256 megabit  flash memory
into full  production as quickly as planned or if we experience  unplanned yield
problems,  we will not be able to meet our customers'  forecasted demand,  which
would result in lost sales, reduced revenues and reduced margins.

    MultiMediaCard products

    The MultiMediaCard  presents new challenges in assembly and testing.  In the
third quarter of 1999, during the  MultiMediaCard  production  startup phase, we
experienced   fluctuations  in  yields  which  reduced   MultiMediaCard  product
availability, increased manufacturing costs and reduced product margins for this
product  family.  We are  currently  unable  to meet  all  customer  demand  for
MultiMediaCard products.  Future yield problems with our MultiMediaCard products
could result in lost sales and reduced revenues. In addition,  our gross margins
may  be  harmed  by  any  problems  we  encounter  in  the   production  of  our
MultiMediaCard products.

    Secure Digital Memory Card products

    In the third  quarter of 1999,  we announced a memorandum  of  understanding
under which we,  along with  Matsushita  and Toshiba,  will jointly  develop and
promote the Secure  Digital  Memory Card.  The Secure  Digital Memory Card is an
enhanced version of our MultiMediaCard  that will incorporate  advanced security
and  copyright  protection  features  required by the  emerging  markets for the
electronic  distribution of music,  video and other copyrighted works. We expect
to begin  shipping our Secure Digital Memory Card products in the second quarter
of 2000.  Negotiations for a definitive  agreement concerning this collaboration
are underway, and are expected to be concluded in the second quarter.

    The Secure  Digital  Memory Card will  incorporate a number of new features,
including  SDMI  compliant  security and copy  protection,  a  mechanical  write
protect  switch and a high data  transfer  rate.  We have never  built  products
incorporating these features. Any problems or delays in establishing  production
capabilities or ramping up production  volumes of our Secure Digital Memory Card
products could result in lost sales or increased manufacturing costs in 2000. In
addition,  we cannot be sure that manufacturers of consumer  electronic products
will  develop  new  products  that use the Secure  Digital  Memory  Card or that
content  providers  such  as  music  studios  will  agree  to  distribute  their
copyrighted  content for storage on Secure  Digital  Memory Cards.  Furthermore,
there is no assurance  that  consumers  will widely adopt Secure  Digital Memory
Cards because of the requirement to purchase  copyrighted  content.  Conversely,
broad  acceptance  of our Secure  Digital  Memory Card by  consumers  may reduce
demand for our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash card products. See "--The success
of our business depends on emerging markets and new products."

We depend on third party foundries for silicon wafers.

       All of our products  require silicon wafers.  We rely on UMC in Taiwan to
supply all of our silicon wafers.  We depend on UMC to allocate a portion of its
capacity  to our  needs,  produce  acceptable  quality  wafers  with  acceptable
manufacturing  yields and deliver our wafers on a timely basis at a  competitive
price. If UMC is unable to satisfy these requirements,  our business,  financial
condition and operating results may suffer. For example, in September 1999, both
UMC foundries  producing  our flash memory  wafers were damaged and  temporarily
shut down by an earthquake in Taiwan. Future earthquakes, aftershocks or other

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>


natural  disasters in Taiwan could preclude us from obtaining an adequate supply
of wafers to fill customer orders,  and could  significantly  harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

    Industry-wide  demand for semiconductor  wafers has increased  significantly
due to increased demand in the consumer  electronics and cellular phone markets.
Increased demand for advanced  technology silicon wafers is increasing the price
of these wafers as supply becomes constrained.  We expect this trend to continue
throughout 2000 and possibly through 2001, which could adversely impact the rate
of growth of our business, either through reduced supply, higher wafer prices or
a combination of the two.

     In January 2000,  the USIC foundry was merged into UMC.  Before the merger,
we owned 10% of USIC,  had the right to appoint  one of its  directors  and were
entitled to 12.5% of its total wafer  production.  As a result of the merger, we
received UMC shares in exchange for our USIC shares.  However,  we do not have a
right to a seat on the  board of  directors  of the  combined  company.  We have
received  assurances  from  the  senior  management  of UMC that it  intends  to
continue to supply us the same wafer  capacity at the prices we currently  enjoy
under our agreement with USIC.  However,  there can be no assurance that we will
be  able  to  maintain  our  current  wafer  capacity  and  competitive  pricing
arrangement in our future supply negotiations with UMC.

    Under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with UMC, we are obligated to
provide a rolling  forecast  of  anticipated  purchase  orders  for the next six
calendar  months.  Generally,  the  estimates for the first three months of each
forecast are binding  commitments.  The estimates  for the remaining  months may
only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month's forecast. This
limits our  ability to react to  fluctuations  in demand for our  products.  For
example,  if  customer  demand  falls  below our  forecast  and we are unable to
reschedule  or  cancel  our  wafer  orders,  we may  end up  with  excess  wafer
inventories,  which could result in higher operating  expenses and reduced gross
margins.  Conversely, if customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we may be unable
to obtain an  adequate  supply of wafers to fill  customer  orders,  which could
result in dissatisfied customers, lost sales and lower revenues. In addition, in
February 2000, we entered into a capacity and reservation deposit agreement with
UMC. To reserve additional foundry capacity under this agreement,  we paid UMC a
reservation  deposit.  This deposit will be refunded to us on a quarterly basis,
over the agreement term, if we purchase the full wafer capacity reserved for us.
We may  forfeit  part of our  deposit if we are unable to utilize  our  reserved
capacity within four quarters of the end of the agreement term. If we are unable
to obtain  scheduled  quantities of wafers with acceptable price and yields from
any foundry,  our business,  financial condition and results of operations could
be harmed.

The success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products.

     In order for demand for our products to grow,  the markets for new products
that use  CompactFlash  and the  MultiMediaCard,  such as portable digital music
players and smart phones,  must develop and grow. If sales of these  products do
not grow, our revenues and profit margins could level off or decline.

     Because  we sell  our  products  for use in many  new  applications,  it is
difficult to forecast demand.  For example,  in 1999, demand for our 32 megabyte
capacity  MultiMediaCard  for use in portable  digital music players grew faster
than anticipated and we were unable to fill all customer orders during the year.
Although we are increasing production of the MultiMediaCard, if we are unable to
fulfill  customer demand for these products in the future,  we may lose sales to
our competitors.

      Secure Digital Memory Card products

    In the third  quarter of 1999, we announced a  collaboration  under which we
will jointly develop the Secure Digital Memory Card, an enhanced  version of our
MultiMediaCard,   which  will  incorporate   advanced   security  and  copyright
protection  features  required  by  the  emerging  markets  for  the  electronic
distribution  of music,  video and other  copyrighted  works. We expect to begin
shipping  customer  samples  of our  Secure  Digital  Memory  Cards in 32 and 64
megabyte  capacities in the second  quarter of 2000.  The Secure  Digital Memory
Card is slightly thicker and uses a different interface than our MultiMediaCard.

                                    Page 19
<PAGE>

Because of these  differences,  the Secure  Digital Memory Card will not work in
current products that include a MultiMediaCard slot. In order for the market for
our Secure Digital Memory Card to develop,  manufacturers of digital audio/video
and  portable  computing  products  must  include a Secure  Digital  Memory Card
compatible  slot in  their  products  and  acquire  a  license  to the  security
algorithms. If OEMs do not incorporate Secure Digital Memory Card slots in their
products or do not buy our Secure Digital Memory Cards, our business,  financial
condition and results of operations  may be harmed.  In addition,  consumers may
postpone or altogether  forego buying  products that utilize our  MultiMediaCard
and CompactFlash cards in anticipation of new products that will incorporate the
Secure  Digital  Memory Card. If this occurs,  sales of our  MultiMediaCard  and
CompactFlash products may be harmed. The main competition for the Secure Digital
Memory  Card  is  expected  to  come  from  the  Sony  Memory  Stick.  Sony  has
substantially  greater  financial and other  resources  than we do and extensive
marketing and sales  channels and brand  recognition.  We cannot assure you that
our  Secure  Digital  Memory  Card  will  be  successful  in the  face  of  such
competition.

     In addition,  the market for portable digital music players is very new and
it is uncertain how quickly consumer demand for these players will grow. If this
market  does  not  grow as  quickly  as  anticipated  or our  customers  are not
successful in selling  their  portable  digital music players to consumers,  our
revenues could be adversely affected. In addition, it is often the case with new
consumer  markets  that after an  initial  period of new  market  formation  and
initial acceptance by early adopters,  the market enters a period of slow growth
as standards emerge and infrastructure  develops.  In the event that this occurs
in the portable digital music player market or other emerging markets,  sales of
our products would be harmed.

    The  success of our new  product  strategy  will  depend  upon,  among other
things, the following:

o      our ability to  successfully  develop  new  products  with higher  memory
       capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte;

o      the development of new applications or markets for our flash data storage
       products;

o      the extent to which prospective  customers design our products into their
       products and successfully introduce their products; and

o      the extent to which our  products  or  technologies  become  obsolete  or
       noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others.

    512 megabit and 1 gigabit scale flash memory card products

    In May 2000, we signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba providing for the
joint  development  and  manufacture  of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit  flash memory
chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. As part of this collaboration,
we and Toshiba plan to employ  Toshiba's future 0.16 micron and 0.13 micron NAND
flash integrated circuit manufacturing  technology and SanDisk's multilevel cell
flash and controller  system  technology.  The  development of 512 megabit and 1
gigabit  flash  memory  chips and Secure  Digital  Memory  Card  controllers  is
expected to be complex and incorporates  SanDisk and Toshiba  technology that is
still  under  development.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  we and  Toshiba  will
successfully  develop these new products or the underlying  technology,  or that
any development will be completed in a timely or  cost-effective  manner.  If we
are not successful in any of the above,  our business,  financial  condition and
results of operations could suffer.

We may be unable to maintain market share.

    We may be unable to increase our production  volumes at a sufficiently rapid
rate so as to maintain our market share. Ultimately,  our growth rate depends on
our ability to obtain  sufficient  flash memory  wafers and other  components to
meet demand. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may lose market

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>


share to our competitors.  Currently, our supply constraints are forcing some of
our largest  customers to seek alternate sources of supply to meet their growing
flash memory product needs.

Our selling  prices may be affected by future excess  capacity in the market for
flash memory products.

    Currently  industry  wide demand for flash  memory  products far exceeds the
available  supply.  This is  primarily  driven by an  explosion in the growth of
cellular phones and internet  appliances and the accelerating  shift in consumer
electronics  from analog to digital  devices.  This strong demand had manifested
itself in improved  bookings  visibility and a more stable pricing  environment.
All major flash memory  suppliers,  including  SanDisk,  are  responding to this
strong demand by  significantly  increasing  investments  in new advanced  flash
memory production  capacity due to the broadly held assumption that our industry
is entering a prolonged  growth phase which will be able to absorb the new flash
production output. If this assumption should prove to be erroneous, or if one or
several of our target markets experience delays in anticipated growth, there may
be excess  supply in market for our  products.  This  excess  capacity,  even if
temporary in nature,  could cause average selling prices to drop  significantly,
thereby  adversely  impacting our product gross margins and operating results in
future quarters.

Our  international  operations  make us  vulnerable to changing  conditions  and
currency fluctuations.

    Political risks

    Currently,  all of our flash memory wafers are produced by two UMC foundries
in Taiwan.  We also use a third-party  subcontractor  in Taiwan for the assembly
and testing of our MultiMediaCard  products. We may therefore be affected by the
political,  economic  and  military  conditions  in Taiwan.  Taiwan is currently
engaged in various political  disputes with China and in the past both countries
have conducted military exercises in or near the other's  territorial waters and
airspace.  The Taiwanese and Chinese  governments  may escalate these  disputes,
resulting  in an economic  embargo,  a  disruption  in  shipping  routes or even
military  hostilities.  This could harm our business by interrupting or delaying
the production or shipment of flash memory wafers or MultiMediaCard  products by
our Taiwanese  foundries and  subcontractor.  See "-- We depend on our suppliers
and third party subcontractors."

    In addition,  in the second  quarter of 1999,  we began using a  third-party
subcontractor  in  China  for  the  assembly  and  testing  of our  CompactFlash
products.  As a result, our business could be harmed by the effect of political,
economic,  legal and other uncertainties in China. Under its current leadership,
the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the
encouragement   of  foreign   trade  and   investment   and   greater   economic
decentralization.  The  Chinese  government  may not  continue  to pursue  these
policies and, even if it does  continue,  these  policies may not be successful.
The Chinese government may also significantly  alter these policies from time to
time. In addition,  China does not  currently  have a  comprehensive  and highly
developed  legal  system,   particularly  with  respect  to  the  protection  of
intellectual  property rights.  As a result,  enforcement of existing and future
laws and contracts is uncertain,  and the  implementation  and interpretation of
such laws may be  inconsistent.  Such  inconsistency  could  lead to piracy  and
degradation of our intellectual property protection.

    Economic risks

    We price our products  primarily in U.S. dollars.  As a result, if the value
of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies,  our products could
become less competitive in international  markets. For example, our products are
relatively  more  expensive  in Asia  because  of the  weakness  of  many  Asian
currencies relative to the US dollar. In addition,  we currently invoice some of
our  customers  in Japanese  yen.  Therefore,  fluctuations  in the Japanese yen
against the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and results
of  operations.  Similarly,  the weakness of the Euro may make our products less
competitive in Europe relative to Japanese flash memory suppliers.


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>


    Our sales are also highly  dependent  upon global  economic  conditions.  In
fiscal 1998,  sales to Japan declined to 31.6% of total product sales from 38.1%
in 1997.  In 1999,  sales to Japan  represented  22.4% of  product  revenue.  We
believe these declines were primarily due to the Japanese recession.

    General risks

Our international  business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any
of the following factors:

o      the need to comply with foreign government regulation;

o      general  geopolitical  risks such as political and economic  instability,
       potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;

o      natural  disasters  affecting  the  countries  in  which we  conduct  our
       business, particularly Taiwan and Japan;

o      imposition  of  regulatory  requirements,   tariffs,  import  and  export
       restrictions and other barriers and restrictions, particularly in China;

o      longer  payment  cycles and greater  difficulty  in  accounts  receivable
       collection,  particularly  as we  increase  our sales  through the retail
       distribution channel;

o      potentially adverse tax consequences;

o      less protection of our intellectual property rights; and

o      delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions.


We depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors.

    We rely on our vendors, some of which are sole source suppliers, for several
of our critical components. We do not have long-term supply agreements with some
of these vendors. Our business,  financial condition and operating results could
be harmed by delays or  reductions  in  shipments  if we are  unable to  develop
alternative  sources or obtain sufficient  quantities of these  components.  For
example,  we rely on UMC for all of our flash  memory  wafers  and NEC to supply
certain  designs of  microcontrollers.  In September  1999,  both UMC  foundries
producing our flash memory wafers were damaged and  temporarily  shut down by an
earthquake in Taiwan.  In addition,  due to industry-wide  increasing demand for
semiconductors, we have recently experienced resistance to price reductions from
some of our important  suppliers.  See "--We depend on third party foundries for
silicon wafers." We have begun to experience longer order lead times on standard
components  due to high  industry  demand.  Shortages  of any of these  standard
components could result in higher  manufacturing  costs or lower revenues due to
production delays or reduced product shipments. Additionally, where possible, we
are building buffer inventories of critical components.  If we accumulate excess
inventories or these buffer inventories  become obsolete,  we will have to write
down  inventories  which will adversely  affect our gross margins and results of
operations.

    We also rely on third-party  subcontractors  to assemble and test the memory
components  for  our  products.  We  have  no  long-term  contracts  with  these
subcontractors  and cannot directly  control product  delivery  schedules.  This
could lead to  product  shortages  or quality  assurance  problems  which  could
increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our
operating results.

    During the second half of 1999,  we  transferred  a  substantial  portion of
wafer testing,  packaged memory final testing, card assembly and card testing to
Silicon Precision  Industries Co., Ltd. in Taiwan and Celestica,  Inc. in China.
In the second  quarter of 2000, we will begin using an additional  subcontractor
in

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>


the  Philippines  for card assembly and testing.  In fiscal 2000, we expect that
they will be  assembling  and  testing a  majority  of our  mature,  high-volume
products.  This  increased  reliance  on  subcontractors  is  expected to reduce
manufacturing costs and give us access to increased production capacity.  During
the  transition  period,  we will  continue  full  operations  at our  Sunnyvale
production  facility  while  simultaneously   transferring  test  equipment  and
training  personnel of our  subcontractors.  However,  we do not have sufficient
duplicative production testing equipment at Sunnyvale and at our subcontractors.
Therefore,  any significant  problems in this complex transfer of operations may
result in a disruption of production  and a shortage of product to meet customer
demand in the first half of 2000 and beyond.

Continuing  declines in our average  sales  prices may result in declines in our
gross margins.

     In 1999,  the average  unit  selling  prices of our  products  declined 22%
compared to 1998. In 1999, the average price per megabyte  shipped  declined 52%
compared  to 1998.  Because  flash data  storage  markets are  characterized  by
intense  competition and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet
consumer  price points,  we expect that  market-driven  pricing  pressures  will
continue.  This will likely result in a further  decline in average sales prices
for our products.  We believe that we can offset declining  average sales prices
by achieving  manufacturing  cost  reductions  and  developing new products that
incorporate more advanced technology,  include more advanced features and can be
sold at stable  average  gross  margins  despite  continued  declines in average
selling  price per  megabyte.  However,  if we are unable to  achieve  such cost
reductions  and  technological  advances,  this  could  result in lost sales and
declining gross margins, and as a result, our business,  financial condition and
results of operations could suffer.

    The  semiconductor  industry is cyclical and we believe it is currently in a
recovery from one of its most severe down cycles.  During most of 1997 and 1998,
the semiconductor  industry  experienced  significant  production over capacity,
which reduced margins for substantially  all flash memory suppliers.  Currently,
the markets for our products are supply  constrained and our selling prices have
stayed  relatively  stable.  There  can be no  assurance  that this  trend  will
continue throughout 2000.

Our markets are highly competitive.

      Flash memory manufacturers and memory card assemblers

    We compete  in an  industry  characterized  by  intense  competition,  rapid
technological  changes,  evolving industry standards,  declining average selling
prices  and rapid  product  obsolescence.  Our  competitors  include  many large
domestic and international  companies that have greater access to advanced wafer
foundry capacity,  substantially  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing and
other resources,  broader product lines and longer standing  relationships  with
customers. Our primary competitors include:

o   storage  flash chip  producers,  such as Hitachi Ltd.,  Samsung  Electronics
    Company Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation;

o   socket  flash,  linear flash and component  manufacturers,  such as Advanced
    Micro  Devices,  Inc.,  Atmel  Corporation,   Intel  Corporation,   Macronix
    International  Co., Ltd., Micron  Technology,  Inc.,  Mitsubishi  Electronic
    Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corporation and STMicroelectronics NV; and

o   module or card  assemblers,  such as Lexar  Media,  Inc.,  M-Systems,  Inc.,
    Pretec Electronics Corp., Simple Technology Inc., Sony Corporation, Kingston
    Technology Company,  Panasonic Consumer Electronic Company,  Silicon Storage
    Technology, Inc., TDK Corporation,  Matsushita Battery, Inc. Delkin Devices,
    Inc., Silicon Tek and Viking Components,  Inc., who combine  controllers and
    flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards.

In  addition,  over  25  companies  have  been  certified  by  the  CompactFlash
Association to manufacture and sell their own brand of CompactFlash.  We believe
additional manufacturers will enter the CompactFlash market in the future.

                                    Page 23

    We have announced a memorandum of understanding  under which we,  Matsushita
and Toshiba will jointly develop and promote a next generation flash memory card
called the Secure  Digital  Memory Card.  Under this  agreement,  Secure Digital
Memory Card licenses  will be granted to other flash memory card  manufacturers,
which  will  increase  the  competition  for our  Secure  Digital  Memory  Card,
CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard  products.  In addition,  Matsushita and Toshiba
will sell  Secure  Digital  Memory  Cards that will  compete  directly  with our
products.  While other flash card  manufacturers  will be required to pay the SD
Association  license fees and royalties which will be shared between Matsushita,
Toshiba and SanDisk,  there will be no  royalties or license fees payable  among
the three  companies for their  respective  sales of the Secure  Digital  Memory
Card. Thus, we will forfeit  potential royalty income from Secure Digital Memory
Card sales by Matsushita and Toshiba.

    In May 2000, we signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba providing for the
joint  development  and  manufacture  of 512 megabit and 1 gigabit  flash memory
chips and Secure  Digital  Memory Card  controllers.  We and  Toshiba  will each
separately  market and sell any products  developed and manufactured  under this
relationship.  Accordingly,  we will compete  directly with Toshiba for sales of
these advanced chips and controllers.

    We have entered  into patent  cross-license  agreements  with several of our
leading competitors including,  Hitachi, Samsung, Toshiba, Intel, SST and Sharp.
Under  these  agreements,  each party may  manufacture  and sell  products  that
incorporate  technology  covered by the other party's  patents  related to flash
memory  devices.  As we  continue  to  license  our  patents  to  certain of our
competitors,  competition  will  increase and may harm our  business,  financial
condition  and results of  operations.  Currently,  we are engaged in  licensing
discussions with several of our  competitors.  There can be no assurance that we
will be  successful  in concluding  licensing  agreements  under terms which are
favorable to us.

    Alternative storage media

    Competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that
are different  from our  CompactFlash  and  MultiMediaCard  products,  including
Toshiba's  SmartMedia,  Sony Corporation's  Memory Stick, Sony's standard floppy
disk used for digital storage in its Mavica digital  cameras,  Panasonic's  Mega
Storage cards, Iomega's Clik drive, a miniaturized,  mechanical,  removable disk
drive and M-Systems' Diskonchip for embedded storage applications and the Secure
MultiMediaCard   from  Hitachi  and  Infineon.   Each   competing   standard  is
mechanically   and    electronically    incompatible   with   CompactFlash   and
MultiMediaCard.   If  a  manufacturer  of  digital  cameras  or  other  consumer
electronic  devices  designs in one of these  alternative  competing  standards,
CompactFlash or MultiMediaCard will be eliminated from use in that product.

    In September 1998, IBM introduced the microdrive, a rotating disk drive in a
Type II CompactFlash  format.  This product  competes  directly with our Type II
CompactFlash memory cards, for use in high-end  professional digital cameras. In
October 1998,  M-Systems  introduced  their  Diskonchip 2000 Millennium  product
which  competes   against  our  Flash  ChipSet   products  in  embedded  storage
applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances.

    According to  independent  industry  analysts,  Sony's Mavica digital camera
captured a considerable  portion of the United States market for digital cameras
in 1998 and 1999. The Mavica uses a standard floppy disk to store digital images
and  therefore  uses no  CompactFlash,  or any  other  flash  cards.  Our  sales
prospects for CompactFlash  cards have been adversely impacted by the success of
the Mavica.  Recently, Sony has shifted its focus to the use of its flash Memory
Stick in its latest digital camera models.

    Our  MultiMediaCard  products also have faced  significant  competition from
Toshiba's  SmartMedia  flash cards and we expect to face  similarly  significant
competition from Sony's Memory Stick.  Sony has licensed its proprietary  memory
stick to other companies. If it is adopted and achieves widespread use in future
products,  sales of our  MultiMediaCard  and CompactFlash  products may decline.
Recently,  Hitachi,  Infineon,  Sanyo and Fujitsu  have  proposed  their  Secure
MultiMediaCard which provides the copy

                                    Page 24
<PAGE>


protection  function that is included in our Secure Digital Memory Card.  Should
this  initiative  gain industry wide  acceptance,  it may reduce the  widespread
adoption of the Secure Digital Memory Card.

    In the first  quarter  of 2000,  Sanyo  announced  that it is  developing  a
miniature  magneto-optical  storage  device for use in future  digital  cameras,
music players and  camcorders.  There can be no assurance  that this device will
not be adopted by some of our OEM customers.

    Alternative flash technologies

    We also face  competition  from  products  based on  multilevel  cell  flash
technology  such as Intel's 64 megabit  and 128  megabit  StrataFlash  chips and
Hitachi's 256 megabit  multilevel cell flash chip.  These products  compete with
our  D2  multilevel   cell  flash   technology.   Multilevel  cell  flash  is  a
technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of
information  instead  of the  traditional  single  bit  stored  by the  industry
standard flash technology.  In the second quarter of 1999, Intel announced their
new  128  megabit  multilevel  cell  chip  and  Hitachi  is  currently  shipping
CompactFlash  and  MultiMediaCard  products  employing their multilevel cell 256
megabit flash chip. In addition,  Toshiba has begun customer shipments of 32 and
64  megabyte  SmartMedia  cards  employing  their new 256  megabit  flash  chip.
Although Toshiba has not incorporated  multilevel cell flash technology in their
256 megabit flash chip, their use of more advanced lithographic design rules may
allow them to achieve a more  competitive  cost  structure  than that of our 256
megabit D2 flash chip.

    Furthermore,  we expect to face  competition  from existing  competitors and
from other  companies  that may enter our  existing or future  markets that have
similar  or  alternative  data  storage  solutions  which may be less  costly or
provide  additional  features.  Price is an important  competitive factor in the
market for consumer  products.  Increased  price  competition  could lower gross
margins if our average  selling prices  decrease faster than our costs and could
also result in lost sales.

Our business depends upon consumer products.

    In 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, we received more product  revenue and
shipped more units of products destined for consumer  electronics  applications,
principally  digital cameras,  than for any other  application.  We believe that
these products will encounter  intense  competition  and be more price sensitive
than products  sold into our other target  markets.  In addition,  we must spend
more on  marketing  and  promotion in consumer  markets to establish  brand name
recognition and preference.

    A significant  portion of sales to the consumer  electronics  market is made
through  distributors and to retailers.  Sales through these channels  typically
include  rights to return  unsold  inventory.  As a result,  we do not recognize
revenue  until  after  the  product  has  been  sold  to the  end  user.  If our
distributors  and  retailers are not  successful in this market,  there could be
substantial product returns, which would harm our business,  financial condition
and results of operations.

Sales to a small  number of  customers  represent a  significant  portion of our
revenues.

    More than half of our revenues  come from a small number of  customers.  For
example in the first  quarter of 2000,  sales to our top 10 customers  accounted
for  approximately  52% of our product  revenues and in 1999 sales to our top 10
customers represented 61% of our product revenues . In the first quarter of 2000
and in fiscal year 1999,  one  customer  accounted  for more than 10% of product
sales.  If we were to lose any of these  customers  or  experience  any material
reduction in orders from these  customers,  our revenues and  operating  results
would suffer.  Our sales are generally made by standard  purchase  orders rather
than long-term  contracts.  In addition,  the  composition of our major customer
base changes from year to year as the market demand for our customers'  products
change.

                                    Page 25
<PAGE>



Our multiple sales channels may compete for a limited number of customer sales.

    Web based sales of our products today  represent a small but growing portion
of our overall  sales.  Sales on the Internet  tend to undercut the  traditional
distribution  channels and may dramatically change the way our consumer products
are  purchased in future years.  We cannot assure you that we will  successfully
manage the inherent channel  conflicts  between our retail channel customers and
customers that wish to purchase directly on the Internet.

There may be seasonality in our business.

    Sales of our products,  in particular the sale of CompactFlash  products, in
the consumer electronics applications market may be subject to seasonality. As a
result,  product  sales may be  impacted by seasonal  purchasing  patterns  with
higher sales  generally  occurring in the second half of each year. In addition,
in the past we have  experienced  a decrease in orders in the first quarter from
our Japanese OEM customers  primarily because most customers in Japan operate on
a fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay  purchases until the beginning
of their next fiscal year. For example,  our product  revenues were 24% lower in
the first  quarter  of 1998 than in the fourth  quarter  of 1997,  mostly due to
these seasonal factors..  Although we did not experience this seasonality in the
first quarter of 2000 and are not able to fulfill all demand from our customers,
we cannot assure you that we will not experience seasonality in the future.

We must achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields.

    The  fabrication of our products  requires wafers to be produced in a highly
controlled and ultra clean environment.  Semiconductor companies that supply our
wafers  sometimes  have   experienced   problems   achieving   acceptable  wafer
manufacturing yields.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both
our design technology and the foundry's  manufacturing  process technology.  Low
yields may result from design errors or manufacturing  failures.  Yield problems
may not be  determined  or improved  until an actual  product is made and can be
tested.  As a result,  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are
well into the  production  process.  The risks  associated  with yields are even
greater because we rely on independent  offshore  foundries for our wafers which
increases  the effort and time  required to  identify,  communicate  and resolve
manufacturing  yield  problems.  If the  foundries  cannot  achieve  the planned
yields, this will result in higher costs and reduced product  availability,  and
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

    Under the terms of our  definitive  agreement  with Toshiba,  we and Toshiba
will  jointly  form and fund a joint  venture  which  will  equip and  operate a
silicon  wafer  manufacturing  line  in  Virginia  (the  Dominion  facility)  to
manufacture  512 megabit and 1 gigabit  flash memory chips.  However,  we cannot
assure you that this manufacturing line will produce satisfactory  quantities of
wafers  with  acceptable  prices and yields.  Any  failure in this regard  could
materially harm our business,  financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, the construction improvements and operation of this line will cause us
to incur  significant  expense and may result in the diversion of resources from
other important areas of business.  We cannot assure you that we or Toshiba will
be able to secure  sufficient  funding to support this  manufacturing  line.  In
addition,  we have no experience in operating a wafer  manufacturing line and we
intend  to rely  on the  existing  manufacturing  organization  at the  Dominion
facility.  This  organization  will be trained in Nand  flash  manufacturing  by
Toshiba,  but we cannot assure you that they will be successful in manufacturing
these advanced Nand flash products on a  cost-effective  basis or at all. We are
committed to purchase  50% of the Nand flash output from the Dominion  facility,
and therefore,  should the customer  demand for Nand flash products be below our
available  supply,  our  results  of  operations  could be  adversely  affected.
Furthermore,  in order for us to sell Nand based  CompactFlash,  MultiMediaCards
and SD Cards,  we will have to develop new  controllers,  printed circuit boards
and test  algorithms  because the  architecture  of Nand flash is  significantly
different from our current Nor flash designs.  Any delays in the  development of
these  elements  could prevent us from taking  advantage of the  available  Nand
output and could adversely affect our results of operations.

Risks associated with patents, proprietary rights and related litigation.

    General

    We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks,  copyright and trade secret
laws,  confidentiality  procedures  and  licensing  arrangements  to protect our
intellectual  property rights. In the past, we have been involved in significant
disputes  regarding our  intellectual  property rights and claims that we may be
infringing third parties' intellectual property rights. We expect that we may be
involved in similar disputes in the future. We cannot assure you that:

o   any of our existing patents will not be invalidated;

o   patents will be issued for any of our pending applications;

o   any claims  allowed from  existing or pending  patents will have  sufficient
    scope or strength;

o   our patents will be issued in the primary  countries  where our products are
    sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage; or

o   any of our products may infringe on the patents of other companies.

In addition,  our  competitors  may be able to design their products  around our
patents.

    We intend to  vigorously  enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that our
efforts  will  be  successful.  If we were to  have  an  adverse  result  in any
litigation,  we  could  be  required  to  pay  substantial  damages,  cease  the
manufacture,  use and sale of infringing products,  expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing  technology,  discontinue the use of certain processes
or obtain  licenses to the  infringing  technology.  Any litigation is likely to
result  in  significant  expense  to us, as well as divert  the  efforts  of our
technical and management personnel.  For example, the Lexar litigation described
below has  resulted in  cumulative  litigation  expenses of  approximately  $1.7
million.

    Cross-licenses and indemnification obligations

    If we decide to incorporate  third party  technology into our products or if
we are found to infringe on others' intellectual  property, we could be required
to license intellectual property from a third party. We may also need to license
some of our  intellectual  property  to  others  in order to enable us to obtain
cross-licenses to third party patents.  Currently,  we have patent cross-license
agreements with several companies,  including Hitachi,  Intel,  Samsung,  Sharp,
SST,  SmartDisk  and  Toshiba  and we are in  discussions  with other  companies
regarding potential cross-license agreements. We cannot be certain that licenses
will be offered when we need them, or that the terms offered will be acceptable.
If we do obtain  licenses from third parties,  we may be required to pay license
fees or royalty payments. In addition, if we are unable to obtain a license that
is necessary to the manufacture of our products, we could be required to suspend
the  manufacture of products or stop our wafer  suppliers  from using  processes
that may  infringe  the rights of third  parties.  We cannot  assure you that we
would be successful in redesigning  our products or that the necessary  licenses
will be available under reasonable terms.

    We have historically agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for
alleged patent  infringement.  The scope of such indemnity  varies,  but may, in
some  instances,  include  indemnification  for damages and expenses,  including
attorney's fees. We may  periodically  engage in litigation as a result of these
indemnification   obligations.   We  are  not  currently  engaged  in  any  such
indemnification  proceedings.  Our insurance policies exclude coverage for third
party claims for patent  infringement.  Any future  obligation  to indemnify our
customers or suppliers could harm our business,  financial  condition or results
of operations.


                                    Page 27

    Litigation risks associated with our intellectual property

    From time to time, it may be necessary to initiate  litigation against third
parties to preserve our  intellectual  property  rights.  These parties could in
turn bring suit against us. For  example,  in March 1998 we filed a complaint in
federal  court against Lexar Media,  Inc. for  infringement  of one of our flash
card patents. Lexar disputed this claim and asserted that our patent was invalid
or unenforceable,  as well as asserting various  counterclaims  including unfair
competition,  violation  of the Lanham Act,  patent  misuse,  interference  with
prospective  economic advantage,  trade defamation and fraud. We have denied all
of these  counterclaims.  In July 1998, the court denied Lexar's request to have
the case dismissed. Discovery in this suit began in August 1998. On February 22,
1999,  the court  considered  arguments  and  papers  submitted  by the  parties
regarding  the scope and proper  interpretation  of the  asserted  claims in our
patent at issue in the Lexar suit. On March 4, 1999, the court issued its ruling
on the proper  construction of the claim terms in our patent.  On July 30, 1999,
we filed a motion for partial summary  judgment that Lexar  CompactFlash  and PC
Cards  contributorily  infringe  our  patent.  Lexar  filed a motion for summary
judgement  that our patent is invalid in view of prior art. A hearing on both of
these  motions  was held on March 17, 2000 and on March 28, 2000 the court found
that the accused Lexar flash cards contributarily infringed SanDisk's patent and
granted SanDisk's motion for partial summary judgement.  Additionally, the court
denied Lexar's summary judgement motion for non-infringement  and invalidity.  A
trial date has been set this matter in October 2000.

    On March 21, 2000,  Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. (Mitsubishi  Electric) filed a
complaint in Tokyo District Court against SanDisk K.K.,  SanDisk's  wholly-owned
subsidiary in Japan. The complaint alleges that SanDisk K.K., based in Yokohama,
Japan, infringes on three Mitsubishi Japanese patents. The Mitsubishi patents in
question  are  #JP2099342,  #JP2129071  and #  JP2138047.  Based on  preliminary
information,  we  believe  that  these  patents  are  related  primarily  to the
mechanical  construction of memory cards built with a separate connector. In the
complaint,  Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary  injunction halting the
sale of our  CompactFlash  and flash ATA  memory  cards in  Japan.  SanDisk  and
SanDisk K.K. will vigorously  defend itself against  Mitsubishi's  claims.  From
time to time,  we have been  contacted by various  parties who have alleged that
certain of our products  infringe on patents that such parties claim to hold. To
date no legal actions have been filed in connection with any such  infringement,
other than as discussed above.

    In the  event  of an  adverse  result  in any such  litigation,  we could be
required to pay  substantial  damages,  cease the  manufacture,  use and sale of
infringing  products,  expend  significant  resources to develop  non-infringing
technology or obtain licenses to the infringing  technology,  or discontinue the
use  of  certain   processes.   Litigation   frequently   involves   substantial
expenditures  and  can  require  significant  management  attention,  even if we
ultimately  prevail.  In  addition,  the results of any  litigation  matters are
inherently  uncertain.  Accordingly,  there can be no assurance  that any of the
foregoing matters,  or any future  litigation,  will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our rapid growth may strain our operations.

    We are currently  experiencing rapid growth, which has placed, and continues
to  place,  a  significant  strain on our  personnel  and  other  resources.  To
accommodate this growth,  we must continue to hire,  train,  motivate and manage
our employees. We are having difficulty hiring the necessary engineering,  sales
and  marketing  personnel  to support our growth.  In  addition,  we must make a
significant  investment in our existing internal information  management systems
to support increased  manufacturing,  as well as accounting and other management
related functions.  Our systems,  procedures and controls may not be adequate to
support  our rapid  growth,  which  could in turn harm our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

Our success depends on key personnel, including our executive officers, the loss
of whom could disrupt our business.

    Our success  greatly  depends on the continued  contributions  of our senior
management  and  other  key  research  and  development,  sales,  marketing  and
operations personnel, including Dr. Eli Harari, our founder,

                                    Page 28
<PAGE>


    President and Chief Executive  Officer.  Our success will also depend on our
ability to recruit  additional  highly skilled  personnel.  We cannot assure you
that we will be successful in hiring or retaining  such key  personnel,  or that
any of our key personnel will remain employed with us.

Anti-takeover  provisions in our charter documents,  stockholder rights plan and
in  Delaware  law could  prevent or delay a change in control  and, as a result,
negatively impact our stockholders.

    We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging
a takeover attempt.  For example, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that
would cause substantial  dilution to a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on
terms not approved by our board of directors.  In addition,  our  certificate of
incorporation  grants the board of  directors  the  authority to fix the rights,
preferences  and  privileges  of and issue up to  4,000,000  shares of preferred
stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue
shares of preferred  stock,  such an issuance could have the effect of making it
more  difficult and less  attractive  for a third party to acquire a majority of
our  outstanding  voting  stock.  Preferred  stock may also have  other  rights,
including  economic rights senior to the common stock that could have a material
adverse  effect on the market value of the common  stock.  In  addition,  we are
subject to the  anti-takeover  provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation  Law. This section  provides that a corporation  shall not engage in
any business  combination with any interested  stockholder during the three-year
period  following  the  time  that  such   stockholder   becomes  an  interested
stockholder.  This  provision  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a
change of control of SanDisk.

Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile.

    The market price of our stock has fluctuated  significantly  in the past and
is likely to continue  to  fluctuate  in the  future.  For example in the twelve
month period ending March 31, 2000 our stock price has fluctuated  from a low of
$8.50 to a high of $169.625.  We believe that such fluctuations will continue as
a result of future  announcements  concerning  us, our  competitors or principal
customers  regarding  technological  innovations,   new  product  introductions,
governmental  regulations,  litigation  or  changes  in  earnings  estimates  by
analysts.  In  addition,  in  recent  years  the stock  market  has  experienced
significant  price  and  volume  fluctuations  and  the  market  prices  of  the
securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile, often for
reasons outside the control of the particular  companies.  These fluctuations as
well as general  economic,  political and market  conditions may have an adverse
affect on the market price of our common stock.
