              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


1.     These interim condensed  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited
       but  reflect,  in  the  opinion  of  management,   all  normal  recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 1998, and the
       results of operations  and cash flows for the three and six month periods
       ended June 30,  1998 and 1997.  Because all the  disclosures  required by
       generally accepted accounting principles are not included,  these interim
       condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
       with the audited financial  statements and notes thereto in the Company's
       annual  report on Form 10-K as of,  and for the year ended  December  31,
       1997.  The condensed  consolidated  balance sheet data as of December 31,
       1997 was derived from the audited financial statements.

       The  results  of  operations  and cash  flows for the three and six month
       period ended June 30, 1998 are not  necessarily  indicative of results of
       operations and cash flows for any future period.

2.     The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31, and
       each fiscal  quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, and
       September  30. The second  fiscal  quarter of 1998 and 1997 ended on June
       28,  1998 and June 29,  1997,  respectively.  Fiscal  year 1997  ended on
       December 28, 1997. For ease of presentation,  the accompanying  financial
       statements  have been  shown as  ending  on the last day of the  calendar
       month.

3.     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4. The components of inventory consist of the following:

6.     To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be  necessary  to  initiate  litigation  with one or more third  parties,
       including  but not limited to those the Company has  notified of possible
       patent infringement.  In addition, one or more of these parties may bring
       suit against the Company.

       In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal  court  against
       Lexar Media, Inc.  ("Lexar") for infringement of a fundamental  flashdisk
       patent.  Lexar has disputed the Company's  claim of patent  infringement,
       claimed SanDisk's patent is invalid or unenforceable and asserted various
       counterclaims including unfair competition,  violation of the Lanham Act,
       patent misuse,  interference with prospective  economic advantage,  trade
       defamation and fraud. SanDisk has denied each of Lexar's counterclaims.

        In July 1998, the federal  district court denied Lexar's request to have
       the case  dismissed  on the  grounds  the  Company  failed to  perform an
       adequate  prefiling  investigation.  As a result,  discovery in the Lexar
       suit will  commence in August  1998.  The Company  intends to  vigorously
       enforce its  patents,  but there can be no assurance  that these  efforts
       will be successful.

       From  time to  time  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  certain  of its
       suppliers  and customers for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances include

                                     Page 7
<PAGE>


       indemnification  for damages and expenses,  including attorneys fees. The
       Company  may from time to time be  engaged in  litigation  as a result of
       such   indemnification   obligations.   Third  party  claims  for  patent
       infringement  are excluded  from coverage  under the Company's  insurance
       policies.  There  can be no  assurance  that  any  future  obligation  to
       indemnify the Company's customers or suppliers,  will not have a material
       adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results
       of operations.

       Any  litigation,  whether as a plaintiff or as a  defendant,  will likely
       result in  significant  expense to the  Company and divert the efforts of
       the Company's  technical and  management  personnel,  whether or not such
       litigation is ultimately determined in favor of the Company. In the event
       of an  adverse  result  in any  such  litigation,  the  Company  could be
       required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture,  use and sale
       of  infringing   products,   expend  significant   resources  to  develop
       non-infringing   technology   or  obtain   licenses  to  the   infringing
       technology,  or discontinue  the use of certain  processes.  Accordingly,
       there  can be no  assurance  that any of the  foregoing  matters,  or any
       future  litigation,  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
       Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

7.     The Company  recorded a provision for income taxes at a 36% effective tax
       rate for the first six months of 1998  compared  to a 15%  effective  tax
       rate for the same period of 1997.  The  effective  tax rate for the first
       six months of 1997 was substantially below the federal statutory rate due
       to the utilization of federal and state tax credit carryforwards, Foreign
       Sales  Corporation tax benefits and a reduction in the deferred tax asset
       valuation allowance.

8.     The Company has a credit agreement (the Agreement) with a bank, which was
       renewed  in July  1998.  Under the  provisions  of the  Agreement,  which
       expires in July 1999,  the  Company  may borrow up to $10.0  million on a
       revolving line of credit at the bank's prime interest rate. Amounts under
       the revolving line of credit can be applied to the issuance of letters of
       credit up to the full amount of the credit line.  At June 30, 1998,  $7.2
       million of letters of credit were  outstanding.  In  addition,  under the
       Agreement, the Company also has a $15.0 million foreign exchange contract
       line under which the Company may enter into foreign  exchange  contracts.
       As of June 30,  1998,  $4.4  million  was  outstanding  under the foreign
       exchange contract portion of the line. The Agreement  contains  covenants
       that require the Company to maintain certain  financial ratios and levels
       of net worth.  The Agreement  prohibits the payment of cash  dividends to
       stockholders.

9.     As of  January  1, 1998,  the  Company  adopted  statement  of  Financial
       Accounting  Standards  No.  130  (SFAS  130),  "Reporting   Comprehensive
       Income." SFAS 130  establishes new rules for the reporting and display of
       comprehensive  income and its components;  however,  the adoption of this
       Statement  had no impact on the  Company's  net  income or  stockholders'
       equity.  SFAS 130 requires  unrealized  gains or losses on the  Company's
       available-for-sale  securities,  which  prior to adoption  were  reported
       separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in other comprehensive
       income.

       Accumulated other comprehensive  income, which consists of gains (losses)
       on available-for-sale  securities,  was $187,000 and ($4,000) at June 30,

       No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
       which is required to be adopted in years  beginning  after June 15, 1999.
       Because of the Company's minimal use of derivatives,  management does not
       anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant
       effect on earnings or the financial position of the Company.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

         Certain  statements  in this  discussion  and  analysis,  including  in
particular,  the second  paragraph under the discussion of product  revenues and
the  paragraph  discussing  patent  license  and royalty  revenues,  are forward
looking  statements  based on current  expectations and entail various risks and
uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from those
expressed in such forward looking  statements.  Such risks and uncertainties are
discussed  below and in the Company's  Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
1997 under the heading "Risk Factors".  Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward  looking  statements,  which speak only as of the date
hereof.  The Company  undertakes no  obligation to update these forward  looking
statements to reflect events or  circumstances  occurring after the date hereof.
The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with the  Company's
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

         The  Company  was  founded  in 1988 to develop  and  market  flash data
storage systems.  The Company sells its products to the consumer electronics and
industrial/communications  markets. During the course of 1997, the percentage of
the Company's  product sales  attributable to the consumer  electronics  market,
particularly  sales  of its  CompactFlash  products  for use in  digital  camera
applications,  increased  substantially.  This increase in sales to the consumer
market  resulted in a shift to lower  capacity  products,  which  typically have
lower average selling prices and gross margins than higher capacity products. In
addition,  these products are  frequently  sold into the retail  channel,  which
usually has shorter  customer order  lead-times  than the other channels used by
the Company,  thereby  decreasing the Company's  ability to accurately  forecast
future  production  needs.   Subject  to  continued  market  acceptance  of  its
CompactFlash  products,  the Company  believes  these  products will continue to
represent  a majority  of the  Company's  sales as the  popularity  of  consumer
applications,  including  digital  cameras,  increases.  The percentage of sales
attributable  to orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter has increased
over time and, in  response,  the Company is  continuing  to work to shorten its
manufacturing cycle times.

         The  Company's  operating  results are  affected by a number of factors
including  the  volume of  product  sales,  the  timing of  significant  orders,
competitive  pricing pressures,  the ability of the Company to match supply with
demand,  changes  in product  and  customer  mix,  market  acceptance  of new or
enhanced  versions of the Company's  products,  changes in the channels  through
which  the   Company's   products  are   distributed,   timing  of  new  product
announcements and  introductions by the Company and its competitors,  the timing
of license and royalty  revenues,  fluctuations in product costs, the ability of
the  Company to achieve  manufacturing  efficiencies  with its new and  existing
products,  availability of foundry capacity,  variations in manufacturing  cycle
times,  fluctuations  in  manufacturing  yields and  manufacturing  utilization,
increased research and development  expenses and exchange rate fluctuations.  In
addition,  as the proportion of the Company's  products sold for use in consumer
electronics applications increases, the Company's revenues may become subject to
seasonal  declines  in the first  quarter  of each  year.  See  "Risk  Factors -
Fluctuations  in  Operating  Results",  "-  Increasing  Dependence  on  Consumer
Products" and "- Seasonality."

         Beginning in late 1995, the Company adopted a strategy of licensing its
flash  technology,  including  its patent  portfolio,  to  selected  third party
manufacturers  of flash  products.  To date, the Company has entered into patent
cross-license   agreements  with  six  companies,   and  it  intends  to  pursue
opportunities to enter into additional  licenses.  The Company's current license
agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties,  or a combination
thereof,  to the  Company.  The  timing and  amount of these  payments  can vary
substantially from quarter to quarter,  depending on the terms of each agreement
and, in some cases,  the timing of sales of products by the other parties.  As a
result,  license and royalty revenues have fluctuated  significantly in the past
and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high
gross margins  associated with license and royalty  revenues,  gross margins and
net income are likely to  fluctuate  more with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues than with changes in product revenues.

                                    Page 10

         SanDisk  markets  its  products  using  a  direct  sales  organization,
distributors,  manufacturers' representatives,  private label partners, OEMs and
retailers.  The  Company  expects  that sales  through the retail  channel  will
comprise  an  increasing  share  of total  revenues  in the  future,  and that a
substantial  portion  of its  sales  into  the  retail  channel  will be made to
participants  that will have the right to return  unsold  products.  The Company
recognizes  revenues  from  these  sales when the  products  are sold to the end
customers.

         Historically,  a majority of the Company's sales have been to a limited
number of customers. The Company expects that sales of its products to a limited
number of customers  will continue to account for a  substantial  portion of its
product  revenues for the foreseeable  future.  The Company has also experienced
significant  changes in the  composition  of its customer base from year to year
and  expects  this  pattern to  continue  as market  demand for such  customers'
products fluctuates. The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by major
customers,  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations.  See "Risk  Factors - Customer
Concentration."

         Due to the emerging nature of the Company's markets and certain planned
product transitions, the Company has had difficulty forecasting future inventory
levels  required  to meet  customer  demand.  As a  result  of both  contractual
obligations and manufacturing cycle time, the Company has been required to order
wafers from its foundries  several months in advance of the ultimate shipment of
its products.  Under the Company's wafer supply agreements,  there are limits on
the number of wafers the Company can order and the  Company's  ability to change
that quantity is  restricted.  Accordingly,  the  Company's  ability to react to
significant fluctuations in demand for its products is limited. As a result, the
Company has not been able to match its purchases of wafers to specific  customer
orders and  therefore  the  Company  has from time to time taken write downs for
potential  excess  inventory  purchased prior to the receipt of customer orders.
Also,  the  Company  has from time to time taken  write  downs of  inventory  to
reflect a lower of cost or market valuation.  The Company most recently recorded
such a write down in the  second  quarter of 1998.  These  adjustments  decrease
gross margins in the quarter reported and have resulted, and could in the future
result,  in  fluctuations  in gross margins on a quarter to quarter  basis.  See
"Risk Factors - Fluctuations in Operating Results."

         Export sales are an important part of the Company's  business.  While a
majority of the  Company's  revenues  from sales to Asian  countries are derived
from OEM  customers  who plan to export their  products to countries  outside of
Asia,  the Asian  economic  crisis has and may continue to adversely  effect the
Company's  revenues to the extent that demand for the Company's products in Asia
declines.  Given the recent economic conditions in Asia and the weakness of many
Asian currencies  relative to the United States dollar,  the Company's  products
are and may continue to be relatively more expensive in Asia, which could result
in a decrease in the  Company's  sales in that  region.  The Company has and may
continue to  experience  pressure on its gross  margins as a result of increased
price competition from Asian competitors.  While most of the Company's sales are
denominated in U.S. Dollars,  the Company invoices certain Japanese customers in
Japanese Yen and is subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions.
To date,  a portion of the  Company's  purchases of wafers,  which  constitute a
significant  part of its cost of goods sold,  have been  denominated in Japanese
Yen. While this percentage has been decreasing,  exchange rate  fluctuations can
affect the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
See "Risk Factors - Risks Associated with International Operations."

         For  the  foreseeable   future,   the  Company  expects  to  realize  a
significant  portion of its revenues from recently  introduced and new products.
Typically  new  products  initially  have lower gross  margins  than more mature
products   because  the   manufacturing   yields  are  lower  at  the  start  of
manufacturing each successive  product  generation.  In addition,  manufacturing
yields are generally  lower at the start of  manufacturing  any product at a new
foundry, such as USIC and NEC. As a result of these factors, the Company expects
that  product  gross  margins  may  decline  in the near  term  from the  levels
experienced  in 1997,  and product  gross  margins are expected to be subject to
fluctuation for the foreseeable future. Moreover, there can be no assurance that
such products or processes will be successfully developed by the

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>


Company or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs. In
addition,  the Company  anticipates that price  competition will increase in the
future,  which will likely result in decreased  average selling prices and lower
gross margins. See "Risk Factors -Manufacturing Yields" and "- Declining Average
Sales Prices."

         The Company is aware of problems  associated  with computer  systems as
the year 2000  approaches.  Year 2000 problems are the result of common computer
programming techniques that result in systems that do not function properly when
manipulating  dates later than December 31, 1999.  The issue is complex and wide
ranging.  The problem may affect transaction  processing  computer  applications
used by the Company for accounting,  distribution,  manufacturing, and planning.
The problem may also affect embedded systems such as building  security systems,
machine controllers and production test equipment. Year 2000 problems with these
systems may affect the ability or efficiency  with which the company can perform
many  significant  functions,  including  but not limited to: order  processing,
material  planning,  product assembly,  product test,  invoicing,  and financial
reporting.  In  addition,  the  problem may affect the  computer  systems of the
Company's  suppliers  and  customers,  disrupting  their  operations.  Year 2000
problems with the Company's  business  partners may impact the Company's sources
of supply and demand.

         The  Company has  established  a year 2000 Risk  Management  program to
assess the impact of the year 2000 issue on SanDisk, and coordinate  remediation
activities.  The Company is in the process of certifying  that it's products are
year 2000  compliant.  Preliminary  product  testing has  uncovered no Year 2000
problems in the  Company's  products.  Preliminary  investigation  into  product
design,  specifically firmware,  microcode, and software developer tool kits has
uncovered no design assumptions or application programming interfaces that would
cause  year  2000  problems.  The  Company  expects  to  compete  the year  2000
compliance testing of its products in the third quarter of 1998.

         The  year  2000  compliance  assessment  of  the  Company's  management
information  system is complete,  and remediation is well underway.  The Company
currently  uses a  commercially  available  fully  integrated  MRP II (Materials
Requirement  Planning and Accounting  system)  software  application that is not
year 2000  compliant.  This  system is used for  Accounting,  Order  Processing,
Planning, Inventory Control, Shop Floor Control and Distribution. This system is
now being  replaced with a commercial  system that is year 2000  compliant.  The
replacement project is expected to be completed in 1998.

         The  assessment  and  remediation  of year 2000  problems  in  tertiary
business  information  systems  is  on-going.  Well  over  90% of the  company's
investment  in  desktop  PC  hardware  is known to be year 2000  compliant.  The
majority of the software  used on these  systems and network  servers are recent
versions of vendor supported,  commercially available products.  Upgrading these
applications  as year 2000  compliant  patches are  released  by the  respective
vendors has not been a significant burden on the company.

         The  assessment  and  remediation  of year 2000  problems  in  computer
systems used for facilities control,  machine control, and manufacturing testing
is on-going. The most significant year 2000 issue in this area has been found to
be related to older wafer test  equipment.  This equipment is not expected to be
in use in the year 2000. The Company is phasing in new year 2000 compliant wafer
test equipment in conjunction  with the introduction of new generations of flash
memory.

         The cost of the Year 2000 project  related to upgrading  the  Company's
core  management  information  system  is  estimated  to be  approximately  $1.0
million.  The Company has  capitalized  approximately  $400,000  for the cost of
purchased   software  and  hardware.   The  Company   estimates  it  will  incur
approximately $350,000 of consulting expenses over the next few quarters related
to the  implementation of its new information  system.  The additional  expenses
related to the management of the year 2000 compliance program and completing the
assessment  of the Company's  internal and external  risks is not expected to be
material to the Company's quarterly operating results.

         The costs and time  schedule  for the Year 2000 problem  abatement  are
based  on  management's  best  estimates  for  the  implementation  of  its  new
management information system and year 2000 problems

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>


uncovered to date. These estimates were derived utilizing numerous  assumptions,
including  that  the  most   significant  Year  2000  risks  have  already  been
identified,  that certain  resources  will continue to be available,  that third
party  plans will be  fulfilled,  and other  factors.  However,  there can be no
guarantee  that these  estimates will be achieved or that the  anticipated  time
schedule  will be met and actual  results  could  differ  materially  from those
anticipated.

         Specific  contingency  plans for systems that pose  significant risk to
on-going operations are being developed under the auspices of the Company's year
2000  Risk  Management  program.  If the  Company  is  unable  to  complete  the
replacement of its core  management  information  system in a timely manner,  an
alternative  plan has been developed.  This plan consists of applying  available
vendor  supplied  software  patches to the existing  system.  The costs and time
involved to  complete  this  alternative  are  expected  to be  minimal.  Should
previously  undetected  Year  2000  problems  be found in other  systems,  these
systems will either be upgraded, replaced, turned off, or operated in place with
manual  procedures  to  compensate  for their  deficiencies.  While the  Company
believes  that these  alternative  plans would be adequate to meet the Company's
needs without  materially  impacting its  operations,  there can be no assurance
that such  alternatives  would be successful  or that the  Company's  results of
operations  would  not  be  materially  adversely  affected  by the  delays  and
inefficiencies inherent in conducting operations in this manner.

         There may be  additional  Year 2000 problems that are as yet unknown to
the Company  and for which  remediation  plans have not yet been made.  Any such
year 2000  compliance  problem  of  either  the  Company,  or its  suppliers  or
customers could materially  adversely affect the Company's business,  results of
operations,  financial condition, and prospects.  There can be no assurance that
the Company's  insurance will cover losses from business  interruptions  arising
from year 2000 problems of the Company or its suppliers.

Results of Operations

         Product Revenues.  SanDisk's product revenues were $23.5 million in the
second quarter of 1998, down $0.4 million or 2% from the second quarter of 1997.
Product revenues for the first half of 1998 were $48.9 million,  up $6.8 million
or 16% from the same  period in 1997.  During  the  three and six month  periods
ended June 30, 1998, units shipped increased 17% and 42%, respectively, from the
same periods of 1997. In the second  quarter of 1998,  the trend toward sales of
higher  capacity  cards  continued with the average  megabyte  capacity per unit
increasing  56% from the same  period of the prior  year.  Due to the decline in
average  selling  prices,  the average  selling  price per  megabyte of capacity
declined  by 50% over this  period.  CompactFlash  average  selling  prices have
eroded more quickly than anticipated due to increased price competition and weak
demand.  The Company  anticipates that  CompactFlash and other small form factor
products  will  continue to represent the major portion of its sales as consumer
applications  such  as  digital  cameras  become  more  popular.  Due  to  price
sensitivity  and intense  competition  in the  consumer  market,  sales of these
products  generally have lower average selling prices and gross margins than the
Company's higher capacity FlashDisk and FlashDrive products. The mix of products
sold varies from  quarter to quarter and may vary in the future,  affecting  the
Company's overall average selling prices and gross margins.

         Sales to Japan  declined 20% in the second  quarter of 1998 compared to
the same period in 1997 due to the to the  economic  recession  in Japan and the
Company's transition to a direct sales model from the use of distributors in the
retail channel in Japan.  The Company  continues to experience  limited bookings
visibility,  particularly  in  Japan.  More  than  one  half  of  the  Company's
anticipated  quarterly  revenues continue to be turns business,  orders received
and fulfilled in the same quarter, with customers demanding short lead times and
quick delivery schedules, thus capitalizing on the current market conditions and
aggressive pricing environment.  Due to a number of factors described herein and
in "Risk  Factors,"  the Company's  ability to adjust its operating  expenses is
limited  in the short  term.  As a result,  if product  revenues  are lower than
anticipated, the Company's results of operations will be adversely affected. See

"Risk  Factors-Fluctuations  in Operating  Results",  "- Risks  Associated  with
International Operations" and "Seasonality."

         While  SanDisk  has been  successful  winning  design-ins  for many new
applications,  it  generally  takes  several  quarters  for these  new  customer
products to reach the market.  It is  difficult to predict the timing of related
new product  introductions and future sales volumes from these design-ins as the
success of the customers'  products is uncertain.  There can be no assurance the
applications  will be  developed  and  marketed  successfully  or at all. As new
markets  develop,  competition is expected to increase,  which will likely cause
average  selling  prices to  decline  further  and may cause  gross  margins  to
decline.

         Export sales  represented 46% of product revenues for the three and six
month periods ended June 30, 1998 compared with 52% and 47%,  respectively,  for
the same periods of the previous year. The Company expects  international  sales
to continue to represent a  significant  portion of revenues.  The Company's top
ten customers  represented  64% of product revenue in the second quarter of 1998
compared to 67% for the same period in 1997. The Company expects that sales to a
limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial  portion of
its revenues for the foreseeable future.

         License  and  Royalty  Revenues.  The Company  currently  earns  patent
licenses and royalty revenues under six cross license agreements,  with Hitachi,
Intel,  Samsung,  Sharp,  Silicon Storage Technology,  Inc. ("SST") and Toshiba.
License and  royalty  revenue  from patent  cross  license  agreements  was $7.9
million in the second  quarter of 1998, up $4.5 million from $3.4 million in the
same period of 1997 primarily due to license and royalty  revenues  earned under
agreements with Hitachi, Toshiba and Sharp which were entered into in the second
half of 1997.  In the  first  half of 1998,  revenue  from  patent  license  and
royalties  was $16.6  million,  up $9.9  million  from the same  period of 1997.
Revenues from patent  licenses and royalties  increased to 25% of total revenues
in the  three  and six  month  periods  ended  June  30,  1998  from 13% and 14%
respectively,  for the same periods of the previous year. The Company  currently
expects that revenues from patent licenses and royalties will be in the range of
$7.5 to $8.0  million in the third  quarter of 1998 due to the timing of revenue
recognition under the various agreements.

         Gross Profits.  In the second quarter of 1998, gross profits were $10.8
million or 34% of total  revenues,  down  slightly  from $11.0 million or 40% of
total revenues for the same period of 1997.  Gross profits for the first half of
1998 were $27.1  million or 41% of total  revenues  compared to $19.5 million or
40% of total  revenues for the same period in the previous  year.  The growth in
overall  gross  profits  for the first  half of 1998 was due to an  increase  in
license and royalty  revenue.  Product  gross  margins  decreased  to 12% in the
second quarter of 1998 compared to 32% for the same period of 1997. The decrease
was primarily due to the decline in average selling  prices.  A lower of cost or
market  inventory  write down also  contributed to the decline in gross margins.
The  Company  expects  to  complete  the  transition  from  32Mbit,  0.4  micron
technology to the more cost effective  64Mbit,  0.35 micron technology and begin
shipment of its 80Mbit D2 flash  products  in the second  half of 1998.  If this
transition is  successful,  the Company  expects gross margins to recover to the
low 20% range over this period.  While the Company has ongoing efforts to reduce
manufacturing  costs,  there can be no assurance that these cost reductions will
be  adequate  to  offset  average  selling  price  declines  due to  anticipated
increased competition.

         Research and  Development.  Research and development  expenses  consist
principally of salaries and payroll related  expenses for design and development
engineers,  prototype supplies and contract  services.  Research and development
expenses increased $1.4 million or 45% in the second quarter of 1998 compared to
the same  period in 1997.  In the first half of 1998  research  and  development
expenses  increased  $2.7  million  compared  to the first  half of 1997.  These
increases  were  primarily  due to an increase in salaries  and payroll  related
expenses  associated  with  additional  personnel,   increased  project  related
expenses and increased depreciation due to capital equipment additions. Research
and  development  expenses  represented  14% of total  revenues  for the  second
quarter of 1998 compared to 11% for the same period in 1997. The Company expects
research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars to
support the  development of new  generations of flash data storage  products and
the addition of new foundries to manufacture the Company's products.

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>



         Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses include salaries and
payroll  related  expenses,  sales  commissions  and  travel  expenses  for  the
Company's  sales,  marketing,  customer  service  and  applications  engineering
personnel. These expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses such
as  independent  manufacturer's  representative  commissions,   advertising  and
tradeshow  expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.3 million or 43%
in the second  quarter of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997. In the first
half of 1998,  sales and marketing  expenses  increased $2.7 million compared to
the  first  half of  1997.  These  increases  were  primarily  due to  increased
marketing and sales  expenses  related to the  development of the retail channel
for the Company's products. An increase in salaries and payroll related expenses
associated  with  additional  personnel also  contributed to the increase in the
first  half of 1998.  Sales  and  marketing  expenses  represented  14% of total
revenues  in the second  quarter of 1998  compared to 11% for the same period of
1997. The Company  expects sales and marketing  expenses to increase in absolute
dollars as sales of its  products  grow and it  continues  to develop the retail
channel for its products both domestically and internationally.

         General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include
the  cost  of the  Company's  finance,  information  systems,  human  resources,
shareholder  relations,   legal  and  administrative   functions.   General  and
administrative  expenses  increased $0.2 million or 12% in the second quarter of
1998 compared to the same period of 1997. In the first half of 1998, general and
administrative expenses increased $0.8 million or 29% compared to the first half
of 1997.  These  increases were primarily due to increased  salaries and payroll
related  expenses  associated  with additional  personnel and higher  consulting
expenses  related  to  the   implementation  of  the  Company's  new  management
information system. General and administrative  expenses represented 5% of total
revenues  in the second  quarter of 1998  compared  to 6% for the same period in
1997. The Company  expects  general and  administrative  expenses to increase in
absolute  dollars as these  functions  grow to support the overall growth of the
Company.  General and administrative  expenses could also increase substantially
in the  future in  connection  with the  Company's  efforts to defend its patent
portfolio. See "Risk Factors-Patents Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation."

         Interest  and  Other  Income,  Net.  Interest  and other  income,  net,
increased  $324,000 in the second quarter of 1998 compared to the same period of
1997. This increase was primarily due to higher investment  balances as a result
of the  investment  of proceeds  from the sale of common stock in the  Company's
November 1997 follow on public offering.

         Provision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded a provision for income
taxes at a 36% effective tax rate for the first six months of 1998 compared to a
15% effective  tax rate for the same period of 1997.  The effective tax rate for
the first six months of 1997 was substantially  below the federal statutory rate
due to the  utilization of federal and state tax credit  carryforwards,  foreign
sales  corporation  tax  benefits  and a  reduction  in the  deferred  tax asset
valuation  allowance.  The Company's  1998  effective tax rate is  substantially
higher than its 1997 rate due to the  utilization  of all remaining  federal and
state tax credit carryforwards in 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         As of June 30, 1998, the Company had working capital of $141.5 million,
which included $13.5 million in cash and cash  equivalents and $118.2 million in
short  term  investments.  The  Company  has a line of  credit  facility  with a
commercial  bank under which it can borrow up to $10 million at the bank's prime
rate.  This line of credit  facility  expires in July 1999. As of June 30, 1998,
the Company had $4.4 million  committed under the foreign  exchange  facility of
the line of credit for Yen forward  exchange  contracts that mature in September
of 1998. The Agreement  contains  covenants that require the Company to maintain
certain  financial  ratios and levels of net worth, and prohibits the payment of
cash dividends to stockholders.

         Operating  activities  used $1.7  million of cash  during the first six
months of 1998 primarily due to a decline in current liabilities and an increase
in inventories. Investing activities used $6.9 million of cash

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>


in the first six months of 1998 and included net  purchases  of  investments  of
$4.0 million and $2.9 million of capital equipment  purchases.  During the first
six months of 1998, financing activities provided $1.2 million of cash primarily
from the sale of common  stock under the SanDisk  employee  stock  purchase  and
stock option plans.

         Depending  on the demand for the  Company's  products,  the Company may
decide to make  investments,  which could be  substantial,  in assembly and test
manufacturing  equipment  or foundry  capacity  to support  its  business in the
future.  Management believes the existing cash and cash equivalents,  short term
investments  and  available  line  of  credit,  together  with  cash  flow  from
operations,  will be  sufficient  to meet the  Company's  currently  anticipated
working  capital  and  capital  expenditure  requirements  for at least the next
twelve months.

Impact of Currency Exchange Rates

         The Company  currently  purchases wafers from Matsushita under purchase
contracts  denominated  in yen. A portion  of the  Company's  revenues  are also
denominated in yen.  Foreign exchange  exposures  arising from the Company's yen
denominated  commitments and related  accounts  payable are offset to the extent
the Company has yen denominated  accounts  receivable and cash balances.  To the
extent such foreign exchange  exposures are not offset,  the Company enters into
foreign exchange forward  contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency
exchange  rates.  At June 30,  1998,  there  were $4.4  million  in Yen  forward
contracts  outstanding.  Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material
adverse  effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations.


Risk Factors

         Fluctuations in Operating  Results.  SanDisk's  operating  results have
been and are  expected  to  continue  to be,  subject  to  quarterly  and annual
fluctuations due to a variety of factors. The principal factors that have caused
the Company's  operating  results to fluctuate in the past several  quarters and
may cause the  Company's  operating  results  to  fluctuate  in the  future  are
unpredictable  demand for the  Company's  products,  declining  average  selling
prices, the economic recession in Japan and the seasonality in sales of products
for consumer  electronics  applications.  For  example,  the  Company's  product
revenues  declined in the first and second quarters of 1998 due to lower average
selling prices, a decline in sales to Japan and seasonal factors.

         The Company must order silicon wafers from its foundries several months
prior to the date such  wafers are  needed.  If the  Company  overestimates  the
number of silicon  wafers it needs to fill product orders and as a result builds
excess  inventories,  gross  margins and  operating  results will be  materially
adversely  affected.  For example,  in the second  quarter of 1998 product gross
margins  declined to 12% from 30% in the  previous  quarter  partially  due to a
lower of cost or market write down of inventory.  Because the Company is selling
CompactFlash,  its largest volume product,  into an emerging consumer market and
is unable to accurately  forecast future sales, there will be a material adverse
effect on the  Company's  operating  results if sales  fall below the  Company's
expectations  in a  particular  quarter  and the Company is unable to reduce its
operating expenses. The portion of the Company's quarterly sales attributable to
orders  received and fulfilled in the same quarter  ("turns  business")  remains
higher than 50% and product order backlog fluctuates  substantially from quarter
to quarter. See "Seasonality" and "Dependence on Third Party Foundries."

         Other  factors  affecting  the  Company's  operating  results and gross
margins include the volume of product sales,  competitive pricing pressures, the
ability of the  Company to match  supply  with  demand,  changes in product  and
customer mix,  market  acceptance  of new or enhanced  versions of the Company's
products,  changes in the  channels  through  which the  Company's  products are
distributed,  timing  of new  product  announcements  and  introductions  by the
Company  and its  competitors,  the  timing  of  license  and  royalty  revenue,
fluctuations in product costs, availability of foundry capacity, variations in

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>


manufacturing cycle time, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing
utilization,  the ability of the Company to achieve  manufacturing  efficiencies
with its new and existing products, increased research and development expenses,
exchange rate fluctuations and changes in general economic conditions, including
economic  conditions in Asia. All of these factors are difficult to forecast and
these or other factors can materially  affect the Company's  quarterly or annual
operating results or gross margins.

         The Company has increased its expense levels to support its anticipated
growth,  including  expenses  associated  with the  expansion  of the  Company's
in-house  assembly  and test  operations.  The  Company  expects to  continue to
increase  its  operating  expenses  by hiring  additional  personnel  to support
expected growth in sales unit volumes, increased marketing and sales efforts and
accelerated research and development activities. If the Company does not achieve
increased  levels  of  revenues  commensurate  with  these  increased  levels of
operating  expenses,  or if the Company's  revenues  decrease or do not meet the
Company's   expectations  for  a  particular  period,  the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations  will be  materially  adversely
affected.

         The mix of the  Company's  products sold varies from quarter to quarter
and will vary in the future,  affecting the Company's  overall  average  selling
prices and gross margins. The Company's CompactFlash  products,  which currently
represent a significant  portion of the Company's product  revenues,  have lower
average  selling  prices and gross  margins than the Company's  higher  capacity
FlashDisk  and  FlashDrive   products.   The  Company   expects  that  sales  of
CompactFlash  products  will  represent  a  significant  percentage  of  product
revenues as consumer  applications  such as digital cameras become more popular.
This  dependence  on  CompactFlash  sales,  coupled  with lower  pricing  due to
competition,  has caused and is expected to  continue to cause  average  selling
prices to decline,  sometimes at a faster rate than cost reductions  implemented
by the Company.

         The Company has  adopted a strategy of  cross-licensing  its patents to
other  manufacturers  of flash products.  Under such  arrangements,  the Company
earns license fees and royalties on terms that are individually negotiated.  The
timing of recognition  of revenues from these  payments  depends on the terms of
each  contract,  and, in some cases,  on the timing of product  shipments by the
third  parties.  As  a  result,  license  and  royalty  revenue  has  fluctuated
significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future.  Given the relatively
high gross margins  associated with license and royalty  revenue,  gross margins
and net income are likely to fluctuate  more with changes in license and royalty
revenue than with changes in product revenue.

         Dependence on Emerging Markets and New Products.  The Company's success
depends to a significant extent upon the development of emerging markets and new
applications  for flash  data  storage  systems,  as well as on its  ability  to
introduce commercially  attractive and competitively priced products on a timely
basis. The Company believes that continued significant expenditures for research
and  development  will be  required in the future.  In  particular,  the Company
intends to develop new products with increased  memory  capacity at a lower cost
per  megabyte,  which the Company  believes  will be essential to its ability to
remain  competitive.  In November 1997,  the Company  introduced a new removable
storage card product family, the MultiMediaCard ("MMC"). MMC is targeted for the
emerging  markets  for  mobile  smart  phones,   advanced  pagers  and  consumer
multimedia  devices.  MMC will initially be offered in storage capacities of 4MB
and 8MB.  The Company  does not expect to generate  material  revenues  from MMC
sales in 1998.  There can be no  assurance  that the Company  will  successfully
develop any of these new products,  that new  applications  or markets for flash
data storage will develop as expected by the Company, that prospective customers
developing products for any such markets will design the Company's products into
their products and  successfully  introduce  such products,  or that products or
technologies  developed  by others  will not render the  Company's  products  or
technologies  obsolete or  noncompetitive.  The failure of new  applications  or
markets to develop or the  failure of the  Company's  products to be accepted by
the market  would  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

         Increasing  Dependence on Consumer  Products.  Product revenues derived
from  sales of  products  for  consumer  electronics  applications,  principally
digital  cameras,  have  increased  significantly  and in 1997  represented  the
largest portion of product revenues and units shipped. The Company expects sales
of products for consumer applications to continue to represent the major portion
of  product  revenues  in 1998.  There can be no  assurance,  however,  that the
Company  will  achieve  large scale  market  acceptance  for its products in the
consumer  electronics  market.  The Company  anticipates  that products sold for
consumer  applications will generally  encounter intense competition and will be
more price  sensitive  than  products  sold into its other  target  markets.  In
addition,  consumer  markets  require  larger  expenditures  for  marketing  and
promotion to establish brand name recognition and preference.

         Consumer  markets are more likely to experience  seasonality  of sales,
with potential  declines in sales activity during the first quarter of any year.
Because of the large number of OEMs entering the digital  camera  market,  it is
likely  that not all of these  manufacturers  will be  successful  in  achieving
market  acceptance  of  their  products.  If  SanDisk's  OEM  customers  are not
successful in this market,  such OEM customers  may have excess  inventories  of
CompactFlash products, which may preclude follow-on orders or result in sales of
their  CompactFlash  inventories  in the open market.  The market  acceptance of
digital  cameras  that use  CompactFlash  has been slower than  expected and the
number of  companies  supplying  CompactFlash  has  increased,  causing  average
selling  prices and product  gross margins to decline at a rapid rate. If market
acceptance of digital cameras that use CompactFlash  continues to be slower than
expected,  or if the market for CompactFlash becomes saturated,  the Company may
encounter  reduced demand for CompactFlash  products,  declining average selling
prices or product  returns,  any of which  would  have an adverse  effect on the
Company's results of operations.

         The Company  anticipates that a greater  proportion of its sales to the
consumer  electronics market will be made through  distributors and to retailers
than  is the  case  with  the  industrial/communications  market.  This  will be
particularly  true if the level of  after-market  sales of flash memory products
increases. The Company is currently expending significant resources developing a
retail sales channel.  The  expenditures  associated  with this  development are
likely to precede the  realization  of  significant  sales through this channel.
Moreover,  the Company has no prior  experience in the development or management
of the retail channel or sales through such channel. In addition,  a significant
portion of retail sales for consumer  applications  will be made to distributors
and retail chains,  which typically  maintain rights to return unsold inventory.
As a result,  the Company does not  recognize  revenues on sales to this channel
until after the products have been sold to end users.  If the  Company's  retail
customers are not successful in this market,  there could be substantial product
returns to the Company.  The inability to  successfully  develop and effectively
manage the retail  sales  channel  could have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         Seasonality.  The  Company has  experienced  and expects to continue to
experience  seasonality  in its  product  sales.  A  significant  portion of the
Company's  product revenues are derived from the sale of CompactFlash  products,
which are sold principally for consumer electronics  applications.  As a result,
the  Company's  product  sales  have been and are  expected  to be  impacted  by
seasonal purchasing patterns,  with higher sales in the second half of each year
as  compared to the first half of each such year.  In the past,  the Company has
experienced  a reduction in order  quantities in the first quarter from Japanese
OEM  customers,  reflecting  the fact that most  customers in Japan operate on a
fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of
their next fiscal year. In the first quarter of 1998,  product revenues declined
24% from the level in the fourth quarter of 1997 due to these  seasonal  factors
and the Asian economic crisis

         Competition.  The flash  data  storage  markets  in which  the  Company
competes are characterized by intense competition,  rapid technological  change,
evolving industry standards,  declining average selling prices and rapid product
obsolescence.   The  Company's  competitors  include  many  large  domestic  and
international   companies  that  have  greater   access  to  foundry   capacity,
substantially  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing  and other  resources,
broader product lines and longer standing  relationships with customers than the
Company. The Company's primary competitors include flash chip producers such as

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>


Advanced  Micro  Devices,  Inc.  ("AMD"),   Hitachi  Ltd.   ("Hitachi"),   Intel
Corporation ("Intel"), Micron Technology, Inc. ("Micron"), Mitsubishi Electronic
Corporation ("Mitsubishi"),  Samsung Electronics Company Ltd. ("Samsung"), Sharp
Electronics  Corporation  ("Sharp") and Toshiba Corporation  ("Toshiba"),  other
companies using data storage  techniques such as socket flash,  linear flash and
system flash  components,  as well as package or card  assemblers  such as Lexar
Media, Inc. ("Lexar"),  M-Systems,  Inc.  ("M-Systems"),  Simple Technology Inc.
("Simple"), SMART Modular Technologies, Inc. ("Smart Modular"), Sony Corporation
("Sony"),  Kingston,  TDK, Matsushita Battery, Inc.  ("Matsushita  Battery") and
Viking  Components,  Inc.  that  combine  controllers  and  flash  memory  chips
developed  by others into flash  storage  cards.  Several  companies,  including
Hitachi,  Lexar,  Mitsubishi and Micron have been certified by the  CompactFlash
Association to  manufacture  and sell their own brand of  CompactFlash,  and the
Company believes that other  manufacturers will enter the CompactFlash market in
the future.  Competing  products promoting industry standards that are different
from  SanDisk's  CompactFlash  product have been  announced,  including  Intel's
Miniature  Card,  Toshiba's  Smart Media  (Solid-State  Floppy Disk Card),  Sony
Corporation's  Memory Stick, and Matsushita  Battery's recently  introduced Mega
Storage  cards.  A manufacturer  of digital  cameras that  designs-in any one of
these alternative  competing  standards will eliminate  CompactFlash from use in
its product,  as each  competing  standard is  mechanically  and  electronically
incompatible with CompactFlash. In addition, in the third quarter of 1997, Intel
announced a 64Mbit flash chip based on its multilevel cell flash.  The Company's
double  density  flash  ("D2  flash")  and  Intel's  multilevel  cell  flash are
competing  technological  innovations that allow each flash memory cell to store
two bits of  information  instead  of the  traditional  single bit stored by the
industry  standard  flash  technology.  In  November  1997,  Iomega  Corporation
("Iomega") announced its Clik drive, a miniaturized,  mechanical, removable disk
drive that  Iomega  claims  will  compete  directly  with  SanDisk's  flash card
products.

         In the first and second quarters of 1998,  Sony's Mavica digital camera
captured  approximately  40% of the US market for digital  cameras  according to
independent  industry analysts.  The Mavica uses a standard floppy disk to store
digital images and therefore uses no CompactFlash (or any other flash) cards. If
other  manufacturers  adopt the Mavica  format and it becomes  the new  "defacto
standard",  this will  significantly  reduce the Company's  sales  prospects for
CompactFlash  cards.  The  Company's  MMC  products  are  expected to face stiff
competition from Toshiba's SmartMedia flash cards and Sony's flash Memory Stick.
Sony  announced  its  intention  to begin  shipments  of the Memory Stick in the
fourth  quarter of 1998.  Although the Memory Stick is  proprietary to Sony, its
possible  adoption and  widespread use in future  products may adversely  impact
future sales of the Company's MMC and CompactFlash products.

         The Company expects competition to increase in the future from existing
competitors  and from other  companies that may enter the Company's  existing or
future  markets with similar or alternative  data storage  solutions that may be
less costly or provide additional features. Due to the high price sensitivity in
the  market  for  consumer  products,  aggressive  price  competition  has  been
experienced for these  applications.  Such  competition is expected to result in
lower gross  margins in the future,  if the  Company's  average  selling  prices
decrease faster than its costs and could result in lost sales.

         The  Company's  ability  to  compete  in the  Japanese  market  against
Japanese  flash card  suppliers  has been impacted by the weak Yen. If the Yen's
decline  against the dollar  continues  unchecked the Company's  sales and gross
margins in Japan will be adversely affected.

         The Company  has entered  into  patent  cross-license  agreements  with
Hitachi, Intel, Samsung, Sharp Toshiba, and SST pursuant to which each party may
manufacture and sell products that incorporate  technology  covered by the other
party's  patents related to flash memory  devices.  As the Company  continues to
license its patents to certain of its competitors, competition will increase. As
a result of the above factors,  the Company expects to face  substantially  more
competition in the future than it has to date. Increased  competition could have
a material  adverse effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results  of  operations.  The  Company  believes  that its  ability  to  compete
successfully  depends on a number of factors,  which  include price and quality,
product performance and availability, success in developing new applications for
system flash technology, adequate foundry capacity, efficiency of

                                    Page 19
<PAGE>


production,  and timing of new product  announcements  or  introductions  by the
Company,  the number and nature of the Company's  competitors in a given market,
successful  protection of  intellectual  property  rights and general market and
economic conditions.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
compete  successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive
pressures  faced  by the  Company  will  not  materially  adversely  affect  its
business, financial condition or results of operations.

         Declining  Average  Sales  Prices.  The  Company has  experienced,  and
expects to  continue  to  experience,  declining  average  sales  prices for its
products.  For  example in the second  quarter of 1998  average  selling  prices
declined 18% compared to the second quarter of 1997. During this same period the
average  selling  price per  megabyte of capacity  declined  50%. The flash data
storage  markets in which the  Company  competes  are  characterized  by intense
competition.   Therefore,  the  Company  expects  to  incur  increasing  pricing
pressures  from its customers in future  periods,  which will likely result in a
further  decline in average sales prices for the Company's  products.  To offset
declining  average sales prices,  the Company  believes that it must continue to
achieve  manufacturing  cost  reductions  as well as develop new  products  that
incorporate  advanced  features and can be sold at higher average gross margins.
If, however,  the Company is unable to achieve such cost reductions,  it may not
be able to remain price competitive,  resulting in lost sales, and the Company's
gross margins could decline,  each of which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         During the second  quarter of 1998,  the  semiconductor  industry  as a
whole experienced significant production over capacity, and a further decline in
DRAM  pricing.  This  "buyers  market"  has created an  environment  of somewhat
irrational pricing even in flash memories. The Company believes that the current
semiconductor  down  cycle  may  continue  for the  next few  quarters,  putting
continuing pressure on average selling prices and product gross margins.

          Risks Associated with International Operations. Sales of the Company's
products  have been  denominated  to date  primarily in United  States  dollars.
Increases in the value of the United States  dollar could  increase the price of
the  Company's  products  so that  they  become  relatively  more  expensive  to
customers in the local currency of a particular country,  leading to a reduction
in sales and profitability in that country. Given the recent economic conditions
in Asia and the weakness of many Asian currencies  relative to the United States
dollar,  the Company's products are relatively more expensive in Asia, which has
resulted and may continue to result in a decrease in the Company's sales in that
region.  In the second  quarter of 1998,  sales to the Japan  declined to 30% of
total sales,  primarily as a result of the Japanese  economic  crisis and market
recession.  If the current market conditions in Japan do not improve, or further
decline, results of operations may be adversely affected.

         All of the Company's  wafers are, and for the  foreseeable  future will
be, produced by foundries located outside the United States. Because the Company
currently purchases a significant portion of its flash wafers in Japanese Yen at
set prices,  and bills  certain  customers  in  Japanese  Yen,  fluctuations  in
currencies could materially  adversely affect the Company's business,  financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.  In  addition,  gains and losses on the
conversion to United States dollars of accounts receivable, accounts payable and
other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international  operations may
contribute to  fluctuations in the Company's  results of operations.  Due to its
reliance on export  sales and its  dependence  on  foundries  outside the United
States,   the   Company  is  subject  to  the  risks  of   conducting   business
internationally,   including   foreign   government   regulation   and   general
geopolitical  risks  such  as  political  and  economic  instability,  potential
hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. Manufacturing and
sales of the  Company's  products may also be materially  adversely  affected by
factors  such  as   unexpected   changes  in,  or  imposition   of,   regulatory
requirements,  tariffs,  import and export  restrictions  and other barriers and
restrictions,  longer payment cycles,  greater difficulty in accounts receivable
collection,  potentially adverse tax consequences, the burdens of complying with
a variety of foreign laws and other  factors  beyond the Company's  control.  In
addition,  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the Company's products
are or may be developed,  manufactured or sold,  including  various countries in
Asia,  may not protect the Company's  intellectual  property  rights to the same
extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make piracy of the Company's
products a more likely possibility.

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>


There can be no assurance  that these  factors will not have a material  adverse
effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.

         Customer Concentration. A limited number of customers have historically
accounted  for a substantial  portion of the Company's  revenues and the Company
expects this trend to continue.  Sales to the Company's  customers are generally
made pursuant to standard purchase orders rather than long-term  contracts.  The
Company has also experienced significant changes in the composition of its major
customer  base from year to year and  expects  this  variability  to continue as
certain customers increase or decrease their purchases of the Company's products
as a result of fluctuations in market demand for such customers' products. Under
a joint cooperation  agreement signed in January 1993, Seagate has the option to
market the Company's products  beginning in 1999 and, if exercised,  the Company
will be required to coordinate sales with Seagate so that up to one-third of the
Company's  worldwide net revenues could be generated from sales of the Company's
flash products through  Seagate.  SanDisk may terminate this agreement by giving
one year written notice of termination beginning in January 1999.

         Dependence  on Third Party  Foundries.  All of the  Company's  products
require silicon wafers, which are currently supplied by United  Microelectronics
Corporation  ("UMC")  in Taiwan  and  Matsushita  in Japan.  The  Company  has a
development  agreement with NEC in Japan,  pursuant to which the Company expects
to receive initial wafer shipments once the products under development  complete
internal  qualification.  In the third  quarter  of 1997,  the  Company  made an
investment  in USIC,  a  semiconductor  manufacturing  venture  headed by UMC in
Taiwan.  The Company has arranged to receive  foundry wafers from a separate UMC
fabrication  facility  during the  qualification  of the USIC plant.  During the
second  quarter  of  1998,  the  Company  received  first  wafers  from the USIC
facility.  Under the current development  schedule,  the Company should complete
the qualification and start production at USIC in the third quarter of 1998. The
Company is  dependent  on its  foundries to allocate to the Company a portion of
their foundry capacity sufficient to meet the Company's needs, to produce wafers
of acceptable  quality and with acceptable  manufacturing  yields and to deliver
those  wafers to the Company on a timely  basis.  On  occasion,  the Company has
experienced  difficulties  in each of  these  areas.  The loss or  reduction  of
capacity  from any of its  foundry  suppliers  or the  inability  to  qualify or
receive the anticipated level of capacity from any of its manufacturing partners
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition  and results of  operations.  There can be no  assurance  that the NEC
fabrication  facility  will  commence  shipments  on  schedule  or that the USIC
facility will begin  production as  scheduled,  or that the processes  needed to
fabricate wafers for the Company will be qualified at either facility. Moreover,
there can be no assurance  that any of the Company's  suppliers  will be able to
maintain  acceptable  yields or  deliver  sufficient  quantities  of wafers on a
timely basis.

         Under each of the  Company's  wafer supply  agreements,  the Company is
obligated to provide a monthly rolling forecast of anticipated  purchase orders.
Except in limited circumstances and subject to acceptance by the foundries,  the
estimates  for the first  three  months of each  forecast  constitute  a binding
commitment  and the  estimates  for the  remaining  months may not  increase  or
decrease by more than a certain  percentage from the previous month's  forecast.
These   restrictions  limit  the  Company's  ability  to  react  to  significant
fluctuations in demand for its products.  As a result,  the Company has not been
able to match its purchases of wafers to specific  customer orders and therefore
the  Company  has from  time to time  taken  write  downs for  potential  excess
inventory  purchased prior to the receipt of customer orders and may be required
to do so in the future.  These adjustments decrease gross margins in the quarter
reported and have resulted,  and could in the future result in  fluctuations  in
gross  margins  on a  quarter  to  quarter  basis.  To the  extent  the  Company
inaccurately  forecasts  the  number of wafers  required,  it may have  either a
shortage  or an excess  supply of wafers,  either of which could have a material
adverse  effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations.   Additionally,  if  the  Company  is  unable  to  obtain  scheduled
quantities  of wafers from any foundry with  acceptable  yields,  the  Company's
business,  financial  condition  and results of  operations  could be negatively
impacted. See "Fluctuations in Operating Results."


                                    Page 21

         Dependence on Sole Source Suppliers and Third Party Subcontractors. The
Company purchases several critical components from single or sole source vendors
for  which  alternative  sources  are  not  currently   available.   Even  where
alternative  suppliers  are  available,  a  significant  amount of time would be
required to qualify an additional vendor in the case of certain of the Company's
components.  The Company does not maintain  long-term supply agreements with any
of these vendors.  The inability to develop alternative sources for these single
or sole source components or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components
could result in delays or reductions in product  shipments which could adversely
affect the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
For example,  the Company  relies on  Motorola,  Inc.  ("Motorola")  as the sole
source of certain designs of microcontrollers,  which are critical components in
the Company's  products.  The sole source risk associated with  microcontrollers
from  Motorola  is  heightened   during   transitions  from  one  generation  of
microcontrollers  to the next,  given the limited safety stock available  during
these  transitions.  In the  event  Motorola  were to  discontinue  shipment  of
microcontrollers  for any reason,  the time to design and qualify an alternative
source would be approximately  nine to twelve months.  The Company's reliance on
Motorola as its sole source of certain  microcontrollers  exposes the Company to
interruptions  of  supply  that  could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         The Company  uses  third-party  subcontractors  to assemble  the memory
components for its products and from time to time uses other  subcontractors  to
perform certain other assembly and test functions.  The Company has no long term
agreements  with these  subcontractors.  As a result of this  reliance  on third
party  subcontractors  for  assembly of a portion of its  products,  the Company
cannot directly  control product delivery  schedules,  which can lead to product
shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase  manufacturing costs
of the Company's products. Any problems associated with the delivery, quality or
cost of the  Company's  products  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         Risks  Associated  with  Transitioning  to New  Processes and Products.
Successive  generations  of the  Company's  products  incorporate  semiconductor
devices  with greater  memory  capacity  per chip.  In addition,  the Company is
continually  involved  in  joint  development  with  its  foundries  to  produce
semiconductor devices based upon smaller geometry manufacturing processes.  Both
the development of higher capacity  semiconductor devices and the implementation
of smaller geometry  manufacturing  processes are important  determinants of the
Company's  ability to decrease  the cost per  megabyte of its flash data storage
products.  The utilization of semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity
and the design and implementation of new semiconductor  manufacturing  processes
can  entail a  number  of  problems,  including  lower  yields  associated  with
semiconductor device production, problems associated with design and manufacture
of products to incorporate such devices,  and production delays.  Because of the
complexity of its products, the Company has periodically experienced significant
delays in the development and volume  production ramp up of its products.  There
can be no  assurance  that  similar  delays  will not occur in the  future.  Any
problems  experienced  by the  Company in its current or future  transitions  to
higher capacity memory devices or to new semiconductor  manufacturing  processes
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

         The Company has  developed  new products  based on D2 (Double  Density)
flash technology,  a new flash  architecture  designed to store two bits in each
flash memory cell. The Company began low-volume shipments of its 64Mbit D2 flash
products in the third quarter of 1997. The Company  introduced its new 80Mbit D2
flash chip in November 1997 and expects to begin customer  shipments of products
utilizing this chip in the second half of 1998. The Company  experienced  delays
in the  production  ramp up of the  64Mbit D2  technology  and has  subsequently
shifted its resources to the qualification and production  startup of the second
generation 80Mbit D2 design.  Consequently,  product revenues from the 64Mbit D2
were not  material in 1997,  and the product was made  obsolete by the 80Mbit D2
design.  The Company  believes  that D2 flash will be important to the Company's
ability  to  increase  the  capacity  and  decrease  the cost of  certain of its
products,  maintain its  competitive  advantage,  broaden its target markets and
attract strategic  partners.  High density flash memory,  such as D2 flash, is a
complex  technology  requiring tight  manufacturing  controls and effective test
screens. The shift to volume production for new flash products is particularly

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>


prone to  problems  which  can  impact  both  reliability  and  yields,  thereby
increasing manufacturing costs. There can be no assurance that reliable and cost
effective D2 flash products can be manufactured  in commercial  volumes and with
yields  sufficient  to result in a lower cost per megabyte.  Furthermore,  flash
data storage  products  designed  with 80Mbit D2 flash are expected to initially
exhibit  approximately  one-quarter  of the write  performance  of the Company's
existing products when writing data into memory, potentially excluding their use
in certain applications, such as digital cameras, thereby limiting their revenue
generating potential.

         Manufacturing  Yields.  The fabrication of the Company's  products is a
complex  and precise  process  requiring  wafers  that are  produced in a highly
controlled and clean environment.  Semiconductor companies supplying the Company
with wafers  periodically have experienced  problems achieving  acceptable wafer
manufacturing yields.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of
design technology,  which is developed by the Company, and manufacturing process
technology,  which is typically  proprietary to the foundry.  Because low yields
may  result  from  errors in  either  design or  manufacturing  failures,  yield
problems may not be  effectively  determined or improved until an actual product
exists that can be analyzed and tested to  recognize  process  sensitivities  in
relation to the design rules that were used. As a result, yield problems may not
be identified until the wafers are well into the production  process.  This risk
is  increased  due to the  fact  that  the  Company  receives  its  wafers  from
independent  offshore  foundries,  increasing  the effort and time  required  to
identify,  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. There can be no
assurance  that the  Company's  foundries  will  achieve or maintain  acceptable
manufacturing  yields in the  future.  The  inability  of the Company to achieve
planned  yields from its foundries  could have a material  adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         Patents,  Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation. The Company relies
on a  combination  of patents,  trademarks,  copyright  and trade  secret  laws,
confidentiality   procedures   and   licensing   arrangements   to  protect  its
intellectual  property rights. The Company has been notified in the past and the
Company and its  foundries may be notified in the future of claims that they may
be  infringing  patents or other  intellectual  property  rights  owned by third
parties.  In the past the Company  has been  involved  in  significant  disputes
regarding its  intellectual  property  rights and believes it may be involved in
similar disputes in the future. There can be no assurance that in the future any
patents held by the Company will not be invalidated, that patents will be issued
for any of the Company's  pending  applications  or that any claims allowed from
existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued
in the primary  countries  where the  Company's  products can be sold to provide
meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the Company.  Additionally,
competitors of the Company may be able to design around the Company's patents.

         To preserve its intellectual  property rights,  the Company believes it
may be  necessary  to initiate  litigation  against  one or more third  parties,
including but not limited to those the Company has already  notified of possible
patent  infringement.  In addition,  one or more of these parties may bring suit
against the  Company.  In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal
court against Lexar for infringement of a fundamental  flash disk patent.  Lexar
has disputed  the  Company's  claim of patent  infringement,  claimed  SanDisk's
patent is invalid or unenforceable and asserted various counterclaims  including
unfair  competition,  violation of the Lanham Act,  patent misuse,  interference
with prospective  economic  advantage,  trade defamation and fraud.  SanDisk has
denied each of Lexar's  counterclaims.  In July 1998, the federal district court
denied  Lexar's  request to have the case  dismissed  on the grounds the Company
failed to perform an adequate prefiling investigation. As a result, discovery in
the Lexar suit will commence in August 1998.  The Company  intends to vigorously
enforce its patents,  but there can be no assurance  that these  efforts will be
successful.

         In the event of an adverse result in any such  litigation,  the Company
could be required to pay substantial  damages,  cease the  manufacture,  use and
sale  of  infringing   products,   expend   significant   resources  to  develop
non-infringing  technology,  discontinue the use of certain  processes or obtain
licenses to the infringing technology. Any litigation, whether as a plaintiff or
as a defendant, would likely result in

                                    Page 23
<PAGE>


significant  expense to the  Company  and divert  the  efforts of the  Company's
technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is ultimately
determined in favor of the Company.  In addition,  the results of any litigation
are inherently uncertain.

         In the event the Company desires to incorporate  third party technology
into its  products or is found to infringe  on others'  patents or  intellectual
property  rights,  the  Company  may be  required  to  license  such  patents or
intellectual  property rights.  The Company may also need to license some or all
of its patent  portfolio to be able to obtain  cross-licenses  to the patents of
others. The Company currently has patent cross-license  agreements with Hitachi,
Intel, Samsung,  Sharp, SST and Toshiba. From time to time, the Company has also
entered into discussions with other companies regarding potential  cross-license
agreements for the Company's  patents.  However,  there can be no assurance that
licenses  will be  offered  or that the terms of any  offered  licenses  will be
acceptable to the Company.  If the Company obtains  licenses from third parties,
it may be required to pay license  fees or make  royalty  payments,  which could
have a material  adverse effect on the Company's  gross margins.  The failure to
obtain a license  from a third party for  technology  used by the Company  could
cause  the  Company  to  incur  substantial   liabilities  and  to  suspend  the
manufacture  of  products or the use by the  Company's  foundries  of  processes
requiring the technology,  or to expend  substantial  resources  redesigning its
products to  eliminate  the  infringement.  There can be no  assurance  that the
Company would be successful  in  redesigning  its products or that such licenses
would be available under reasonable terms. Furthermore,  any such development or
license  negotiations could require  substantial  expenditures of time and other
resources by the Company.

         As is common in the industry,  the Company agrees to indemnify  certain
of its suppliers and customers  for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances,  include  indemnification for
damages and expenses,  including  attorneys'  fees. The Company may from time to
time be engaged in litigation as a result of such  indemnification  obligations.
Third party claims for patent  infringement are excluded from coverage under the
Company's  insurance  policies.  There  can  be no  assurance  that  any  future
obligation to indemnify the  Company's  customers or suppliers,  will not have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         Management  of Growth.  The Company has  recently  experienced  and may
continue to experience  rapid growth,  which has placed,  and could  continue to
place,  a  significant  strain  on the  Company's  limited  personnel  and other
resources. To manage such growth effectively,  the Company will need to continue
to implement and improve its operational,  financial and management  information
systems and to hire,  train,  motivate and manage its employees.  In particular,
the Company has on occasion  experienced  difficulty in hiring the  engineering,
sales and marketing  personnel  necessary to support the growth of the Company's
business.  Competition  for such  personnel  is  intense,  and  there  can be no
assurance  that the Company will be successful in attracting  and retaining such
personnel  or that the Company  will be able to manage such growth  effectively.
The Company's ability to manage its growth will require a significant investment
in and  expansion of its existing  internal  information  management  systems to
support  increased  manufacturing,   accounting  and  other  management  related
functions.  The Company is in the process of  replacing  its  existing  in-house
information  system. The implementation of the new system will impact almost all
phases of the Company's operations (i.e., planning,  manufacturing,  finance and
accounting).  The new system is currently scheduled to become operational in the
fourth  quarter of 1998.  There can be no  assurance  that the Company  will not
experience  problems,  delays or unanticipated  additional costs in implementing
the new management  information system or in the use of its existing system that
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition and results of operations, particularly in the period in which the new
system is brought online. The failure of the Company to successfully  manage any
of these issues would have a material adverse effect on the Company's  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

         Dependence  on  Key  Personnel.  The  Company's  success  depends  to a
significant  degree upon the  continued  contributions  of members of its senior
management  and  other  key  research  and  development,  sales,  marketing  and
operations personnel,  including,  in particular,  Dr. Eli Harari, the Company's
founder,  President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of any of such persons
could have a material adverse effect

                                    Page 24
<PAGE>


on the Company's business,  financial  condition and results of operations.  The
Company does not have an employment agreement or non-competition  agreement with
any of its employees.

         Volatility  of Stock  Price.  There has been a history  of  significant
volatility  in the market  prices of the  Company's  Common  Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market,  and it is likely that the market price of the Company's Common
Stock will continue to be subject to significant  fluctuations.  For example, in
1997,  the Company's  stock price  fluctuated  from a low of $8 7/8 to a high of
$40. The Company believes that future announcements  concerning the Company, its
competitors or its principal customers, including technological innovations, new
product  introductions,  governmental  regulations,  litigation  or  changes  in
earnings  estimated by analysts,  may cause the market price of the Common Stock
to fluctuate  substantially in the future.  Sales of substantial  amounts of the
Company's  outstanding  Common  Stock  in the  public  market  could  materially
adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock.  Further, in recent years
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
particularly  affected  the  market  prices  of equity  securities  of many high
technology  companies  and that  often  have  been  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of such companies.  These  fluctuations as well as general economic,
political and market  conditions  such as recessions or  international  currency
fluctuations,  may  materially  adversely  affect the market price of the Common
Stock.

         Year 2000 Compliance.  The Company is aware of problems associated with
computer systems as the year 2000 approaches.  Year 2000 problems are the result
of common  computer  programming  techniques  that result in systems that do not
function  properly when  manipulating  dates later than  December 31, 1999.  The
issue is complex and wide ranging. The problem may affect transaction processing
computer  applications  used  by  the  Company  for  accounting,   distribution,
manufacturing,  and planning.  The problem may also affect embedded systems such
as building security systems, machine controllers and production test equipment.
Year 2000 problems with these systems may affect the ability or efficiency  with
which the company can perform  many  significant  functions,  including  but not
limited to: order processing, material planning, product assembly, product test,
invoicing,  and  financial  reporting.  In addition,  the problem may affect the
computer  systems of the Company's  suppliers and  customers,  disrupting  their
operations.  Year 2000 problems with the Company's  business partners may impact
the Company's sources of supply and demand.

         The  costs  and time  schedule  for the  Company's  Year  2000  problem
abatement   program  are  based  on   management's   best   estimates   for  the
implementation of its new management  information  system and year 2000 problems
uncovered to date. These estimates were derived utilizing numerous  assumptions,
including  that  the  most   significant  Year  2000  risks  have  already  been
identified,  that certain  resources  will continue to be available,  that third
party  plans will be  fulfilled,  and other  factors.  However,  there can be no
guarantee  that these  estimates will be achieved or that the  anticipated  time
schedule  will be met and actual  results  could  differ  materially  from those
anticipated.

         Specific  contingency  plans for systems that pose  significant risk to
on-going operations are being developed under the auspices of the Company's year
2000  Risk  Management  program.  If the  Company  is  unable  to  complete  the
replacement of its core  management  information  system in a timely manner,  an
alternative  plan has been developed.  This plan consists of applying  available
vendor  supplied  software  patches to the existing  system.  The costs and time
involved to  complete  this  alternative  are  expected  to be  minimal.  Should
previously  undetected  Year  2000  problems  be found in other  systems,  these
systems will either be upgraded, replaced, turned off, or operated in place with
manual  procedures  to  compensate  for their  deficiencies.  While the  Company
believes  that these  alternative  plans would be adequate to meet the Company's
needs without  materially  impacting its  operations,  there can be no assurance
that such  alternatives  would be successful  or that the  Company's  results of
operations  would  not  be  materially  adversely  affected  by the  delays  and
inefficiencies inherent in conducting operations in this manner.

         Failure  of  the  Company's   internal  computer  systems  or  of  such
third-party  equipment or software,  or of systems  maintained  by the Company's
suppliers, to operate properly with regard to the Year 2000 and thereafter could
require the  Company to incur  unanticipated  expenses  to remedy any  problems,
which

                                    Page 25
<PAGE>


could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  operating
results and financial  condition.  There can be no assurance  that the Company's
insurance will cover losses from business  interruptions  arising from year 2000
problems of the Company or its suppliers.  Furthermore,  the purchasing patterns
of customers or potential  customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues.  which
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  operating
results and financial condition.

         Effect of Anti-Takeover  Provisions.  The Company has taken a number of
actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt that might
be  beneficial  to  stockholders  who wish to receive a premium for their shares
from a potential bidder.  The Company has adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan that
would cause substantial dilution to a person who attempts to acquire the Company
on terms not  approved by the  Company's  Board of  Directors.  The  Shareholder
Rights Plan may therefore  have the effect of delaying or preventing  any change
in  control  and  deterring  any  prospective  acquisition  of the  Company.  In
addition,  the  Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  grants  the  Board of
Directors the authority to issue up to 4,000,000  shares of Preferred  Stock and
to determine  the price,  rights,  preferences  and  privileges  of those shares
without any further vote or action by the Company's stockholders.  The rights of
the holders of Common  Stock will be subject to, and may be  adversely  affected
by, the  rights of the  holders  of any  shares of  Preferred  Stock that may be
issued in the future. While the Company has no present intention to issue shares
of Preferred  Stock,  such issuance,  while providing  desirable  flexibility in
connection with possible  acquisitions and other corporate purposes,  could have
the effect of making it more  difficult or less  attractive for a third party to
acquire  a  majority  of the  outstanding  voting  stock  of the  Company.  Such
Preferred Stock may also have other rights,  including economic rights senior to
the Common Stock,  and, as a result,  the issuance thereof could have a material
adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock. Furthermore, the Company
is subject  to the  anti-takeover  provisions  of  Section  203 of the  Delaware
General  Corporation  Law  ("Section  203"),  which  prohibits  the Company from
engaging in a "business  combination"  with an  "interested  stockholder"  for a
period of three  years  after the date of the  transaction  in which the  person
first becomes an "interested  stockholder,"  unless the business  combination is
approved in a prescribed  manner. The application of Section 203 also could have
the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company.

                                INDUSTRIAL LEASE


         THIS INDUSTRIAL  LEASE (this "Lease") is entered into on and as of June
10,  1998 by and  between  G. F.  PROPERTIES,  INC.,  a  California  corporation
("Landlord") and SANDISK CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Tenant").

                                    Recitals

         A. Landlord is the owner of that certain real property  located at, 111
Java  Drive,  Sunnyvale,  California,  94089,  in the County of Santa Clara (the
"Property")  comprising  a portion the Moffett  Industrial  Park.  Landlord  has
constructed  on a  portion  of the  Property  that  certain  building  and other
improvements  consisting  of  approximately  Fifty  Thousand,  Three Hundred and
Twenty  (50,320)  rentable  square feet (the  "Building") and one fully enclosed
storage  area  which  extends  beyond the  original  footprint  of the  Building
consisting  of   approximately   Eighteen   Hundred  (1,800)  square  feet  (the
"Warehouse").  For  purposes  of this  Lease,  the term  "Premises"  shall refer
collectively to the Property,  the Building and the Warehouse.  The Premises are
more  particularly  described  in  Exhibit A attached  hereto  and  incorporated
herein.

         B. In accordance with the election of Tenant, pursuant to the terms and
provisions of the First  Amendment to  Industrial  Lease dated April 3, 1997, by
and between  Landlord  and Tenant with  respect to the  Premises  located at 140
Caspian Court, Sunnyvale, California ("First Amendment"),  Landlord has given to
the existing  tenant of the Premises at 111 Java Drive the Notice of Termination
of Tenancy on 111 Java Drive provided for in Paragraph 2 of the First  Amendment
to  Industrial  Lease.  The Notice of  Termination  of Tenancy on 111 Java Drive
requires the existing tenant to surrender  possession of the Premises  effective
July 1, 1998.

         C.  Having  exercised  its  rights  under the First  Amendment,  Tenant
desires to lease the Premises  from  Landlord and Landlord  desires to lease the
Premises to Tenant on the terms and conditions contained in this Lease.

         NOW, THEREFORE,  for good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

SECTION 1.     Lease of the Premises.

         Landlord  leases to Tenant and Tenant leases from Landlord the Premises
on the terms and conditions contained in this Lease.




                                       1
<PAGE>


SECTION 2.     Term of Lease.

         The term of this Lease (the "Term")  shall  commence  promptly upon the
surrender of the Property and the Premises by the current tenant of the Premises
(the  "Commencement  Date"), and shall terminate on July 31, 2001, unless sooner
terminated  pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Lease  (the  "Termination  Date").
Landlord  shall  expend  its best  efforts  to cause the  current  tenant of the
Premises to vacate the Premises upon the  expiration or earlier  termination  of
its current  lease,  as amended,  provided,  however that if Landlord  shall not
succeed in causing the current  tenant of the Premises to vacate the Premises on
or before December 31, 1998, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease
by giving  Landlord  unequivocal  written notice of its election to so terminate
this Lease no sooner than December 31, 1998 and no later than January 8, 1999.

SECTION 3.     Intentionally Omitted

SECTION 4.     Possession.

         Except as  otherwise  provided in this Lease,  Tenant  agrees to accept
possession  of the  Premises on the  Commencement  Date in its  existing "as is"
condition,  including  but not  limited to all patent  and  latent  defects  and
subject to all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations  governing  and
regulating  the use of the  Premises,  and any recorded  covenants,  conditions,
restrictions,  easements,  licenses or right of ways.  Prior to the execution of
this Lease,  Landlord has provided Tenant with copies of any recorded covenants,
conditions,  restrictions,  easements,  licenses  or  right  of  ways.  Landlord
represents  and  warrants  that to the  best of  Landlord's  knowledge,  without
inquiry or investigation, no ground leases, covenants, conditions, restrictions,
easements,  licenses  or right of ways  burden  the  Premises  except  for those
provided to Tenant by Landlord prior to the execution of this Lease.

SECTION 5.     Monthly Rent.

         (a) Commencing on the Commencement  Date,  Tenant agrees to pay monthly
rent ("Monthly Rent") as follows:

         Months:           Monthly Rent:              Rent per RSF per month:
                                                      Building / Warehouse
7-1-98 to 1-31-99          41,488.20                  $.81 / $.405
2-1-99 to 7-31-99          43,537.00                  $.85 / $.425
8-1-99 to 7-31-01          46,098.00                  $.90 / $.45

         (b) The Monthly Rent shall be payable in advance on the first  calendar
day of each month at the following address: 999 Baker Way, Suite 200, San Mateo,
California,  94404 or at such other  address that Landlord may from time to time
designate by written notice to Tenant. In the event that the Termination Date is
a day other than the last day of

                                       2
<PAGE>


a calendar month,  then the Monthly Rent for the applicable  fractional month of
the Term shall be appropriately prorated.

         (c) Upon  execution of the Lease,  Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum
of One Hundred  and  Twenty-Four  Thousand  Four  Hundred  Sixty Four and 60/100
Dollars
(124,464.60) to be applied toward the first three payments of Monthly Rent.

         (d) In the event of a Chronic Delinquency (as hereinafter  defined), at
Landlord's  option,  Landlord  shall have the right,  in  addition  to all other
remedies  under this Lease and at law, to require  that  Monthly Rent be paid by
Tenant quarterly,  in advance.  This provision shall not limit in any way nor be
construed as a waiver of any rights and remedies of Landlord  provided herein or
by law in the event of delinquency.  "Chronic Delinquency" shall mean failure by
Tenant to pay Monthly Rent, or any other payments  required to be paid by Tenant
under  this  Lease,  when  due  in any  of  three  (3)  months  (consecutive  or
non-consecutive) during any twelve (12) month period.

         (e) The Monthly Rent is based upon the mutual  assumptions that (i) the
Building  (less the  subterranean  storage area)  contains  approximately  Fifty
Thousand Three Hundred Twenty  (50,320)  rentable square feet, and (ii) that the
Warehouse contains  approximately One Thousand Eight Hundred (1,800) square feet
("Landlord's  Measurement").  While the Premises  includes both the subterranean
storage space and the partially  enclosed  storage area which extends beyond the
footprint of the  Building,  and while no rent shall be charged to or payable by
Tenant  for  either  of such  spaces  under  this  Lease,  all  other  terms and
provisions  of this Lease shall apply to both of such spaces.  Tenant shall have
the right to cause the  measurement of the Premises in accordance  with Building
Owners and Managers Association standards ANSI Z65.1-1980 (the "BOMA Standards")
and if such  measurement  results in a  determination  that the actual  rentable
square footage of the Premises varies from  Landlord's  Measurement by more than
two percent (2%),  Tenant may submit to Landlord  Tenant's  measurements  of the
Premises  within thirty (30) days after the  Commencement  Date. If Landlord and
Tenant fail to agree on the rentable  square footage of the Premises  within ten
(10) business days after  delivery of Tenant's  measurements  of the Premises to
Landlord,  Landlord  and Tenant  shall  resolve  the dispute by  submitting  the
dispute to an architect reasonably  acceptable to both parties who is . familiar
with the BOMA  Standards  (the  "Architect").  The  Architect  shall  review the
measurements of Tenant and Landlord and if necessary re-measure the Premises and
shall submit its determination of the rentable square footage of the Premises to
Landlord and Tenant within ten (10) business days after the dispute is submitted
to the Architect.  In the event that the Architect  determines that the rentable
square  footage  deviates from  Landlord's  Measurement by more than two percent
(2%),  the  Monthly  Rent  schedule  contained  in Section  5(a) above  shall be
modified  to  reflect  the  correct  rentable  square  footage  of the  Premises
multiplied by the rent per square foot shown in the schedule.  Such modification
shall be  effective  as of the  Commencement  Date and shall be  evidenced by an
amendment to this Lease to be executed by the parties.


                                       3
<PAGE>


          (f) Tenant  shall be entitled to a rent credit which shall be credited
against the rent due from Tenant to Landlord during the first months of the term
of this Lease.  The rent credit shall be calculated by multiplying the number of
full calendar months during which the current tenant of the Premises  remains in
possession  of the Premises  after  December 31, 1997,  by the sum of $5,283.60,
provided,  however,  that Tenant shall only be entitled to such rent credit, and
such rent credit  shall only be credited by Landlord to Tenant,  during any such
holdover  period  if,  when and to the  extent  that the  current  tenant of the
Premises pays its rent, including any holdover rent, for the applicable holdover
periods to Landlord.  Any such rent credit which is for less than one full month
shall be prorated based on the actual number of days of the month involved.

SECTION 6.     Use.

(a) Tenant will occupy and use the  Premises  for  general  office,  electronics
manufacturing, warehousing, and shipping connected therewith and for any related
lawful use.  Tenant  agrees not to use the  Premises for any immoral or unlawful
purpose. Landlord agrees that, subject to Section 18 and to the prior reasonable
review and approval by Landlord and compliance with all applicable  governmental
requirements,  including but not limited to the American with  Disabilities Act,
and any signing criteria in any covenants, conditions, and restrictions recorded
prior to the date of this Lease,  Tenant may erect and  maintain on the Premises
and the building and improvements any signs advertising  Tenant's  business,  as
Tenant may desire.

         (b)  Tenant  shall not  commit  any acts on the  Premises,  nor use the
Premises in any manner that will cause the cancellation of any fire,  liability,
or other insurance  policy insuring or hereinafter  insuring the Premises or the
improvements  on the Premises.  Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost and expense,
comply with all requirements of Landlord's insurance carriers that are necessary
for  the  continued  maintenance  at  reasonable  rates  of fire  and  liability
insurance policies on the Premises and the improvements on the Premises.

         (c) Tenant shall not commit or allow any waste or any public or private
nuisance in, on or under the Premises.

         (d) Except as  otherwise  provided  in  Sections  10, 19 and 43 hereof,
Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost,  promptly  comply with all laws,  statutes,
ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, recorded covenants and restrictions, and
requirements of all municipal,  state,  and federal  authorities now or later in
force,  including,  but not limited to, all  provisions  of the  Americans  with
Disabilities  Act (the "ADA"),  all seismic  retrofitting  and other  earthquake
protection measures being required by any governmental entity with regard to the
Premises,  any  requirements  of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations,
the requirements of any board of fire  underwriters or other similar body now or
in the future constituted,  and the direction or occupancy certificate issued by
public officers (collectively the "Legal Requirements"),  insofar as they relate
to the condition,  occupancy and use of the Premises,  the  construction  of the
Tenant Improvements (as hereinafter  defined) and the construction of any future
Alterations (as hereinafter defined),

                                       4
<PAGE>


including  but not  limited to the  correction  or  remediation  of a  violation
arising out of or in connection with the construction of Tenant  Improvements or
other  Alterations  done by or on behalf of Tenant or which violation arises out
of or  results  from the  actions  of  Tenant  or any of  Tenant's  contractors,
employees, licensees, invitees or agents. The judgment of any court of competent
jurisdiction  or the  admission  of Tenant in any action or  proceeding  against
Tenant that Tenant has violated any Legal Requirement in the condition,  use, or
occupancy of the Premises,  will be conclusive of that fact as between  Landlord
and Tenant.

SECTION 7.     Utilities.

         From  and  after  the  Commencement  Date,  Tenant  shall  pay,  before
delinquency,  all charges or assessments for telephone, water, sewer, gas, heat,
electricity,   garbage  disposal,  trash  disposal,  fire  sprinkler  and  alarm
monitoring and any and all other  utilities or maintenance  charges and services
of any  kind  that may be used on or in  connection  with  the  Premises.  If an
interruption  or  cessation of utilities  results from the gross  negligence  or
willful  misconduct of Landlord,  its employees,  agents, or contractors and the
Premises  are not  reasonably  usable  by Tenant  for the  conduct  of  Tenant's
business as a result  thereof,  Monthly  Rent not  actually  incurred up to that
point by Tenant shall be abated for the period which commences five (5) business
days after the date Tenant gives to Landlord written notice of such interruption
until such  utilities  are  restored.  Except  the  abatement  of Monthly  Rent,
Landlord  shall  not be  liable  to Tenant  for any  damages  occasioned  by any
interruption   or  cessation  of   utilities,   including  but  not  limited  to
consequential, speculative or anticipatory damages.

SECTION 8.     Taxes.

         (a) Within ten (10)  business  days  after  receipt of an invoice  from
Landlord,  Tenant shall, as additional rent,  reimburse  Landlord for all taxes,
permit,  inspection,  and license  fees,  and other  public  charges of whatever
nature  (other than  penalties and interest for the late payment of taxes except
to the extent that such penalties and interest  arise in connection  with a good
faith protest of such taxes by Landlord) that are assessed  against the Premises
or arise because of the occupancy, use, or possession of the Premises (including
but not limited to taxes on, or which shall be measured  by, any rents or rental
income,  taxes on personal property,  whether of Landlord or Tenant and taxes or
increases in taxes which result from reassessment of the Premises due to changes
in ownership  thereof during the Term or which result from the  reassessment  of
the Premises due to the improvement thereof) (collectively "Real Estate Taxes"),
subsequent to the  Commencement  Date, and all  installments of assessments that
are due or become  due from and after the  Commencement  Date and on or prior to
the  expiration  or  sooner  termination  of  this  Lease.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  "Real  Estate  Taxes"  shall not  include  and  Tenant  shall not be
responsible for any taxes in the nature of estate,  inheritance,  transfer, gift
or franchise  taxes of Landlord or the federal or state income taxes  imposed on
Landlord's  income  from all  sources or net income  taxes  imposed on  Landlord
unless such

                                       5
<PAGE>


net  income  taxes  are in  substitution  or in  lieu of real  estate  taxes  or
assessments against the Premises.

         (b) Tenant  shall pay directly to the public  authorities  charged with
the  collection  on or before the last day on which  payment may be made without
penalty or interest,  as additional  rent, all taxes,  permit,  inspection,  and
license  fees,  and other  public  charges of whatever  nature that are assessed
against Tenant's personal property, subsequent to the Commencement Date, and all
installments  of  assessments  that are due or  become  due from and  after  the
Commencement  Date and on or prior to the  expiration or sooner  termination  of
this Lease.

         (c) All Real Estate  Taxes  levied on the  Premises for the tax year in
which the  Commencement  Date  falls  shall be  appropriately  prorated  between
Landlord and Tenant, so that Tenant's share will reflect the portion of that tax
year after the Commencement  Date. Taxes levied on the Premises for the tax year
in which  the  Termination  Date  occurs  shall be  similarly  prorated  between
Landlord and Tenant to reflect the period of Tenant's possession of the Premises
during that tax year.  Real Estate  Taxes  reimbursable  from Tenant in any year
shall include only installments of taxes and assessments which would have become
due during such year if Landlord  had elected to pay such taxes and  assessments
in the maximum number of installments thereof.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section,
Tenant shall have the right to contest or appeal the validity or the legality of
any tax (including penalties and interest), assessment, tax lien, forfeiture, or
other  imposition or charge  against the Premises or any part of the Premises or
any  improvements  (each a "Tax" and  collectively  "Taxes"),  so long as Tenant
diligently  and in good  faith  pursues  such  contest  or appeal  to  fruition;
provided however, that notwithstanding  Tenant's desire to contest or appeal the
validity or the legality of any Tax,  Landlord  shall have the right in its sole
discretion  to pay such Tax and Tenant  shall,  as a condition  precedent to its
right to contest or appeal the  imposition  of any Tax,  reimburse  Landlord for
such Tax in accordance  with Section 8(a).  Any  proceedings  for  contesting or
appealing the validity, legality, or amount of any tax, assessment,  imposition,
or charge,  or to recover  any tax,  assessment,  imposition,  or charge paid by
Tenant,  may be  brought  by  Tenant in the name of  Landlord  or in the name of
Tenant, or both, as Tenant deems advisable.  Landlord agrees that Landlord will,
upon the reasonable  request of Tenant,  execute or join in the execution of any
instrument or document necessary in connection with any proceeding.  However, if
any  proceedings are brought by Tenant,  Tenant agrees to indemnify,  defend and
hold Landlord  harmless for all  reasonable  loss,  cost, or expense that may be
imposed on Landlord in  connection  with the  proceeding.  In any event,  Tenant
shall  notify  Landlord  in advance of any tax contest  proceedings  that Tenant
intends  to  initiate,  and  shall  then  inform  Landlord  of  all  significant
developments  in  the  proceedings  as  they  may  occur.  Upon  the  successful
conclusion of any such contest or appeal, Landlord agrees to, at Landlord's sole
discretion,  either (i) pay over to Tenant such  amounts as shall be returned to
Landlord in connection with such appeal or contest or (ii) apply such amounts as
shall be returned to

                                       6
<PAGE>


Landlord in  connection  with such appeal or contest to amounts  then owing from
Tenant to Landlord under this Lease.

         (e) If  Tenant  has not paid  any tax,  assessment,  or  public  charge
required by this Lease to be paid by Tenant before its delinquency, or if a tax,
assessment, or public charge is contested by Tenant and that tax, assessment, or
public  charge  has  not  been  paid  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  a final
determination  of the validity,  legality,  or amount of the tax,  assessment or
public  charge,  then  Landlord  may,  but shall  not be  required  to,  pay and
discharge the tax, assessment, or public charge. If a tax, assessment, or public
charge,  including penalties and interest,  are paid by Landlord,  the amount of
that  payment  shall be due and  payable  to  Landlord  by Tenant  with the next
succeeding  rental  installment,  and shall bear  interest  at the lesser of ten
percent  (10%) per annum or the highest rate allowed by law from the date of the
payment by Landlord until repayment by Tenant.

         (f) If any assessments for local  improvements  become a lien after the
Commencement  Date,  Tenant shall pay only the  installments  of the assessments
that become due and payable during the Term. On the request of Tenant,  Landlord
agrees to cooperate or join with Tenant in any application that may be necessary
to permit the payment of the assessments in installments.

SECTION 9.     Intentionally Omitted

SECTION 10.     Repairs and Maintenance.

         (a) Except as  otherwise  provided  in  Sections  10, 19 and 43 hereof,
Tenant  shall,  at  Tenant's  sole  expense,  keep  and  maintain  the  Premises
(including  without   limitation,   interior  walls,  roof  membrane,   heating,
ventilation and air conditioning systems, operating systems, sidewalks,  parking
lots, interior and exterior glass, fire sprinklers,  alarms and landscaping that
are part of or adjoin the  Premises) in a clean and good  condition  and repair,
including without limitation  replacements as needed thereof,  and to deliver to
Landlord physical possession of the Premises at the termination of this Lease or
any sooner expiration thereof, in good condition and repair, reasonable wear and
tear excepted. All repairs and replacements required of Tenant shall be promptly
made  with new  materials  of like kind and  quality.  If the work  affects  the
structural  elements  of the  Premises or if the  estimated  cost of any item of
repair or replacement is in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00),  Tenant
shall first obtain  Landlord's  written  approval of the scope of the work,  the
plans  for the work,  the  materials  to be used,  and the  contractor  hired to
perform the work.  In the event that any singular  repair of the roof  membrane,
the HVAC system,  the parking lot, the fire sprinklers or the building operating
systems  of  a  capital  nature  costs  in  excess  of  Fifty  Thousand  dollars
($50,000.00)  (each a "Singular  Capital  Expenditure") or in the event that the
aggregate cost of replacing HVAC units  installed in the Premises  exceeds Fifty
Thousand dollars  ($50,000.00) during the Term (each replacement a "HVAC Capital
Expenditure"),  Tenant  shall have the right to cause  Landlord  to pay for such
Singular  Capital   Expenditure  or  the  excess  over  Fifty  Thousand  Dollars
($50,000.00) of the HVAC Capital Expenditures ("Excess HVAC Capital

                                       7
<PAGE>


Expenditure"), provided that Landlord shall amortize the amount paid by Landlord
over the useful life of such Singular  Capital  Expenditure  or such Excess HVAC
Capital Expenditure, as the case may be, and Tenant shall pay as additional rent
to  Landlord  on or  before  the  first day of the  calendar  month  immediately
following the payment of such Singular  Capital  Expenditure or such Excess HVAC
Capital  Expenditure  by Landlord,  as the case may be, and on each  anniversary
thereof  during the Term,  an amount  equal to the annual  amortization  of such
Singular Capital Expenditure and/or such Excess HVAC Capital Expenditure, as the
case may be.

         (b) Tenant shall maintain continuously throughout the term of the Lease
a service  contract for the maintenance of all heating,  air  conditioning,  and
ventilation  equipment  with  a  licensed  repair  and  maintenance   contractor
reasonably  approved by  Landlord;  the  contract  should  provide for  periodic
inspections  and servicing of the heating,  air  conditioning,  and  ventilation
equipment at least once every ninety (90) days during the term of the Lease (the
"HVAC Contract").

         (c) Tenant shall maintain continuously throughout the term of the Lease
a service  contract for the monitoring of fire  sprinklers and alarms located on
or about the Premises with a licensed service, which contract shall, inter alia,
provide  for the  periodic  testing  and if  necessary  replacement  of the fire
sprinklers  and  alarms  located  on or about the  Premises  (the  "Life  Safety
Contract").

         (d)  Within  ten (10),  days of the  Commencement  date,  Tenant  shall
provide copies of the HVAC Contract and the Life Safety Contract to Landlord.

         (e) If at any time during the Term,  including  renewals or  extensions
thereof, Tenant fails to maintain the Premises, make any repairs or replacements
as  required  by this  Section or maintain  service  contracts  required by this
Section,  Landlord  shall have the right to, but shall not be required to, enter
the Premises and perform the  maintenance or make the repairs or replacements or
enter  into  appropriate  service  contracts,  as the case  may be,  all for the
account of Tenant and any sums  expended by Landlord in so doing,  together with
interest  at the  lesser of ten  percent  (10%) per  annum or the  highest  rate
allowed by law, shall be deemed  additional  rent and shall be  immediately  due
from Tenant on demand of Landlord.

         (f) Tenant waives the provisions of Civil Code ss.ss. 1941 and 1942 and
any  other law that  would  require  Landlord  to  maintain  the  Premises  in a
tenantable  condition or would provide Tenant with the right to make repairs and
deduct the cost of those repairs from the rent.

         (g) Landlord agrees that after the Substantial Completion of the Tenant
Improvements,  it shall, at its sole expense,  maintain,  repair and comply with
all Legal Requirements regarding the building foundation, the exterior walls and
the roof  structure of the  Premises,  including any latent  defects  discovered
therein; provided however that Landlord shall not be responsible for any repairs
to or maintenance to the building

                                       8
<PAGE>


foundation,  exterior  walls or roof  structure  caused by or resulting from the
actions of Tenant or any of Tenant's contractors, employees, licensees, invitees
or agents other than ordinary and customary wear and tear. Tenant agrees that it
shall be responsible for and shall promptly repair or replace, as necessary, any
part or portion of the  building  foundation,  the  exterior  walls and the roof
structure of the Premises;  which repair or maintenance arises out of or results
from the actions of Tenant or any of Tenant's contractors, employees, licensees,
invitees or agents.  In  addition,  Landlord  agrees that after the  Substantial
Completion of the Tenant  Improvements,  it shall be  responsible  for and shall
promptly repair or replace,  as necessary,  any part or portion of the Premises,
which  repair or  maintenance  arises  out of or  results  from the  actions  of
Landlord or any of Landlord's  contractors,  employees,  licensees,  invitees or
agents (other than Tenant).

         (h) In the event of an emergency  (being defined as an imminent  threat
of  personal  injury to  Tenant's  employees  or  material  damage  to  Tenant's
equipment  or other  property at the  Premises),  Tenant shall have the right to
make such temporary,  emergency  repairs to the roof  structure,  foundation and
exterior  walls of the Premises as may be  reasonably  necessary to prevent such
personal  injury or  material  damage to the  equipment  or  property  of Tenant
situated in the Premises,  provided Tenant has no reasonable alternative and has
either (i) notified  Landlord's  representative  of such  emergency by telephone
(with subsequent  written notice as soon as practicable) and Landlord has failed
to  initiate  emergency  repairs  within a  reasonable  period of time under the
circumstances,  but in no event  longer than  forty-eight  (48) hours after such
telephonic  notification,  or (ii) Tenant has  attempted in good faith to notify
Landlord's  representative  of such  emergency  by  telephone  (with  subsequent
written notice as soon as practicable) and has been unsuccessful in its attempts
to  contact  such  representative  for  a  time  period  commensurate  with  the
circumstances, but in no event more than forty-eight (48) hours after attempting
to contact Landlord. Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable,  out-of
pocket costs actually incurred by Tenant in making such emergency repairs to the
roof structure,  foundation or exterior walls, as applicable, within thirty (30)
days after submission by Tenant to Landlord of any invoice therefor, accompanied
by reasonable supporting documentation for the costs so incurred.

         (i)  Landlord  shall keep and maintain the exterior of the Premises and
all  grounds  and  landscaping  in  good  condition,  and  repair  (collectively
"Exterior  Maintenance").  Within  twenty (20) business days after receipt of an
invoice from Landlord,  Tenant shall, as additional rent, reimburse Landlord for
all costs reasonably incurred by Landlord in such Exterior  Maintenance.  Tenant
shall  have the  right to cause  Landlord  to  obtain  no more  than  three  (3)
competitive  bids  for  the  Exterior  Maintenance  from  reputable  independent
contractors. In the event that Tenant causes Landlord to obtain such competitive
bids, Tenant's liability shall be limited to the lesser of the median bid or the
actual cost to Landlord of the Exterior Maintenance.

SECTION 11.     Alterations.

         (a)  Tenant  shall not make or allow  any  alterations,  additions,  or
improvements  to  the  Premises  or any  part  of  the  Premises  (collectively,
"Alterations"),   without   Landlord's   prior  consent,   which  shall  not  be
unreasonably withheld. Consent, however, may be conditioned upon the receipt by,
and  approval  of,  Landlord  of a set  of  plans  and  specifications  for  the
alterations  no later than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled  construction
of the  Alterations  together  with such  additional  information  regarding the
proposed  Alterations  as Landlord  may  reasonably  request  (collectively  the
"Alteration Support"). Landlord agrees to approve or disapprove of such proposed
Alterations  within ten (10) business days  following the receipt the Alteration
Support.  The  installation  of  furnishings,   fixtures,   equipment,  interior
partitions,  non-load bearing walls or decorative  improvements  (other than the
recarpeting  of the  Premises,  which  shall be deemed an  Alteration  for which
Landlord's  consent  must be  obtained),  none of which shall  affect  operating
systems or the  structure of the Premises,  and the  repainting of the Premises,
shall not constitute  "Alterations."  Except as otherwise provided in Section 16
hereof,  all  Alterations and any  furnishings,  fixtures,  equipment,  interior
partitions,  non-load bearing walls or decorative  improvements remaining on the
Premises  after the  termination  or  earlier  expiration  of this  Lease  shall
immediately  become  Landlord's  property  and,  at the  termination  or earlier
expiration of this Lease,  shall remain on the Premises without  compensation to
Tenant,  unless Landlord elects by notice to Tenant to have.  Tenant remove same
and restore the  Premises  to the  condition  of as of the date of this Lease in
which event  Tenant shall cause such removal  and/or  restoration  to be done at
Tenant's sole cost and expense.  Landlord agrees that  contemporaneous  with its
consent to the making of any Alterations and subject to Tenant's express written
request therefore it shall notify Tenant as to which of the Alterations Landlord
may require to be removed prior to the termination or earlier expiration of this
Lease.  If Landlord  fails to notify  Tenant in writing  that it may require the
removal of Alterations as to which Tenant has requested such notification,  then
Landlord shall not be permitted to require the removal of such  Alterations upon
the expiration or earlier  termination of this Lease. In the event that Landlord
requires  Tenant  to  remove  any  Alterations  and any  furnishings,  fixtures,
equipment,   interior   partitions,   non-load   bearing   walls  or  decorative
improvements  and Tenant fails to cause such removal  and/or  restoration  on or
prior to the termination or other earlier expiration of this Lease, such failure
shall be deemed a holdover  under Section 1 3(b) of this Lease,  and in addition
to any other  damages  owing  Landlord  under  this  Section,  Tenant  shall owe
Holdover Rent (as hereinafter defined) for each month or portion thereof of such
failure. All improvements,  additions,  alterations, and repairs and the removal
and  restoration  thereof,  if required under this Lease,  shall be performed in
accordance  with all applicable  laws and at Tenant's sole expense.  Tenant will
indemnify  and defend  Landlord  for all  liens,  claims,  or damages  caused by
remodeling,  improvements,  additions,  alterations, and repairs and the removal
and restoration  thereof,  if required under this Lease.  Landlord agrees,  when
requested by Tenant, to execute and deliver any applications, consents, or other
instruments  reasonably  required to permit  Tenant to do this work or to obtain
permits for the work.


                                       10

         (b)  Before  any  contract  or  subcontract  is let or other  agreement
executed for the performance of any service, or the furnishing of any materials,
and before any work of any kind or nature is commenced upon the  construction of
Alterations, Tenant will procure and deliver to Landlord a completion bond and a
payment bond,  both in form and  substance  satisfactory  to Landlord  issued by
reputable surety corporations or bonding  corporations  qualified to do business
in California, guaranteeing or otherwise assuring Landlord that the construction
of the  Alterations  will proceed to  completion  with due  diligence,  that the
reconstruction,  when  completed,  will be fully paid for, and that the Premises
will remain free of all mechanics',  laborers' or materialmen's liens or claimed
liens  on  account  of any  services  or  materials  furnished  or labor or work
performed in connection with the construction of the Alterations.

         (c) At  least  ten (10)  days  before  any  construction  commences  or
materials  are  delivered  for any  alterations  that  Tenant  is  making to the
Premises,  whether or not  Landlord's  consent is  required,  Tenant  shall give
written  notice to  Landlord as to when the  construction  is to commence or the
materials  are to be delivered.  Landlord  shall then have the right to post and
maintain on the Premises  any notices that are required to protect  Landlord and
Landlord's  interest in the Premises from any liens for work and labor performed
or materials  furnished in making the alterations;  provided,  however,  that it
shall be Tenant's duty to keep the Premises free and clear of all liens, claims,
and demands for work performed,  materials furnished, or operations conducted on
the  Premises  by or on behalf of  Tenant.  In the event  that  Tenant  fails to
provide Landlord with the notice required by this Section 11 (b), Landlord shall
have the right to cause the  cessation of such  construction  and shall have the
further right to file notices of cessation and/or completion, so as to allow the
Premises to be  protected  from  mechanic's  liens.  Tenant  hereby  irrevocably
appoints  Landlord its  attorney-in-fact  which  appointment  is coupled with an
interest to cause such cessation and to file such notices.

         (d) Tenant will not at any time permit any  mechanics',  laborers',  or
materialmen's  liens to stand  against  the  Premises  for any labor or material
furnished  to Tenant or claimed  to have been  furnished  to Tenant or  Tenant's
agents,  contractors,  or subtenants,  in connection  with work of any character
performed  or  claimed  to have  been  performed  on the  Premises  by or at the
direction or sufferance of Tenant; provided, however, that Tenant shall have the
right to contest the validity or amount of any lien or claimed lien, upon giving
to Landlord a bond  assuring that the lien or claimed lien will be paid when and
to the extent  that the lien is  finally  determined  to be valid and owing.  On
final  determination  of the lien or claim of lien,  Tenant will immediately pay
any final judgment rendered, with all property costs and charges, and shall have
the lien  released or judgment  satisfied at Tenant's  sole  expense.  If Tenant
fails to pay the  judgment  promptly  or  otherwise  fails to prevent  any sale,
foreclosure,  or forfeiture of the Premises  because of a lien,  Landlord  shall
have the right,  upon five (5) days' written notice to Tenant, to pay or prevent
this  action,  and the amount  paid by  Landlord  shall be  immediately  due and
payable to Landlord, and shall bear interest at the lesser of ten percent ( 10%)
per  annum or the  highest  rate  allowed  by law from  the date of  payment  by
Landlord until repayment by Tenant.

SECTION 12.     Entry.

         (a) Landlord  and its agents may enter the  Premises at any  reasonable
time upon  reasonable  notice to  Tenant,  it being  agreed  that  notice  given
twenty-four  (24)  hours or more in  advance  shall be deemed  to be  reasonable
notice,  or  immediately  in the case of an  emergency,  for the  purpose of (i)
inspecting  the  Premises;  (ii) posting  notices of  non-responsibility;  (iii)
supplying  any service to be provided  by Landlord to Tenant;  (iv)  showing the
Leased Premises to prospective  purchasers,  mortgagees,  or tenants; (v) making
necessary  alterations,  additions,  or repairs as  required by this Lease or to
otherwise perform  Landlord's duties under this Lease; (vi) to determine whether
Tenant is  complying  with the terms of this Lease;  (vii)  performing  Tenant's
obligations  when Tenant has failed to do so after written notice from Landlord,
if  required by the terms of this Lease;  (vii)  placing on the Leased  Premises
ordinary  for lease  signs or for sale  signs  during the last year of the Term;
(viii) to do other  lawful  acts that may be  necessary  to  protect  Landlord's
interest in the Premises under this Lease and (ix) responding to an emergency.

         (b)  Landlord  shall  have the  right to use any means  Landlord  deems
necessary and proper to enter the Premises in an  emergency.  Any entry into the
Premises  obtained by Landlord in  accordance  with this Section  shall not be a
forcible or unlawful entry into, or a detainer of, the Premises, or an eviction,
actual or constructive,  of Tenant from the Premises,  nor shall such entry give
rise to a claim for rent abatement.

SECTION 13.     Surrender of Premises: Holding Over.

         (a) At the termination of this Lease or any sooner expiration  thereof,
Tenant shall promptly surrender and deliver the Premises to Landlord in good and
tenantable  condition,  casualty,  condemnation  and  reasonable  wear  and tear
excepted.

         (b) At the end of the Term, or any  extension,  should Tenant hold over
for any reason,  it is agreed that in the absence of a written  agreement to the
contrary,  that tenancy shall be from  month-to-month  only and not a renewal of
this Lease, nor an extension for any further term. Tenant shall pay Monthly Rent
in an amount  (the  "Holdover  Rent")  equal to (i) one  hundred and twenty five
percent  (125%) of the Monthly Rent payable for the month  immediately  prior to
the end of the Term or any extension  thereof for the first month or any portion
thereof  after the end of the Term for which  Tenant  holds  over,  and (ii) one
hundred  and fifty  percent  (150%) of the  Monthly  Rent  payable for the month
immediately prior to the end of the Term or any extension thereof for any period
after the first month after the end of the Term for which Tenant holds over, and
the month-to-month  tenancy shall be subject to every other term, covenant,  and
condition  in  this  Lease  that  is  consistent  with  and  not  contrary  to a
month-to-month tenancy.

SECTION 14.     Indemnity.

         (a)  Tenant  agrees  to  indemnify,  defend,  and  hold  Landlord,  and
Landlord's  employees,  agents  and  contractors  harmless  from all  liability,
penalties,  losses,  damages,  costs,  expenses,  causes of action,  claims,  or
judgments,  including but not limited to attorneys'  fees and costs,  arising by
reason  of any  death,  bodily  injury,  personal  injury,  or  property  damage
resulting  from:  (i) any  cause  occurring  in or  about or  resulting  from an

directors, employees,  contractors,  licensees or invitees, (iii) the negligence
or  willful  misconduct  of  Tenant or  Tenant's  agents,  employees,  invitees,
licensees,  contractors  and  subcontractors,  or (iii) an Event of  Default  by

sooner termination of this Lease.

         (b) Except as otherwise  provided in this Lease,  Landlord shall not be
liable to Tenant,  nor shall Tenant be entitled to any abatement of rent for any
damage  to  Tenant's  property  or any  injury  to  Tenant  or  any of  Tenant's
employees,  agents, or invitees, or loss to Tenant's business arising out of any
cause,  including  but  not  limited  to  (i)  the  failure,   interruption,  or

SECTION 15.     Insurance.

         (a)  Landlord  agrees  at all  times  during  the Term and  during  any
extension,  to maintain in force, an "all risk" policy of insurance covering the
building  and all  improvements  that may be built or  placed  on the  Premises,
including  extended coverage,  including fire sprinkler  leakage,  vandalism and
malicious  mischief,  in an amount equal to their full insurable  value,  with a
replacement cost endorsement.  Tenant agrees to immediately  reimburse  Landlord

connection with any loss or damage thereby insured against. Tenant's obligations
under this Section 15(a) shall not extend to any earthquake  insurance  Landlord

Landlord with all relevant endorsements.  Each such policy of insurance shall be
primary and noncontributory with any policies carried by Landlord, to the extent
obtainable,  any loss shall be payable  notwithstanding any act or negligence of
Landlord that might otherwise result in forfeiture of insurance, shall contain a
cross-liability  endorsement;  and shall  contain a  severability  clause.  Each
insurance policy shall provide that a thirty (30) day notice of cancellation and
of any material  modification  of coverage shall be given to all named insureds.
The  insurance  coverage  required  under this  Section may be carried by Tenant
under a blanket policy insuring other locations of Tenant's  business,  provided
that the Premises covered by this Lease are specifically  identified as included
under that policy.  Tenant agrees that upon the failure to insure as provided in
this Lease,  or to pay the premiums in the insurance,  Landlord may contract for
the insurance  and pay the  premiums,  and all sums expended by Landlord for the
insurance  shall be  considered  additional  rent  under this Lease and shall be
immediately  repayable by Tenant.  Each policy of  insurance  obtained by Tenant
shall include a waiver by the insurer of  subrogation  and all rights based upon
an  assignment  from its  insured  against  Landlord,  its  officers,  directors
employees,  agents,  invitees,  licensees and contractors in connection with any
loss or damage thereby insured against.

         (d) So that  the  business  of  Tenant  may  continue  with  as  little
interruption  as  possible,  Tenant  shall,  during the Term and any renewals or
extensions,  maintain  at  Tenant's  sole cost and  expense,  insurance  for (i)
Tenant's  personal  property;  inventory,  alterations,  fixtures and  equipment
located on the Premises,  in an amount not less than one hundred  percent (100%)
of their actual  replacement  value,  providing All Risk coverage including fire
sprinkler leakage, vandalism and malicious mischief; and (ii) all plate glass on
the Premises.  The proceeds of such insurance,  so long as this Lease remains in
effect,  shall be used to repair or replace the  personal  property,  inventory,
alterations, fixtures, equipment and plate glass so insured. In addition, Tenant
shall obtain and keep in force,  at all times during the Term or any  extensions
or renewals  thereof,  a policy of  business  interruption  insurance  coverage,
insuring that one hundred  percent (100%) of the Monthly Rent due hereunder will
be paid to Landlord  for a period of not less than one (1) year if the  Premises
are damaged or destroyed or rendered unfit for occupancy by a risk

                                       14
<PAGE>


insured  against  by a policy  of All Risk  coverage  including  fire  sprinkler
leakage, vandalism and malicious mischief endorsements.

         (e) At all times during the Term and any extensions or renewals, Tenant
agrees  to  keep  and  maintain,  or  cause  Tenant's  agents,  contractors,  or
subcontractors to keep and maintain,  workmen's compensation insurance and other
forms of insurance as may from time to time be required by law or may  otherwise
be necessary to protect  Landlord and the Premises from claims of any person who
may at any time work on the Premises,  whether as a servant,  agent, or employee
of Tenant or  otherwise.  This  insurance  shall be maintained at the expense of
Tenant or Tenant's agents, contractors, or subcontractors and not at the expense
of Landlord.

         (f)  Landlord  agrees that it will tender and turn over to Tenant or to
Tenant's insurers the defense of any claims, demands, or suits instituted, made,
or brought against Landlord or against  Landlord and Tenant jointly,  within the
scope of this  Section.  However,  Landlord  shall have the right to approve the
selection of legal  counsel,  to the extent that  selection  is within  Tenant's
control,  which  approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or  delayed.  In
addition,  Landlord  shall  retain  the  right at  Landlord's  election  to have
Landlord's  own legal  counsel  participate  as  co-counsel,  to the extent that
claims are made that may not be covered by Tenant's insurers.

         (g) Tenant and Landlord  each waive all rights of  subrogation  against
the other for loss or damage  arising out of or  incident to the perils  insured
against,  which perils occur in, on, or about the  Premises,  whether due to the
negligence,  gross negligence or willful misconduct of either Landlord or Tenant
or any their respective agents, employees,  contractors, or invitees. Tenant and
Landlord shall, upon obtaining the required  policies of insurance,  give notice
to the  insurance  carriers that this mutual  waiver of  subrogation  is in this
Lease.

         (h)  Landlord  agrees to  procure  and  maintain  commercial  liability
insurance  from a  responsible  insurance  company  authorized to do business in
California, with a combined single limit of not less than One Million Dollars ($
1,000,000)  for  injury or death to any  person or damage to  property,  for any
claims,  demands,  or causes of action of any person  arising  out of  accidents
occurring on the Premises during the Term.

SECTION 16.     Trade Fixtures.

         (a)  Tenant  shall  have the  right,  at any time and from time to time
during  the Term and any  renewals  or  extensions,  at  Tenant's  sole cost and
expense, to install and affix on the Premises items for use in Tenant's trade or
business,   which  Tenant,   in  Tenant's  sole   discretion,   deems  advisable
(collectively  "Trade  Fixtures").  Trade Fixtures  installed in the Premises by
Tenant  shall  always  remain the  property  of Tenant and may be removed at the
expiration  of the  Term or any  extension,  provided  that  any  damage  to the
Premises  caused by the  removal  of the Trade  Fixtures  shall be  repaired  by
Tenant, and further provided that

                                       15
<PAGE>


Landlord shall have the right to keep any Trade Fixtures or to require Tenant to
remove any Trade Fixtures that Tenant might otherwise elect to abandon.

         (b) As security  for Tenant's  performance  of  obligations  under this
Lease, Tenant grants to Landlord a security interest in all Trade Fixtures owned
by Tenant and now or later placed on the Premises by Tenant;  provided  that (i)
Landlord shall  subordinate its lien to the lien of any current or future lender
of Tenant;  and (ii) that each such current or future lender of Tenant  consents
to Landlord's  security interest in the Trade Fixtures.  Any right to remove the
Trade  Fixtures  given  Tenant  by the  provisions  of  Section  16(a)  shall be
exercisable  only if, at the time of the  removal,  an Event of Default  has not
occurred and is not continuing on the part of Tenant in its  performance of this
Lease.  Provided  that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the
part of Tenant,  Landlord agrees to release its security interest from any Trade
Fixture  which  Tenant  desires  to trade in or  replace,  provided,  that  this
security  interest will then attach to the item that replaced the previous Trade
Fixture. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default on the part of Tenant under
this  Lease,  Landlord  shall  immediately  have as to the  Trade  Fixtures  the
remedies  provided to a secured party under relevant  sections of the California
Uniform  Commercial  Code. Upon Landlord's  request to Tenant and subject to the
forgoing terms and conditions,  Tenant agrees to execute and deliver to Landlord
a UCC Financing  Statement together with applicable  continuations  thereof with
regard to Landlord's security interest in the Trade Fixtures.

         (c) Any Trade Fixtures that are not removed from the Premises by Tenant
within thirty (30) days after the Termination  Date shall be deemed abandoned by
Tenant and shall  automatically  become the property of Landlord as owner of the
real  property  to which they are  affixed  and not due to the lien  provided to
Landlord in Section 16(b).

SECTION 17.     Communications Cables.

         Regardless of any  provisions  of this Lease to the contrary,  Landlord
and Tenant agree as follows:

         (a) Cabling and Equipment. Tenant will be responsible, at Tenant's sole
cost, for the  installation,  maintenance,  and repair of all  telecommunication
cabling,  wiring, and risers running throughout the Premises,  together with all
of Tenant's telephones,  telecopiers,  computers, telephone switching, telephone
panels, and related equipment.  Tenant agrees to install,  maintain,  and repair
the  telecommunication  cabling,  wiring,  and  risers  running  throughout  the
Premises in a good and proper manner.

         (b) Right of Entry.  In addition to  Landlord's  other  rights of entry
under  this  Lease,  Landlord  may enter the  Leased  Premises  to  inspect  the
telecommunication  cabling,  wiring, and risers to assure that the installation,
maintenance, and repair are being performed in a good and proper manner.


                                       16
<PAGE>


         (c)  Designated  Provider.  Tenant  agrees  to have  the  installation,
maintenance,  and repair of the  telecommunication  cabling,  wiring, and risers
done by an  independent  contractor  approved in writing in advance by Landlord,
provided  Landlord  shall  not  unreasonably   withhold  its  approval  of  such
independent contractor.

         (d) Indemnity.  Tenant agrees to indemnify,  release,  defend, and hold
Landlord harmless against any damages, claims, or other liability resulting from
Tenant's installation,  repair, or maintenance of the telecommunication cabling,
wiring, and risers, including, but not limited to, the costs of repair.

         (e)  Release.   Tenant  releases  Landlord  from  all  losses,  claims,
injuries,   damages,  or  other  liability,   including,  but  not  limited  to,
consequential damages,  whether to persons or property and no matter how caused,
in any way connected with the interruption of telecommunications services due to
the  failure  of any  telecommunications  cabling,  wiring,  or  risers.  Tenant
expressly  waives the right to claim that any interruption  constitutes  grounds
for a claim of abatement of rent, of constructive  eviction,  or for termination
of the Lease.

SECTION 18.     Signs.

         Tenant shall not maintain nor permit any sign, awning, canopy, marquee,
or other  advertising  to appear or be affixed on any exterior  door,  wall,  or
window of the Premises,  except as permitted by both  applicable  ordinances and
any conditions,  covenants and restrictions  covering the Premises,  and then at
Tenant's  sole  cost  or  expense.  Furthermore,  Tenant  shall  not  place  any
decoration, lettering, or advertising matter on the glass of any exterior window
of the Premises without the prior written  approval of Landlord,  which approval
shall not be  unreasonably  withheld.  If  Tenant  maintains  any sign,  awning,
canopy, marquee,  decoration, or advertising matter in accordance with the terms
of this Section,  Tenant shall maintain it in good  appearance and repair at all
times during this Lease. At the Termination  Date, any of the items mentioned in
this  Section  that are not removed  from the  Premises  by Tenant may,  without
damage or  liability,  be removed and  destroyed by Landlord and Tenant shall be
liable to Landlord for the cost of such removal and destruction.

SECTION 19.     Damage and Destruction.

         If at any time during the Term,  the  Premises are damaged by a fire or
other casualty,  Tenant shall  immediately  notify Landlord of the occurrence of
such fire or casualty.  Landlord shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of
such notice in the event of a casualty  affecting  only the  Premises  and sixty
(60) days from the receipt of such  notice in the event of a casualty  affecting
the Premises and one or more other buildings, to determine the amount of time it
reasonably  estimates  will be required to repair or restore the Premises  after
obtaining a building permit therefor.  If Landlord reasonably estimates that the
time  required to repair or restore the  Premises  exceeds one hundred and fifty
(150) days following the issuance of a building permit therefor, either Landlord
or Tenant

                                       17
<PAGE>


shall have the right to  terminate  this  Lease  upon the notice to other  party
given no later than thirty (30) days  following the giving of notice by Landlord
to Tenant of Landlord's  estimate of the time necessary to repair or restore the
Premises.  If neither  party  elects to  terminate  this  Lease,  or if Landlord
estimates  that  restoration  of the  Premises  shall take one hundred and fifty
(150) days or less to complete, then, subject to receipt of sufficient insurance
proceeds (other than deductibles under such insurance),  Landlord shall promptly
restore the Premises, excluding the improvements installed by Tenant, subject to
delays arising from the  collection of insurance  proceeds or from force majeure
events. Tenant, at Tenant's expense,  shall promptly perform,  subject to delays
arising from the collection of insurance  proceeds or from force majeure events,
all  repairs  or  restoration  not  required  to be done by  Landlord  and shall
promptly  re-enter the Premises and commence doing  business in accordance  with
this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Lease
if the  Premises  are  materially  damaged  during the last year of the Term and
Landlord reasonably estimates that it will take more than one-hundred and twenty
(120) days to repair such damage;  provided however,  that Tenant shall have the
right to avoid such  termination  of this Lease by  Landlord by  exercising  its
option to extend the Term in  accordance  with  Section 41 of this Lease for the
first Option Period,  or, if Tenant has previously  exercised the option for the
first Option Period, the second Option Period. If Tenant avoids such termination
by exercising  its rights,  if any,  under Section 41 of this Lease,  all of the
terms and  conditions  of this Section 19 relating to any  restoration  shall be
reinstated  and adhered to by the parties  hereto.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord
with respect to the damage to the Premises the amount of  Landlord's  deductible
within thirty (30) days after presentment of Landlord's invoice. If the Premises
are  damaged  to the  extent  that the  Premises  are  partially  unsuitable  or
inadequate  for the purposes  which  Tenant was using the Premises  prior to the
damage,  the Monthly Rent otherwise payable by Tenant shall be reduced effective
as of the date of the damage so that the new Monthly  Rent  payable  shall be an
amount equivalent to the proportion of the Monthly Rent otherwise payable as the
total floor area of the  Premises  still  reasonably  suitable  for Tenant's use
under this Lease  bears to the total  floor  area of the  Premises  prior to the
damage;  provided that if such partial  destruction  materially  interferes with
Tenant's  intended  use of the  Premises as existing  prior to the damage,  rent
shall be abated  entirely  until Tenant is able to re-enter the Premises and use
the Premises  for purposes for which Tenant was using the Premises  prior to the
damage.

SECTION 20.     Condemnation.

         (a) If, during the Term or any renewal or  extension,  the whole of the
Premises  shall be taken  pursuant to any  condemnation  proceeding,  this Lease
shall terminate as of 12:01 a.m. of the date that actual physical  possession of
the  Premises  is taken,  and after  that,  both  Landlord  and Tenant  shall be
released from all obligations under this Lease.

         (b) If, during the Term or any renewal or extension, only a part of the
Premises is taken  pursuant to any  condemnation  proceeding  and the  remaining
portion is not  suitable or adequate for the purposes for which Tenant was using
the Premises prior to the taking, or if the Premises should become unsuitable or
inadequate for those purposes by

                                       18
<PAGE>


reason of the taking  of any other  property  adjacent  to or over the  Premises
pursuant to any condemnation proceeding, or if by reason of any law or ordinance
the use of the Premises  for the  purposes  specified in this Lease shall become
unlawful,  then and after the taking or after the occurrence of other  described
events,  Tenant  shall  have the  option to  terminate,  and the  option  can be
exercised  only  after the  taking or after the  occurrence  of other  described
events by Tenant giving written notice to Landlord  within ten (10) days of such
taking or the occurrence of other  described  events,  and Monthly Rent shall be
paid only to the time when Tenant surrenders possession of the Premises. Without
limiting  the  generality  of the previous  provision,  it is agreed that in the
event  of a  partial  taking  of  the  Premises  pursuant  to  any  condemnation
proceeding,  if the number of square feet of floor area in the portion remaining
after the taking is less than eighty  percent (80%) of the number of square feet
of floor area at the commencement of the Term,  Tenant shall,  after the taking,
have the option to terminate  this Lease upon giving  written notice to Landlord
within  ten ( 10) days of such  taking  or the  occurrence  of  other  described
events,  and Monthly Rent shall be paid only to the time when Tenant  surrenders
possession of the Premises.

         (c)  If  only  a  part  of  the  Premises  is  taken  pursuant  to  any
condemnation proceeding under circumstances that Tenant does not have the option
to  terminate  this Lease as provided in this  Section,  or having the option to
terminate,  Tenant  elects not to terminate,  then Landlord  shall at Landlord's
expense  promptly  proceed to restore the  remainder  of the  Premises to a self
contained  architectural  unit,  and the Monthly Rent  payable  shall be reduced
effective  the  date of the  taking  to an  amount  that  shall  be in the  same
proportion to Monthly Rent payable prior to the taking,  as the number of square
feet of floor area remaining after the taking bears to the number of square feet
of floor area immediately prior to the taking.

         (d) If the whole or any part of the Premises are taken  pursuant to any
condemnation proceeding,  then Landlord shall be entitled to the entirety of any
condemnation award except that portion allocable to Tenant's unsalvageable Trade
Fixtures and provided that Tenant shall have the right to make a separate  claim
against the  condemning  authority  for Tenant's  relocation  costs and Tenant's
business interruption.

SECTION 21.     Assignment and Subletting.

         (a) Tenant shall not assign or  hypothecate  this Lease or any interest
herein (by  operation  of law or  otherwise)  or sublet the Premises or any part
thereof,  or permit the use of the Premises by any party other than Tenant (each
an "Transfer")  without the prior written consent of Landlord which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld.  If Tenant is a corporation,  a partnership or a limited
liability company, the transfer (as a consequence of a single transaction or any
number  of  separate  transactions)  of  fifty  percent  (50%)  or  more  of the
beneficial  ownership  interest  of  the  voting  stock  of  Tenant  issued  and
outstanding  as of the date  hereof  or  partnership  interests  in  Tenant,  or
ownership interests in Tenant, as the case may be, other than as a result of the
open  trading  of  Tenant's  shares on a public  stock  exchange  which does not
constitute a merger, consolidation or other reorganization,

                                       19
<PAGE>


shall  constitute  a  Transfer  hereunder  for which such  consent is  required.
Further, Tenant shall not Transfer this Lease to any corporation which controls,
is controlled by or is under common control with Tenant,  or to any  corporation
resulting from merger or consolidation  with Tenant,  or to any person or entity
which  acquires all the assets as a going concern of the business of Tenant that
is being  conducted  on the  Premises,  without  the prior  written  consent  of
Landlord  which shall not be  unreasonably  withheld.  Any of the foregoing acts
without  such  consent  shall be void,  and,  at the option of  Landlord,  shall
terminate this Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section,  provided the use of the Premises does not change,  Tenant may Transfer
this Lease  without  first  obtaining  Landlord's  consent  as  follows  (each a
"Permitted Transfer"): (i) to a corporation,  limited liability company or other
entity which results from a merger, consolidation,  reorganization or asset sale
with Tenant in which the surviving entity (A) acquires  substantially all of the
assets of  Tenant as a going  concern,  (B)  assumes,  or is deemed by law to be
liable  for,  all of the  liabilities  of Tenant and (C) has after such  merger,
consolidation,  reorganization  or asset sale a net worth not less than Tenant's
net worth as of the date of this Lease; and (ii) as a result of a sale, issuance
or transfer of the capital  stock of Tenant  provided  Tenant  continues to be a
publicly traded corporation, limited liability company or other entity.

         (b) In the event that Tenant  should  desire to Transfer  this Lease or
any  portion  thereof,  Tenant  shall  first  offer the space  affected  by such
Transfer to Landlord and Landlord  shall have the right within  thirty (30) days
following  such offer to elect to, in Landlord's  sole and absolute  discretion,
terminate  this Lease as to the space affected by the desired  Transfer.  In the
event that Landlord does not notify Tenant within such thirty-day  period of its
election  to  terminate  the  Lease as to the  space  affected  by such  desired
Transfer,  Landlord shall be deemed to have waived its right to so terminate the
Lease as to the space to be affected by the desired Transfer.  In the event that
Landlord  does not  terminate  the Lease as to the space  affected  by  Tenant's
desired  transfer,  and,  within  one-hundred  and twenty  (120) days  following
Landlord's  election  not to  terminate  the Lease as to the space  affected  by
Tenant's Transfer,  Tenant reaches a tentative  agreement to Transfer such space
to a third party,  Tenant shall  provide  Landlord  with written  notice of such
tentative  agreement at least ten (10) business days in advance of the effective
date of such proposed Transfer. Such notice shall include (i) the name and legal
composition of the proposed  sublessee or assignee,  (ii) the nature of business
to be conducted by the proposed sublessee or assignee in the Premises, (iii) the
terms  and  conditions  of  the  proposed  Transfer,  (iv) a  current  financial
statement  of the  proposed  sublessee  or  assignee,  financial  statements  of
proposed  sublessee or assignee  covering the preceding three (3) years, if they
exist,  and,  if  available,  an audited  financial  statement  of the  proposed
sublessee  or assignee  for a period  ending not more than one (1) year prior to
the proposed effective date of the Transfer,  all of which are to be prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (v) a statement of all
consideration  to be given  on  account  of the  Transfer;  and  (vi) any  other
information  that  Landlord  reasonably  requests.  At any time  within ten (10)
business  days  following  receipt of Tenant's  notice,  Landlord may by written
notice to Tenant  elect to (i) unless  waived in  accordance  with this  Section
21(b), in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion, terminate this Lease as to

                                       20
<PAGE>


the space  affected as of the  effective  date of the  proposed  Transfer,  (ii)
consent to the proposed  subletting  of the Premises or assignment of this Lease
or (iii)  disapprove  of the proposed  Transfer.  If Landlord  does not elect to
terminate  this Lease,  however,  Landlord shall not  unreasonably  withhold its
consent to a proposed  Transfer if Tenant is not in default  under this Lease at
the time Tenant  requests such consent.  Without  limiting  other  situations in
which it may be reasonable  for Landlord to withhold its consent to any proposed
assignment  or sublease,  Landlord and Tenant agree that it shall be  reasonable
for  Landlord  to  withhold  its  consent  in any one or  more of the  following
situations:  (i) if,  in  Landlord's  reasonable  judgment,  the net  worth  and
financial  capability of the proposed subtenant or assignee is not sufficient to
support  the  obligations  of  such  proposed  subtenant  or  assignee;  (ii) in
Landlord's  reasonable  judgment,  the business  history and  reputation  in the
community of the  proposed  subtenant  or assignee  does not meet the  standards
applied by Landlord or (iii) the proposed  subtenant or assignee shall be a then
existing or prospective tenant of Landlord;  provided that in any event Landlord
shall be entitled to exercise its right of  termination in lieu of consenting to
a  transfer,  as set forth  above.  In order for any  Transfer  to be binding on
Landlord, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord, promptly after execution thereof, an
executed copy of such  sublease or assignment  whereby the sublessee or assignee
shall expressly assume the obligations of Tenant under this Lease.

         (c) Landlord and Tenant agree that seventy percent (70%) of any rent or
other  consideration  received  or to be  received by or on behalf of or for the
benefit of Tenant as a result of any Transfer, in excess of the aggregate of (i)
the Monthly Rent which  Tenant is  obligated  to pay  Landlord  under this Lease
(prorated  to reflect  obligations  allocable  to that  portion of the  Premises
subject  to such  sublease)  and (ii) any  leasing  commissions  and  reasonable
attorneys'  fees  actually  incurred and paid by Tenant to secure the  Transfer,
shall be payable  to  Landlord  as  additional  rent  under  this Lease  without
affecting or reducing any other obligation of Tenant hereunder. Landlord's share
of such excess rent or other  consideration  shall be paid by the  subtenant  or
assignee  directly  to  Landlord  at  the  same  time  as  such  rent  or  other
consideration is payable to Tenant.

         (d) Regardless of Landlord's  consent, no Transfer shall release Tenant
of  Tenant's  obligation  or alter the  primary  liability  of Tenant to pay the
rental and to perform all other obligations to be performed by Tenant hereunder.
The  acceptance  of rental by Landlord from any other person shall not be deemed
to be a waiver by landlord of any provision hereof. Consent to one assignment or
subletting  shall not be deemed consent to any subsequent or further  Transfers.
In  the  event  of  default  by any  assignee  or  successor  of  Tenant  in the
performance of any of the terms hereof,  Landlord may proceed  directly  against
Tenant  without the  necessity of exhausting  remedies  against said assignee or
successor.  Landlord  may  consent  to  subsequent  Transfers  of this  Lease or
amendments  or  modifications  to this Lease with  assignees of Tenant,  without
notifying Tenant, or any successor of Tenant, and without obtaining its or their
consent  thereto and such action  shall not relieve  Tenant or any  successor of
Tenant of liability under this Lease.


                                       21
<PAGE>


         (e) Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as an additional rent, all reasonable
costs and attorney fees incurred by Landlord in connection  with the evaluation,
processing,  or  documentation  of  any  requested  Transfer,   whether  or  not
Landlord's  consent is granted.  Landlord's  reasonable  costs shall include the
cost of any review or investigation  performed by Landlord or consultant  acting
on behalf of Landlord of:

         (i)     any Hazardous Substances used, stored, released, or disposed of
         by the proposed subtenant or assignee, or

         (ii) violations of any  Environmental Law by the Tenant or the proposed
         subtenant or assignee.

         (f) Any  Transfer  approved by Landlord  shall not be  effective  until
Tenant has  delivered  to  Landlord  an  executed  counterpart  of the  document
evidencing  the Transfer is in form and  substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to
Landlord.

         (g) Any attempted  Transfer without Landlord's consent shall constitute
an Event of Default. Landlord's consent to any one Transfer shall not constitute
a waiver of the  provision  of Section  21 as to any  subsequent  Transfer  or a
consent to any subsequent Transfer.

         SECTION 22.     Default.

         Any of the following events or occurrences  shall constitute a material
breach of this Lease by Tenant and, after the expiration of any applicable grace
period, shall constitute an event of default (each an "Event of Default"):

          (a) The  failure  by Tenant  to pay any  amount in full when it is due
under the Lease,  provided  however  that once every 12 months  during the Term,
Tenant's  failure to pay any amount  when it is due under the Lease shall not be
an Event of Default if Tenant makes such payment  within three (3) business days
following written notice from Landlord of such failure;

         (b) The failure by Tenant to perform any  obligation  under this Lease,
which by its nature Tenant has no capacity to cure;

         (c) The  failure by Tenant to perform any other  obligation  under this
Lease, if the failure has continued for a period of ten (10) days after Landlord
demands in writing that Tenant cure the failure.  If, however, by its nature the
failure cannot be cured within ten (10) days, Tenant may have a longer period as
is necessary to cure the failure, but this is conditioned upon Tenant's promptly
commencing  to cure  within the ten (10) day period  and  thereafter  diligently
pursuing such cure to completion within  one-hundred and twenty (120) days after
Landlord demands in writing that Tenant cure the failure. Tenant shall indemnify
and defend Landlord against any liability, claim, damage, loss, or penalty that

may be threatened  or may in fact arise from that failure  during the period the
failure is incurred;

         (d) Any of the  following:  a  general  assignment  by  Tenant  for the
benefit of Tenant's creditors; any voluntary filing, petition, or application by
Tenant  under any law  relating  to  insolvency  or  bankruptcy,  whether  for a
declaration of bankruptcy,  a reorganization,  an arrangement,  or otherwise; or
the  dispossession  of Tenant  from the  Premises  (other than by  Landlord)  by
process of law or otherwise; or

         (e) The  appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of all
or substantially all of Tenant's assets;  or the attachment,  execution or other
judicial seizure of all or  substantially  all of Tenant's assets located at the
Premises  or of  Tenant's  interest in this  Lease,  unless the  appointment  or
attachment,  execution,  or seizure is discharged within sixty (60) days; or the
involuntary filing against Tenant, or any general partner of Tenant if Tenant is
a partnership, of

         (i) a petition to have Tenant, or any partner of Tenant if  Tenant is a
         partnership, declared bankrupt, or

         (ii) a petition for  reorganization  or arrangement of Tenant under any
         law relating to insolvency or  bankruptcy,  unless,  in the case of any
         involuntary filing, it is dismissed within sixty (60) days;

SECTION 23.     Remedies.

         Upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default,  Landlord,  in addition to
any other rights or remedies  available  to Landlord at law or in equity,  shall
have the right to

         (a)  terminate  this Lease and all rights of Tenant under this Lease by
giving  Tenant  written  notice  that this  Lease is  terminated,  in which case
Landlord may recover from Tenant the aggregate sum of

         (i) the  worth  at the time  of award of any  unpaid rent that had been
         earned at the time of termination;

         (ii) the  worth at the time of  award of the  amount  by which  (A) the
         unpaid rent that would have been  earned  after  termination  until the
         time of award  exceeds  (B) the amount of the rental  loss,  if any, as
         Tenant affirmatively proves could have been reasonably avoided;

         (iii)  the  worth at the time of award of the  amount  by which (A) the
         unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds
         (B) the amount of rental loss, if any, as Tenant  affirmatively  proves
         could be reasonably avoided;


                                       23
<PAGE>


         (iv) any other  amount  necessary  to  compensate  Landlord for all the
         detriment caused by Tenant's failure to perform Tenant's obligations or
         that, in the ordinary course of things,  would be likely to result from
         Tenant's failure,  including without  limitation the costs and expenses
         incurred by Landlord for:

                  (A) retaking possession of the Premises;

                  (B) cleaning and making repairs and alterations (including the
                  cost of leasehold  improvements  installed in connection  with
                  the releasing of the  Premises,  whether or not the same shall
                  be funded by a reduction of rent, direct payment or otherwise,
                  as amortized over the life of such  improvements to the extent
                  such  amortization  occurs  during  what  would  have been the
                  remaining  portion  of  the  scheduled  Term  of  this  Lease)
                  necessary  to  return  the  Premises  to  good  condition  and
                  preparing the Premises for reletting;

                  (C)  removing,  transporting,  and  storing  any  of  Tenant's
                  property left at the Premises (although Landlord shall have no
                  obligation  to  remove,  transport,  or store  any of the said
                  property);

                  (D)  reletting  the Premises,  including  without  limitation,
                  brokerage commissions, advertising costs, and attorneys' fees;

                  (E) expert witness fees, court costs and reasonable attorney's
                  fees;

                  (F) any unamortized real estate brokerage  commissions paid in
                  connection with this Lease; and

                  (G)  costs  of  carrying  the   Premises,   such  as  repairs,
                  maintenance,  taxes  and  insurance  premiums,  utilities  and
                  security  precautions,  if any;  and (v) all other  amounts in
                  addition to or in lieu of those  previously  set out as may be
                  permitted from time to time by applicable California law.

         As used in  clauses  (i) and (ii) of Section  23(a),  the "worth at the
time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at the rate of ten percent
(10%) per annum.  As used in clause  (iii) of Section  23(a),  the "worth at the
time of award" shall be computed by discounting that amount at the discount rate
of the  Federal  Reserve  Bank of San  Francisco  at the time of award  plus one
percent  (1%). As used in this  Section,  the term "rent" shall include  Monthly
Rent as well as any other payments required by Tenant under this Lease.

         (b) continue  this Lease,  and from time to time,  without  terminating
this Lease, either:

         (i)  recover all rent and other  amounts  payable as they become due in
         accordance with California Civil Code ss.1951.4; or

24
<PAGE>



         (ii) relet the Premises or any part on behalf of Tenant on terms and at
         the  rent  that  Landlord,  in  Landlord's  sole  discretion,  may deem
         advisable,  all with the right to make  alterations  and repairs to the
         Premises,  at Tenant's cost, and apply the proceeds of reletting to the
         rent and other amounts  payable by Tenant.  To the extent that the rent
         and other amounts  payable by Tenant under this Lease exceed the amount
         of the  proceeds  from  reletting,  the Landlord may recover the excess
         from Tenant as and when due.

         (c) Upon the  occurrence  of an Event of Default,  Landlord  shall also
have the right, with or without terminating this Lease, to re-enter the Premises
and remove all persons and property  from the  Premises.  Landlord may store the
property  removed  from the  Premises in a public  warehouse or elsewhere at the
expense and for the account of Tenant.

         (d) None of the following  remedial  actions,  alone or in combination,
shall be  construed  as an election by Landlord to  terminate  this Lease unless
Landlord has in fact given Tenant  written  notice that this Lease is terminated
or unless a court of competent  jurisdiction  decrees termination of this Lease:
any act by  Landlord  to  maintain  or  preserve  the  Premises;  any efforts by
Landlord to relet the Premises; any re-entry,  repossession, or reletting of the
Premises;  or any  re-entry,  repossession,  or  reletting  of the  Premises  by
Landlord  pursuant  to this  Section.  If  Landlord  takes  any of the  previous
remedial actions without  terminating  this Lease,  Landlord may nevertheless at
any later time terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant.

         (e) If Landlord  relets the Premises,  Landlord shall apply the revenue
from the reletting as follows:  first, to the payment of any indebtedness  other
than rent due from  Tenant to  Landlord;  second,  to the payment of any cost of
reletting,  including without limitation finder's fees and leasing  commissions;
third,  to the  payment  of the  cost  of any  maintenance  and  repairs  to the
Premises;  and fourth,  to the payment of rent and other  amounts due and unpaid
under this Lease.  Landlord shall hold and apply the residue, if any, to payment
of future amounts payable under this Lease as the same may become due, and shall
be entitled to retain the eventual  balance with no liability to Tenant.  If the
revenue  from  reletting  during any month,  after  application  pursuant to the
previous provisions, is less than the sum of (i) Landlord's expenditures for the
Premises  during that month and (ii) the  amounts  due from  Tenant  during that
month, Tenant shall pay the deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand.

         (f) After the occurrence of an Event of Default,  Landlord, in addition
to or in lieu of exercising  other remedies,  may, but without any obligation to
do so,  cure the breach  underlying  the Event of Default for the account and at
the expense of Tenant. However Landlord shall by prior notice first allow Tenant
a reasonable  opportunity to cure, except in cases of emergency,  where Landlord
may  proceed  without  prior  notice  to  Tenant.  Tenant  shall,  upon  demand,
immediately reimburse Landlord for all costs,

                                       25
<PAGE>


including costs of settlements,  defense,  court costs,  and attorney fees, that
Landlord may incur in the course of any cure.

         (g) No security or guaranty for the performance of Tenant's obligations
that Landlord may now or later hold shall in any way constitute a bar or defense
to any action initiated by Landlord for unlawful detainer or for the recovery of
the Premises,  for enforcement of any obligation of Tenant,  or for the recovery
of damages caused by a breach of this Lease by Tenant or by an Event of Default.

         (h)  Except  where  this  is  inconsistent  with  or  contrary  to  any
provisions  of this  Lease,  no right or remedy  conferred  upon or  reserved to
either party is intended to be  exclusive  of any other right or remedy,  or any
right or  remedy  given  or now or  later  existing  at law or in  equity  or by
statute.  Except to the extent that either  party may have  otherwise  agreed in
writing,  no waiver by a party of any violation or  nonperformance  by the other
party of any  obligations,  agreements,  or covenants  under this Lease shall be
deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent  violation or nonperformance of the same
or any other covenant,  agreement,  or obligation,  nor shall any forbearance by
either  party to exercise a remedy for any  violation or  nonperformance  by the
other  party be deemed a waiver by that  party of the  rights or  remedies  with
respect to that violation or nonperformance,  except that acceptance by Landlord
of any amount due or owing  under the Lease  shall be a waiver of any failure of
Tenant to pay such amount.

SECTION 24.     Late Charge.

         Tenant acknowledges that Tenant's failure to pay any installment of the
Monthly  Rent,  or any other  amounts  due under  this Lease as and when due may
cause  Landlord to incur costs not  contemplated  by Landlord when entering into
this Lease,  the exact nature and amount of which would be  extremely  difficult
and  impracticable  to ascertain.  Accordingly,  (i) if any  installment  of the
Monthly  Rent is not  received  by Landlord as and when due or (ii) if any other
amount due under the Lease is not received by Landlord within three (3) business
days after notice to Tenant that such amount is past due,  then,  without notice
to Tenant,  Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to four percent (4%) of
the past due amount,  which the parties agree  represents a fair and  reasonable
estimate of the costs  incurred  by Landlord as a result of the late  payment by
Tenant.

SECTION 25.     Default Interest.

         If Tenant fails to pay any amount due under this Lease as and when due,
that amount shall bear  interest at the lesser of ten percent (10%) per annum or
the maximum rate then allowable by law from the due date until paid.






                                       26
<PAGE>


SECTION 26.     Waiver of Breach.

         Any  express  or  implied  waiver of a breach of any term of this Lease
shall not constitute a waiver of any further breach of the same or other term of
this Lease;  and the  acceptance  of rent shall not  constitute  a waiver of any
breach of any term of this Lease, except as to the payment of rent accepted.

SECTION 27.     Estoppel Certificates.

         At any time, with at least fifteen (15) days' prior notice by Landlord,
Tenant  shall  execute,  acknowledge,  and  deliver to  Landlord  a  certificate
certifying:

         (a)      the Commencement Date, the occupancy date and the Term,

         (b)      the amount of the Monthly Rent,

         (c)      the dates to which rent and other charges have been paid,

         (d) that this Lease is  unmodified  and in full force or, if there have
been modifications,  that this Lease is in full force, as modified,  and stating
the date and nature of each modification,

         (e) that no notice has been received by Tenant of any default by Tenant
that has not been cured, except, if any exist, those defaults shall be specified
in the  certificate,  and Tenant shall certify that no event has occurred  that,
but for the expiration of the applicable  time period or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute an Event of Default under this Lease,

         (f) that no default of Landlord is claimed by Tenant,  except,  if any,
those defaults shall be specified in the certificate, and

         (g)  other  matters  as may be  reasonably  requested  by  Landlord  or
Landlord's lenders.

Any such certificate may be relied on by prospective purchasers,  mortgagees, or
beneficiaries under any deed of trust on the Premises or any part of it.

SECTION 28.     Attorney Fees.

         If any action at law or in equity or any other proceeding is brought to
recover  any rent or other sums under  this  Lease,  or for or on account of any
breach or alleged  breach of or to enforce or  interpret  any of the  covenants,
terms, or conditions of this Lease, or for the recovery of the possession of the
Premises,  the  "prevailing  party"  shall be entitled to recover from the other
party as part of  prevailing  party's costs  reasonable  attorney fees and other
costs  incurred in that  action or  proceeding,  including,  but not limited to,
expert's

                                       27
<PAGE>


expenses,  in addition to any other  relief to which they may be  entitled.  The
"prevailing party" shall include without limitation (a) a party who dismisses an
action  in  exchange  for  sums  allegedly  due;  (b)  the  party  who  receives
performance  from the other party of an alleged  breach of covenant or a desired
remedy where that is substantially  equal to the relief sought in an action;  or
(c) the party determined to be the prevailing party by a court of law.

SECTION 29.     Security Deposit.

         Tenant has  deposited  with Landlord on or before the execution of this
Lease the sum of Eight Two  Thousand  Nine  Hundred  and  Seventy Six and 40/100
Dollars  ($82,976.40)  which  shall  be held by  Landlord  as  security  for the
performance  of  Tenant's  covenants  and  obligations  under  this  Lease  (the
"Security Deposit"),  it being expressly understood and agreed that the Security
Deposit is not an advance rental deposit or a measure of the Landlord's  damages
in case of Tenant's default.  Landlord agrees to pay to Tenant interest of three
percent  (3%) per annum,  compounded  annually,  on the Security  Deposit,  such
interest to be held with and increase the Security  Deposit on an annual  basis.
Upon the  occurrence of any Event of Default by Tenant,  Landlord may, from time
to time and without  prejudice to any other remedy  provided by this Lease or by
law, use the Security  Deposit to the extent  necessary to make good any arrears
of rent or other  payments or liability  caused by the Event of Default.  Tenant
shall pay to  Landlord on demand the amount that was applied in order to restore
the Security  Deposit to the amount held by Landlord  prior to the  application.
Although the Security Deposit together with any interest  accruing thereon shall
be deemed the  property  of  Landlord,  any  remaining  balance of the  Security
Deposit  shall  promptly  be  returned  by  Landlord to Tenant at the time after
termination of this Lease that all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease have
been  fulfilled to Landlord's  reasonable  satisfaction.  Landlord  shall not be
required to keep the  Security  Deposit  separate  from the general  accounts of
Landlord.  Tenant shall  concurrent  with the  execution  of this Lease  provide
Landlord with its federal  employer  identification  number to allow Landlord to
report on an annual basis the amount of interest paid on the Security Deposit.

SECTION 30.     Authority.

         (a) All individuals  executing this Lease on behalf of Tenant represent
that they are  authorized to execute and deliver this Lease on behalf of Tenant.
Tenant shall, prior to the execution of this Lease, deliver to Landlord evidence
of that authority and evidence of due formation,  all reasonably satisfactory to
Landlord.  Tenant  agrees that it shall in a timely  manner obtain all corporate
and other  approvals  necessary  to allow it to execute this Lease and carry out
Tenant's obligations hereunder.

         (b)  All  individuals  executing  this  Lease  on  behalf  of  Landlord
represent  that they are  authorized to execute and deliver this Lease on behalf
of Landlord.  Landlord shall,  prior to the execution of this Lease,  deliver to
Tenant evidence of that authority, all reasonably satisfactory to Tenant.

SECTION 31.     Notices.

         Except as  otherwise  expressly  provided by law,  all notices or other
communications  required or permitted by this Lease or by law to be served on or
given to either  party to this Lease by the other  party shall be in writing and
shall be deemed served when  personally  delivered to the party to whom they are

         Either  party,  Tenant or  Landlord,  may  change the  address  for the
purpose  of this  Section  by giving  written  notice of the change to the other
party in the manner provided in this Section.

SECTION 32.     Heirs and Successors.

         This Lease  shall be binding on and shall  inure to the  benefit of the
heirs,  executors,  administrators,  successors,  and  assigns of  Landlord  and
Tenant.

SECTION 33.     Partial Invalidity.

         Should  any  provision  of this  Lease be held by a court of  competent
jurisdiction to be either invalid or unenforceable,  the remaining provisions of
this Lease shall remain in effect, unimpaired by the holding.



                                       29

SECTION 34.     Entire Agreement.

         This  instrument  constitutes the sole agreement  between  Landlord and
Tenant respecting the Premises,  the leasing of the Premises to Tenant,  and the
specified  lease term, and correctly sets forth the  obligations of Landlord and
Tenant.  Any  agreement  or  representations  respecting  the  Premises or their
leasing by Landlord to Tenant not  expressly  set forth in this  instrument  are
void.

SECTION 35.     Time of the Essence.

         Time is of the essence in this Lease.

SECTION 36.     Rent.

         All  monetary  obligations  of Tenant  to  Landlord  under  the  Lease,
including but not limited to the Monthly Rent shall be deemed rent.

SECTION 37.     Amendments.

         This Lease may be  modified  only in writing  and only if signed by the
parties at the time of the modification.

SECTION 38.     Subordination. Nondisturbance and Attornment.

         (a) This  Lease and the  rights of Tenant  hereunder  are  subject  and
subordinate to any lien of the holder of or beneficiary under a mortgage or deed
of trust which now or in the future  encumbers  the  Premises and to any and all
advances made thereunder, and interest thereon, and all modifications, renewals,
supplements, consolidations and replacements thereof.

          (b) Tenant  agrees  that any lender  may at its  option,  unilaterally
elect to subordinate in whole or in part,  such lien of such mortgage or deed or
trust to this Lease,  provided that such subordination shall be conditioned upon
lender  agreeing to enter into a  nondisturbance  and attornment  agreement with
Tenant  which shall  provide that (i) so long as Tenant is not in default in the
payment  of  rent  or in the  performance  of any of the  terms,  covenants  and
conditions  of this  Lease,  the  beneficiary  under a mortgage or deed of trust
which now  encumbers  the  Premises  and any  purchaser  at a trustee's  sale or
foreclosure  sale shall not interfere  with Tenant's  possession of the Premises
during the term of this Lease,  and (ii) if Landlord's  interest in the Premises
is  transferred to the  beneficiary  under a mortgage or deed of trust which now
encumbers the Premises or any other purchaser at a trustee's sale or foreclosure
sale of the Premises,  Tenant shall agree to be bound to such  transferee  under
all of the terms,  covenants and  conditions of the Lease for the balance of the
term  hereof   (including   any   extensions  or  renewals).   Except  for  such
nondisturbance  agreement,  such subordination or priority of this Lease, as the
case may be, shall be effective  without the  necessity of executing any further
instrument or

                                       30
<PAGE>


agreement to effect such  subordination  or priority;  provided,  however,  that
Tenant  agrees to execute,  acknowledge  and deliver to Landlord upon demand any
and all  instruments  required  by  Landlord,  lessor or lender  evidencing  the
subordination  or  priority  of this Lease,  as the case may be.  Tenant  hereby
irrevocably  appoints  Landlord  as  its  agent  and   attorney-in-fact   (which
appointment is coupled with an interest) to execute, acknowledge and deliver any
such  instruments  in the name of and on behalf of Tenant if Tenant  fails to so
execute,  acknowledge and deliver such instruments  within 10 days after written
request  therefor.  Landlord agrees to use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
cause any lender or other party to a nondisturbance agreement to agree that upon
taking possession of the Premises it will be bound by the ongoing obligations of
Landlord under this Lease, other than such past obligations with regard to which
Landlord may be then in default.

         (c) Within  thirty (30) days of the  execution  by both parties of this
Lease,  Landlord  shall cause the holder of or  beneficiary  under a mortgage or
deed of trust which now  encumbers  the Premises to enter into a  nondisturbance
and  attornment  agreement  with Tenant which shall  provide that (i) so long as
Tenant is not in default in the payment of rent or in the  performance of any of
the terms,  covenants and  conditions  of this Lease,  the  beneficiary  under a
mortgage or deed of trust which now  encumbers the Premises and any purchaser at
a  trustee's  sale  or  foreclosure  sale  shall  not  interfere  with  Tenant's
possession  of the  Premises  during  the  term  of  this  Lease,  and;  (ii) If
Landlord's  interest in the Premises is transferred to the  beneficiary  under a
mortgage  or deed of  trust  which  now  encumbers  the  Premises  or any  other
purchaser at a trustee's sale or foreclosure sale of the Premises,  Tenant shall
agree to be bound to such  transferee  under  all of the  terms,  covenants  and
conditions  of the Lease  for the  balance  of the term  hereof  (including  any
extensions or renewals).

SECTION 39.     Merger.

         The voluntary or other  surrender of this Lease by Tenant,  or a mutual
cancellation  of the  Lease,  or a  termination  by  Landlord,  shall not work a
merger,  and shall,  at the option of  Landlord,  terminate  all or any existing
subtenancies  or may, at the option of Landlord,  operate as an  assignment to a
Landlord of any of the subtenancies.

SECTION 40.     Intentionally Omitted.

SECTION 41.     Options To Extend Term.

         (a) Tenant shall have the option (collectively the "Extension Options")
to extend the Term,  for two (2)  additional  periods (each an "Option Term") by
giving  Landlord  prior  written  notice of Tenant's  election to exercise  each

         Except for the Monthly  Rent,  the lease of the  Premises for the First
Option Term shall be on the same terms and  conditions  as are contained in this
Lease.

         (c) The Second  Option  Term will  extend the First  Option  Term for a
period  commencing the day following the expiration of the First Option Term and
ending on June 30, 2011 (the  "Second  Option  Term").  The Monthly Rent for the
Second Option Term shall be determined in accordance with Section 42 hereof.

         (d) Each of the  Extension  Options are  personal  to the named  tenant
herein and any  Transfer of such  tenant's  interest in the Lease  (other than a
Permitted Transfer),  whether or not consented to by Landlord,  shall cause such
Extension  Option and any subsequent  Extension Option to terminate and be of no
further force or effect.

SECTION 42.     Determination Of Monthly Rent for Second  Option Term.

         For purposes of Section 41(c),  Monthly Rent for the Second Option Term
shall be determined as follows:

         (a) Parties shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt by Landlord of
Tenant's notice electing to exercise the second  Extension  Option,  to agree on
the Monthly Rent for the Second Option Term. If the parties agree on the Monthly
Rent for the Second Option Term, by such date, they shall immediately execute an
amendment to this Lease stating the Monthly Rent for the Second Option Term.

         (b) If the parties  are unable to agree upon the  Monthly  Rent for the
Second Option Term in accordance  with Section 42(a),  then within fourteen (14)
days after the parties fail to agree on the Monthly  Rent for the Second  Option
Term,  each  party at its cost and by giving  notice to the other  party,  shall
appoint a real  estate  appraiser  with at least  five (5)  years  full time MAI
appraisal experience in Santa Clara County, to determine

                                       32
<PAGE>


the  Monthly  Rent for  the  Second  Option  Term,  and  shall  deliver  to said
appraiser as well as the other party, such party's proposal for the Monthly Rent
for the Second Option Term. If a party does not appoint an appraiser within said
fourteen (14) day period and the other party has given notice of the name of its
appraiser,  the single appraiser appointed shall be the sole appraiser and shall
determine  the Monthly  Rent for the Second  Option  Term.  If an  appraiser  is
appointed  by each of the parties as provided in this  section,  they shall meet
promptly  and attempt to set the Monthly  Rent for the Second  Option  Term,  by
agreeing on which party's  proposal most closely reflects the Fair Market Rental
Value for the Second Option Term. If they are unable to agree within thirty (30)
days after the second  appraiser has been appointed,  the appraisers can if they
so agree cause to be appointed a third  appraiser  who meets the  qualifications
stated in this  Section or if they cannot so agree either of the parties to this
Lease, by giving ten (10) days notice to the other party,  can apply to the then
Presiding  Judge of the Santa Clara County Superior Court for the appointment of
a third appraiser who meets the qualifications  stated in this Section.  Each of
the parties shall bear one-half of the cost of  appointing  the third  appraiser
together with one-half of such appraiser's  fee. The third  appraiser,  however,
shall be a person who has not previously  acted in any capacity for either party
during the prior three (3) years. Within thirty (30) days after the selection of
the third appraiser,  a majority of the appraisers shall determine which party's
proposal  more  closely  reflects  the Fair Market  Rental  Value for the Second
Option Term.  As used herein,  "Fair  Market  Rental  Value" shall mean the then
prevailing  annual  rental rate per square foot of rentable  area for mixed used
industrial  space in  comparable  buildings in Santa Clara County which has been
built out for occupancy,  comparable in area and location to the space for which
such rental rate is being  determined  (to the extent that quoted  rental  rates
vary with regard to  location),  being leased for a duration  comparable  to the
term for which such space is being leased and taking into  consideration  rental
concessions and abatements, tenant improvement allowances, if any, being offered
by Landlord,  the "as is" condition of the space,  operating expenses and taxes,
other adjustments to basic rent and other comparable factors.

         (c) After the appraisers  determine which party's proposal more closely
reflects the Fair Market Rental Value for the Second Option Term, the appraisers
shall  immediately  notify the parties and the parties of their findings and the
parties shall immediately execute an amendment to this Lease stating the Monthly
Rent for the  Second  Option  Term based upon the  party's  proposal  which most
closely  reflects  the Fair  Market  Rental  Value for the Second  Option  Term,
provided  however that in no event shall the Monthly Rent for the Second  Option
Term be less than the Monthly Rent immediately preceding the commencement of the
Second Option Term.

SECTION 43.     Tenant Improvements.

         Landlord  agrees to effect a program of Alterations  for the renovation
of the Premises as soon after the  Commencement  Date as the mutual best efforts
of Landlord and Tenant shall allow. All such Alterations effected as part of the
renovation program being hereinafter  referred to as the "Tenant  Improvements."
The renovation  program shall be  accomplished in accordance with the provisions
of Section 11 of this Lease and

                                       33
<PAGE>


the  provisions  of a work letter  agreement  to be agreed upon by Landlord  and
Tenant no later than June 1, 1998, to be marked Exhibit C (Work Letter),  and to
be attached hereto and  incorporated  herein,  in form and substance  similar to
Exhibit B (Work  Letter)  which is  attached  hereto  and  incorporated  herein,
subject to the following provisions:

          (a) Tenant shall bear the cost of the Tenant Improvements and the cost
of architectural and engineering  consultants in connection therewith,  provided
however  that  Landlord  shall  contribute  an amount not to exceed Five Dollars
($5.00) per square foot of Building (specifically not including Warehouse) space
(the  "Unrestricted  Tenant  Improvement   Allowance")  to  be  applied  to  the
construction of new tenant improvements  together with the cost of architectural
and engineering consultants in connection therewith.

         (b) In  addition  to the  Unrestricted  Tenant  Improvement  Allowance,
Landlord  agrees to contribute  an amount not to exceed Two Dollars  ($2.00) per
square  foot of  Building  (specifically  not  including  Warehouse)  space (the
"Restricted  Tenant  Improvement  Allowance")  for the removal and demolition of
existing tenant  improvements  located in the Premises on the Commencement  Date
and the upgrading of the Premises to comply with Legal  Requirements (as defined
in Section 6 hereof) in effect as of the date of this Lease,  including  but not
limited  to  compliance  with  the  ADA,  Title  24 of the  California  Code  of
Regulations,   and  the  Uniform  Building  Code  (collectively  the  "Upgrading
Requirements").  By way of example and not by way of limitation,  the Restricted
Tenant  Improvement  Allowance would be available to pay for the installation of
smoke detectors, door handles, door locks, signage,  handicapped  accessibility,
lighting and  lighting  controls if and to the extent such items are required by
Legal  Requirements in place as of the date of this Lease.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  the Restricted  Tenant  Improvement  Allowance shall not be used for
compliance  with  Legal   Requirements   in  the   construction  of  new  tenant
improvements  but only in causing the compliance with Legal  Requirements of the
existing  improvements,  it being the  intention of the parties  hereto that the
cost of compliance  with Legal  Requirements  in the  construction of new tenant
improvements be paid out of the Unrestricted Tenant Improvement Allowance.

         (c) If and to the  extent  that  either  (i) the cost of the new tenant
improvements  to be  constructed  in the  Premises  (inclusive  of the  cost  of
architectural and engineering  consultants in connection  therewith) exceeds the
Unrestricted Tenant Improvement Allowance or (ii) the cost of improvements to be
constructed  in the Premises  pursuant to the provisions of Section 43(b) exceed
the  aggregate of the  Restricted  Tenant  Improvement  Allowance,  Tenant shall
reimburse Landlord for such excess within fifteen (15) days following receipt by
Tenant of invoices for such excess.

         (d) Landlord  represents and warrants that as of the date of completion
of the Tenant Improvements (i) the Premises and the Tenant Improvements shall be
in full compliance with all applicable Legal  Requirements and shall be built in
a good and  workmanlike  manner with good materials in accordance with the plans
therefore,  (ii) the equipment and the building systems serving the Premises are
in good working order, and

                                       34
<PAGE>


(iii) to the best of  Landlord's  knowledge,  no Hazardous  Substances  exist in
measurable  quantities  in or about  the  Premises.  Landlord  agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any contractor responsible for a latent
defect to cure such latent defect.  Landlord  hereby agrees to indemnify  Tenant
against any inaccuracy in the representations contained in this Section 43(d).

SECTION 44.     Right of First Offer.

         At any time during the Term, Tenant shall have the right of first offer
to acquire the  Premises on the terms and  conditions  set forth in this Section
(the "Right of First Offer"). If at any time during the Term or any extension or
renewal thereof, Landlord elects to sell its interest in the Premises,  Landlord
shall notify Tenant in writing by certified mail, return receipt  requested,  of
its intent to sell its interest in the Premises  (the "Sale  Notice").  The Sale
Notice shall contain the price and terms on which Landlord  intends to offer its
interest in the  Premises on the open  market.  Tenant  shall have  fifteen (15)
business days from said  notification  to notify Landlord in writing of Tenant's
intent to negotiate a purchase of the Premises (the "Exercise  Notice").  Tenant
and  Landlord  shall then have thirty (30) days from  Landlord's  receipt of the
Exercise  Notice to agree on the terms and  conditions  of a  purchase  and sale
agreement covering the Premises (the "Purchase  Agreement").  If Tenant fails to
give the Exercise Notice,  it will be deemed that Tenant has waived its Right of
First Offer.  If Landlord  and Tenant do not enter into the  Purchase  Agreement
covering  the  Premises  within such thirty (30) day period,  Tenant's  Right of
First Offer to purchase the Premises shall terminate and Landlord shall have the
right to sell the Premises to a third party on any terms and conditions it deems
acceptable in its sole discretion. The Right of First Offer shall not apply to a
transfer to a party related to  Landlord..  The Right of First Offer is personal
to the named  tenant  herein and any Transfer of such  tenant's  interest in the
Lease  (other  than  a  Permitted  Transfer),  whether  or not  consented  to by
Landlord, shall cause the Right of First Offer to terminate and be of no further
effect.

SECTION 45.     Hazardous Materials.

         (a) Tenant agrees that any and all handling,  transportation,  storage,
treatment,  disposal,  or use of Hazardous  Substances by Tenant in or about the
Premises shall strictly comply with all applicable Environmental Laws.

         (b) Tenant agrees to indemnify,  defend and hold Landlord harmless from
any liabilities,  losses,  claims,  damages,  penalties,  fines,  attorney fees,
expert fees,  court costs,  remediation  costs,  investigation  costs,  or other
expenses  resulting  from  or  arising  out  of  the  use,  storage,  treatment,
transportation,  release,  or disposal of Hazardous  Substances  on or about the
Premises by Tenant.





                                       35
<PAGE>


         (c) If the presence of Hazardous  Substances  on the Project  caused or
permitted by Tenant results in the contamination or deterioration of the Project
or any water or soil beneath the Project,  Tenant shall promptly take all action
necessary to investigate and remediate that contamination.

         (d) Landlord and Tenant each agree to promptly  notify the other of any
communication received from any governmental entity concerning the contamination
of the  Property or the  Premises by Hazardous  Substances  or the  violation of
Environmental Laws that relate to the Premises.

         (e) Tenant shall not use, handle, store, transport,  generate, release,
or dispose of any Hazardous Substances on, under, or about the Premises,  except
that Tenant may use (i) small  quantities of common chemicals such as adhesives,
lubricants, and cleaning fluids in order to conduct business at the Premises and
(ii) other Hazardous Substances that are necessary for the operation of Tenant's
business all of which shall be used in accordance  with all  Environmental  Laws
(as  hereinafter  defined).  At any time during the term of this  Lease,  Tenant
shall,  within ten (10) days after written  request from  Landlord,  disclose in
writing all Hazardous  Substances that are being used by Tenant on the Premises,
the nature of the use, and the manner of storage and disposal.

         (f) At any time and upon prior written  notice to Tenant,  Landlord may
require  testing  wells to be drilled on the Premises and may require the ground
water to be tested to detect the presence of Hazardous  Substances by the use of
any tests that are then  customarily  used for those  purposes.  Landlord  shall
supply  Tenant with copies of the test  results.  The cost of these tests and of
the  installation,  maintenance,  repair,  and replacement of the wells shall be
paid by Tenant if the tests  disclose  the  existence of facts that give rise to
liability of Tenant pursuant to this Section 45.

         (g)  Landlord  has  provided  to Tenant and Tenant  has  approved  that
certain Phase I  Environmental  Assessment  Moffett  Industrial Park 140 Caspian
Court, 169 Java Drive, 111 Java Drive Sunnyvale,  California ENV01540,  prepared
for Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. by All  Environmental,  Inc., dated November 8, 1994,
covering, inter alia, the Premises (the "Phase I ESA"). Landlord shall perform a
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment ("Entrance Assessment"),  consisting of an
update of the Phase I ESA, which Entrance  Assessment  shall be addressed to and
may be relied upon by both Landlord and Tenant. Landlord shall provide a copy of
the  report of the  Entrance  Assessment  to  Tenant.  The cost of the  Entrance
Assessment  shall be paid by Landlord.  Provided  that the  Entrance  Assessment
shows no  material  adverse  changes in the  condition  of the  Property  or the
Premises  from the Phase I ESA,  Tenant  shall be deemed  to have  approved  the
Entrance Assessment upon receipt of the Entrance  Assessment.  In the event that
the Entrance  Assessment shows a material adverse change in the condition of the
Property  or the  Premises  from the  Phase I ESA,  Landlord  shall  immediately
remediate  such  condition  or in the  event  Landlord  refuses  or  fails to so
remediate such condition or fails to complete such remediation within sixty (60)
days following the commencement of such remediation, Tenant shall have the right
to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Landlord.

         (h) Landlord agrees to indemnify,  defend and hold Tenant harmless from
any liabilities,  losses,  claims,  damages,  penalties,  fines,  attorney fees,
expert fees,  court costs,  remediation  costs,  investigation  costs,  or other
expenses  resulting  from or  arising  out of (i) the use,  storage,  treatment,
transportation,  release,  or disposal of Hazardous  Substances  on or about the
Premises  prior to  Tenant's  occupancy  of the  Premises  and (ii) the off site
migration  of  Hazardous  Substances  onto or under the  Premises,  whether such
migration occurs prior to, during or after Tenant's occupancy of the Premises.

         (i) Within fifteen (15) days after vacating the Premises,  Tenant shall
perform,  at  Tenant's  sole  cost and  expense,  a Phase I  Environmental  Site
Assessment  covering the Premises and the Property as necessary to bring current
the Entrance  Assessment prepared by a reputable  environmental  consulting firm
acceptable to Landlord in Landlord's sole  discretion  (the "Exit  Assessment"),
provided,  however,  that the firm which issues the Entrance Assessment shall be
acceptable to Landlord for purposes of issuing the Exit  Assessment,  so long as
such firm remains  licensed and in good  standing  within its  industry.  In the
event that the Exit Assessment  discloses  contamination  of the Property or the
Premises  resulting from or arising out causes other than (i) the use,  storage,
treatment,  transportation,  release, or disposal of Hazardous  Substances on or
about the Premises  prior to Tenant's  occupancy of the Premises or (ii) the off
site migration of Hazardous Substances onto or under the Premises,  occurs prior
to,  during or after  Tenant's  occupancy  of the  Premises,  Tenant  shall,  at
Tenant's sole cost and expense,  immediately  commence and diligently  pursue to
completion the remediation of such  contamination  as well as such other actions
as  may  be  recommended  by  the  Exit  Assessment  (collectively  "Remediation
Actions").  Tenant  acknowledges and agrees that Remediation Actions that extend
beyond the termination or sooner  expiration of this Lease may cause Landlord to
sustain lost rental income.  Accordingly,  if Remediation  Actions extend beyond
the  termination  or sooner  expiration of this Lease,  then Tenant shall pay to
Landlord an amount equal to the Holdover  Rent for the period  during which such
Remediation  Actions extend beyond the termination or sooner  expiration of this
Lease.  Nothing contained herein shall limit or restrict any liability of Tenant
for the completion of the Remediation  Actions in accordance with applicable law
and the recommendations of the Exit Assessment,  nor shall anything herein serve
to limit or restrict Tenant's liability under this Section 45.

         (j) As used herein the following terms have the following meanings:

"Environmental Laws" means all federal,  state, local, or municipal laws, rules,
orders, regulations,  statutes,  ordinances,  codes, decrees, or requirements of
any  government  authority  regulating,  relating  to, or imposing  liability or
standards of conduct concerning any Hazardous  Substance (as later defined),  or
pertaining to occupational  health or industrial hygiene (and only to the extent
that  the  occupational  health  or  industrial  hygiene  laws,  ordinances,  or
regulations  relate to Hazardous  Substances on, under,  or about the Premises),

         Tenant  has  designated  the  Tenant's   Representative   as  the  sole
representative  with  respect to the  matters set forth in this Work Letter with
full authority and  responsibility to act on behalf of the Tenant as required in
this Work Letter.  Landlord has designated the Landlord's  Representative as the
sole  representative  with  respect to the matters set forth in this Work Letter
with full authority and  responsibility to act on behalf of Landlord as required
in this Work Letter.  Either party may change the representative under this Work
Letter at any time by giving five (5) days' written notice to the other party.

         SECTION 3.     Procedure and Costs.

         Landlord  and Tenant will comply  with the  procedure  outlined in this
Section  in  preparing,   delivering,   approving,  and  seeking  and  obtaining
regulatory   approval  of  all  matters  relating  to  the  Improvements  to  be
constructed by Landlord.

         (a) Working  Drawings and Cost  Estimates.  Landlord and Tenant  hereby
agree  to  expend  their  individual  best  efforts  to  accomplish  each of the
activities  referenced in the  Pre-Construction  Schedule on or before the dates
assigned to each such activity.  The number of days which any listed activity is
delayed  beyond the date assigned for  completion of any such activity  shall be
allocated as Landlord Delay(s), Tenant Delay(s), or Unavoidable Delay(s), as the
case may be, in the manner outlined in this Agreement.  If the date on which the
Premises is Ready for  Occupancy  occurs on or before April 1, 1999,  no further
action shall be taken with regard to delays and no delay  penalties shall be due
or  payable.  If the date on which the  Premises is Ready for  Occupancy  occurs
after April 1, 1999, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum of $2,500 for each day
of Tenant  Delay  between  April 1, 1999 and the date on which the  Premises  is
deemed Ready for Occupancy under this Agreement,  it being understood and agreed
that Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against any delay  penalties which may
become  payable  by Tenant  to  Landlord  in the sum of  $2,500  for each day of
Landlord Delay. Neither party shall be penalized for Unavoidable Delays.

                  (i)  For  purposes  of  this  subsection  (a),  the  following
         numbered line items on the Pre-Construction  Schedule shall be the sole
         responsibility of Tenant: 1 and 3.

                  (ii)  For  purposes  of this  subsection  (a),  the  following
         numbered  line  items  on the  Pre-Construction  Schedule  shall be the
         responsibility of both Landlord and Tenant: 2, 6, 9, and 11.

                  (iii) For purposes of this  subsection  (a), both Landlord and
         Tenant shall share  responsibility  for  providing  full,  complete and
         prompt response and assistance to the General Contractor with regard to
         the following numbered line items on the Pre-Construction  Schedule: 4,
         5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

                                       3
<PAGE>



         (b) General Contractor.  Landlord shall execute a construction contract
with  General  Contractor  relating to  construction  of the  Improvements  (the
"Construction  Contract") in accordance  with the Approved  Final Working Plans,
promptly following approval by Landlord and Tenant. Landlord shall cause any and
all assignable  warranties under the Construction  Contract and any subcontracts
entered  into  in  connection  therewith  to be  assigned  to  Tenant  upon  the
completion of the Improvements.

         (c)  Construction  of  Improvements.  Landlord  shall  expend  its best
efforts  to  cause  the  General   Contractor  to  construct  and  complete  the
Improvements  substantially  in accordance with the Approved Final Working Plans
in good and  workmanlike  manner subject only to Tenant Delays,  Landlord Delays
and Unavoidable Delays .

         (d) Changes. If at any time Tenant desires any changes, alterations, or
additions  to any of the  Approved  Final  Working  Plans,  Tenant must submit a
detailed written request to Landlord (a "Change Order").  If construction of the
portion of the Improvements  Tenant seeks to change has not commenced and if the
requested  changes are reasonable  and  practical,  Landlord will seek to comply
with the Change  Order.  Under no  circumstance  will  Landlord  be  required to
undertake  any change,  alteration,  or addition  to any of the  Approved  Final
Working   Plans  prior  to  the   execution   of  a  Change  Order  by  Tenant's
Representative.   If  any  additional  plans,  drawings  of  specifications,  or
modifications  of those items are required as a result of a Change  Order,  they
will be prepared  and approved in the manner set forth in Section  3(a).  Delays
caused by Change Orders shall be Tenant Delays.

         (e) Tenant  Delays.  In the event of any Tenant Delay,  Landlord  shall
expend its reasonable efforts to cause notice of such Tenant Delay(s) to be sent
to Tenant as soon as reasonably  practicable after Landlord becomes aware of any
such Tenant Delay(s),  provided, however, that Landlord's failure to give notice
of any such  Tenant  Delay shall have no impact on the  designation  of any such
delays as Tenant Delay(s).

         SECTION 4.     Payment.

         All amounts payable by Tenant to Landlord pursuant to the provisions of
Paragraph 43 of the Lease shall be due and payable by Tenant within fifteen (15)
calendar days after the  rendering to Tenant of a bill by Landlord,  which bills
shall not be rendered any more frequently than once per calendar month. Tenant's
failure  to pay  within the  fifteen  (15) day time  period  will  constitute  a
monetary  default under the Lease,  and all amounts will then bear interest from
the date on which the bills were  submitted to Tenant until paid in full, at the
lesser of ten percent (10%) per annum or the highest rate allowed by law.



                                       4

         SECTION 5.     Ready for Occupancy.

         Landlord will cause the General Contractor and the Architect to deliver
to  Tenant a  written  notice  of  substantial  completion  certifying  that the
Improvements  have been  completed in  conformance  with the  provisions  of the
Construction  Contract,  the Approved Final Working Plans, and any Change Orders
("Substantial Completion"). Upon receipt by Tenant of such notice of Substantial
Completion, the Improvements will be deemed delivered to Tenant for all purposes
of the Lease and Landlord's obligations under the provisions of Paragraphs 43(a)
and 43(b) of the Lease shall be deemed to be fully  discharged.  Within five (5)
days after receipt of the notice of Substantial Completion, Tenant shall conduct
a  walk-through  inspection  of  the  Premises  with  Landlord  to  inspect  the
Improvements and the Premises, and Tenant's  representative,  within thirty (30)
days following such inspection shall develop and provide Landlord with a written
list of Punch List Work.  Landlord will diligently cause the General  Contractor
to complete  the Punch List Work within a  reasonable  time  thereafter.  In the
event of any dispute as to substantial  completion of work performed or required
to be performed by Landlord,  the  certificate  of Landlord's  architect will be
conclusive.  Substantial completion will have occurred  notwithstanding Tenant's
submission of a list of Punch List Work to Landlord.

         SECTION 6.     No Agency.

         Nothing  contained in this Letter will make or constitute Tenant as the
agent of Landlord.

         SECTION 7.     Notices.

communications  required or permitted by this Work Letter or by law to be served
