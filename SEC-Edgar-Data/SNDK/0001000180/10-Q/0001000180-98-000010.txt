              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


1.     These interim condensed  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited
       but  reflect,  in  the  opinion  of  management,   all  normal  recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation  and  Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of September 30, 1998,
       and the results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine month
       periods ended  September 30, 1998 and 1997.  Because all the  disclosures
       required by generally  accepted  accounting  principles are not included,
       these interim condensed  consolidated financial statements should be read
       in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto in
       the  Company's  annual  report on Form 10-K as of, and for the year ended
       December 31, 1997.  The condensed  consolidated  balance sheet data as of
       December 31, 1997 was derived from the audited financial statements.

       The  results  of  operations  and cash flows for the three and nine month
       periods  ended  September  30,  1998 are not  necessarily  indicative  of
       results of operations and cash flows for any future period.

2.     The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31, and
       each fiscal  quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, and
       September  30.  The  third  fiscal  quarter  of 1998  and  1997  ended on
       September 27, 1998 and September 28, 1997, respectively. Fiscal year 1997
       ended on December 28, 1997. For ease of  presentation,  the  accompanying
       financial  statements  have  been  shown as ending on the last day of the
       calendar month.

3.     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

6.     To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be  necessary  to  initiate  litigation  with one or more third  parties,
       including  but not limited to those the Company has  notified of possible
       patent  infringement.  In  addition,  one or more of  these  parties,  or
       others, may bring suit against the Company.

       In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal  court  against
       Lexar Media, Inc.  ("Lexar") for infringement of a fundamental  flashdisk
       patent.  Lexar has disputed the Company's  claim of patent  infringement,
       claimed SanDisk's patent is invalid or unenforceable and asserted various
       counterclaims including unfair competition,  violation of the Lanham Act,
       patent misuse,  interference with prospective  economic advantage,  trade
       defamation and fraud. SanDisk has denied each of Lexar's counterclaims.

        In July 1998, the federal  district court denied Lexar's request to have
       the case  dismissed  on the  grounds  the  Company  failed to  perform an
       adequate prefiling  investigation.  Discovery in the Lexar suit commenced
       in August 1998.  The Company  intends to vigorously  enforce its patents,
       but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful.

       From  time to  time  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  certain  of its
       suppliers  and customers for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances  include  indemnification
       for damages and expenses,  including attorneys fees. The Company may from
       time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of such indemnification
       obligations. Third party claims

                                     Page 7
<PAGE>


       for patent  infringement  are excluded from coverage  under the Company's
       insurance policies.  There can be no assurance that any future obligation
       to  indemnify  the  Company's  customers  or  suppliers,  will not have a
       material adverse effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition
       and results of operations.

       Any  litigation,  whether as a plaintiff or as a  defendant,  will likely
       result in  significant  expense to the  Company and divert the efforts of
       the Company's  technical and  management  personnel,  whether or not such
       litigation is ultimately determined in favor of the Company. In the event
       of an  adverse  result  in any  such  litigation,  the  Company  could be
       required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture,  use and sale
       of  infringing   products,   expend  significant   resources  to  develop
       non-infringing   technology   or  obtain   licenses  to  the   infringing
       technology,  or discontinue  the use of certain  processes.  Accordingly,
       there  can be no  assurance  that any of the  foregoing  matters,  or any
       future  litigation,  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
       Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

7.     The Company  recorded a provision for income taxes at a 36% effective tax
       rate for the first nine months of 1998  compared to a 15%  effective  tax
       rate for the same period of 1997.  The  effective  tax rate for the first
       nine months of 1997 was  substantially  below the federal  statutory rate
       due to the  utilization  of federal  and state tax credit  carryforwards,
       Foreign  Sales  Corporation  tax benefits and a reduction in the deferred
       tax asset valuation allowance.

8.     The Company has a credit agreement (the Agreement) with a bank, which was
       renewed  in July  1998.  Under the  provisions  of the  Agreement,  which
       expires in July 1999,  the  Company  may borrow up to $10.0  million on a
       revolving line of credit at the bank's prime interest rate. Amounts under
       the revolving line of credit can be applied to the issuance of letters of
       credit up to the full amount of the credit line.  At September  30, 1998,
       $1.0 million of letters of credit were  outstanding.  In addition,  under
       the  Agreement,  the Company also has a $15.0  million  foreign  exchange
       contract  line under which the Company  may enter into  foreign  exchange
       contracts.  As of September 30, 1998, $2.8 million was outstanding  under
       the foreign exchange contract portion of the line. The Agreement contains
       covenants that require the Company to maintain  certain  financial ratios
       and levels of net worth.  The  Agreement  prohibits  the  payment of cash
       dividends to stockholders.

9.     On   August   21,    1998,    the   Company    implemented    an   option
       cancellation/regrant  program.  Under the  cancellation/regrant  program,
       employees  could elect to  exchange  their stock  options  with  exercise
       prices in excess of $12.00 per share for new options priced at $10.00 per
       share, the market price of the Company's common stock on August 21, 1998.
       Under the new options,  shares  become  exercisable  six to twelve months
       later than under the old  higher-priced  options.  The new options have a
       maximum term of ten years from the August 21, 1998, grant date.  Officers
       and directors of the Company were not eligible for  participation  in the
       option   cancellation/regrant   program.  Options  covering  a  total  of
       approximately  903,425  shares were  canceled and regranted in connection
       with the program.

10.    As of  January  1, 1998,  the  Company  adopted  statement  of  Financial
       Accounting  Standards  No.  130  (SFAS  130),  "Reporting   Comprehensive
       Income." SFAS 130  establishes new rules for the reporting and display of
       comprehensive  income and its components;  however,  the adoption of this
       Statement  had no impact on the  Company's  net  income or  stockholders'
       equity.  SFAS 130 requires  unrealized  gains or losses on the  Company's
       available-for-sale  securities,  which  prior to adoption  were  reported
       separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in other comprehensive
       income.

       No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,"

       Because of the Company's minimal use of derivatives,  management does not
       anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant
       effect on earnings or the financial position of the Company.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

         Certain  statements  in this  discussion  and  analysis,  including  in
particular,  the paragraph  discussing patent license and royalty revenues,  are
forward  looking  statements  based on current  expectations  and entail various
risks and  uncertainties  that could cause actual  results to differ  materially
from  those  expressed  in such  forward  looking  statements.  Such  risks  and
uncertainties  are discussed  below and in the Company's  Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1997 under the heading "Risk Factors".  Readers are cautioned
not to place undue  reliance on these forward  looking  statements,  which speak
only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these
forward looking  statements to reflect events or  circumstances  occurring after
the date hereof. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

         The  Company  was  founded  in 1988 to develop  and  market  flash data
storage systems.  The Company sells its products to the consumer electronics and
industrial/communications markets. The percentage of the Company's product sales
attributable to the consumer electronics market has increased  substantially and
in 1998 represents approximately 60% of product revenues. This increase in sales
to the  consumer  market  resulted in a shift to  CompactFlash  products,  which
typically  have lower  average  selling  prices and gross  margins  than  higher
capacity  products.  In addition,  these products are  frequently  sold into the
retail  channel,  which usually has shorter  customer order  lead-times than the
other channels used by the Company,  thereby decreasing the Company's ability to
accurately  forecast  future  production  needs.  Subject  to  continued  market
acceptance of its  CompactFlash  products,  the Company  believes these products
will continue to represent a majority of the Company's  sales as the  popularity
of consumer applications,  including digital cameras,  increases. The percentage
of sales  attributable  to orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter has
increased  over time and,  in  response,  the Company is  continuing  to work to
shorten its manufacturing cycle times.

         Beginning in late 1995, the Company adopted a strategy of licensing its
flash technology,  including portions of its patent portfolio, to selected third
party  manufacturers  of flash  products.  To date, the Company has entered into
patent  cross-license  agreements  with six companies,  and it intends to pursue
opportunities to enter into additional  licenses.  The Company's current license
agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties,  or a combination
thereof,  to the  Company.  The  timing and  amount of these  payments  can vary
substantially from quarter to quarter,  depending on the terms of each agreement
and, in some cases,  the timing of sales of products by the other parties.  As a
result,  license and royalty revenues have fluctuated  significantly in the past
and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high
gross margins  associated with license and royalty  revenues,  gross margins and
net income are likely to  fluctuate  more with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues than with changes in product revenues.

         SanDisk  markets  its  products  using  a  direct  sales  organization,
distributors,  manufacturers' representatives,  private label partners, OEMs and
retailers.  The  Company  expects  that sales  through the retail  channel  will
comprise  an  increasing  share  of total  revenues  in the  future,  and that a
substantial  portion  of its  sales  into  the  retail  channel  will be made to
participants  that will have the right to return  unsold  products.  The Company
recognizes  revenues from sales to the retail channel and distributors  when the
products are sold to the end customers.

         Historically,  a majority of the Company's sales have been to a limited
number of customers. The Company expects that sales of its products to a limited
number of customers  will continue to account for a  substantial  portion of its
product  revenues for the foreseeable  future.  The Company has also experienced
significant  changes in the  composition  of its customer base from year to year
and  expects  this  pattern to  continue  as market  demand for such  customers'
products fluctuates. The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by major
customers,  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations.  See "Risk  Factors - Customer
Concentration."

                                    Page 10
<PAGE>



         Export sales are an important part of the Company's  business.  While a
majority of the  Company's  revenues  from sales to Asian  countries are derived
from OEM customers  who plan to export a portion of their  products to countries
outside of Asia,  the Asian  economic  crisis has and may  continue to adversely
effect the  Company's  revenues  to the  extent  that  demand for the  Company's
products in Asia declines.  Given the recent economic conditions in Asia and the
weakness of many Asian  currencies  relative to the United  States  dollar,  the
Company's products are and may continue to be relatively more expensive in Asia,
which could  result in a decrease in the  Company's  sales in that  region.  The
Company has and may continue to  experience  pressure on its gross  margins as a
result of increased price competition from Asian competitors.  While most of the
Company's sales are denominated in U.S.  Dollars,  the Company  invoices certain
Japanese  customers in Japanese Yen and is subject to exchange rate fluctuations
on these  transactions.  To date, a portion of the Company's purchases of wafers
have  been   denominated  in  Japanese  Yen.  While  this  percentage  has  been
decreasing,  exchange  rate  fluctuations  can  affect the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.   See  "Risk  Factors  Risks
Associated with International Operations."

         The  Company's  operating  results are  affected by a number of factors
including  the  volume of  product  sales,  the  timing of  significant  orders,
competitive  pricing pressures,  the ability of the Company to match supply with
demand,  changes  in product  and  customer  mix,  market  acceptance  of new or
enhanced  versions of the Company's  products,  changes in the channels  through
which  the   Company's   products  are   distributed,   timing  of  new  product
announcements and  introductions by the Company and its competitors,  the timing
of license and royalty  revenues,  fluctuations in product costs, the ability of
the  Company to achieve  manufacturing  efficiencies  with its new and  existing
products,  availability of foundry capacity,  variations in manufacturing  cycle
times,  fluctuations  in  manufacturing  yields and  manufacturing  utilization,
increased research and development  expenses and exchange rate fluctuations.  In
addition,  as the proportion of the Company's  products sold for use in consumer
electronics applications increases, the Company's revenues may become subject to
seasonal  declines  in the first  quarter  of each  year.  See  "Risk  Factors -
Fluctuations  in  Operating  Results",  "-  Increasing  Dependence  on  Consumer
Products" and "- Seasonality."


Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

         The Company is aware of problems  associated  with computer  systems as
the year 2000  approaches.  Year 2000 problems are the result of common computer
programming techniques that result in systems that do not function properly when
manipulating  dates later than December 31, 1999.  The issue is complex and wide
ranging.  The problem may affect transaction  processing  computer  applications
used by the Company for accounting,  distribution,  manufacturing,  planning and
communications.  The problem may also affect  embedded  systems such as building
security systems,  machine controllers and production test equipment.  Year 2000
problems with these systems may affect the ability or efficiency  with which the
Company can perform many  significant  functions,  including but not limited to:
order processing and fulfillment,  material planning,  product assembly, product
test, invoicing and financial reporting. In addition, the problem may affect the
computer  systems  of  the  Company's   suppliers  and  customers,   potentially
disrupting  their  operations.  Year 2000 problems  with the Company's  business
partners may impact the Company's sources of supply and demand.

         Year 2000  Readiness.  The  Company  has  established  a Year 2000 Risk
Management  program to assess the impact of the Year 2000 issue on SanDisk,  and
to coordinate  remediation  activities.  The Company completed the evaluation of
its  products  for Year  2000  compliance  in the  third  quarter  of 1998.  The
Company's FlashDisk,  FlashDrive, Flash Chipset,  CompactFlash,  MultiMediaCard,
and  ImageMate  product  lines do not perform  date related  processing,  do not
contain real time clock  circuitry and  therefore  are Year 2000 ready.  Sandisk
storage and  connectivity  products are used as  components in a variety of host
systems. The firmware,  operating system, and application software of these host
systems are designed and  manufactured  by others.  SanDisk  makes no claim with
regard to the Year 2000 readiness of host

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>


systems  designed by others in which  SanDisk's  products are used.  Independent
system designers make derivative works from the SanDisk Host Developer's Toolkit
("Toolkit")  source code  product.  Sample  date  related  subroutines  and data
structures  are included in the Toolkit for use by system  designers.  Designers
modify the sample  routines in order to fit the specific  requirements  of their
host  operating  system.  The designer is  responsible  for the  formatting  and
processing  logic  associated with the date values that pass through the Toolkit
subsystem and for the Year 2000 readiness of the systems in which the Toolkit is
used.  SanDisk  makes no claims with regard to the Year 2000  readiness  of host
firmware and operating systems designed by others that contain  derivative works
of the Host Developer's Toolkit.

         The  Year  2000  compliance  assessment  of  the  Company's  management
information  system is complete,  and remediation is well underway.  The Company
expects to complete the implementation of a new, Year 2000 compliant  management
information  system  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1998.  The  new  system  is a
commercially  available fully integrated MRP II (Materials  Requirement Planning
and  Accounting  system)  software  application.  This  system  will be used for
Accounting,  Order Processing,  Planning,  Inventory Control, Shop Floor Control
and Distribution. Problems or delays in the implementation of the Company's Year
2000 compliant management information system could result in a disruption of the
Company's operations.

         The  assessment  and  remediation  of Year 2000  problems  in  tertiary
business  information  systems  is  on-going.  Well  over  90% of the  company's
investment  in  desktop  PC  hardware  is known to be Year 2000  compliant.  The
majority of the software  used on these  systems and network  servers are recent
versions of vendor supported,  commercially available products.  Upgrading these
applications  as Year 2000  compliant  patches are  released  by the  respective
vendors has not been a  significant  burden on the Company and is expected to be
completed before the end of 1999.

         The  assessment  and  remediation  of Year 2000  problems  in  computer
systems used for facilities control,  machine control, and manufacturing testing
is on-going. The most significant Year 2000 issue in this area has been found to
be related to older wafer test  equipment.  This equipment is not expected to be
in use in the year 2000. The Company is phasing in new Year 2000 compliant wafer
test equipment in conjunction  with the introduction of new generations of flash
memory.

         The  Company  has begun its  assessment  of Year 2000 risks  related to
suppliers,  customers  and other third  parties.  Inquiries  will be made of all
critical suppliers and an assessment made of their Year 2000 readiness.  SanDisk
will also contact its significant  customers regarding their Year 2000 readiness
in order to  understand  the  potential for any  disruptions  in their  ordering
patterns.  Completion  of this review will depend on the  responsiveness  of the
Company's vendors and customers, over which the Company has no control.

         Year  2000 Risk  Management  Program  Costs.  The cost of the Year 2000
project related to upgrading the Company's core management information system is
approximately $1.0 million. The Company has capitalized  approximately  $400,000
for the cost of purchased software and hardware. The Company would have incurred
the  majority of these costs,  in spite of Year 2000 issues,  due to the need to
upgrade its management  information  system to support the Company's growth. The
additional  expenses  related  to the  management  of the Year  2000  compliance
program and  completing  the  assessment of the Company's  internal and external
risks are not  expected  to be  material to the  Company's  quarterly  operating
results.

         The costs and time  schedule  for the Year 2000 problem  abatement  are
based  on  management's  best  estimates  for  the  implementation  of  its  new
management  information  system and Year 2000 problems  uncovered to date. These
estimates were derived utilizing numerous  assumptions,  including that the most
significant Year 2000 risks have already been identified, that certain resources
will  continue to be available,  that third party plans will be  fulfilled,  and
other factors.  However,  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be
achieved or that the  anticipated  time schedule will be met and actual  results
could differ materially from those anticipated.

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>



         Contingency  Plans.  Specific  contingency  plans for systems that pose
significant  risk to on-going  operations are being developed under the auspices
of the Company's Year 2000 Risk Management  program. If the Company is unable to
complete the replacement of its core management  information  system in a timely
manner,  an alternative plan has been developed.  This plan consists of applying
available vendor supplied software patches to the existing system. The costs and
time involved to complete this  alternative  are expected to be minimal.  Should
previously  undetected  Year  2000  problems  be found in other  systems,  these
systems will either be upgraded, replaced, turned off, or operated in place with
manual  procedures  to  compensate  for their  deficiencies.  While the  Company
believes  that these  alternative  plans would be adequate to meet the Company's
needs without  materially  impacting its  operations,  there can be no assurance
that such  alternatives  would be successful  or that the  Company's  results of
operations  would  not  be  materially  adversely  affected  by the  delays  and
inefficiencies inherent in conducting operations in this manner.

         Risks Related to Year 2000  Readiness.  Success of the  Company's  Year
2000 compliance efforts depend, in part, on the success of its key suppliers and
customers in dealing with their Year 2000 issues.  The Company does not have any
control over the  remediation  efforts of its key suppliers and customers and is
not aware of the extent to which they have resolved  their Year 2000  compliance
issues. The Company currently  purchases several critical components from single
or sole source  vendors.  Disruptions  in the supply of  components  from any of
these sole source  suppliers due to Year 2000 issues,  could cause delays in the
Company's  fulfillment of customer  orders which could result in reduced or lost
revenues.  Furthermore,  the Company's sales have historically been to a limited
number  of  customers.  Any  disruption  in the  purchasing  patterns  of  these
customers or potential  customers  due to Year 2000 issues could cause a decline
in the Company's  revenues.  There can be no assurance  that the Company and its
key  suppliers and customers  will identify and remediate all  significant  Year
2000 problems on a timely basis. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the
Company's insurance will cover losses from business  interruptions  arising from
Year 2000  problems  of the  Company  or its  suppliers.  Year  2000  compliance
problems of the Company's key suppliers and customers could adversely affect the
Company's, business, financial condition and results of operations.

         The foregoing  statements  regarding the Company's  Year 2000 readiness
are based upon  management's  best  estimates  at the present  time,  which were
derived utilizing assumptions  regarding future events,  including the continued
availability  of certain  resources,  third party  modification  plans and other
factors.  There can be no guarantee  that these  estimates  will be achieved and
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.  Specific factors
that might cause such material  differences include, but are not limited to, the
availability  and cost of personnel  trained in this area, the ability to locate
and correct all relevant  computer  codes,  the nature and amount of programming
required  to upgrade  or replace  each of the  affected  programs,  the rate and
magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the Company's
external  customers  and  suppliers  in  addressing  the Year  2000  issue.  The
Company's  evaluation  is  on-going  and  it  expects  that  new  and  different
information   will  become   available  to  it  as  the  evaluation   continues.
Consequently, there is no guarantee that all material elements will be Year 2000
ready in time.


Results of Operations

         Product Revenues.  SanDisk's product revenues were $24.1 million in the
third quarter of 1998,  down $6.1 million or 20% from the third quarter of 1997.
Product  revenues  for the nine  months  ended  September  30,  1998 were  $73.0
million,  up $0.7  million or 1% from the same period in 1997.  During the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 1998, units shipped increased 29% and
36%, respectively, from the same periods of 1997. These increases were offset by
decreases in average selling prices of 39% for the third quarter of 1998 and 26%
for the first nine months of 1998 compared to the same periods of 1997.


                                    Page 13
<PAGE>


         Due to the economic  recession in Japan,  sales to this region declined
$5.8 million in the third  quarter of 1998  compared to the same period in 1997,
representing  essentially  all of the year to year decline in product  revenues.
The Company continues to experience limited bookings visibility, particularly in
Japan.  More  than  one half of the  Company's  anticipated  quarterly  revenues
continue  to be  turns  business,  orders  received  and  fulfilled  in the same
quarter, with customers demanding short lead times and quick delivery schedules,
thus  capitalizing  on the current  market  conditions  and  aggressive  pricing
environment.  Due to a number of factors described herein and in "Risk Factors,"
the Company's  ability to adjust its operating  expenses is limited in the short
term. As a result, if product revenues are lower than anticipated, the Company's
results of operations will be adversely affected. See "Risk Factors-Fluctuations
in Operating  Results",  "- Risks Associated with International  Operations" and
"Seasonality."

         Export sales represented 47% and 46%,  respectively,of product revenues
for the three and nine month periods ended  September 30, 1998 compared with 60%
and 53%,  respectively,  for the same periods of the previous  year. The Company
expects  international  sales to continue to represent a significant  portion of
its product revenues. The Company's top ten customers represented 65% of product
revenue in the third  quarter  of 1998  compared  to 67% for the same  period in
1997.  The Company  expects  that sales to a limited  number of  customers  will
continue to represent a substantial  portion of its revenues for the foreseeable
future.

         License  and  Royalty  Revenues.  The Company  currently  earns  patent
licenses and royalty revenues under six cross license agreements,  with Hitachi,
Intel,  Samsung,  Sharp,  Silicon Storage Technology,  Inc. ("SST") and Toshiba.
License and  royalty  revenue  from patent  cross  license  agreements  was $7.9
million in the third  quarter of 1998,  up $2.0 million from $5.9 million in the
same period of 1997 primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition under the
various  agreements.  In the first  nine  months of 1998,  revenue  from  patent
license and royalties was $24.5  million,  up $11.9 million from the same period
of 1997.  Revenues from patent licenses and royalties  increased to 25% of total
revenues in the three and nine month periods  ended  September 30, 1998 from 16%
and 15%  respectively,  for the same periods of the previous  year.  The Company
currently  expects that revenues from patent  licenses and royalties  will be in
the range of $7.5 to $8.0 million per quarter for the next several quarters.

         Gross Profits.  In the third quarter of 1998,  gross profits were $13.2
million  or 41% of total  revenues,  down  from  $16.0  million  or 44% of total
revenues for the same period of 1997. Gross profits for the first nine months of
1998 were $40.4  million or 41% of total  revenues  compared to $35.5 million or
42% of total  revenues for the same period in the previous  year.  The growth in
overall  gross  profits for the first nine months of 1998 was due to an increase
in license and royalty  revenue.  Product gross margins  decreased to 22% in the
third quarter of 1998 compared to 33% for the same period of 1997.  The decrease
was primarily  due to the decline in average  selling  prices.  During the third
quarter, the Company completed the transition from 32Mbit, 0.4 micron technology
to the more cost effective 64Mbit, 0.35 micron technology. While the Company has
ongoing efforts to reduce  manufacturing  costs,  there can be no assurance that
these cost  reductions  will be adequate to offset future average  selling price
declines due to increased competition.

         Research and  Development.  Research and development  expenses  consist
principally of salaries and payroll related  expenses for design and development
engineers,  prototype supplies and contract  services.  Research and development
expenses  increased $1.3 million or 35% in the third quarter of 1998 compared to
the third  quarter  of 1997.  In the first  nine  months  of 1998  research  and
development expenses increased $4.0 million compared to the same period in 1997.
These  increases  were  primarily  due to an increase  in  salaries  and payroll
related expenses associated with additional personnel, increased project related
expenses and increased depreciation due to capital equipment additions. Research
and development expenses represented 15% of total revenues for the third quarter
of 1998  compared  to 10% for the same  period  in  1997.  The  Company  expects
research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars to
support the development of new generations of flash data storage products.


                                    Page 14

             Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses include salaries
and payroll  related  expenses,  sales  commissions  and travel expenses for the
Company's  sales,  marketing,  customer  service  and  applications  engineering
personnel. These expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses such
as  independent  manufacturer's  representative  commissions,   advertising  and
tradeshow  expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.8 million or 24%
in the third quarter of 1998 compared to the third quarter of 1997. In the first
nine  months of 1998,  sales  and  marketing  expenses  increased  $3.4  million
compared same period in 1997.  These  increases  were primarily due to increased
marketing and sales  expenses  related to the  development of the retail channel
for the  Company's  products  and an increase in  salaries  and payroll  related
expenses  associated with  additional  personnel.  Sales and marketing  expenses
represented  12% of total  revenues in the third  quarter of 1998 compared to 9%
for the same period of 1997. The Company expects sales and marketing expenses to
increase in absolute  dollars as sales of its products  grow and it continues to
develop   the  retail   channel  for  its   products   both   domestically   and
internationally.

         General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include
the  cost  of the  Company's  finance,  information  systems,  human  resources,
shareholder  relations,   legal  and  administrative   functions.   General  and
administrative  expenses  decreased  $0.2 million or 10% in the third quarter of
1998  compared to the third  quarter of 1997.  In the first nine months of 1998,
general and  administrative  expenses  increased $0.7 million or 13% compared to
the same period of 1997. The decrease in the third quarter of 1998 was primarily
due to a decrease in bad debt expense.  The increase in the first nine months of
1998 was  primarily  due to  increased  salaries  and payroll  related  expenses
associated with additional  personnel and higher consulting  expenses related to
the implementation of the Company's new management  information system.  General
and  administrative  expenses  represented  6% of total  revenues  in the  third
quarters  of 1998 and 1997.  The  Company  expects  general  and  administrative
expenses to increase in absolute  dollars as these functions grow to support the
overall growth of the Company.  General and  administrative  expenses could also
increase substantially in the future in connection with the Company's efforts to
defend its patent portfolio.  See "Risk  Factors-Patents  Proprietary Rights and
Related Litigation."

         Interest  and  Other  Income,  Net.  Interest  and other  income,  net,
increased  $0.5 million in the third quarter of 1998 compared to the same period
of 1997.  This  increase was primarily  due to higher  investment  balances as a
result  of the  investment  of  proceeds  from the sale of  common  stock in the
Company's November 1997 follow on public offering.

         Provision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded a provision for income
taxes at a 36%  effective tax rate for the first nine months of 1998 compared to
a 15% effective tax rate for the same period of 1997. The effective tax rate for
the first nine months of 1997 was substantially below the federal statutory rate
due to the  utilization of federal and state tax credit  carryforwards,  foreign
sales  corporation  tax  benefits  and a  reduction  in the  deferred  tax asset
valuation  allowance.  The Company's  1998  effective tax rate is  substantially
higher than its 1997 rate due to the  utilization  of all remaining  federal and
state tax credit carryforwards in 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         As of  September  30, 1998,  the Company had working  capital of $133.9
million,  which included $13.9 million in cash and cash  equivalents  and $113.0
million in short term  investments.  The Company  has a line of credit  facility
with a commercial bank under which it can borrow up to $10 million at the bank's
prime rate. This line of credit  facility  expires in July 1999. As of September
30, 1998,  the Company had $2.8  million  committed  under the foreign  exchange
facility of the line of credit for Yen forward exchange contracts that mature in
November  1998.  The Agreement  contains  covenants  that require the Company to
maintain  certain  financial  ratios and levels of net worth,  and prohibits the
payment of cash dividends to stockholders.

         Operating  activities  provided  $5.0  million of cash during the first
nine months of 1998 primarily from net income,  an increase in deferred  revenue
and a decrease in accounts receivable which were

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>


partially  offset by a decline in accounts payable and an increase in inventory.
Investing activities used $14.3 million of cash in the first nine months of 1998
and included an  additional  investment of $10.9 million in the USIC foundry and
capital equipment purchases of $4.8 million,  which were partially offset by net
proceeds from investments of $1.4 million. During the first nine months of 1998,
financing  activities  provided $2.3 million of cash  primarily from the sale of
common stock under the SanDisk employee stock purchase and stock option plans.

         Depending  on the demand for the  Company's  products,  the Company may
decide to make  investments,  which could be  substantial,  in assembly and test
manufacturing  equipment  or foundry  capacity  to support  its  business in the
future.  Management believes the existing cash and cash equivalents,  short term
investments  and  available  line  of  credit,  together  with  cash  flow  from
operations,  will be  sufficient  to meet the  Company's  currently  anticipated
working  capital  and  capital  expenditure  requirements  for at least the next
twelve months.

Impact of Currency Exchange Rates

         The Company  currently  purchases wafers from Matsushita under purchase
contracts  denominated  in yen. A portion  of the  Company's  revenues  are also
denominated in yen.  Foreign exchange  exposures  arising from the Company's yen
denominated  commitments and related  accounts  payable are offset to the extent
the Company has yen denominated  accounts  receivable and cash balances.  To the
extent such foreign exchange  exposures are not offset,  the Company enters into
foreign exchange forward  contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency
exchange  rates.  At September 30, 1998,  there were $2.8 million in Yen forward
contracts  outstanding.  Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material
adverse  effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations.

Risk Factors

         Fluctuations in Operating  Results.  SanDisk's  operating  results have
been and are  expected  to  continue  to be,  subject  to  quarterly  and annual
fluctuations due to a variety of factors. The principal factors that have caused
the Company's  operating  results to fluctuate in the past several  quarters and
may cause the  Company's  operating  results  to  fluctuate  in the  future  are
unpredictable  demand for the  Company's  products,  declining  average  selling
prices, the economic recession in Japan and the seasonality in sales of products
for consumer  electronics  applications.  For  example,  the  Company's  product
revenues  declined in the first and second  quarters of 1998 and were relatively
flat in the third quarter,  due to lower average  selling  prices,  a decline in
sales to Japan and seasonal factors.

         The Company must order silicon wafers from its foundries several months
prior to the date such  wafers are  needed.  If the  Company  overestimates  the
number of silicon  wafers it needs to fill product orders and as a result builds
excess  inventories,  gross  margins and  operating  results will be  materially
adversely  affected.  For example,  in the second  quarter of 1998 product gross
margins  declined to 12% from 30% in the  previous  quarter  partially  due to a
lower of cost or market write down of inventory.  Because the Company is selling
CompactFlash,  its largest volume product,  into an emerging consumer market and
is unable to accurately  forecast future sales, there will be a material adverse
effect on the  Company's  operating  results if sales  fall below the  Company's
expectations  in a  particular  quarter  and the Company is unable to reduce its
operating expenses. The portion of the Company's quarterly sales attributable to
orders  received and fulfilled in the same quarter  ("turns  business")  remains
higher  than 50% and product  order  backlog may  fluctuate  substantially  from
quarter to quarter. See "Seasonality" and "Dependence on Third Party Foundries."

         Other  factors  affecting  the  Company's  operating  results and gross
margins include the volume of product sales,  competitive pricing pressures, the
ability of the  Company to match  supply  with  demand,  changes in product  and
customer mix,  market  acceptance  of new or enhanced  versions of the Company's
products,  changes in the  channels  through  which the  Company's  products are
distributed,  timing  of new  product  announcements  and  introductions  by the
Company and its competitors, the timing of

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>


license and royalty  revenue,  fluctuations  in product costs,  availability  of
foundry  capacity,  variations  in  manufacturing  cycle time,  fluctuations  in
manufacturing yields and manufacturing  utilization,  the ability of the Company
to  achieve  manufacturing  efficiencies  with  its new and  existing  products,
increased  research and development  expenses,  exchange rate  fluctuations  and
changes in general economic  conditions,  including economic conditions in Asia.
All of these  factors are  difficult to forecast and these or other  factors can
materially  affect the Company's  quarterly or annual operating results or gross
margins.

         The Company has increased its expense levels to support its anticipated
growth,  including  expenses  associated  with the  expansion  of the  Company's
in-house  assembly  and test  operations.  The  Company  expects to  continue to
increase  its  operating  expenses  by hiring  additional  personnel  to support
expected growth in sales unit volumes, increased marketing and sales efforts and
accelerated research and development activities. If the Company does not achieve
increased  levels  of  revenues  commensurate  with  these  increased  levels of
operating  expenses,  or if the Company's  revenues  decrease or do not meet the
Company's   expectations  for  a  particular  period,  the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations  will be  materially  adversely
affected.

         The mix of the  Company's  products sold varies from quarter to quarter
and will vary in the future,  affecting the Company's  overall  average  selling
prices and gross margins. The Company's CompactFlash  products,  which currently
represent a significant  portion of the Company's product  revenues,  have lower
average  selling  prices and gross  margins than the Company's  higher  capacity
FlashDisk  and  FlashDrive   products.   The  Company   expects  that  sales  of
CompactFlash  products  will  represent  a  significant  percentage  of  product
revenues as consumer  applications  such as digital cameras become more popular.
This  dependence  on  CompactFlash  sales,  coupled  with lower  pricing  due to
competition,  has caused and is expected to  continue to cause  average  selling
prices to decline,  sometimes at a faster rate than cost reductions  implemented
by the Company.

         The Company has  adopted a strategy of  cross-licensing  its patents to
other  manufacturers  of flash products.  Under such  arrangements,  the Company
earns license fees and royalties on terms that are individually negotiated.  The
timing of recognition  of revenues from these  payments  depends on the terms of
each  contract,  and, in some cases,  on the timing of product  shipments by the
third  parties.  As  a  result,  license  and  royalty  revenue  has  fluctuated
significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future.  Given the relatively
high gross margins  associated with license and royalty  revenue,  gross margins
and net income are likely to fluctuate  more with changes in license and royalty
revenue than with changes in product revenue.

         Dependence on Emerging Markets and New Products.  The Company's success
depends to a significant extent upon the development of emerging markets and new
applications  for flash  data  storage  systems,  as well as on its  ability  to
introduce commercially  attractive and competitively priced products on a timely
basis. The Company believes that continued significant expenditures for research
and  development  will be  required in the future.  In  particular,  the Company
intends to develop new products with increased  memory  capacity at a lower cost
per  megabyte,  which the Company  believes  will be essential to its ability to
remain  competitive.  In November 1997,  the Company  introduced a new removable
storage card product family, the MultiMediaCard.  MultiMediaCard is targeted for
the  emerging  markets for mobile  smart  phones,  advanced  pagers and consumer
multimedia  devices.   MultiMediaCard  will  initially  be  offered  in  storage
capacities  of 4MB and 8MB.  The Company  does not expect to  generate  material
revenues from  MultiMediaCard  sales in 1998. There can be no assurance that the
Company  will  successfully  develop  any  of  these  new  products,   that  new
applications  or markets for flash data  storage will develop as expected by the
Company,  that prospective  customers  developing  products for any such markets
will  design  the  Company's  products  into  their  products  and  successfully
introduce such products,  or that products or  technologies  developed by others
will  not  render  the   Company's   products   or   technologies   obsolete  or
noncompetitive.  The  failure of new  applications  or markets to develop or the
failure of the  Company's  products to be  accepted  by the market  would have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         Increasing  Dependence on Consumer  Products.  Product revenues derived
from  sales of  products  for  consumer  electronics  applications,  principally
digital cameras, have increased  significantly and in 1998 represent the largest
portion  of  product  revenues  and units  shipped.  There can be no  assurance,
however,  that the Company will achieve  large scale market  acceptance  for its
products  in the  consumer  electronics  market.  The Company  anticipates  that
products  sold  for  consumer  applications  will  generally  encounter  intense
competition  and will be more price  sensitive than products sold into its other
target markets.  In addition,  consumer markets require larger  expenditures for
marketing and promotion to establish brand name recognition and preference.

         Consumer  markets are more likely to experience  seasonality  of sales,
with potential  declines in sales activity during the first quarter of any year.
Because of the large number of OEMs entering the digital  camera  market,  it is
likely  that not all of these  manufacturers  will be  successful  in  achieving
market  acceptance  of  their  products.  If  SanDisk's  OEM  customers  are not
successful in this market,  such OEM customers  may have excess  inventories  of
CompactFlash products, which may preclude follow-on orders or result in sales of
their  CompactFlash  inventories  in the open market.  The market  acceptance of
digital  cameras  that use  CompactFlash  has been slower than  expected and the
number of  companies  supplying  CompactFlash  has  increased,  causing  average
selling  prices and product  gross margins to decline at a rapid rate. If market
acceptance of digital cameras that use CompactFlash  continues to be slower than
expected,  or if the market for CompactFlash becomes saturated,  the Company may
encounter  reduced demand for CompactFlash  products,  declining average selling
prices or product  returns,  any of which  would  have an adverse  effect on the
Company's results of operations.

         The Company  anticipates that a greater  proportion of its sales to the
consumer  electronics market will be made through  distributors and to retailers
than  is the  case  with  the  industrial/communications  market.  This  will be
particularly  true if the level of  after-market  sales of flash memory products
increases. The Company is currently expending significant resources developing a
retail sales channel.  The  expenditures  associated  with this  development are
likely to precede the  realization  of  significant  sales through this channel.
Moreover,  the Company has no prior  experience in the development or management
of the retail channel or sales through such channel. In addition,  a significant
portion of retail sales for consumer  applications  will be made to distributors
and retail chains,  which typically  maintain rights to return unsold inventory.
As a result,  the Company does not  recognize  revenues on sales to this channel
until after the products have been sold to end users.  If the  Company's  retail
customers are not successful in this market,  there could be substantial product
returns to the Company.  The inability to  successfully  develop and effectively
manage the retail  sales  channel  could have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         Seasonality.  The  Company has  experienced  and expects to continue to
experience  seasonality  in its  product  sales.  A  significant  portion of the
Company's  product revenues are derived from the sale of CompactFlash  products,
which are sold principally for consumer electronics  applications.  As a result,
the  Company's  product  sales  have been and are  expected  to be  impacted  by
seasonal purchasing patterns,  with higher sales in the second half of each year
as  compared to the first half of each such year.  In the past,  the Company has
experienced  a reduction in order  quantities in the first quarter from Japanese
OEM  customers,  reflecting  the fact that most  customers in Japan operate on a
fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of
their next fiscal year. In the first quarter of 1998,  product revenues declined
24% from the level in the fourth  quarter of 1997 due in part to these  seasonal
factors and the Asian economic crisis.

         Competition.  The flash  data  storage  markets  in which  the  Company
competes are characterized by intense competition,  rapid technological  change,
evolving industry standards,  declining average selling prices and rapid product
obsolescence.   The  Company's  competitors  include  many  large  domestic  and
international   companies  that  have  greater   access  to  foundry   capacity,
substantially  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing  and other  resources,
broader product lines and longer standing  relationships with customers than the
Company.  The Company's primary competitors include flash chip producers such as
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD"), Atmel Corporation ("Atmel"),  Hitachi Ltd.
("Hitachi"), Intel

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>


Corporation ("Intel"), Micron Technology, Inc. ("Micron"), Mitsubishi Electronic
Corporation ("Mitsubishi"),  Samsung Electronics Company Ltd. ("Samsung"), Sharp
Electronics  Corporation  ("Sharp") and Toshiba Corporation  ("Toshiba"),  other
companies using data storage  techniques such as socket flash,  linear flash and
system flash  components,  as well as package or card  assemblers  such as Lexar
Media, Inc. ("Lexar"),  M-Systems,  Inc.  ("M-Systems"),  Simple Technology Inc.
("Simple"), SMART Modular Technologies, Inc. ("Smart Modular"), Sony Corporation
("Sony"),  Kingston Technology Company  ("Kingston"),  TDK Corporation  ("TDK"),
Matsushita  Battery,  Inc.  ("Matsushita  Battery") and Viking Components,  Inc.
("Viking")  that combine  controllers and flash memory chips developed by others
into  flash  storage  cards.  Several  companies,   including  Hitachi,   Lexar,
Mitsubishi  and Micron have been  certified by the  CompactFlash  Association to
manufacture and sell their own brand of  CompactFlash,  and the Company believes
that other  manufacturers  will  enter the  CompactFlash  market in the  future.
Competing   products  promoting  industry  standards  that  are  different  from
SanDisk's CompactFlash product have been announced,  including Intel's Miniature
Card,  Toshiba's Smart Media (Solid-State  Floppy Disk Card), Sony Corporation's
Memory Stick,  Matsushita  Battery's recently  introduced Mega Storage cards and
M-Systems'  Diskonchip(TM) for embedded storage applications.  A manufacturer of
digital cameras that designs-in any one of these alternative competing standards
will eliminate  CompactFlash from use in its product, as each competing standard
is mechanically and electronically incompatible with CompactFlash.  In addition,
in the third quarter of 1997,  Intel  announced a 64Mbit flash chip based on its
multilevel  cell flash.  The  Company's  double  density  flash ("D2 flash") and
Intel's multilevel cell flash are competing technological innovations that allow
each  flash  memory  cell to  store  two  bits  of  information  instead  of the
traditional  single bit stored by the industry  standard  flash  technology.  In
November  1997,  Iomega  Corporation  ("Iomega")  announced  its Clik  drive,  a
miniaturized,  mechanical,  removable disk drive that Iomega claims will compete
directly with SanDisk's  flash card products.  In September 1998, IBM introduced
the  microdrive,  a rotating disk drive in a type II CompactFlash  format.  This
product will initially  compete directly with the Company's type II CompactFlash
memory cards for use in high end professional  digital cameras. In October 1998,
M-Systems  introduced their Diskonchip 2000 product which is expected to compete
against the Company's Chipset products in embedded storage applications.

         In the first and second quarters of 1998,  Sony's Mavica digital camera
captured  approximately  40% of the US market for digital  cameras  according to
independent  industry analysts.  The Mavica uses a standard floppy disk to store
digital images and therefore uses no CompactFlash (or any other flash) cards. If
other  manufacturers  adopt the Mavica  format and it becomes  the new  "defacto
standard",  this will  significantly  reduce the Company's  sales  prospects for
CompactFlash cards. The Company's  MultiMediaCard  products are expected to face
stiff competition from Toshiba's  SmartMedia flash cards and Sony's flash Memory
Stick.  Although the Memory Stick is proprietary to Sony, its possible  adoption
and widespread use in future  products may adversely  impact future sales of the
Company's MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash products.

         The Company expects competition to increase in the future from existing
competitors  and from other  companies that may enter the Company's  existing or
future  markets with similar or alternative  data storage  solutions that may be
less costly or provide additional features. Due to the high price sensitivity in
the  market  for  consumer  products,  aggressive  price  competition  has  been
experienced for these  applications.  Such  competition is expected to result in
lower gross  margins in the future,  if the  Company's  average  selling  prices
decrease faster than its costs and could result in lost sales.

         The Company  has entered  into  patent  cross-license  agreements  with
Hitachi, Intel, Samsung, Sharp, SST and Toshiba pursuant to which each party may
manufacture and sell products that incorporate  technology  covered by the other
party's  patents related to flash memory  devices.  As the Company  continues to
license its patents to certain of its competitors, competition will increase. As
a result of the above factors,  the Company expects to face  substantially  more
competition in the future than it has to date. Increased  competition could have
a material  adverse effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results  of  operations.  The  Company  believes  that its  ability  to  compete
successfully  depends on a number of factors,  which  include price and quality,
product performance and availability, success in developing new applications for
system flash technology, adequate foundry capacity, efficiency of

                                    Page 19
<PAGE>


production, timing of new product announcements or introductions by the Company,
the number and nature of the Company's competitors in a given market, successful
protection  of  intellectual  property  rights and general  market and  economic
conditions.  There can be no assurance  that the Company will be able to compete
successfully   against  current  and  future  competitors  or  that  competitive
pressures  faced  by the  Company  will  not  materially  adversely  affect  its
business, financial condition or results of operations.

         Declining  Average  Sales  Prices.  The  Company has  experienced,  and
expects to  continue  to  experience,  declining  average  sales  prices for its
products.  For  example in the third  quarter  of 1998  average  selling  prices
declined  29%  compared  to the third  quarter of 1997.  The flash data  storage
markets in which the Company competes are characterized by intense  competition.
Therefore,  the Company expects to incur increasing  pricing  pressures from its
customers in future  periods,  which will likely result in a further  decline in
average sales prices for the Company's  products.  To offset  declining  average
sales   prices,   the  Company   believes  that  it  must  continue  to  achieve
manufacturing  cost reductions as well as develop new products that  incorporate
advanced features and can be sold at higher average gross margins.  If, however,
the  Company is unable to achieve  such cost  reductions,  it may not be able to
remain price  competitive,  resulting  in lost sales,  and the  Company's  gross
margins could decline, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         During the third quarter of 1998, the semiconductor industry as a whole
continued to  experience  significant  production  over  capacity.  This "buyers
market"  continued to put margin  pressures on all flash memory  suppliers.  The
Company believes that the current  semiconductor down cycle may continue for the
next few quarters,  putting  continued  pressure on average  selling  prices and
product gross margins.

          Risks Associated with International Operations. Sales of the Company's
products  have been  denominated  to date  primarily in United  States  dollars.
Increases in the value of the United States  dollar could  increase the price of
the  Company's  products  so that  they  become  relatively  more  expensive  to
customers in the local currency of a particular country,  leading to a reduction
in sales and profitability in that country. Given the recent economic conditions
in Asia and the weakness of many Asian currencies  relative to the United States
dollar,  the Company's products are relatively more expensive in Asia, which has
resulted and may continue to result in a decrease in the Company's sales in that
region. In the third quarter of 1998, product sales to the Japan declined to 30%
of total product sales,  primarily as a result of the Japanese  economic  crisis
and market recession.  If the current market conditions in Japan do not improve,
or further decline, results of operations may be adversely affected.

         All of the Company's  wafers are, and for the  foreseeable  future will
be, produced by foundries located outside the United States. Because the Company
currently  bills certain  customers in Japanese Yen,  fluctuations in currencies
could materially  adversely affect the Company's  business,  financial condition
and results of  operations.  In addition,  gains and losses on the conversion to
United  States  dollars  of  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable  and other
monetary  assets and  liabilities  arising  from  international  operations  may
contribute to  fluctuations in the Company's  results of operations.  Due to its
reliance on export  sales and its  dependence  on  foundries  outside the United
States,   the   Company  is  subject  to  the  risks  of   conducting   business
internationally,   including   foreign   government   regulation   and   general
geopolitical  risks  such  as  political  and  economic  instability,  potential
hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. Manufacturing and
sales of the  Company's  products may also be materially  adversely  affected by
factors  such  as   unexpected   changes  in,  or  imposition   of,   regulatory
requirements,  tariffs,  import and export  restrictions  and other barriers and
restrictions,  longer payment cycles,  greater difficulty in accounts receivable
collection,  potentially adverse tax consequences, the burdens of complying with
a variety of foreign laws and other  factors  beyond the Company's  control.  In
addition,  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the Company's products
are or may be developed,  manufactured or sold,  including  various countries in
Asia,  may not protect the Company's  intellectual  property  rights to the same
extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make piracy of the Company's
products a more likely possibility. There can be no assurance that these factors
will not have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's  business,  financial
condition or results of operations.


                                    Page 20

         Customer Concentration. A limited number of customers have historically
accounted  for a substantial  portion of the Company's  revenues and the Company
expects this trend to continue.  Sales to the Company's  customers are generally
made pursuant to standard purchase orders rather than long-term  contracts.  The
Company has also experienced significant changes in the composition of its major
customer  base from year to year and  expects  this  variability  to continue as
certain customers increase or decrease their purchases of the Company's products
as a result of fluctuations in market demand for such customers' products.

         Dependence  on Third Party  Foundries.  All of the  Company's  products
require silicon wafers,  the majority of which are currently  supplied by United
Silicon  Corporation  ("USC")  and  USIC in  Taiwan  and  Matsushita  Electronic
Corporation  in Japan.  The Company is dependent on its foundries to allocate to
the Company a portion of their foundry capacity sufficient to meet the Company's
needs, to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing
yields  and to  deliver  those  wafers  to the  Company  on a timely  basis.  On
occasion,  the Company has experienced  difficulties in each of these areas. The
loss or reduction of capacity from any of its foundry suppliers or the inability
to  qualify  or  receive  the  anticipated  level  of  capacity  from any of its
manufacturing  partners  could have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  There  can be no
assurance  that  any of  the  Company's  suppliers  will  be  able  to  maintain
acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis.

         Under each of the  Company's  wafer supply  agreements,  the Company is
obligated to provide a monthly rolling forecast of anticipated  purchase orders.
Except in limited circumstances and subject to acceptance by the foundries,  the
estimates  for the first  three  months of each  forecast  constitute  a binding
commitment  and the  estimates  for the  remaining  months may not  increase  or
decrease by more than a certain  percentage from the previous month's  forecast.
These   restrictions  limit  the  Company's  ability  to  react  to  significant
fluctuations in demand for its products.  As a result,  the Company has not been
able to match its purchases of wafers to specific  customer orders and therefore
the  Company  has from  time to time  taken  write  downs for  potential  excess
inventory  purchased prior to the receipt of customer orders and may be required
to do so in the future.  These adjustments decrease gross margins in the quarter
reported and have resulted,  and could in the future result in  fluctuations  in
gross  margins  on a  quarter  to  quarter  basis.  To the  extent  the  Company
inaccurately  forecasts  the  number of wafers  required,  it may have  either a
shortage  or an excess  supply of wafers,  either of which could have a material
adverse  effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations.   Additionally,  if  the  Company  is  unable  to  obtain  scheduled
quantities  of wafers from any foundry with  acceptable  yields,  the  Company's
business,  financial  condition  and results of  operations  could be negatively
impacted. See "Fluctuations in Operating Results."

         Dependence on Sole Source Suppliers and Third Party Subcontractors. The
Company purchases several critical components from single or sole source vendors
for  which  alternative  sources  are  not  currently   available.   Even  where
alternative  suppliers  are  available,  a  significant  amount of time would be
required to qualify an additional vendor in the case of certain of the Company's
components.  The Company does not maintain  long-term supply agreements with any
of these vendors.  The inability to develop alternative sources for these single
or sole source components or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components
could result in delays or reductions in product  shipments which could adversely
affect the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
For example,  the Company  relies on  Motorola,  Inc.  ("Motorola")  as the sole
source of certain designs of microcontrollers,  which are critical components in
the Company's  products.  The sole source risk associated with  microcontrollers
from  Motorola  is  heightened   during   transitions  from  one  generation  of
microcontrollers  to the next,  given the limited safety stock available  during
these  transitions.  In the  event  Motorola  were to  discontinue  shipment  of
microcontrollers  for any reason,  the time to design and qualify an alternative
source would be approximately  nine to twelve months.  The Company's reliance on
Motorola as its sole source of certain  microcontrollers  exposes the Company to
interruptions  of  supply  that  could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>


         The Company  uses  third-party  subcontractors  to assemble  the memory
components for its products and from time to time uses other  subcontractors  to
perform certain other assembly and test functions.  The Company has no long term
agreements  with these  subcontractors.  As a result of this  reliance  on third
party  subcontractors  for  assembly of a portion of its  products,  the Company
cannot directly  control product delivery  schedules,  which can lead to product
shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase  manufacturing costs
of the Company's products. Any problems associated with the delivery, quality or
cost of the  Company's  products  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         Risks  Associated  with  Transitioning  to New  Processes and Products.
Successive  generations  of the  Company's  products  incorporate  semiconductor
devices  with greater  memory  capacity  per chip.  In addition,  the Company is
continually  involved  in  joint  development  with  its  foundries  to  produce
semiconductor devices based upon smaller geometry manufacturing processes.  Both
the development of higher capacity  semiconductor devices and the implementation
of smaller geometry  manufacturing  processes are important  determinants of the
Company's  ability to decrease  the cost per  megabyte of its flash data storage
products.  The utilization of semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity
and the design and implementation of new semiconductor  manufacturing  processes
can  entail a  number  of  problems,  including  lower  yields  associated  with
semiconductor device production, problems associated with design and manufacture
of products to incorporate such devices,  and production delays.  Because of the
complexity of its products, the Company has periodically experienced significant
delays in the development and volume  production ramp up of its products.  There
can be no  assurance  that  similar  delays  will not occur in the  future.  Any
problems  experienced  by the  Company in its current or future  transitions  to
higher capacity memory devices or to new semiconductor  manufacturing  processes
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

         The Company has  developed  new products  based on D2 (Double  Density)
flash technology,  a new flash  architecture  designed to store two bits in each
flash  memory  cell.  The  Company  introduced  its new  80Mbit D2 flash chip in
November 1997 and began  customer  shipments in the third  quarter of 1998,  but
expects  production  volumes to be limited,  primarily  because of more advanced
flash  memory  designs  currently  planned  for  production  in 1999,  which are
expected  to have  faster  write  speed  than the 80Mbit D2 flash.  The  Company
believes  that D2 flash will be important to the  Company's  ability to increase
the  capacity and  decrease  the cost of certain of its  products,  maintain its
competitive  advantage,   broaden  its  target  markets  and  attract  strategic
partners.  High density flash memory,  such as D2 flash, is a complex technology
requiring tight manufacturing  controls and effective test screens. The shift to
volume production for new flash products is particularly prone to problems which
can impact both reliability and yields, thereby increasing  manufacturing costs.
There can be no assurance that reliable and cost effective D2 flash products can
be manufactured in commercial  volumes and with yields sufficient to result in a
lower cost per megabyte.  Furthermore,  D2 flash technology needs to be designed
to  significantly  improve its write speed so that it can be usefully applied to
market  applications such as digital cameras,  where write speed is an important
parameter.  There can be no  assurance  that the Company will be able to achieve
the requisite write speed in its future D2 products.

         Manufacturing  Yields.  The fabrication of the Company's  products is a
complex  and precise  process  requiring  wafers  that are  produced in a highly
controlled and clean environment.  Semiconductor companies supplying the Company
with wafers  periodically have experienced  problems achieving  acceptable wafer
manufacturing yields.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of
design technology,  which is developed by the Company, and manufacturing process
technology,  which is typically  proprietary to the foundry.  Because low yields
may  result  from  errors in  either  design or  manufacturing  failures,  yield
problems may not be  effectively  determined or improved until an actual product
exists that can be analyzed and tested to  recognize  process  sensitivities  in
relation to the design rules that were used. As a result, yield problems may not
be identified until the wafers are well into the production  process.  This risk
is  increased  due to the  fact  that  the  Company  receives  its  wafers  from
independent  offshore  foundries,  increasing  the effort and time  required  to
identify,  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. There can be no
assurance that the Company's foundries will

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>


achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. The inability
of the  Company  to  achieve  planned  yields  from its  foundries  could have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         Patents,  Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation. The Company relies
on a  combination  of patents,  trademarks,  copyright  and trade  secret  laws,
confidentiality   procedures   and   licensing   arrangements   to  protect  its
intellectual  property rights. The Company has been notified in the past and the
Company and its  foundries may be notified in the future of claims that they may
be  infringing  patents or other  intellectual  property  rights  owned by third
parties.  In the past the Company  has been  involved  in  significant  disputes
regarding its  intellectual  property  rights and believes it may be involved in
similar disputes in the future. There can be no assurance that in the future any
patents held by the Company will not be invalidated, that patents will be issued
for any of the Company's  pending  applications  or that any claims allowed from
existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued
in the primary  countries  where the  Company's  products can be sold to provide
meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the Company.  Additionally,
competitors of the Company may be able to design around the Company's patents.

         To preserve its intellectual  property rights,  the Company believes it
may be  necessary  to initiate  litigation  against  one or more third  parties,
including but not limited to those the Company has already  notified of possible
patent  infringement.  In addition,  one or more of these parties may bring suit
against the  Company.  In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal
court against Lexar for infringement of a fundamental  flash disk patent.  Lexar
has disputed  the  Company's  claim of patent  infringement,  claimed  SanDisk's
patent is invalid or unenforceable and asserted various counterclaims  including
unfair  competition,  violation of the Lanham Act,  patent misuse,  interference
with prospective  economic  advantage,  trade defamation and fraud.  SanDisk has
denied each of Lexar's  counterclaims.  In July 1998, the federal district court
denied  Lexar's  request to have the case  dismissed  on the grounds the Company
failed to perform an adequate  prefiling  investigation.  Discovery in the Lexar
suit  commenced in August 1998.  The Company  intends to vigorously  enforce its
patents, but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful.

         In the event of an adverse result in any such  litigation,  the Company
could be required to pay substantial  damages,  cease the  manufacture,  use and
sale  of  infringing   products,   expend   significant   resources  to  develop
non-infringing  technology,  discontinue the use of certain  processes or obtain
licenses to the infringing technology. Any litigation, whether as a plaintiff or
as a defendant,  would likely result in  significant  expense to the Company and
divert the efforts of the Company's technical and management personnel,  whether
or not such  litigation  is ultimately  determined  in favor of the Company.  In
addition, the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain.

         In the event the Company desires to incorporate  third party technology
into its  products or is found to infringe  on others'  patents or  intellectual
property  rights,  the  Company  may be  required  to  license  such  patents or
intellectual  property rights.  The Company may also need to license some or all
of its patent  portfolio to be able to obtain  cross-licenses  to the patents of
others. The Company currently has patent cross-license  agreements with Hitachi,
Intel, Samsung,  Sharp, SST and Toshiba. From time to time, the Company has also
entered into discussions with other companies regarding potential  cross-license
agreements for the Company's  patents.  However,  there can be no assurance that
licenses  will be  offered  or that the terms of any  offered  licenses  will be
acceptable to the Company.  If the Company obtains  licenses from third parties,
it may be required to pay license  fees or make  royalty  payments,  which could
have a material  adverse effect on the Company's  gross margins.  The failure to
obtain a license  from a third party for  technology  used by the Company  could
cause  the  Company  to  incur  substantial   liabilities  and  to  suspend  the
manufacture  of  products or the use by the  Company's  foundries  of  processes
requiring the technology,  or to expend  substantial  resources  redesigning its
products to  eliminate  the  infringement.  There can be no  assurance  that the
Company would be successful  in  redesigning  its products or that such licenses
would be available under reasonable terms. Furthermore,  any such development or
license  negotiations could require  substantial  expenditures of time and other
resources by the Company.

                                    Page 23

         As is common in the industry,  the Company agrees to indemnify  certain
of its suppliers and customers  for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances,  include  indemnification for
damages and expenses,  including  attorneys'  fees. The Company may from time to
time be engaged in litigation as a result of such  indemnification  obligations.
Third party claims for patent  infringement are excluded from coverage under the
Company's  insurance  policies.  There  can  be no  assurance  that  any  future
obligation to indemnify the  Company's  customers or suppliers,  will not have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         Management of Growth. The Company has experienced and may in the future
experience  rapid  growth,  which has placed,  and could  continue  to place,  a
significant  strain on the Company's limited  personnel and other resources.  To
manage such growth  effectively,  the Company will need to continue to implement
and improve its operational, financial and management information systems and to
hire, train, motivate and manage its employees.  In particular,  the Company has
on  occasion  experienced  difficulty  in  hiring  the  engineering,  sales  and
marketing  personnel  necessary to support the growth of the Company's business.
Competition  for such  personnel is intense,  and there can be no assurance that
the Company will be  successful in attracting  and retaining  such  personnel or
that the Company will be able to manage such growth  effectively.  The Company's
ability to manage its  growth has  required,  and is  expected  to  continue  to
require,  a significant  investment  in and  expansion of its existing  internal
information  management systems to support increased  manufacturing,  accounting
and other  management  related  functions.  The  Company  is in the  process  of
replacing its existing in-house  information  system.  The implementation of the
new system  will impact  almost all phases of the  Company's  operations  (i.e.,
planning,  manufacturing,  finance and accounting).  The new system is currently
scheduled to become  operational in the fourth quarter of 1998.  There can be no
assurance that the Company will not experience problems, delays or unanticipated
additional costs in implementing the new management information system or in the
use of its  existing  system  that could have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations,  particularly
in the  period in which the new  system is brought  online.  The  failure of the
Company to successfully manage any of these issues would have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         Dependence  on  Key  Personnel.  The  Company's  success  depends  to a
significant  degree upon the  continued  contributions  of members of its senior
management  and  other  key  research  and  development,  sales,  marketing  and
operations personnel,  including,  in particular,  Dr. Eli Harari, the Company's
founder,  President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of any of such persons
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition  and results of  operations.  The Company does not have an  employment
agreement or non-competition agreement with any of its employees.

         Volatility  of Stock  Price.  There has been a history  of  significant
volatility  in the market  prices of the  Company's  Common  Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market,  and it is likely that the market price of the Company's Common
Stock will continue to be subject to significant  fluctuations.  For example, in
the twelve month period  ending  September 30, 1998,  the Company's  stock price
fluctuated  from a low of $7.50 to a high of $40.00.  The Company  believes that
future  announcements  concerning the Company,  its competitors or its principal
customers,  including  technological  innovations,  new  product  introductions,
governmental  regulations,  litigation  or  changes  in  earnings  estimated  by
analysts,  may  cause  the  market  price  of  the  Common  Stock  to  fluctuate
substantially  in the  future.  Sales of  substantial  amounts of the  Company's
outstanding Common Stock in the public market could materially  adversely affect
the market price of the Common Stock.  Further, in recent years the stock market
has experienced  extreme price and volume  fluctuations  that have  particularly
affected  the  market  prices  of  equity  securities  of many  high  technology
companies  and that often have been  unrelated to the operating  performance  of
such companies.  These  fluctuations as well as general economic,  political and
market conditions such as recessions or international currency fluctuations, may
materially adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock.

         Year 2000 Compliance.  The Company is aware of problems associated with
computer systems as the year 2000 approaches.  Year 2000 problems are the result
of common computer programming

                                    Page 24
<PAGE>


techniques   that  result  in  systems  that  do  not  function   properly  when
manipulating  dates later than December 31, 1999. The Company has  established a
Year 2000 Risk Management program to assess the impact of the Year 2000 issue on
SanDisk,  and to  coordinate  remediation  activities.  Based  on the  Company's
assessment to date, all of the Company's flash memory and connectivity  products
are Year 2000 compliant.  Other Year 2000 issues facing the Company include, but
are not  limited  to the  following:  remediation  of the  Company's  management
information  system, the assessment and the remediation of the tertiary business
information systems, the assessment and remediation of the computer systems used
for facilities control, machine control, and manufacturing testing and Year 2000
compliance problems of the Company's key suppliers and customers. The total cost
of Year 2000 compliance issues,  based on management's  estimates,  has not been
and is not  anticipated  to be,  material to the Company's  business,  financial
condition  and results of  operations.  However,  the Company  does not have any
control over the  remediation  efforts of its key  suppliers an customers and is
not aware of the extent to which they have resolved  their Year 2000  compliance
issues.  There can be no assurance  that the Company and its key  suppliers  and
customers  will  identify and  remediate  all  significant  Year 2000 risks on a
timely basis,  that  remediation  efforts will not involve  significant time and
expense,  or that unremediated  problems will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's business,  financial  condition and results of operations.  See
"Managements  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations - Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure."


         Effect of Anti-Takeover  Provisions.  The Company has taken a number of
actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt that might
be  beneficial  to  stockholders  who wish to receive a premium for their shares
from a potential bidder.  The Company has adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan that
would cause substantial dilution to a person who attempts to acquire the Company
on terms not  approved by the  Company's  Board of  Directors.  The  Shareholder
Rights Plan may therefore  have the effect of delaying or preventing  any change
in  control  and  deterring  any  prospective  acquisition  of the  Company.  In
addition,  the  Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  grants  the  Board of
Directors the authority to issue up to 4,000,000  shares of Preferred  Stock and
to determine  the price,  rights,  preferences  and  privileges  of those shares
without any further vote or action by the Company's stockholders.  The rights of
the holders of Common  Stock will be subject to, and may be  adversely  affected
by, the  rights of the  holders  of any  shares of  Preferred  Stock that may be
issued in the future. While the Company has no present intention to issue shares
of Preferred  Stock,  such issuance,  while providing  desirable  flexibility in
connection with possible  acquisitions and other corporate purposes,  could have
the effect of making it more  difficult or less  attractive for a third party to
acquire  a  majority  of the  outstanding  voting  stock  of the  Company.  Such
Preferred Stock may also have other rights,  including economic rights senior to
the Common Stock,  and, as a result,  the issuance thereof could have a material
adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock. Furthermore, the Company
is subject  to the  anti-takeover  provisions  of  Section  203 of the  Delaware
General  Corporation  Law  ("Section  203"),  which  prohibits  the Company from
engaging in a "business  combination"  with an  "interested  stockholder"  for a
period of three  years  after the date of the  transaction  in which the  person
first becomes an "interested  stockholder,"  unless the business  combination is
approved in a prescribed  manner. The application of Section 203 also could have
the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company.

                             TRADE FINANCE AGREEMENT



        THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED TRADE FINANCE AGREEMENT  ('Agreement') is made
and  entered  into as of July 15,  1998 by and between  SanDisk  Corporation,  a
Delaware Corporation  ('Borrower') and UNION BANK OF CALIFORNIA,  N.A. ('Bank').
This  Agreement  amends and restates in its entirety  that certain Trade Finance
Agreement  dated July 1, 1996,  as amended  from time to time,  between Bank and
Borrower.


         SECTION 1.      THE LOAN

         1.1 The Trade Finance Credit  Facility.  Bank will extend to Borrower a
Trade  Finance  Credit  Facility in an amount not to exceed Ten Million  Dollars
($10,000,000); (the 'Trade Finance Credit Facility') to expire on July 15, 1999.
The Trade Finance Credit Facility shall be subject to the following sublimits:

        a. The Clean Advance Line in an amount not to exceed Ten Million Dollars
           ($10,000,000);

        b. The Standby  L/C Line in an amount not to exceed Ten Million  Dollars
           ($10,000,000);



        1.1.1 Clean Advance Line.  Bank will also make  available an amount that
will not  exceed  the  amount  listed  above  (the  'Clean  Advance  Line')  for
Borrower's  working capital purposes.  All advances under the Clean Advance Line
must be made on or before July 15, 1999, at which time all unpaid  principal and
interest  under the Clean  Advance Line shall be due and  payable.  Borrower may
borrow,  repay and reborrow all or part of the Clean  Advance Line in accordance
with the terms of the  Clean  Advance  Note.  The Clean  Advance  Line  shall be
evidenced by a Promissory  Note (the 'Clean  Advance Note') on the standard form
used by Bank for  commercial  loans.  Bank shall enter each amount  borrowed and
repaid in Bank's  records and such entry shall be deemed to be the amount of the
Clean Advance Line outstanding.  Omission by Bank to make any such entries shall
not discharge  Borrower of its obligation to repay amounts borrowed in full with
interest.


        1.1.2 The Standby L/C  Sublimit.  Bank shall  issue,  for the account of
Borrower,  one or more irrevocable,  standby letters of credit (individually,  a
"Standby L/C' and collectively, the 'Standby L/Cs'). All such Standby L/Cs shall
be drawn on such terms and  conditions  as are  acceptable  to Bank and shall be
governed by the terms of (and Borrower  agrees to execute)  Bank's standard form
of Standby UC application  and  reimbursement  agreement.  The aggregate  amount
available  to be drawn  under all  outstanding  Standby  L/Cs and the  aggregate
amount of unpaid  reimbursement  obligations  under drawn Standby L/Cs shall not
exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). No Standby L/C shall expire after July
15, 1999.


        1.1.3 Trade Finance  Revolving  Lines and Limits.  The aggregate  amount
available to be drawn under each sublimit listed above shall be reduced,  dollar
for dollar,  by the aggregate amount of unpaid principal  obligations  under the
respective  sublimit.  The  aggregate of all unpaid  advances and  reimbursement
obligations shall reduce,  dollar for dollar, the maximum amount available under
the  Trade  Finance  Credit  Facility.  Borrower  may  reborrow  or  obtain  new
extensions of credit under each such sublimit until the  expiration  date of the
Trade Finance Credit Facility, to the extent that Borrower has paid or otherwise
satisfied  prior  borrowings or  extensions of credit,  subject to all terms and
conditions in the Loan Documents.

proceeds  of the Loan  unless  at or prior  to the time for the  making  of such
disbursement,   the  following   conditions   have  been   fulfilled  to  Bank's

in  connection  with this  Agreement  and to do the things  required of Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement.

        2.3  Continuing  Compliance.  At the time any UC is to be issued,  there

        Borrower represents and warrants that:

        3.1  Business  Activity.  The  principal  business  of  Borrower  is the
manufacturing of flash storage products.

(those entities in which Borrower has either a controlling  interest or at least
a 25%  ownership  interest)  and their  addresses,  and the names of  Borrower's
principal  shareholders,  are as provided on a schedule  delivered to Bank on or
before the date of this Agreement.

        3.3 Authority to Borrow. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Note and all other agreements and instruments required by Bank in

indenture,  agreement or undertaking to which Borrower is a party or by which it
or any of its property is bound or affected.

                                   (BASE RATE)



Borrower Name:   SANDISK CORPORATION
Borrower Address: 140 CASPIAN COURT, SUNNYVALE, CA. 94089
Office:  64561   
Loan Number:  8159632704 0080000000
Maturity Date:  JULY 15, 1999
Amount: $10,000,000.00



$10,000,000.00                                                Date JULY 15, 1998




FOR VALUE RECEIVED, on JULY 15, 1999, the undersigned ("Debtor") promises to pay
to the order of UNION BANK OF CALIFORNIA, N.A. ("Bank'), as indicated below, the
principal sum of TEN MILLION AND NO/1 00 Dollars ($1  0,000,000,00),  or so much
thereof as is disbursed, together with interest on the balance of such principal
from time to time  outstanding,  at the per annum rate or rates and at the times
set forth below.

1. INTEREST PAYMENTS. Debtor shall pay interest on the 1 5TH day of each QUARTER
(commencing  OCTOBER 15, 1998).  Should  interest not be paid when due, it shall
become  part  of the  principal  and  bear  interest  as  herein  provided.  All
computations of interest under this note shall be made on the basis of a year of
360 days, for actual days elapsed.

        a. BASE INTEREST RATE. At Debtor's option, amounts outstanding hereunder
        in minimum  amounts of at least $1  00,000.00  shall bear  interest at a
        rate, based on an index selected by Debtor,  which is 1.00% per annum in
        excess of Bank's  LIBOR-Rate for the Interest Period selected by Debtor,
        acceptable to Bank.

        No Base  Interest  Rate may be changed,  altered or  otherwise  modified
        until the  expiration  of the Interest  Period  selected by Debtor.  The
        exercise  of  interest  rate  options by Debtor  shall be as recorded in
        Bank's  records,  which  records  shall be prima  facie  evidence of the
        amount  borrowed  under either  interest  option and the interest  rate;
        provided, however, that failure of Bank to make any such notation in its
        records shall not discharge Debtor from its obligations to repay in full
        with  interest  all amounts  borrowed.  In no event  shall any  Interest
        Period extend beyond the maturity date of this note.

        To exercise  this option,  Debtor may, from time to time with respect to
        principal outstanding on which a Base Interest Rate is not accruing, and
        on the  expiration  of any  Interest  Period with  respect to  principal
        outstanding on which a Base Interest Rate has been  accruing,  select an
        index  offered  by Bank for a Base  Interest  Rate Loan and an  Interest
        Period by telephoning an authorized  lending  officer of Bank located at
        the banking office identified below prior to 1 0:00 a.m.,  Pacific time,
        on any Business Day and advising that officer of the selected index, the
        Interest  Period and the Origination  Date selected  (which  Origination
        Date,  for a Base  Interest  Rate Loan  based on the  LIBOR-Rate,  shall
        follow  the date of such  selection  by no more  than  two (2)  Business
        Days).

        Bank will mail a written  confirmation  of the terms of the selection to
        Debtor  promptly  after  the  selection  is made.  Failure  to send such
        confirmation  shall not affect Bank's rights to collect  interest at the
        rate selected.  If, on the date of the selection,  the index selected is
        unavailable  for any reason,  the selection shall be void. Bank reserves
        the right to fund the principal from any source of funds notwithstanding
        any Base Interest Rate selected by Debtor.



        b. VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. All principal  outstanding hereunder which is
        not bearing  interest at a Base  Interest  Rate shall bear interest at a
        rate per annum equal to the Reference Rate, which rate shall vary as and
        when the Reference Rate changes.

        At  any  time  prior  to the  maturity  of  this  note,  subject  to the
        provisions of paragraph 4, below, of this note, Debtor may borrow, repay
        and  reborrow  hereon so long as the total  outstanding  at any one time
        does not exceed the principal amount of this note.  Debtor shall pay all
        amounts  due under  this note in lawful  money of the  United  States at
        Bank's  SANTA CLARA  VALLEY CBO Office,  or such other  office as may be
        designated by Bank, from time to time.

                                      -1-
<PAGE>


2. LATE PAYMENTS. If any payment required by the terms of this note shall remain
unpaid ten days after same is due, at the option of Bank, Debtor shall pay a fee
of $100 to Bank.

3. INTEREST RATE FOLLOWING  DEFAULT.  In the event of default,  at the option of
Bank,  and, to the extent  permitted  by law,  interest  shall be payable on the
outstanding  principal under this note at a per annum rate equal to five percent
(5%) in  excess  of the  interest  rate  specified  in  paragraph  l..b,  above,
calculated  from the date of default  until all amounts  payable under this note
are paid in full.

4. PREPAYMENT.

         a. Amounts outstanding under this note bearing interest at a rate based
         on the  Reference  Rate may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time,
         without penalty or premium. Debtor may prepay amounts outstanding under
         this note bearing  interest at a Base  Interest Rate in whom or in part
         provided  Debtor  has given Bank not less than five (5)  Business  Days
         prior written notice of Debtor's  intention to make such prepayment and
         pays to Bank the liquidated damages due as a result. Liquidated Damages
         shall  also  be  paid,  if  Bank,  for  any  other  reason,   including
         acceleration or  foreclosure,  receives all or any portion of principal
         bearing interest at a Base Interest Rate prior to its scheduled payment
         date.  Liquidated Damages shall be an amount equal to the present value
         of the product of: (i) the difference  (but not less than zero) between
         (a) the Base Interest Rate applicable to the principal  amount which is
         being  prepaid,  and lb) the return  which Bank could obtain if it used
         the amount of such  prepayment  of  principal  to purchase at bid price
         regularly  quoted  securities  issued  by the  United  States  having a
         maturity  date most  closely  coinciding  with the  relevant  Base Rate
         Maturity Date and such  securities were hold by Bank until the relevant
         Base Rate Maturity Date ("Yield Rate"); (ii) a fraction,  the numerator
         of  which  is the  number  of days in the  period  between  the date of
         prepayment and the relevant Base Rate Maturity Date and the denominator
         of which is 360;  and (iii)  the  amount of the  principal  so  prepaid
         (except in the event that principal payments are required and have been
         made as scheduled  under the terms of the Base Interest Rate Loan being
         prepaid,  then an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount  prepaid
         or (B) 50% of the sum of (1) the amount  prepaid  and (2) the amount of
         principal  scheduled  under  the terms of the Base  Interest  Rate Loan
         being  prepaid to be  outstanding  at the relevant  Base Rate  Maturity
         Date).  Present value under this note is determined by discounting  the
         above  product  to  present  value  using the Yield  Rate as the annual
         discount factor.

        b. In no event shall Bank be  obligated to make any payment or refund to
        Debtor,  nor  shall  Debtor be  entitled  to any  setoff or other  claim
        against  Bank,  should the return  which  Bank could  obtain  under this
        prepayment  formula exceed the interest that Bank would have received if
        no prepayment had occurred.  All  prepayments  shall include  payment of
        accrued interest on the principal amount so prepaid and shall be applied
        to payment of interest before application to principal.  A determination
        by Bank as to the prepayment fee amount, if any, shag be conclusive.

        c. Bank  shall  provide  Debtor a  statement  of the  amount  payable on
        account of prepayment.  Debtor  acknowledges that (1) Bank establishes a
        Base  Interest  Rate  upon the  understanding  that it apply to the Base
        Interest  Rate  Loan  for the  entire  Interest  Period,  and  (ii)  any
        prepayment may result in Bank incurring  additional  costs,  expenses or
        liabilities;  and  Debtor  agrees to pay these  liquidated  damages as a
        reasonable  estimate  of the costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  of Bank
        associated with such prepayment.

be  limited  to,  any of the  following:  (a) the  failure of Debtor to make any
payment required under this note when due; (b) any breach,  misrepresentation or

7.  DEFINITIONS.  As used herein,  the  following  terms shall have the meanings
respectively  set forth  below:  'Base  Interest  Rate' means a rate of interest

Date"  means the last day of the  Interest  Period  with  respect  to  principal
outstanding under a Base Interest Rate Loan. 'Business Day' means a day on which
Bank is open for business for the funding of corporate loans,  and, with respect
to the rate of  interest  based on the LIBOR  Rate,  on which  dealings  in U.S.

"Interest  Period' means with respect to funds bearing  interest at a rate based
on the LIBOR Rate, any calendar  period of [one, two or three weeks or one, two,
three,  four,  five,  six, nine or twelve  months].  In  determining an Interest
Period,  a month means a period that starts on one  Business  Day in a month and
ends on and includes the day preceding the numerically  corresponding day in the
next month.  For any month in which there is no such  numerically  corresponding
day, then as to that month, such day shall be deemed to be the last calendar day
of such month.  Any Interest  Period which would otherwise and on a non-Business

interest charged by Bank at any given time.
