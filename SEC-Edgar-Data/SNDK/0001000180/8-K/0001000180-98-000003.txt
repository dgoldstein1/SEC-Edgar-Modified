Item 5.  Other Events.


         On March 23, 1998,  SanDisk  Corporation  (the  "Company" or "SanDisk")
filed a complaint in the U.S. Federal  District Court for the Northern  District
of California in San Francisco  against  Lexar Media,  Inc.  ("Lexar")  claiming
patent  infringement with respect to the Company's solid state flashdisk patent.
Specifically,  SanDisk  claims Lexar has  infringed its patent  entitled  "flash
EEPROM System" (U.S. Patent 5,602,987). Customers who purchase Lexar products or
build electronic products with Lexar devices may also be infringing this patent.
The   Company's   intellectual   property   strategy  has  been  to  enter  into
cross-licensing agreements with various companies with respect to its flash card
technology.  Currently,  SanDisk maintains patent license agreements with Intel,
Sharp, Hitachi,  Samsung and Toshiba.  SanDisk offered a cross-license agreement
to  Lexar,  similar  to  those  cross-licensing   agreements  offered  to  other
companies,  but the two companies were unable to reach an agreement with respect
to the terms of such cross-license. Lexar has stated that it disputes the patent
infringement claim.
