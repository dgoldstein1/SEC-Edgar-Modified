Intel Corporation, Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements

1.   The accompanying interim consolidated condensed financial statements of
     Intel Corporation ("Intel," the "Company" or the "Registrant") have been
     prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
     consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Annual
     Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 1997. The interim
     financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal adjustments
     which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to provide a fair
     statement of results for the interim periods presented. The interim
     financial statements should be read in connection with the financial
     statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
     ended December 27, 1997.

3.   The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
     ("SFAS") No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," as of the first
     quarter of 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes new rules for the reporting
     and display of comprehensive income and its components, however it has
     no impact on the Company's net income or stockholders' equity.

4.   Between December 27, 1997 and March 14, 1998, approximately 78 million
     of the Company's 1998 Step-Up Warrants to purchase shares of Common
     Stock were exercised at a price of $20.875 per share. Approximately
     78 million shares of Common Stock were issued, and the Company
     received proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion. The expiration date
     of these warrants was March 14, 1998.

5.   During the first quarter of 1998, the Company repurchased 22.1
     million shares of Common Stock under the Company's authorized
     repurchase program at a cost of $1.8 billion, including 1.7 million
     shares for $127 million upon the exercise of outstanding put
     warrants. During the quarter, the Company's Board of Directors
     approved an increase in the repurchase program of up to 100
     million additional shares, bringing the total authorization to
     380 million shares. As of March 28, 1998, after allowing
     for the outstanding put warrants, approximately 129.7 million shares
     remained available under the repurchase program. (See Item 2.
     Management's Discussion and Analysis for subsequent activity.)

6.   In a series of private placements during the 1991-1997 period, the
     Company sold put warrants that entitle the holder of each warrant to
     sell to the Company, by physical delivery, one share of Common Stock
     at a specified price. On certain of these warrants, the Company
     simultaneously entered into additional contractual arrangements which
     cause the warrants to terminate if the Company's stock price reaches
     specified levels. Activity during the first quarter of 1998 is
     summarized as follows:

     The 14.8 million put warrants outstanding on March 28, 1998 expire on
     various dates between May and August 1998 and have exercise prices
     ranging from $69 to $95 per share, with an average exercise price of
     $80. The amount related to the Company's potential buyback obligation
     has been reclassified from Stockholders' Equity and recorded as put
     warrants. There is no material dilutive effect on earnings per share
     for the periods presented. (See Item 2. Management's Discussion and
     Analysis for subsequent activity.)

7.   In January 1998, the Company acquired the outstanding shares of Chips
     and Technologies, Inc., a supplier of graphics accelerator chips for
     the mobile computing market segment. The purchase price was
     approximately $430 million ($321 million in net cash). During the first
     quarter, the Company recorded a nondeductible charge of $165 million
     for purchased in-process research and development, representing the
     appraised value of products still in the development stage that were
     not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no
     alternative future use.

8.   In October 1997, Intel and Digital announced that they had agreed to
     establish a broad-based business relationship. The two companies agreed
     to request a stay of all lawsuits until government review of the
     agreement was completed, following which the lawsuits would be dismissed
     with prejudice. On April 23, 1998 the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC")
     notified Intel and Digital that the FTC will not seek to enjoin
     settlement of the legal dispute between the companies. Intel currently
     expects that the settlement and the related transactions will be
     completed in the second quarter of 1998.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
         Results of Operations

Results of Operations - First Quarter of 1998 Compared to First Quarter of 1997

Revenues for Q1 1998 declined by 7% compared to Q1 1997 primarily due to lower
processor prices and decreasing revenues from sales of related board-level
products, as well as lower flash memory and chipsets revenues. Processor unit
volumes increased in Q1 1998 compared to Q1 1997, with higher volumes of
processors based on the P6 micro-architecture** partially offset by lower
volumes of Intel(R) Pentium(R) family processors.

Cost of sales increased by 19% from Q1 1997 to Q1 1998 due to the shift in
product mix, reflecting the cost of purchased components for the Single Edge
Contact ("SEC") cartridge in the Intel(R) Pentium(R) II processor, higher 
fixed costs and higher unit volumes. Gross margin decreased from 64% in Q1 
1997 to 54% in Q1 1998 due to lower processor revenues, the impact of the SEC
cartridge and the higher fixed costs.

For Q1 1998, sales of microprocessors based on the P6 micro-architecture
represented a significant and growing portion of the Company's revenues and a
majority of its gross margin. For Q1 1997, these products represented a
significant portion of both revenues and gross margin. Sales of Pentium family
microprocessors represented a significant but declining portion of revenues
and gross margin in Q1 1998, and they constituted a majority of revenues and a
substantial majority of gross margin in Q1 1997.

Operating expenses rose by a total of $197 million, or 15%, from Q1 1997 to Q1
1998, and included a one-time charge of $165 million for in-process research
and development related to the acquisition of Chips and Technologies, Inc.
which was completed during the quarter. The remaining increase was primarily
due to higher levels of spending on product development programs and expenses
related to headcount, partially offset by lower Intel Inside(R) and profit
dependent expenses. Excluding the one-time charge, operating expenses were 22%
of revenues in Q1 of 1998, and 20% of revenues in Q1 1997.

Interest and other income for Q1 1998 decreased by $8 million over the prior
year due primarily to lower gains on sales of equity investments partially
offset by increased interest income due to higher average investment balances.

The provision for taxes decreased by $384 million compared to Q1 of 1997,
primarily due to the decrease in pretax income in Q1 of 1998. The effective
tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%, including the impact of the nondeductible
one-time charge related to the acquisition of Chips and Technologies, Inc.
Without the one-time charge, the tax rate would have been 33%, lower than the
35.5% in Q1 1997.


Financial Condition

The Company's financial condition remains very strong. As of March 28, 1998,
cash, trading assets and short- and long-term investments totaled $12.7
billion, up from $11.8 billion at December 27, 1997. The Company's other
sources of available liquidity include authorized commercial paper borrowings
of up to $700 million. The Company also maintains the authority to issue an
aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion in debt, equity and other securities
under shelf registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Major sources of cash during the first quarter of 1998 included cash generated
from operations, which totaled $2.1 billion, and approximately $1.6 billion
received upon the exercise of the 1998 Step-Up Warrants. Major uses of cash
during the quarter included $1.8 billion to buy back 22.1 million shares of
Common Stock, capital spending of $1.1 billion for property, plant and
equipment, primarily for microprocessor manufacturing capacity, and $321
million in net cash for the acquisition of Chips and Technologies, Inc.

- ------------------
** The P6 micro-architecture products include the Intel(R) Pentium(R) Pro,
Intel(R) Pentium(R) II and Intel(R) Celeron(TM) processors.

         Results of Operations (continued)

Financial Condition (continued)

The Company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of net
revenues for the three month period ended March 28, 1998. At March 28, 1998,
these customers accounted for approximately 35% of net accounts receivable.

Key financing activities in the first quarter of 1998 included the repurchase
of 22.1 million shares of Common Stock for $1.8 billion as part of the
Company's authorized stock repurchase program, including 1.7 million shares
for $127 million upon the exercise of outstanding put warrants. During the
same period, 9.8 million previously outstanding put warrants expired
unexercised. From the end of the first quarter of 1998 through May 6, 1998,
the Company repurchased 8.9 million shares of its Common Stock at a cost of
$712 million and issued 3.0 million put warrants, receiving premiums of $17
million. As of May 6, 1998, Intel had the potential obligation to repurchase
17.8 million shares of Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $1.4 billion
under outstanding put warrants. The exercise price of these outstanding
warrants ranged from $69 to $95 per share, with an average exercise price of
$80 per share. During the first quarter of 1998, the Company's Board of
Directors approved an increase of up to 100 million additional shares in the
Company's repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to 380 million
shares.  As of May 6, 1998, 117.8 million shares remained available for
repurchase under the repurchase authorization, after allowing for the
outstanding put warrants.

In October 1997, the Company and Digital Equipment Corporation ("Digital")
announced that they had agreed to establish a broad-based business
relationship. Under the agreement, Intel will purchase Digital's semiconductor
operations, including facilities in Hudson, Massachusetts as well as
development operations in Jerusalem, Israel and Austin, Texas for approximately
$700 million. As the companies have been notified that the Federal Trade
Commission will not oppose the transaction, Intel currently expects that the
transaction will be completed in Q2 1998.

Management considers cash flow from operations and available sources of
liquidity to be adequate to meet business requirements in the foreseeable
future, including planned capital expenditure programs, working capital
requirements, the potential put warrant obligation and the dividend program.


Outlook

The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of
which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially.
These statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future mergers or
acquisitions, except for the previously announced transaction with Digital.

The Company expects revenue for the second quarter of 1998 to be flat to
slightly down from the first quarter revenue of $6.0 billion. The Company
expects sequential revenue growth to resume in the second half of 1998. Revenue
is partly a function of the mix of microprocessors and related purchased
components and the mix of microprocessor types and speeds, all of which are
difficult to forecast. Because of the large price difference between types of
microprocessors, this mix affects the average price Intel will realize and has
a large impact on Intel's revenues. Revenue is also subject to the rate of
growth of the computing industry and the impact of economic conditions in
various geographic regions.

Intel's strategy is to introduce ever higher performance microprocessors
tailored for the different segments of the worldwide computer market. To
implement this strategy, the Company plans to cultivate new businesses and
continue to work with the software industry to develop compelling applications
that can take advantage of this higher performance, thus driving demand toward
the newer products in each computer market segment. In line with this strategy,
the Company is seeking to develop higher performance microprocessors for each
market segment, including servers, workstations, high-end business PCs, the
basic PC and other product lines. During the first quarter, the Company began

<PAGE> 9

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
         Results of Operations (continued)

Outlook (continued)

shipping the first Intel(R) Celeron(TM) processor, intended to meet the 
computing needs of many new PC users.  The Company may continue to reduce 
microprocessor prices at such times as it deems appropriate in order to bring 
its technology to market within each relevant market segment.

The Company expects the gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 1998
to be down a few points from 54% in the first quarter, primarily the result
of purchased components used on the SEC cartridge for the Pentium II processor.
The Company expects the quarterly gross margin percentage to reach its lowest
level for the year in the second quarter. Intel's gross margin expectation for
1998 is 52 percent plus or minus a few points. The Company's goal continues to
be to grow gross margin dollars, and the Company still believes that over the
long-term, the gross margin percentage will be 50 percent plus or minus a few
points. Intel's gross margin percentage in any period varies depending on the
level of revenues and on the mix of types and speeds of microprocessors sold,
as well as the mix of microprocessors and purchased components. The Pentium II
processor is packaged with purchased components in the SEC cartridge, and the
inclusion of purchased components tends to increase unit costs. Accordingly,
sales of the Pentium II processor increase absolute dollar margins but tend to
lower the gross margin percentage. Various other factors (including unit
volumes and costs, yield issues associated with production at factories, ramp
of new technologies, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory
valuation and mix of shipments of other semiconductors) will also continue to
affect the amount of cost of sales and the variability of gross margin
percentages.

The Company has expanded manufacturing capacity over the last few years and
continues to expand capacity based on the assumed continued success of its
strategy and the acceptance of its products in specific market segments. The
Company currently expects capital expenditures for 1998 to be approximately
$5.0 billion, down from guidance of $5.3 billion in the Company's 1997 Annual
Report. This spending plan is dependent upon expectations regarding
manufacturing efficiencies, delivery times of various machines and construction
schedules for new facilities. Depreciation for 1998 is expected to be
approximately $2.9 billion, up from guidance of $2.7 billion in the Annual
Report. Depreciation in the second quarter of 1998 is expected to be
approximately $690 million.

Spending on research and development and marketing, general and
administrative expenses in the second quarter of 1998 is expected to be
approximately 3 to 5 percent higher than first quarter expenses of $1.3
billion. The $1.3 billion represents first quarter expenses excluding the $165
million charge for in-process research and development. Expense projections
for the second quarter of 1998 incorporate annual salary increases and are
dependent in part on changes in revenue and profit dependent expenses. For all
of 1998, research and development spending is expected to be approximately
$2.8 billion, including the one-time charge for in-process research and
development in the first quarter. Guidance of $2.8 billion in the Annual Report
excluded the one-time charge.

In an effort to control expenses, the Company expects to reduce headcount by
approximately 3,000 people over the next 6 months predominantly through
attrition, augmented by localized reductions in workforce.

The Company expects net interest and other (including interest expense) for the
second quarter of 1998 to be approximately $160 million, assuming no
significant changes in interest rates or expected cash balances, and no
unanticipated items.

The tax rate for the remaining quarters of 1998 is expected to be 33%. The tax
rate guidance for 1998 has been lowered from guidance of 34% in the Annual
Report. This estimate is based on current tax law and current estimate of
earnings and is subject to change.

The Company's future results of operations and the other forward-looking
statements contained in this outlook, in particular the statements regarding
revenues, pricing, new product development, gross margin, capital

<PAGE> 10

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
         Results of Operations (continued)

Outlook (continued)

spending, depreciation, research and development expenses, marketing and
general and administrative expenses, net interest and other, and tax rate
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the factors
discussed above, among the other factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially are the following: changes in customer order patterns,
including changes in customer and channel inventory levels; competitive
factors, such as rival chip architectures and manufacturing technologies,
competing software-compatible microprocessors and acceptance of new products
in specific market segments; pricing pressures; timing of software industry
product introductions; continued success in technological advances, including
development and implementation of new processes and strategic products for
specific market segments; execution of the manufacturing ramp; excess or
shortage of manufacturing capacity; the ability to successfully integrate and
operate any acquired businesses; unanticipated costs or other adverse effects
associated with processors and other products containing errata (deviations
from published specifications); and litigation involving intellectual property,
consumer and other issues.

Intel believes that it has the product offerings, facilities, personnel, and
competitive and financial resources for continued business success, but future
revenues, costs, margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors,
as discussed above, all of which are inherently difficult to forecast.

Reference is made to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Registrant's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 1997  for
descriptions of the following and other legal proceedings.


                    Digital Equipment Corporation v. Intel
              U.S. District Court, District of Mass. (97-40080)
              -------------------------------------------------
In October 1997, Intel and Digital announced that they had agreed to establish
a broad-based business relationship. The two companies agreed to request a
stay of all lawsuits until government review of the agreement was completed,
following which the lawsuits would be dismissed with prejudice. On April 23,
1998 the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") notified Intel and Digital Equipment
Corporation that the FTC will not seek to enjoin settlement of the legal
dispute between the companies. Intel currently expects that the settlement and
the related transactions will be completed in the second quarter of 1998.


                       Intergraph Corporation v. Intel
   U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Northeastern Division
                             (CV-97-N-3023-NE)
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
On April 10, 1998, the Court ordered Intel to continue to treat Intergraph as
it does similarly-situated customers, for example with respect to access to
confidential information and product supply.  Intel has filed an appeal from
this ruling. Although the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit cannot be
determined at this time, management, including internal counsel, does not
believe that the ultimate outcome will have a material adverse effect on
Intel's financial position or overall trends in results of operations.
