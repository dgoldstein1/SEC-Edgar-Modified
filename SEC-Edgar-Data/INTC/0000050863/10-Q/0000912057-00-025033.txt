ITEM 1.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

INTEL CORPORATION, NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -
UNAUDITED

1.       The accompanying interim consolidated condensed financial statements of
         Intel Corporation have been prepared in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting principles, consistent in all material respects
         with those applied in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
         year ended December 25, 1999. The interim financial information is
         unaudited, but reflects all normal adjustments which are, in the
         opinion of management, necessary to provide a fair statement of results
         for the interim periods presented. The interim financial statements
         should be read in connection with the financial statements in the
         company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25,
         1999. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to
         conform to the current presentation.

2.       In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff
         Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
         Statements (SAB 101), providing the staff's views in applying generally
         accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues.
         For companies such as Intel with fiscal years that begin between
         December 16, 1999 and March 15, 2000, the effective date for portions
         of SAB 101 was subsequently deferred until the second quarter of 2000.
         The company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting these
         portions of SAB 101 may have on the company's financial position and
         overall trends in results of operations.

5.       In March of 2000, the Internal Revenue Service closed its examination
         of the company's tax returns for years up to and including 1998.
         Resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments
         related to intercompany allocation of profits. As part of this closure,
         the company reversed previously accrued taxes reducing the first
         quarter of 2000 tax provision by $600 million, or approximately $0.17
         per share.

6.       The components of comprehensive income, net of tax, were as follows (in
         millions):

         Accumulated other comprehensive income presented in the accompanying
         consolidated condensed balance sheets consisted of the accumulated net
         unrealized gain on available-for-sale investments.

7.       During the first quarter of 2000, the company repurchased 9.8 million
         shares of common stock under the company's authorized repurchase
         program at a cost of $1 billion. As of April 1, 2000, approximately
         90.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under the
         program.

8.       In a series of private placements during the 1991-1999 period, the
         company sold put warrants that entitled the holder of each warrant to
         sell to the company, by physical delivery, one share of common stock at
         a specified price. The two million put warrants that were outstanding
         at December 25, 1999 expired unexercised in the first quarter of 2000.

9.       Intel is organized into five product-line operating segments, the Intel
         Architecture Group, the Wireless Communications and Computing Group,
         the Network Communications Group, the Communications Products Group,
         and the New Business Group.

         Although the company has five operating segments, only the Intel
         Architecture Group is a reportable segment. The Intel Architecture
         Group's products include microprocessors, motherboards and other
         related board-level products and chipsets.

         The "all other" category includes revenues and earnings or losses for
         all operating segments other than the Intel Architecture Group. In
         addition, "all other" includes certain corporate-level operating
         expenses (primarily the amount by which total profit-dependent bonus
         expenses differ from a targeted level allocated to all of the operating
         segments) and the impact of reserves for deferred income on shipments
         to distributors not allocated to operating segments.

10.      During the first quarter of 2000, the company completed a number of
         acquisitions that have been accounted for using the purchase method of
         accounting.

         In March 2000, the company acquired Ambient Technologies, Inc. in a
         cash transaction. Ambient develops integrated digital subscriber line
         silicon solutions and analog modems designed to bring high-speed
         Internet access to home users and small businesses.

         Also in March 2000, the company acquired GIGA A/S in a cash
         transaction. GIGA specializes in the design of advanced high-speed
         communications chips used in optical networking and communications
         products that direct traffic across the Internet and corporate
         networks.

         For the first quarter of 2000, $62 million was allocated to purchased
         in-process research and development and expensed upon acquisition of
         the above companies, because the technological feasibility of products
         under development had not been established and no future alternative
         uses existed.

         These purchase transactions are further described below (in millions):

</TABLE>

              Consideration includes the cash paid, less any cash acquired,
              together with the value of any stock issued and options
              assumed, but excludes any debt assumed.

        In addition to the transactions described above, Intel also purchased
        other businesses in smaller transactions. The charge for purchased
        in-process research and development related to the other acquisitions
        was not significant. The total amount allocated to goodwill and
        identified intangibles for these transactions was $38 million, which
        represents a substantial majority of the consideration for these
        transactions.

         The consolidated condensed financial statements include the operating
         results of acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition. The
         operating results of Ambient and GIGA since their acquisition have been
         included in the operating results of the Network Communications Group
         operating segment. This group has been included in the "all other"
         category for segment reporting purposes.

         The pro forma information below assumes that companies acquired in 2000
         and 1999 had been acquired at the beginning of 1999 and includes the
         effect of amortization of goodwill and other identified intangibles
         from that date. The impact of charges for purchased in-process research
         and development has been excluded. This is presented for informational
         purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of
         future operations or results that would have been achieved had the
         acquisitions taken place at the beginning of 1999.

11.      Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for acquisitions
         exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
         Goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles are amortized on a
         straight-line basis over the periods indicated below. Reviews are
         regularly performed to determine whether facts or circumstances exist
         which indicate that the carrying values of assets are impaired. The
         company assesses the recoverability of its assets by comparing the
         projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets
         against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based
         on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those
         assets. No impairment has been indicated to date.

         Net goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles at the end of
         each period consisted of the following (in millions):

         accumulated amortization of $771 million and $471 million at April 1,
         2000 and December 25, 1999, respectively.

         Amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles of
         $313 million for the first three months of 2000 consisted of $260
         million of amortization of goodwill and $53 million of amortization of
         other acquisition-related intangibles, a majority of which was related
         to developed technology.

12.      During March 2000, the company announced that it had entered into a
         definitive agreement to acquire privately held Basis Communications
         Corporation in a transaction valued at approximately $450 million in
         cash and assumed options. Basis designs and markets advanced
         semiconductors and other products used in equipment that

         directs traffic across the Internet and corporate networks. The
         completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory review and
         customary closing conditions. This acquisition is expected to be
         accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

         During May 2000, the company announced that it had entered into an
         agreement to form a new company with Excalibur Technologies
         Corporation. Intel expects to contribute its Interactive Media Services
         division to the new company and invest approximately $150 million. The
         new company is intended to enable owners of branded content, such as
         sports and entertainment, to produce and securely sell their audio and
         video content over the Internet. The completion of this transaction is
         subject to regulatory review, Excalibur stockholder approval and other
         normal closing conditions.

13.      On May 10, 2000, the company announced that it would replace
         motherboards that have a defective memory translator hub (MTH)
         component that enables SDRAM memory to work with the
         Intel-Registered Trademark- 820 Chipset. The MTH began shipping in
         November 1999, with a substantial majority of Intel's shipments to
         date occurring in the first quarter of 2000. The company estimates
         that fewer than one million boards or systems with the MTH component
         have been shipped to end users. Chipsets and motherboards with the
         MTH component that remain in raw materials inventories at Intel's
         customers may be returned to Intel for credit. The previously
         announced results for the first quarter of 2000 have been revised to
         reflect a revenue reserve for products sold prior to the end of the
         first quarter that may be returned from customers. The company also
         recorded additional inventory reserves related to such products that
         may be returned and the company's inventory of these products as of
         the end of the first quarter. The revisions to the previously
         announced results for the first quarter had a net impact on earnings
         per share of $0.01. The costs associated with the motherboard
         replacement program cannot be estimated because the number of
         motherboards that will be replaced (the user replacement rate) and
         the actual cost to replace are dependent on several variables that
         cannot be estimated at this time. The company expects to record a
         liability for these costs in a future period when the replacement
         rate and the cost to replace are known or can be estimated, and this
         liability could have a material adverse impact on the results of
         operations of the period in which it is recorded.

14.      In November 1997, Intergraph Corporation filed suit in Federal District
         Court in Alabama for patent infringement and generally alleging that
         Intel attempted to coerce Intergraph into relinquishing certain patent
         rights. The suit alleges that Intel infringes five Intergraph
         microprocessor-related patents, and includes alleged violations of
         antitrust laws and various state law claims. The suit seeks injunctive
         relief, damages and prejudgment interest, and further alleges that
         Intel's infringement is willful and that any damages awarded should be
         trebled. Intergraph's expert witness has claimed that Intergraph is
         entitled to damages of approximately $2.2 billion for Intel's alleged
         patent infringement, $500 million for the alleged antitrust violations
         and an undetermined amount for alleged state law violations. Intel has
         counterclaimed that the Intergraph patents are invalid and further
         alleges infringement of seven Intel patents, breach of contract and
         misappropriation of trade secrets. In October 1999, the court
         reconsidered an earlier adverse ruling and granted Intel's motion for
         summary judgment that the Intergraph patents are licensed to Intel, and
         dismissed all of Intergraph's patent infringement claims with
         prejudice. Intergraph has appealed this ruling. In November 1999, the
         Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's
         April 1998 order requiring Intel to continue to deal with Intergraph on
         the same terms as it treats allegedly similarly situated customers with
         respect to confidential information and products supply. In March 2000,
         the District Court issued an order granting Intel summary judgment on
         Intergraph's antitrust claims. Intergraph has appealed this ruling. The
         company disputes Intergraph's remaining state law claims, and intends
         to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

         The company is currently party to various legal proceedings, including
         that noted above. While management, including internal counsel,
         currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings,
         individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse
         effect on the company's financial position or overall trends in
         results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent
         uncertainties. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the
         possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the
         period in which the ruling occurs.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER OF 2000 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF 1999

Intel's net revenues for Q1 2000 increased by 13% compared to Q1 1999. Net
revenues for the Intel Architecture Group operating segment increased 2% in Q1
2000 compared to Q1 1999. This increase is after taking into account the revenue
reserve related to sales of chipsets and motherboards with the defective memory
translator hub (MTH) that may be returned from customers. The increase in net
revenues for the Intel Architecture Group was primarily due to higher unit
volumes of microprocessors, partially offset by lower prices. Within the "all
other" category for operating segment reporting, revenues from sales of flash
memory grew significantly between these periods. Revenues from networking and
communications products also grew, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions
made during the second half of 1999.

For Q1 2000, sales of microprocessors and related board-level products based on
the P6 microarchitecture, which are included in the Intel Architecture Group's
operations, comprised a majority of Intel's consolidated net revenues and a
substantial majority of gross margin. For Q1 1999, these products represented a
substantial majority of the company's consolidated net revenues and gross
margin.

Cost of sales increased 3% in Q1 2000 compared to Q1 1999. Within the Intel
Architecture Group operating segment, increased costs due to higher unit sales
volume of microprocessors were largely offset by lower unit costs in Q1 2000.
The lower unit costs in Q1 2000 were achieved primarily through redesigned
microprocessor products with lower-cost packaging, including packaging using
fewer purchased components, as well as factory efficiencies and lower purchase
prices on the purchased components. The cost of sales recorded for Q1 2000
includes the impact of inventory reserves related to chipsets and motherboards
with the defective MTH component, but does not include the impact of the
motherboard replacement program announced in May 2000 because the cost of this
program cannot be estimated at this time. The company's gross margin percentage
increased to 63% in Q1 2000, up from 59% in Q1 1999. The improvement in gross
margin was primarily a result of lower unit costs of microprocessors in the
Intel Architecture Group operating segment partially offset by the impact of
lower prices for microprocessors. In addition, improved demand and higher prices
for flash memory in Q1 2000 also contributed to the improvement in gross margin.
See "Outlook" for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

Excluding charges of $62 million for purchased in-process research and
development (IPR&D) related to the acquisitions completed in Q1 2000,
research and development spending increased $288 million, or 43%, in Q1 2000
compared to Q1 1999. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on
product and process development programs including product development of
companies acquired in the second half of 1999. Marketing, general and
administrative expenses increased $233 million, or 26%, in Q1 2000 compared
to Q1 1999, primarily due to increases for the Intel Inside-Registered
Trademark- cooperative advertising program, profit-dependent bonus expenses,
and marketing, general and administrative expenses from companies acquired in
the second half of 1999. Excluding the charges for IPR&D and the amortization
of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles, operating expenses
were 26% of net revenues in Q1 2000 and 22% of net revenues in Q1 1999.

The fair value of the IPR&D for each of the acquisitions was determined using
the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects
under development to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to
determine the technological innovations included; the utilization of core
technology; the complexity, cost and time to complete the remaining development
efforts; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility; and
the stage of completion in development. Future cash flows were estimated based
on forecasted revenues and costs, taking into account the expected life cycles
of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and
industry trends.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER OF 2000 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF 1999
(CONTINUED)

Discount rates were derived from weighted average cost of capital analysis,
adjusted to reflect the relative risks inherent in each entity's development
process, including the probability of achieving technological success and market
acceptance. The IPR&D charge includes the fair value of IPR&D completed. The
fair value assigned to developed technology is included in identifiable
intangible assets, and no value is assigned to IPR&D to be completed or to
future development. Intel believes the amounts determined for IPR&D, as well as
developed technology, are representative of fair value and do not exceed the
amounts an independent party would pay for these projects. Failure to deliver
new products to the market on a timely basis, or to achieve expected market
acceptance or revenue and expense forecasts, could have a significant impact on
the financial results and operations of the acquired businesses.

In March 2000 Intel completed the acquisition of GIGA A/S. GIGA specializes in
the design of advanced high-speed communications chips used in optical
networking and communications products that direct traffic across the Internet
and corporate networks. The total charge for IPR&D for GIGA was approximately
$52 million. One project, in the 10 gigabits-per-second (Gbps) product group,
accounted for 73% of the value, with four remaining projects each contributing
from 5% to 9% of the total IPR&D value. The in-process projects include the
development of next generation integrated circuit devices featuring improved
speed, efficiency and functionality for communications equipment. These projects
ranged from 7% to 78% complete, with the 10 Gbps project approximately 61%
complete. Expected completion dates for the projects range from Q2 2000 to Q2
2001, with total remaining costs to complete of approximately $12 million. The
average discount rates used for GIGA were 20% for IPR&D projects, and 11% for
developed technology. GIGA's weighted average cost of capital was 15%.

The estimated completion dates of certain IPR&D projects from companies acquired
in 1999 were revised in Q1 2000. For the Dialogic Corporation acquisition, the
CT Server project, accounting for 35% of the value assigned to IPR&D, is now
expected to be completed in Q4 2000. This project was originally scheduled to be
completed in Q1 2000 and had been subsequently revised to Q2 2000. For the Level
One Communications, Inc. acquisition, one project related to high-end switches
and accounting for 17% of the value assigned to IPR&D is now expected to be
completed in Q3 2000, revised from a previous estimate of Q1 2000.

Amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles increased to
$313 million in Q1 2000 compared to $18 million in Q1 1999, primarily due to the
impact of the acquisitions made in second half of 1999.

Interest and other income increased to $652 million in Q1 2000 compared to $356
million in Q1 1999, primarily due to higher realized gains on equity
investments.

The Q1 2000 tax provision reflects a one-time benefit for the reversal of
previously accrued taxes of $600 million. In March 2000, the Internal Revenue
Service closed its examination of the company's tax returns for years up to and
including 1998 and resolution was reached on a number of issues including
adjustments related to intercompany allocation of profits. The company's
effective income tax rate was approximately 15.6% in Q1 2000. Excluding the
one-time tax benefit and the impact of non-deductible charges for IPR&D and
amortization of goodwill, the company's effective income tax rate was
approximately 31.7% for Q1 2000 compared to 33% in Q1 1999. This decrease takes
into consideration the impact of the resolution of issues noted above.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The company's financial condition remains very strong. At April 1, 2000, total
cash, trading assets, and short-and long-term investments, excluding marketable
strategic equity securities, totaled $12.4 billion, down slightly from $12.6
billion at December 25, 1999.

The major source of cash during the first quarter of 2000 was cash provided by
operating activities of $3.3 billion. Major uses of cash during the period
included $1 billion to repurchase 9.8 million shares of common stock and capital
spending of $1.1 billion for property, plant and equipment, primarily for
microprocessor manufacturing capacity. The

FINANCIAL CONDITION (CONTINUED)

company also paid $1.4 billion in net cash for acquisitions, including the
purchases of Ambient Technologies, Inc. and GIGA. See "Outlook" for a discussion
of capital expenditure expectations in 2000.

The company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 37% of net
revenues for the first quarter of 2000. At April 1, 2000, the five largest
customers accounted for approximately 31% of net accounts receivable.

At April 1, 2000, marketable strategic equity securities totaled $9.8 billion
with approximately $7.8 billion in unrealized appreciation, an increase in total
value of $2.7 billion compared to December 25, 1999 and an increase in
unrealized appreciation of approximately $2.0 billion.

Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2000, the company announced that
it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Basis
Communications Corporation in a transaction valued at approximately $450 million
in cash and assumed options. Basis designs and markets advanced semiconductors
and other products used in equipment that directs traffic across the Internet
and corporate networks. The completion of this transaction is subject to
regulatory review and customary closing conditions.

During May 2000, the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to
form a new company with Excalibur Technologies Corporation. Intel expects to
contribute its Interactive Media Services division to the new company and invest
approximately $150 million. The new company is intended to enable owners of
branded content, such as sports and entertainment, to produce and securely sell
their audio and video content over the Internet. The completion of this
transaction is subject to regulatory review, Excalibur stockholder approval and
other normal closing conditions.

The company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet business
requirements for the next twelve months, including potential future acquisitions
or strategic investments, capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of
worldwide manufacturing capacity, working capital requirements and the dividend
program.

OUTLOOK

This outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of
which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially.
These statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers or
acquisitions that had not closed as of the end of the first quarter of 2000.

Intel's goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide
Internet economy. The company's primary focus areas are the client platform,
server platform, networking and communications, and solutions and services.
The company's five product-line operating segments support these initiatives.
Intel's strategy for client and server platforms is to introduce ever higher
performance microprocessors and chipsets, tailored for the different market
segments of the worldwide computing market, using a tiered branding approach.
In line with this strategy, during the first quarter of 2000, the company
introduced higher performance microprocessors based on the P6
microarchitecture specifically for each computing segment: the
Intel-Registered Trademark- Celeron-TM- processor for the value segment; the
Pentium-Registered Trademark- III processor for home and business
applications, and for entry level servers and workstations; and
Pentium-Registered Trademark- III Xeon-TM- processors for mid-range and
high-end servers and workstations. Later in 2000, the company expects to
introduce processors for high-end servers based on the IA-64 architecture,
under the Itanium-TM- brand. For the client platform, the company expects to
introduce the next generation of 32-bit processors, code named Timna and
Willamette. In addition, the client platform strategy includes providing
low-power processors and flash memory for handheld wireless devices. The
Intel Architecture Group operating segment supports the client and server
initiatives. The Wireless Communications and Computing Group supports the
handheld wireless device initiatives for the client platform.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)

Intel plans to cultivate new businesses as well as continue to work with the
computing industry to expand Internet capabilities and product offerings, and
develop compelling software applications that can take advantage of higher
performance microprocessors and chipsets, thus driving demand toward Intel's
newer products in each computing market segment. The company may continue to
take various steps, including reducing microprocessor prices at such times as it
deems appropriate, in order to increase acceptance of its latest technology and
to remain competitive within each relevant market segment.

In the network and communications infrastructure area, Intel's strategy is to
deliver both the system-level communications products and component-level
silicon building blocks for networking and communications systems for the home
and small- and medium-sized businesses. Intel has made acquisitions and expects
to make additional acquisitions to grow new networking and communications areas.
Initiatives in these areas are supported by the Communications Products Group
operating segment, focusing on system-level products, and the Network
Communications Group, focusing on component-level products.

Intel also intends to build new service businesses around the Internet.
Intel-Registered Trademark- Online Services, which provides Web hosting and
e-Commerce services for customers, is part of this initiative. Intel intends
to deliver a consistent worldwide platform for developing and delivering
e-Business solutions. The New Business Group operating segment supports the
service business initiatives.

Intel expects to grow revenues in the networking, communications and wireless
businesses by 50% or more in 2000. Intel's expectations for growth in these
areas, as well as in new service businesses, are subject to the company's
ability to acquire businesses as well as integrate and operate them
successfully, and to grow new businesses internally.

The company expects revenue for the second quarter of 2000 to be approximately
flat with first quarter revenue of $8.0 billion. The company's financial results
are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors and related components
by the Intel Architecture Group. Revenue is partly a function of the mix of
microprocessor types and speeds sold as well as the mix of related motherboards,
purchased components and other semiconductor products, all of which are
difficult to forecast. Because of the wide price difference among types of
microprocessors, this mix affects the average price Intel will realize and has a
large impact on Intel's revenues. Revenue is also subject to the impact of
economic conditions in various geographic regions.

In May 2000, the company announced that it would replace motherboards that
have a defective MTH component related to the Intel-Registered Trademark- 820
Chipset. The costs associated with the motherboard replacement program cannot
be estimated because the number of motherboards that will be replaced (the
user replacement rate) and the actual cost to replace are dependent on
several variables that cannot be estimated at this time. The company expects
to record a liability for these costs in a future period when the replacement
rate and the cost to replace are known or can be estimated, and this
liability could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations
of the period in which it is recorded.

Excluding the impact of the motherboard replacement program described above,
the company expects the gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2000
to be flat to down a point with the first quarter gross margin percentage of
63%, primarily due to startup and ramp costs associated with 0.18-micron
fabrication facilities. Intel's gross margin expectation for 2000 is 61%,
plus or minus a few points, again excluding the impact of the motherboard
replacement program. Based on current expectations, the gross margin
percentage is expected to be at the mid to high part of that range. The
company's gross margin percentage in any period varies depending on the mix
of types and speeds of processors sold as well as the mix of microprocessors
and related motherboards and purchased components. The company has been
implementing new packaging formats that have reduced costs on certain
microprocessor products and this is expected to continue to have a positive
impact on product unit costs as the transition continues. Over the course of
2000, the company also expects to have reduced costs due to continued
productivity improvement on its existing manufacturing processes, including
the 0.18-micron manufacturing process. Various other factors (including unit
volumes, yield issues associated with production at

                                       13

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)

factories, ramp of new technologies, the reusability of factory equipment,
warranty costs including costs related to replacing motherboards with the
defective MTH component, insufficient or excess inventory, inventory
obsolescence, variations in inventory valuation and mix of shipments of other
semiconductor and non-semiconductor products) will also continue to affect the
amount of cost of sales and the variability of gross margin percentages.

Intel's primary goal is to get its advanced technology to the marketplace, and
at the same time increase gross margin dollars. The company's plans to grow in
non-microprocessor areas, particularly those areas that have the potential to
expand networking and communications capabilities, are intended to increase
gross margin dollars but may lower the gross margin percentage.

The company has expanded its semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test
capacity over the last few years, and continues to plan capacity based on the
assumed continued success of its strategy and the acceptance of its products in
specific market segments. The company currently expects that capital spending
will be approximately $6.0 billion in 2000. This capital spending includes
expected spending related to the next-generation 0.13-micron process technology,
spending on new fabrication facility construction and equipment purchases to add
0.18-micron process capacity. The increase from the prior guidance of $5.0
billion reflects an upward revision of the company's anticipated capacity
requirements. This spending plan is dependent upon expectations regarding
production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment,
and construction schedules for new facilities. Depreciation for the second
quarter of 2000 is expected to be approximately $790 million and $3.5 billion
for the full year 2000, up from previous guidance of $3.4 billion. Amortization
of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles is expected to be
approximately $370 million in the second quarter and $1.4 billion for the full
year 2000.

Spending on research and development, excluding IPR&D, and marketing, general
and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2000 is expected to be
approximately two to four percent higher than first quarter expenses of $2.1
billion. Expense projections for the second quarter incorporate expected higher
research and development spending. Expenses are dependent in part on the level
of revenue.

Research and development spending, excluding IPR&D, for all of 2000 is expected
to be approximately $3.9 billion, up slightly from previous guidance of $3.8
billion.

The company expects interest and other income for the second quarter of 2000 to
be approximately $725 million depending on interest rates, cash balances, equity
market levels and volatility, the realization of expected gains on investments,
including gains on investments acquired by third parties, and assuming no
unanticipated items.

The company currently expects the tax rate for 2000 to be approximately 31.7%,
excluding the one-time tax benefit related to the closure of the Internal
Revenue Service audit of tax returns for years up to and including 1998, and the
impact of any IPR&D and amortization of goodwill from both prior and potential
future mergers or acquisitions. This estimate is based on current tax law, the
current estimate of earnings and the expected distribution of income among
various tax jurisdictions.

The company is currently party to various legal proceedings. Although litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, management, including internal counsel,
does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings will have
a material adverse effect on the company's financial position or overall trends
in results of operations. However, were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any
specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on
the results of operations of that period. Management believes, given the
company's current liquidity and cash and investments balances, that even an
adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or
liquidity.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)

The company's future results of operations and the other forward-looking
statements contained in this outlook--in particular the statements regarding
Intel's goals and strategies, statements regarding expected product
introductions, expectations regarding additional acquisitions, intentions
regarding building new service businesses around the Internet, revenues,
pricing, gross margin, costs and continued productivity improvements,
expectations for recording a liability for the cost of replacing motherboards
with the MTH component, capital spending, depreciation and amortization,
research and development expenses, marketing and general and administrative
expenses, interest and other income, the tax rate, and pending legal
proceedings--involve a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the
factors discussed above, among the other factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially are the following: business and economic conditions and
growth in the computing industry in various geographic regions; changes in
customer order patterns; competitive factors such as rival chip architectures
and manufacturing technologies, competing software-compatible microprocessors
and acceptance of new products in specific market segments; development and
timing of the introduction of compelling software applications; pricing
pressures; continued success in technological advances, including development
and implementation of new processes and strategic products for specific market
segments; execution of the manufacturing ramp, including the transition to the
0.18-micron process technology; shortage of manufacturing capacity;
unanticipated costs or other adverse effects associated with processors and
other products containing errata (deviations from published specifications); and
litigation involving antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other
issues.

Intel believes that it has the product offerings, facilities, personnel, and
competitive and financial resources for continued business success, but future
net revenues, costs, margins and profits are all influenced by a number of
factors, including those discussed above, all of which are inherently difficult
to forecast.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates, reference is made to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in the Registrant's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 1999 and to the subheading "Financial
Market Risks" under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on page 33 of the Registrant's
1999 Annual Report to Stockholders.

The company is exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of its
portfolio of strategic equity securities. The company typically does not attempt
to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities. These
investments are generally in companies in the high-technology industry, and a
substantial majority of the market value of the portfolio is in three sectors:
Internet, semiconductor and networking. As of April 1, 2000, five equity
positions constituted approximately 41% of the market value of the portfolio, of
which approximately $2.0 billion, or 20% of the market value of the portfolio,
consisted of an investment in Micron Technology, Inc.

The company analyzed the historical movements over the past several years of
high-technology stock indices that the company considered appropriate. Based on
the analysis, the company estimated that it was reasonably possible that the
prices of the stocks in the company's portfolio could experience a 30% adverse
change in the near term. Assuming a 30% adverse change, the company's marketable
strategic equity securities would decrease in value by approximately $2.9
billion, based on the value of the portfolio as of April 1, 2000. During the
month of April 2000, many high-technology stocks experienced increased
volatility and a significant decrease in value. If the company's marketable
strategic equity security positions as of April 1, 2000 had been valued using
prices as of April 28, 2000, the value of these securities would have decreased
by approximately $2.0 billion, or 21%. The portfolio's concentrations in
specific companies or sectors may vary over time and may be different from the
compositions of the indices analyzed, and these factors may affect the
portfolio's price volatility. This estimate is not necessarily indicative of
future performance and actual results may differ materially.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.           LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Reference is made to Item 3, Legal Proceedings in the Registrant's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 1999 for descriptions of the
following and other legal proceedings.

                         Intergraph Corporation v. Intel
    U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Northeastern Division
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               (CV-97-N-3023-NE)
                               -----------------

In March 2000, the District Court issued an order granting Intel summary
judgment on Intergraph's antitrust claims. Intergraph has appealed this ruling.
The company disputes Intergraph's remaining state law claims, and intends to
defend the lawsuit vigorously.

The company is currently party to various legal proceedings, including that
noted above. While management, including internal counsel, currently believes
that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial
position or overall trends in results of operations, litigation is subject to
inherent uncertainties. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in
which the ruling occurs. The estimate of the potential impact on the company's
financial position or overall results of operations for the above legal
proceedings could change in the future.

                  statements relating to 2000 and the first quarter of 2000 as
                  presented in a press release of January 13, 2000.

         2)       On March 31, 2000, Intel filed a report on Form 8-K relating

                  agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on a tax
                  examination for years up to and including 1998.
