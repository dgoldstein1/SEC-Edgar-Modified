Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. In the opinion of the management of International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), all adjustments necessary to a fair statement of the
results for the unaudited three and nine month periods have been made.

2. Earnings per share amounts were computed by dividing earnings after deduction
of preferred stock dividends by the average number of common shares outstanding.

3. Treasury stock within Stockholders' equity includes 62,964,675 common shares
amounting to $5,230.4 million and 53,800 preferred shares amounting to $1.4
million at September 30, 1997, and 2,179,066 common shares (adjusted to reflect
a two-for-one stock split on May 9, 1997) amounting to $135.2 million at
December 31, 1996.

4. The majority of the company's derivative transactions relates to the matching
of liabilities to assets associated with its worldwide customer financing
business. The company issues debt, using the most efficient capital markets and
products, which may result in a currency or interest rate mismatch. Interest
rate swaps or currency swaps are then used to match the interest rates and
currencies of its debt to the related customer financing receivables. These swap
contracts are principally one to five years in duration. The company uses an
internal regional center to manage the cash of its subsidiaries, predominately
for the company's European subsidiaries. This regional center principally uses
currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. The terms of
the swaps are generally less than one year.

      Interest and currency rate differentials accruing under interest rate and
currency swap contracts related to the customer financing business are
recognized over the life of the contracts in interest expense, and the effects
of contracts related to intracompany funding are recognized over the life of the
contract in interest income. When the terms of the instrument are modified, or
if it ceases to exist for whatever reason, all changes in fair value of the swap
contracts are recognized in income each period until they mature.

      Additionally, the company uses derivatives to limit its exposure to loss
resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on anticipated
cash transactions between foreign subsidiaries and the parent company. The
company receives significant dividends, intracompany royalties and net payments
for goods and services from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. In anticipation of these
foreign currency flows, and given the volatility of the currency markets, the
company selectively employs foreign currency options to manage the currency
risks. The terms of these instruments are generally less than one year.

      For purchased options that hedge anticipated transactions, gains and
losses are deferred and recognized in other income in the same period that the
underlying transaction occurs, expires or is otherwise terminated. At September
30, 1997 and December 31, 1996, there were no material deferred gains or losses.
The premiums associated with entering into option contracts are generally
amortized over the life of the options and are not


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)

material to the company's results. Unamortized premiums are included in prepaid
assets. All written options are marked to market monthly and are not material to
the company's results.

      The company also enters into derivative transactions to moderate the
impact that an appreciation of the dollar relative to other currencies would
have on the translation of foreign earnings. These transactions do not qualify
as hedges for accounting purposes and the transactions have foreign exchange
gains and losses which are recorded in earnings as the earnings occur.

      The company has used derivative instruments as an element of its risk
management strategy for many years. Although derivatives entail a risk of
non-performance by counterparties, the company manages this risk by establishing
explicit dollar and term limitations that correspond to the credit rating of
each carefully selected counterparty. The company has not sustained a material
loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
on its results of operations or financial position in the future.

5. A supplemental Consolidated Statement of Earnings schedule has been provided,
for information purposes only, to exclude the effects of the write-offs of
purchased in-process research and development associated with the Tivoli Systems
Inc. and Object Technology International Inc. acquisitions recorded in the first
quarter of 1996. The supplemental statement is shown in exhibit 99 on page 20.
This information is presented voluntarily and is provided solely to assist in
understanding the effects of these items on the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings.

6. On April 29, 1997, the stockholders of the company approved amendments to the
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 750 million to 1,875 million, which was required to effect a
two-for-one stock split approved by the company's Board of Directors on January
28, 1997. In addition, the amendments served to reduce the par value of the
common shares from $1.25 to $.50 per share. Common stockholders of record at the
close of business on May 9, 1997 received one additional share for each share
held. All share and per share data presented in the Consolidated Financial
Statements reflect the two-for-one stock split.

7. Subsequent Events: On October 28, 1997, the Board of Directors authorized the
company to repurchase up to an additional $3.5 billion of IBM common shares. The
company plans to buy shares on the open market from time-to-time, depending on
market conditions. Since, January 31, 1995, the company has repurchased
approximately $16 billion of its common stock under a series of earlier Board
authorizations.

      Effective November 1, 1997, the company created an employee benefits trust
to which the company will contribute 10 million shares of treasury stock. The
company is authorized to instruct the trustee to sell such shares from time to
time and to use such proceeds from such sales, and any dividends paid or
earnings received on such stock, toward the partial satisfaction of the
company's obligations under certain of its compensation and benefit plans,
including its retiree medical plans. The shares held in trust are not considered
outstanding for earnings purposes until they are committed to be released and
the shares will be voted by the trustee in accordance with its fiduciary duties.

ITEM 2.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
             FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997

      The company's third quarter results showed a continuation of trends that
had been evident the last several quarters. The company continued to show
strength in services, System/390* servers, commercial PCs, and Lotus Notes* and
Tivoli distributed software. At the same time there was ongoing weakness in
consumer PCs and two of the company's key server products, RS/6000* and AS/400*,
were undergoing product transitions. Currency had a significant adverse impact
on the company's results (approximately $.14 per common share). Despite these
negative factors, the company showed good earnings and constant currency revenue
growth because of its broad and diversified product and services portfolio.

  Net earnings             $  1,359   $  1,285     $  4,000   $  3,406

      The company recorded third quarter 1997 earnings of $1.38 per common
share, compared with $1.23 per common share in the third quarter of last year.
Total revenue as reported increased 3.0 percent over the same period of 1996 to
$18.6 billion and excluding the effects of currency revenue grew approximately 8
percent. The average number of common shares outstanding for the period was
978.0 million in 1997 versus 1,043.7 million in 1996.

      Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1997, were $4.03 per
common share, compared with earnings of $3.18 per common share in the first nine
months of 1996. The company's first quarter 1996 results included a charge of
$435 million ($.40 per common share) relating to a non-recurring non-tax
deductible charge for purchased in-process research and development in
connection with the acquisition of Tivoli Systems Inc. ($417 million) and Object
Technology International Inc. ($18 million). Excluding this item, the company's
adjusted earnings per common share would have been $3.59 for the first nine
months of 1996. Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 1997, was
up 3.8 percent from the prior year to $54.8 billion. The average number of
common shares outstanding for the period was 989.4 million in 1997 versus
1,066.7 million in 1996.

Results of Operations - (continued)

      On an as-reported basis, third quarter revenue in the United States was
$8.0 billion, an increase of 8.4 percent from the same period of 1996.
Asia-Pacific revenue grew 7.4 percent to $3.8 billion while revenue from Latin
America was up 9.9 percent to $891 million. Revenue from Europe/ Middle East/
Africa declined 6.3 percent to $5.2 billion and revenue from Canada declined 5.5
percent to $752 million.

      Excluding the effects of currency, Asia-Pacific revenue grew approximately
15 percent, while European revenue climbed about 6 percent year-over-year.
Revenue from Canada declined approximately 5 percent on a constant currency
basis.

      The company's total gross profit margin was 38.2 percent in the third
quarter of 1997 compared with 40.2 percent in the third quarter of last year.

      Total third-quarter expenses declined 3.1 percent, largely as a result of
a 5.8 percent drop in selling, general and administrative expense. Research,
development and engineering expense rose 4.2 percent.

      The company's tax rate was 31.5 percent in the third quarter compared with
35.1 percent in the third quarter of last year.

      Revenue from storage products increased on both a third-quarter and
nine-months basis when compared to the same periods in 1996, due to strong sales
of hard disk drives and good growth in open-systems DASD and tape products.
These increases were partially offset by lower high-end DASD revenue, which
which continued to be affected by competitive price pressures.

      Semiconductor revenue grew on both a third-quarter and nine-months basis
when compared to the same periods in 1996, as a result of strong growth in S-RAM
and custom logic products, partially offset by lower DRAM revenue.

      These increases were offset by a decline in AS/400 and RS/6000 server
revenue both on a third-quarter and nine-months basis, when compared to the same
periods in 1996. These products continued to undergo major product transitions.
System/390 revenue was essentially flat in the third quarter and decreased on a
nine months basis, when compared to last year, while MIPS (millions of
instructions per second) increased approximately 36 percent and 34 percent,
respectively, when compared to the same periods of 1996.

      Hardware sales gross profit for the third quarter and first nine months of
1997 decreased 8.7 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively, over comparable
periods in 1996. The decreases were primarily due to the increased proportion of
revenue from personal computers and semiconductor products which carry a lower
gross profit margin than AS/400 servers whose revenue had declined. These mix
effects were partially offset by cost improvements in storage products,
System/390 and semiconductors. In addition, most other hardware products
continued to be affected by competitive pricing pressures.

      Revenue from software for the third quarter and first nine months of 1997
decreased 2.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, over comparable periods in
1996. The third-quarter and first-nine months results were negatively affected
by approximately 7 and 5 percentage points, respectively, from currency in 1997.
The revenue decreases were a result of lower host based computer software
revenue associated with AS/400 and System/390 products. These decreases were
partially offset by revenue growth for distributed software offerings from Lotus
Notes and system management software from Tivoli.

      Software gross profit dollars for the third quarter were essentially flat
and decreased 1.2 percent for the first nine months of 1997, versus the same
periods in 1996. Software gross profit margins increased 2.1 percentage points
and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine
months of 1997, when compared to the same periods of last year. The improvements
in the gross profit margins are the results of lower capitalization rates and
the associated reduction in amortization, partially offset by higher vendor
royalty costs.

versus comparable periods in 1996. The third-quarter and first nine-months
revenue was negatively affected by approximately 4 percentage points from
currency in 1997. The increases in revenue were primarily due to higher
operating lease activity, offset by decreased dealer financing in 1997 versus
the same periods in 1996.

      Rentals and financing gross profit dollars decreased 13.1 percent and 8.6
percent, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 1997, when
compared to the same periods of the prior year. The decline in gross profit
dollars and margin were principally due to a trend towards financing a greater
amount of low-end products and faster growth in the more competitive U.S.
market.

      Research, development and engineering expense increased 4.2 percent and
3.9 percent, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 1997,
when compared to the same periods of 1996. These increases were primarily due to
continued investment to support the company's network computing solutions within
the company's industry-specific business units and investment in new
technologies for future products.

      The first nine-months 1996 results included a non-tax deductible charge of
$435 million for purchased-in process research and development expense
associated with the acquisition of Tivoli Systems, Inc. and Object Technology
International, Inc. in the first quarter of 1996. This amount has been
separately identified on the company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

      Interest on total borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries, which
included interest expense and interest costs associated with rentals and
financing, amounted to $407 million and $1,175 million for the third quarter and
first nine months of 1997, respectively. Of these amounts, $10 million for the
third quarter and $26 million for the first nine months were capitalized.

      The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 1997, was 31.5
percent, versus 35.1 percent for the same period in 1996. The decrease is
primarily the result of the mix of earnings and corresponding weighting of tax
rates on a country-by-country basis. The company performs assessments of the
realizability of its net deferred tax assets on a regular basis.

      The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 1997 was 33.5 percent,
versus 40.3 percent for the same period in 1996. The decrease was partially a
result of the $435 million charge associated with Tivoli Systems Inc. and Object
Technology Inc. acquisitions in the first quarter of 1996 that did not give rise
to a tax benefit. Excluding this charge, the effective tax rate for the first
nine months of 1996 would have been 37.4 percent. The additional decrease in the
nine months effective tax rate was primarily the result of the mix of earnings
and corresponding weighting of tax rates on a country-by-country basis.

Financial Condition

      During 1997, the company has continued to make significant investments to
fund its future growth and increase shareholder value, including expenditures of
$4.5 billion for plant, rental machines and other property, $3.5 billion for
research, development and engineering and $5.2 billion for the repurchase of the
company's common shares. The company had $6.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities on hand at September 30, 1997.

      The company's current ratio improved to 1.25:1. Current assets declined
$2.5 billion from year-end 1996 with declines of $1.7 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities and $1.4 billion in accounts receivable,
offset by increases of $.5 billion in prepaid expenses and a slight increase in
inventories. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
results primarily from the stock repurchases and capital expenditures, offset by
cash generated from operations and debt financing. The decline in accounts
receivable was attributable to the collection of traditionally higher year-end
accounts receivable balances, while prepaid expenses reflects a seasonal
increase from year-end levels.

      Current liabilities declined $3.4, billion with declines of $3.0 billion
in accruals, taxes and accounts payable (resulting primarily from seasonal
declines in these balances from their normally higher year-end levels), and $.4
billion in short-term debt.

Investments

      The company's capital expenditures for plant, rental machines and other
property were $4.5 billion for the nine-months ended September 30, 1997, an
increase of $.7 billion from the comparable 1996 period. This increase reflects
the company's continued investment in its rapidly growing outsourcing business,
as well as in the areas of storage products and microelectronics.

      In addition to software development expense included in research,
development and engineering expense, the company capitalized $.2 billion of
software costs during the first nine months of both 1997 and 1996. Amortization
of capitalized software costs amounted to $.8 billion during the nine-months
ended September 30, 1997, a decline of $.2 billion from the comparable 1996
period.

Other Non-Current Liabilities

      Other non-current liabilities of $13.0 billion at September 30, 1997,
declined $1.0 billion from year-end 1996 primarily due to reductions in
restructuring accrual balances related to pre-1996 restructuring programs, and
in non-U.S. retirement reserves.

customer financing increased $2.8 billion, and "core" debt increased $.5
billion. Stockholders' equity declined $1.9 billion from December 31, 1996 as
the increase in the company's retained earnings was more than offset by the
common share repurchases and the currency effect of the stronger U.S. dollar on
the company's foreign net assets.

Liquidity

      The company maintains a $10.0 billion committed global credit facility as
part of its ongoing efforts to ensure appropriate levels of liquidity. As of
September 30, 1997, $9.2 billion of this confirmed line of credit remains unused
and available for future use.

      SECTION 1. Place of Meetings. Meetings of the stockholders of the

the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote shall be produced at any

appointment, by the Chairman of the Board. If there shall be a failure to
appoint inspectors, or if, at any such meeting, any inspector so appointed shall
be absent or shall fail to act or the office shall become vacant, the chairman
of the meeting may, and at the request of a stockholder present in person and
entitled to vote at such meeting shall, appoint such inspector or inspectors of
election, as the case may be, to act thereat. The inspectors of election so
appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the
discharge of their duties, shall be sworn faithfully to execute the duties of
inspectors at such meeting, with strict impartiality and according to the best
of their ability, and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. Such
inspectors of election shall take charge of the polls, and, after the voting on
any question, shall make a certificate of the results of the vote taken. No
director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector of an
election of directors. Inspectors need not be stockholders.

present in person at any meeting of the Board in order to constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business at such meeting. Participation in a meeting by

or the Certificate of Incorporation and except also as specified in Section 1,
Section 5, and Section 6 of Article IV, in Section 3 of Article V and in Article
XII of these By-laws, the act of a majority of the directors present at any

Board, or in the case of the Chairman's absence therefrom, the President, or in
the case of the President's absence therefrom, a Vice Chairman, or in the case

unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not
be necessary to make it effective.

death, resignation, an increase in the number of directors or any other cause,
may be filled by the Board.

      SECTION 12. Retirement of Directors. The Board may prescribe a retirement
policy for directors on or after reaching a certain age, provided, however, that
such 


                                      -6-

retirement shall not cut short the annual term for which any director shall have

      SECTION 1. Executive Committee. The Board, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, may designate not less than four of the directors then in
office to constitute an Executive Committee, each member of which unless
otherwise determined by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board,
shall continue to be a member of such Committee until the annual meeting of the
stockholders which shall be held next after designation as a member of such
Committee or until the earlier termination as a director. The Chief Executive
Officer shall always be designated as a member of the Executive Committee. The
Board may by resolution appoint one member as the Chairman of the Executive
Committee who shall preside at all meetings of such Committee. In the absence of
said Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer shall preside at all such meetings.
In the absence of both the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief
Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board shall preside at all such meetings.
In the absence of the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board, the President shall preside at
all such meetings. In the absence of all such persons, a majority of the members
of the Executive Committee present shall choose a chairman to preside at such
meetings. The Secretary, or if the Secretary shall be absent from such meeting,
any person appointed by the chairman, shall act as secretary of the meeting and
keep the minutes thereof.

      SECTION 2. Powers of the Executive Committee. To the extent permitted by
law, the Executive Committee may exercise all the powers of the Board in the
management of specified matters where such authority is delegated to it by the
Board, and also, to the extent permitted by law, the Executive Committee shall
have, and may exercise, all the powers of the Board in the management of the
business and affairs of the Corporation (including the power to authorize the
seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but
excluding the power to appoint a member of the Executive Committee) in such
manner as the Executive Committee shall deem to be in the best interests of the
Corporation and not inconsistent with any prior specific action of the Board. An
act of the Executive Committee taken within the scope of its authority shall be
an act of the Board. The Executive Committee shall render in the form of minutes
a report of its several acts at each regular meeting of the Board and at any
other time when so directed by the Board.

      SECTION 3. Meetings of the Executive Committee. Regular meetings of the
Executive Committee shall be held at such times, on such dates and at such
places as shall be fixed by resolution adopted by a majority of the Executive
Committee, 


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

of which regular meetings notice need not be given, or as shall be fixed by the
Chairman of the Executive Committee or in the absence of the Chairman of the
Executive Committee the Chief Executive Officer and specified in the notice of
such meeting. Special meetings of the Executive Committee may be called by the
Chairman of the Executive Committee or by the Chief Executive Officer. Notice of
each such special meeting of the Executive Committee (and of each regular
meeting for which notice shall be required), stating the time and place thereof
shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each member of the Executive Committee, by
first-class mail, at least four days before the day on which such meeting is to
be held, or shall be sent by facsimile transmission or comparable medium, or be
delivered personally or by telephone, at least twenty-four hours before the time
at which such meeting is to be held; but notice need not be given to a member of
the Executive Committee who shall waive notice thereof as provided in Article IX
of these By-laws, and any meeting of the Executive Committee shall be a legal
meeting without any notice thereof having been given, if all the members of such
Committee shall be present thereat.

      SECTION 4. Quorum and Manner of Acting of the Executive Committee. Four
members of the Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business, and the act of a majority of the members of the Executive Committee
present at a meeting at which a quorum shall be present shall be the act of the
Executive Committee. Participating in a meeting by means of a conference
telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating
in the meeting to hear each other shall constitute presence at a meeting of the
Executive Committee. The members of the Executive Committee shall act only as a
committee and individual members shall have no power as such.

      SECTION 5. Other Committees. The Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, designate members of the Board to constitute other
committees, which shall have, and may exercise, such powers as the Board may by
resolution delegate to them, and shall in each case consist of such number of
directors as the Board may determine; provided, however, that each such
committee shall have at least three directors as members thereof. Such a
committee may either be constituted for a specified term or may be constituted
as a standing committee which does not require annual or periodic
reconstitution. A majority of all the members of any such committee may
determine its action and its quorum requirements and may fix the time and place
of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise provide. Participating in a
meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment
allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other shall
constitute presence at a meeting of such other committees.

      In addition to the foregoing, the Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, create a committee of indeterminate membership and
duration and not subject to the limitations as to the membership, quorum and
manner of meeting and acting prescribed in these By-laws, which committee, in
the event of a major disaster or catastrophe or national emergency which renders
the Board 


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

incapable of action by reason of the death, physical incapacity or inability to
meet of some or all of its members, shall have, and may exercise all the powers
of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation
(including, without limitation, the power to authorize the seal of the
Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it and the power to
fill vacancies in the Board). An act of such committee taken within the scope of
its authority shall be an act of the Board.

      SECTION 6. Changes in Committees; Resignations; Removals; Vacancies. The
Board shall have power, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, at any
time to change or remove the members of, to fill vacancies in, and to discharge
any committee created pursuant to these By-laws, either with or without cause.
Any member of any such committee may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Board or the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary. Such resignation
shall take effect upon receipt of such notice or at any later time specified
therein; and, unless otherwise specified therein, acceptance of such resignation
shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any vacancy in any committee,
whether arising from death, resignation, an increase in the number of committee
members or any other cause, shall be filled by the Board in the manner
prescribed in these By-laws for the original appointment of the members of such
committee.

or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, for which any director or officer of the Corporation served in any

person or such person's testator or intestate was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or served such other corporation, partnership, joint


                                      -14-

venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity,

including attorneys' fees actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such
action or proceeding, or any appeal therein. Such indemnification shall be a
contract right and shall include the right to be paid advances of any expenses
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding,
consistent with the provisions of applicable law in effect at any time.
Indemnification shall be deemed to be 'permitted' within the meaning of the

      SECTION 1. Stock Certificates. The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, or shall be uncertificated shares. Each owner of
stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, in such form
as shall be approved by the Board, certifying the number of shares of stock of
the Corporation owned. To the extent that shares are represented by
certificates, such certificates of stock shall be signed in the name of the
Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or a Vice Chairman of the Board or the
President or a Vice President and by the Secretary and sealed with the seal of
the Corporation (which seal may be a facsimile, engraved or printed); provided,
however, that where any such certificate is signed by a registrar, other than
the Corporation or its employee, the signatures of the Chairman of the Board, a
Vice Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary, and transfer agent or
a transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation upon such certificates may
be facsimiles, engraved or printed. In case any officer, transfer agent or
transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation ceases to be such officer,
transfer agent, or transfer clerk before such certificates shall be issued, they
may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if they
were still such officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk at the date of their
issue.

kept at the office of the Corporation correct books of account of all its
business and transactions, minutes of the proceedings of stockholders, Board,

containing the names and addresses of all persons who are stockholders, the
number of shares of stock held, and the date when the stockholder became the
owner of record thereof.

      SECTION 3. Transfers of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made on the record of stockholders of the Corporation only
upon authorization by the registered holder thereof, or by an attorney thereunto
authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary or
with a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and on surrender of the certificate or
certificates for such shares properly endorsed, provided such shares are
represented by a certificate, or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer
power and the payment of all taxes thereon. The person in whose names shares of
stock shall stand on the 


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

record of stockholders of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for
all purposes as regards the Corporation. Whenever any transfers of shares shall
be made for collateral security and not absolutely and written notice thereof
shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent or transfer clerk,
such fact shall be stated in the entry of the transfer.

      SECTION 4. Regulations. The Board may make such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-laws,
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificated or
uncertificated shares of stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize
any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents or one or more
transfer clerks and one or more registrars and may require all certificates of
stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

      SECTION 5. Fixing of Record Date. The Board shall fix a time not exceeding
fifty nor less than ten days prior to the date then fixed for the holding of any
meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
dissent of the stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose without
a meeting, as the time as of which the stockholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at such meeting or whose consent or dissent is required or may be expressed
for any purpose, as the case may be, shall be determined, and all persons who
were holders of record of voting stock at such time, and no others, shall be
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent, as the case may be. The Board may fix a time not exceeding fifty days
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making of any
distribution or the allotment of rights to subscribe for securities of the
Corporation, or for the delivery of evidences of rights or evidences of
interests arising out of any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock or
other securities, as the record date for the determination of the stockholders
entitled to receive any such dividend, distribution, allotment, rights or
interests, and in such case only the stockholders of record at the time so fixed
shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, allotment, rights or
interests.

      SECTION 6. Lost, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates. The holder of any
certificate representing shares of stock of the Corporation shall immediately
notify the Corporation of any loss, destruction or mutilation of such
certificate, and the Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued by it which the owner thereof shall
allege to have been lost or destroyed or which shall have been mutilated, and
the Corporation may, in its discretion, require such owner or the owner's legal
representatives to give to the Corporation a bond in such sum, limited or
