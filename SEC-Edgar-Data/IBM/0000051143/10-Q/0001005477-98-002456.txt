Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. In the opinion of the management of International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), all adjustments necessary to a fair statement of the
results for the unaudited three and six month periods have been made.

2. The gains and losses not affecting retained earnings line of stockholders'
equity is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities. Net earnings and gains and losses not
affecting retained earnings amounted to $1,340 million and $1,487 million for
the three month periods ended June 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The amounts
for the six month periods ended June 30, 1998 and 1997 were $2,289 million and
$1,836 million, respectively.

3. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities." This statement establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments. It requires an entity to recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those instruments at fair value. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, although early
adoption is permitted. Management is in the process of determining the impacts
to the company's financial statements as a result of the adoption of this
standard.

ITEM 2.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1998

      The company's second-quarter and first-half results were mixed across its
portfolio of businesses as the company encountered a variety of discrete market
and economic conditions. During the second quarter, the company was faced with
intense price competition and inventory management challenges in the personal
computer channel, continuing price erosion in DRAM chips and hard disk drives,
the impact of the Asian economic crisis, and the continuing negative impact
associated with foreign currency translation. In addition, the announcement of
the G5 model of the System/390 processor family resulted in a market pause in
anticipation of the new model availability in late August. The impact of these
factors was principally on hardware revenue, similar to the first quarter, but
more pronounced due to the System/390 product transition. Despite these
challenges, the company continued to make progress towards its objectives on
many fronts. Services revenue in the second quarter grew by nearly $1 billion
over the same period last year and software displayed good revenue growth and
margin performance year-to-year. Also, the technology-driven OEM businesses,
continued to show strong growth and offer further investment opportunities for
the company.

      Many of the market and economic dynamics experienced in the first half
will still be operative in the second half of 1998. However, some important
transitions will be behind the company, in particular, the System/390 product
transition. In addition, significant progress has occurred in executing to the
company's inventory management model for the personal computer channel.

Net earnings             $  1,452   $  1,446     $  2,488   $  2,641

      Net earnings were $1,452 million or $1.50 per diluted common share for the
three months ended June 30, 1998, compared with net earnings of $1,446 million
or $1.43 per diluted common share in the second quarter of 1997. Net earnings
for the six months ended June 30, 1998 were $2.5 billion or $2.56 per diluted
common share compared with net earnings of $2.6 billion or $2.58 per diluted
common share in the comparable period last year.

      As a result of the company's share repurchase program, the average number
of common shares outstanding were lower by 47.3 million to 939.6 million shares
in the second quarter and by 50.2 million to 944.9 million shares on a six
months basis versus comparable periods in 1997.

      Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 1998 was flat as reported and
up 4% on a constant currency basis as the company continued to experience
category performance similar to the first quarter of 1998. Services revenue
growth remained strong while software continued to display improved year to year
growth dynamics. However, the hardware category deteriorated further from its
first quarter performance due to personal computer and OEM price pressures and
the System/390 product transition. For the period ended June 30, 1998, revenue
increased 0.7 percent as reported and approximately 5% on a constant currency
basis versus last year.

      On an as-reported basis, second-quarter revenue in the United States was
$8.2 billion, an increase of 3.8 percent from the same period of 1997. Revenue
from Europe/Middle East/Africa grew 2.0 percent to $5.8 billion and revenue from
Canada increased 13.3 percent to $790 million. Asia-Pacific revenue was $3.3
billion, a decline of 13.1 percent. Revenue from Latin America totaled $782
million, a decrease of 7.7 percent compared with the second quarter of 1997.

      Excluding the effects of currency translation, Asia-Pacific revenue grew 1
percent, European revenue grew 5 percent, Canada increased 19 percent and Latin
America declined 6 percent, versus the second-quarter 1997.

      The overall gross profit margin for the three months ended June 30, 1998
was 38.0 percent or 1.2 points lower than the comparable period last year. The
decline on a year-to-year basis is consistent with the first quarter of 1998 and
continues to reflect the changing mix of the company's businesses which tends to
lower the overall gross profit margin. For the six months ended June 30, 1998,
overall gross profit margin of 37.3 percent was down 1.4 points versus last
year.

      Total expenses declined 3.0 percent compared with last year's second
quarter. The company's expense-to-revenue ratio improved .8 points versus last
year.

      The company's tax rate was 30.3 percent in the second quarter compared
with 33.7 percent in the year-earlier period as the company continued to benefit
from increased profit generation in markets with lower effective tax rates.

Gross profit margin                30.3%      35.5%        29.4%      34.0%

      Revenue from hardware sales for the second quarter and first six months of
1998 declined 12.7 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively, when compared to the
same periods in 1997. On a constant currency basis, the year-to-year decrease
was 9 percent in the second quarter and 7 percent through the first half of
1998.

      The hardware sales declines were due principally to continued weakness in
personal computers as a result of severe price competition and lower Systems/390
revenue as a result of price reductions and the G5 product transition. Reactions
to the G5 announcement have been positive and indications are that the G5 is
going to be a strong product and will be the most powerful server in the market.
RS/6000 revenue was lower for both the quarter and first six months of 1998,
versus comparable periods of 1997. AS/400 revenue was down slightly in the
second quarter, but increased on a six months basis when compared to the same
periods last year.

      Revenue from storage products increased on both a second-quarter and six
months basis when compared to the same periods in 1997, due primarily to strong
sales of hard disk drives, partially offset by lower revenue for high-end
storage systems, which experienced a significant decline in Asia.

      Semiconductor revenue declined in the second quarter and increased for the
first six months of 1998, when compared to the same periods in 1997. The decline
in the second quarter was primarily due to lower DRAM prices and an
Asian-related slow down in demand for ASICS products.

      Hardware sales gross profit for the second quarter and first six months of
1998 decreased 25.4 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively from comparable
periods in 1997. The hardware gross profit margin decreased 5.2 points and 4.6
points, respectively, from the prior year. These decreases were primarily driven
by pricing pressures associated with personal computers, hard disk drives and
memory chip prices when compared to the same periods in 1997. These declines
were partially offset by improved margins for AS/400, RS/6000 and System/390
products.

      Services revenue increased 21.5 percent and 21.9 percent, respectively, in
the second quarter and first six months of 1998, when compared to the same
period of last year. On a constant currency basis, growth rates in both the
quarter and the first half of 1998 would have improved 5 points to approximately
27 percent. The revenue increases were driven by continued strong growth in all
categories of service offerings. In the second quarter, new contract signings
amounted to $7.0 billion. Most of these contracts are for strategic outsourcing
agreements and require a full spectrum of the company's services.

      Services gross profit dollars increased in the second quarter and first
six months of 1998 by 29.2 percent and 30.6 percent, respectively, when compared
to year-ago periods. The positive gross profit margin trend seen in the first
quarter continued in the second quarter as margin improved 1.3 points versus
last year due to improved utilization rates and contract management.

increased 4.6 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, over comparable periods in
1997. The second-quarter and first-six months results were negatively affected
by approximately 4 and 5 percentage points, respectively, from currency in 1998.
The revenue increases are being driven by growth in the company's middleware
products consisting of data management, transaction processing, systems
management, and messaging and collaboration. On a constant currency basis,
operating systems revenue also showed double digit growth, primarily as a result

      Software gross profit dollars for the second quarter and first six months
of 1998 increased 13.6 and 12.0 percent, respectively, versus the same periods
in 1997. Software gross profit margins increased 6.0 percentage points and 5.7
percentage points, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of
1998, when compared to the same periods of last year. The company continues to
see an improved margin due to lower levels of amortization associated with
deferred development costs.

Maintenance gross profit dollars decreased 2.6 percent and 5.0 percent,
respectively, in the second quarter and first six months of 1998, when compared
to the same periods of 1997. While maintenance revenue continues to be impacted
by aggressive pricing dynamics, the gross profit margin has displayed a positive
trend in both the first and second quarter by virtue of effective cost
management actions.

negatively affected by approximately 3 percentage points, respectively, from
currency in 1997. The increases in revenue were driven by higher levels of
operating leases on low-end products.

Results of Operations - (continued)

      Rentals and financing gross profit dollars decreased 7.2 percent and 9.3
percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 1998, when
compared to the same periods of the prior year. The decline in gross profit
dollars and margin were principally due to a trend towards financing a greater
amount of low-end products and faster growth in the more competitive U.S.
market.

      Selling, general and administrative expense for the second quarter and
first six months of 1998 decreased 3.7 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively,
from the same periods in 1997. Currency had a benefit of about 3 percentage
points for the second quarter and first six months of 1998, respectively, versus
the same periods in 1997. The company continues to aggressively manage
infrastructure expense and its overall portfolio to allow for investment in
growth segments of the business.

      Research, development and engineering expense, was flat and increased 4.8
percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 1998, when
compared to the same periods of 1997. The increase in the six months of 1998 was
primarily due to the charges associated with the acquisition of Software
Artistry, Inc. and CommQuest Technologies in the first quarter of 1998.

      Interest on total borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries, which
includes interest expense and interest costs associated with rentals and
financing, amounted to $387 million and $795 million for the second quarter and
first six months of 1998, respectively. Of these amounts, $7 million for the
second quarter and $11 million for the first six months were capitalized.

      The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 1998, was 30.3
percent, versus 33.7 percent for the same period in 1997. The decrease was
primarily the result of the source of earnings and corresponding weighting of
tax rates on a country-by-country basis, as the company continued to expand into
markets with lower effective tax rates.


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

Results of Operations - (continued)

      The effective tax rate for the first six months of 1998 was 31.0 percent,
versus 34.5 percent for the same period in 1997. The 3.5 points decrease from
the 1997 rate was a result of the same factors that impacted the second quarter
effective tax rate.

Financial Condition

      During the first half of 1998, the company continued to make significant
investments to fund its future growth and increase shareholder value. These
included expenditures of $2.7 billion for research, development and engineering,
$2.8 billion in plant, rental machines and other property and $3.6 billion for
the repurchase of the company's common shares. The company had $5.5 billion in
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June 30, 1998.

Financial Condition - (continued)

      Current assets declined $3.4 billion from year-end 1997 with declines of
$2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $2.2
billion in accounts receivable, offset by increases of $.5 billion in inventory
and $.4 billion in prepaid expense. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities resulted primarily from the stock repurchases and capital
expenditures, offset by cash generated from operations and debt financing. The
decline in accounts receivable was attributable to the collection of
traditionally higher year-end accounts receivable balances. Inventories
increased mainly due to ramp-up activity relative to new model introductions,
while prepaid expenses reflect the seasonal increase in prepaid expenses from
year-end levels.

      Current liabilities declined $3.5 billion with declines of $2.9 billion in
accounts payable and accruals (resulting primarily from seasonal declines in
these balances from their normally higher year-end levels), and $.6 billion in
taxes.

Investments

      During the first half of 1998, the company continued to invest in its
rapidly growing services business, primarily in the management of customers'
information technology, as well as, in manufacturing capacity for hard disk
drives and microelectronics. The company's capital investment for plant, rental
machines and property was $2.8 billion during the first half of 1998, a decrease
of $.2 billion from the comparable 1997 period.

      In addition to software development expense included in research,
development and engineering expense, the company capitalized $.1 billion of
software costs during the first half of both 1998 and 1997. Amortization of
capitalized software costs amounted to $.3 billion during the first half of
1998, a decline of $.3 billion from the comparable 1997 period.

      Investments and sundry assets were $20.9 billion at June 30, 1998, a
decrease of $1.0 billion from year-end 1997, resulting primarily from a decrease
in non-current sales-type lease receivables and deferred tax assets.

Other Non-Current Liabilities

      Other non-current liabilities of $12.5 billion at June 30, 1998, declined
$.5 billion from year-end 1997 primarily due to reductions in restructuring
accrual balances related to pre-1996 restructuring programs, and in
postretirement benefits and non-U.S. retirement reserves.

      Total debt increased $.9 billion from year-end 1997, as "core" debt
increased $.5 billion, and debt in support of growth in global financing assets
increased $.4 billion. Stockholders' equity declined $1.2 billion from December
31, 1997, as the increase in the company's retained earnings was more than
offset by the common share repurchases.

Liquidity

      The company maintains a $10.0 billion committed global credit facility as
part of its ongoing efforts to ensure appropriate levels of liquidity. As of
June 30, 1998, $8.7 billion of this confirmed line of credit remained unused and
available for future use.

      At June 30, 1998, the company had an outstanding balance of $1.2 billion
in assets under management from the securitization of loans, leases and trade
receivables.

Year 2000

      The "Year 2000 issue" arises because many computer hardware and software
systems use only two digits to represent the year. As a result, these systems
and programs may not process dates beyond 1999, which may cause errors in
information or systems failures. Assessments of the potential effects of the
Year 2000 issues vary markedly among different companies, governments,
consultants, economists and commentators, and it is not possible to predict what
the actual impact may be. Given this uncertainty, the company recognizes the
need to remain vigilant and is continuing its analysis, assessment and planning
for the various Year 2000 issues, across its business.

      With respect to its internal systems, the potential Year 2000 impacts
extend beyond the company's information technology systems to its manufacturing
and development systems and physical facilities. The company is addressing these
issues, and aims to complete these efforts throughout 1999, including testing
phases. Although the company believes its efforts will be successful and does
not expect the costs of these efforts to be material, any failure or delay could
result in the disruption of business and in the


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Year 2000 - (continued)

company incurring substantial expense. To minimize any such potential impact,
the company has initiated a global contingency planning effort designed to
support critical business operations.

      As part of its ordinary course product development efforts, the company's
current product and service offerings have been designed to be Year 2000 ready.
The Year 2000 readiness of the company's customers varies, and the company is
actively encouraging its customers to prepare their own systems, making
available a broad array of product, service and educational offerings to assist
them (see the IBM Year 2000 Home Page at http://www.ibm.com/IBM/year2000/).
Efforts by customers to address Year 2000 issues may absorb a substantial part
of their information technology budgets in the near term, and customers may
either delay or accelerate the deployment and implementation of new applications
and systems. While this behavior may increase demand for certain of the
company's products and services, including its Year 2000 offerings, it could
also soften demand for other offerings. These events could affect the company's
revenues or change its revenue patterns.

      The company is also in the process of assessing the Year 2000 readiness of
its key suppliers, subcontractors and business partners. This project has been
undertaken with a view toward assuring that the company has adequate resources
for required supplies, components and complementary offerings, and the company
expects to complete this project early in 1999. A failure of the company's
suppliers, subcontractors and business partners to address adequately their Year
2000 readiness could affect the company's business. As part of its contingency
planning efforts, the company is preparing to identify alternate sources or
strategies where necessary if significant exposures are identified.

      In addition, the company is aware of the potential for claims against it
and other companies for damages arising from products and services that were not
Year 2000 ready. The company continues to believe that any such claims against
it would be without merit.

      Finally, the Year 2000 presents a number of other risks and uncertainties
that could affect the company, including utilities failures, competition for
personnel skilled in the resolution of Year 2000 issues, and the nature of
government responses to the issues, among others. While the company continues to
believe that the Year 2000 matters discussed above will not have a material
impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations, it remains
uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected.

                                   DEFINITIONS

      (a) 'Corporation' shall mean International Business Machines Corporation.

      (b) 'Certificate of Incorporation' shall mean the restated Certificate of

                                   ARTICLE II

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

      SECTION 1. Place of Meetings. Meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held at such place either within or outside the State of
New York as may from time to time be fixed by the Board or specified or fixed in
the notice of any such meeting.

      SECTION 2. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other
business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held on the last
Tuesday of April of each year, if not a legal holiday, or, if such day shall be

annual meeting shall not be held on the day designated herein, or if the
directors to be elected at such annual


                                       1
<PAGE>

meeting shall not have been elected thereat or at any adjournment thereof, the
Board shall forthwith call a special meeting of the stockholders for the
election of directors to be held as soon thereafter as convenient and give
notice thereof as provided in these By-laws in respect of the notice of an
annual meeting of the stockholders. At such special meeting the stockholders may
elect the directors and transact other business with the same force and effect
as at an annual meeting of the stockholders duly called and held.

      SECTION 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders, unless
otherwise provided by law, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the
Board or by the Board.

      SECTION 4. Notice of Meetings. Notice of each meeting of the stockholders,
annual or special, shall be given in the name of the Chairman of the Board, a
Vice Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President or the
Secretary. Such notice shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting
is called and the date and hour when and the place where it is to be held. A
copy thereof shall be duly delivered or transmitted to all stockholders of
record entitled to vote at such meeting, and all stockholders of record who, by
reason of any action proposed to be taken at such meeting, would be entitled to
have their stock appraised if such action were taken, not less than ten or more
than sixty days before the day on which the meeting is called to be held. If
mailed, such copy shall be directed to each stockholder at the address listed on
the record of stockholders of the Corporation, or if the stockholder shall have

Nevertheless, notice of any meeting of the stockholders shall not be required to

provided in Article IX of these By-laws. Except when expressly required by law,
notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders need not be given nor shall
publication of notice of any annual or special meeting thereof be required.

      SECTION 5. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, at all meetings of
the stockholders, the presence of holders of record of a majority of the
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation having voting power, in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereat, shall be necessary to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum
at any such meeting or any adjournment or adjournments thereof, a majority in
voting interest of those present in person or represented by proxy and entitled
to vote thereat, or, in the absence of all the stockholders, any officer
entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, such meeting, may adjourn
such meeting from time to time without further notice, other than by
announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment shall be taken, until a
quorum shall be present thereat. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum
shall be present any business may be transacted which might have been transacted
at the meeting as originally called.


                                       2
<PAGE>

      SECTION 6. Organization. At each meeting of the stockholders, the Chairman
of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the President, or
in the absence of the Chairman of the Board and the President, a Vice Chairman
of the Board, or if the Chairman of the Board, the President, and all Vice
Chairmen of the Board shall be absent therefrom, an Executive Vice President, or
if the Chairman of the Board, the President, all Vice Chairmen of the Board and
all Executive Vice Presidents shall be absent therefrom, a Senior Vice President
shall act as chairman. The Secretary, or, if the Secretary shall be absent from
such meeting or unable to act, the person whom the Chairman of such meeting
shall appoint secretary of such meeting shall act as secretary of such meeting
and keep the minutes thereof.

      SECTION 7. Items of Business. The items of business at all meetings of the
stockholders shall be, insofar as applicable, as follows:

      -- Call to order.

      -- Proof of notice of meeting or of waiver thereof.

      -- Appointment of inspectors of election, if necessary.

      -- A quorum being present.

      -- Reports.

      -- Election of directors.

      -- Other business specified in the notice of the meeting.

      -- Voting.

      -- Adjournment.

      Any items of business not referred to in the foregoing may be taken up at
the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall determine.

      No other business shall be transacted at any annual meeting of
stockholders, except business as may be: (i) specified in the notice of meeting
(including stockholder proposals included in the Corporation's proxy materials
under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934),
(ii) otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, or (iii) a proper subject for the meeting which is timely submitted
by a stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting who
complies fully with the notice requirements set forth below.

      For business to be properly submitted by a stockholder before any annual
meeting under subparagraph (iii) above, a stockholder must give timely notice in
writing of such business to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be considered
timely, a stockholder's notice must be received by the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 120 calendar days
nor more than 150 calendar days before the date of the Corporation's proxy
statement released to stockholders in connection with the prior year's annual
meeting.


                                       3
<PAGE>

However, if no annual meeting was held in the previous year, or if the date of
the applicable annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the
date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, a
stockholder's notice must be received by the Secretary not later than 60 days
before the date the Corporation commences mailing of its proxy materials in
connection with the applicable annual meeting.

      A stockholder's notice to the Secretary to submit business to an annual
meeting of stockholders shall set forth: (i) the name and address of the
stockholder, (ii) the number of shares of stock held of record and beneficially
by such stockholder, (iii) the name in which all such shares of stock are
registered on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, (iv) a representation
that the stockholder intends to appear at the meeting in person or by proxy to
submit the business specified in such notice, (v) a brief description of the
business desired to be submitted to the annual meeting, including the complete
text of any resolutions intended to be presented at the annual meeting, and the
reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (vi) any personal or
other material interest of the stockholder in the business to be submitted, and
(vii) all other information relating to the proposed business which may be
required to be disclosed under applicable law. In addition, a stockholder
seeking to submit such business at the meeting shall promptly provide any other
information reasonably requested by the Corporation.

      The chairman of the meeting shall determine all matters relating to the
efficient conduct of the meeting, including, but not limited to, the items of
business, as well as the maintenance of order and decorum. The chairman shall,
if the facts warrant, determine and declare that any putative business was not
properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed
by this Section 7, in which case such business shall not be transacted.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7, a stockholder
who seeks to have any proposal included in the Corporation's proxy materials
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under Regulation 14A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

      SECTION 8. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law, each holder of
record of shares of stock of the Corporation having voting power shall be
entitled at each meeting of the stockholders to one vote for every share of such
stock standing in the stockholder's name on the record of stockholders of the
Corporation:

      (a) on the date fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 of Article
VII of these By-laws as the record date for the determination of the
stockholders who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting, or


                                       4
<PAGE>

      (b) if such record date shall not have been so fixed, then at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of such meeting shall
have been given, or

      (c) if such record date shall not have been so fixed and if no notice of
such meeting shall have been given, then at the time of the call to order of
such meeting.

      Any vote on stock of the Corporation at any meeting of the stockholders
may be given by the stockholder of record entitled thereto in person or by proxy
appointed by such stockholder or by the stockholder's attorney thereunto duly
authorized and delivered or transmitted to the secretary of such meeting at or
prior to the time designated in the order of business for turning in proxies. At
all meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum shall be present, all matters
(except where otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-laws) shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting interest of
the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
thereat. Unless required by law, or determined by the chairman of the meeting to
be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by ballot. On a vote by
ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by the
stockholder's proxy as such, if there be such proxy.

      SECTION 9. List of Stockholders. A list, certified by the Secretary, of
the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote shall be produced at any
meeting of the stockholders upon the request of any stockholder of the
Corporation pursuant to the provisions of applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-laws.

      SECTION 10. Inspectors of Election. Prior to the holding of each annual or
special meeting of the stockholders, two inspectors of election to serve thereat
shall be appointed by the Board, or, if the Board shall not have made such
appointment, by the Chairman of the Board. If there shall be a failure to
appoint inspectors, or if, at any such meeting, any inspector so appointed shall
be absent or shall fail to act or the office shall become vacant, the chairman
of the meeting may, and at the request of a stockholder present in person and
entitled to vote at such meeting shall, appoint such inspector or inspectors of
election, as the case may be, to act thereat. The inspectors of election so
appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the
discharge of their duties, shall be sworn faithfully to execute the duties of
inspectors at such meeting, with strict impartiality and according to the best
of their ability, and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. Such
inspectors of election shall take charge of the polls, and, after the voting on
any question, shall make a certificate of the results of the vote taken. No
director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector of an
election of directors. Inspectors need not be stockholders.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

      SECTION 1. General Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation

law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, directed or required to
be exercised or done by the stockholders.

      SECTION 2. Number; Qualifications; Election; Term of Office. The number of
directors of the Corporation shall be eleven, but the number thereof may be
increased to not more than twenty-five, or decreased to not less than nine, by
amendment of these By-laws. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting
of the stockholders. At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of
directors at which a quorum is present, the persons receiving a plurality of the
votes at such election shall be elected. Each director shall hold office until
the annual meeting of the stockholders which shall be held next after the
election of such director and until a successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified, or until death, or until the director shall have resigned as
hereinafter provided in Section 10 of this Article III.

      SECTION 3. Place of Meetings. Meetings of the Board shall be held at such
place either within or outside State of New York as may from time to time be
fixed by the Board or specified or fixed in the notice of any such meeting.

      SECTION 4. First Meeting. The Board shall meet for the purpose of
organization, the election of officers and the transaction of other business, on
the same day the annual meeting of stockholders is held. Notice of such meeting
need not be given. Such meeting may be held at any other time or place which
shall be specified in a notice thereof given as hereinafter provided in Section
7 of this Article III.

      SECTION 5. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board shall be held
at times and dates fixed by the Board or at such other times and dates as the

such meetings. Notice of regular meetings of the Board need not be given except
as otherwise required by law or these By-laws.

      SECTION 6. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board may be called
by the Chairman of the Board.

      SECTION 7. Notice of Meetings. Notice of each special meeting of the Board
(and of each regular meeting for which notice shall be required) shall be given

shall be stated the time, place and, if required by law or these By-laws, the
purposes of such meeting. Notice of each such meeting shall be mailed, postage
prepaid, to each director, by first-class mail, at least four days before the
day on which such meeting is to be held, or shall be sent by facsimile
transmission or comparable medium, or be delivered personally or by telephone,
at least twenty-four hours before the time at which such meeting is to be held.
Notice of any such meeting need not be given to any director who shall waive
notice thereof as provided in Article IX of these By-laws. Any


                                       6
<PAGE>

meeting of the Board shall be a legal meeting without notice thereof having been
given, if all the directors of the Corporation then holding office shall be
present thereat.

      SECTION 8. Quorum and Manner of Acting. A majority of the Board shall be
present in person at any meeting of the Board in order to constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business at such meeting. Participation in a meeting by
means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all
persons participating in the meeting to hear each other shall constitute
presence in person at a meeting. Except as otherwise expressly required by law
or the Certificate of Incorporation and except also as specified in Section 1,
Section 5, and Section 6 of Article IV, in Section 3 of Article V and in Article
XII of these By-laws, the act of a majority of the directors present at any
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board. In the
absence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board, a majority of the directors
present thereat may adjourn such meeting from time to time until a quorum shall
be present thereat. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. At any
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted
which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. The
directors shall act only as a Board and the individual directors shall have no
power as such.

      SECTION 9. Organization. At each meeting of the Board, the Chairman of the
Board, or in the case of the Chairman's absence therefrom, the President, or in
the case of the President's absence therefrom, a Vice Chairman, or in the case
of the absence of all such persons, another director chosen by a majority of
directors present, shall act as chairman of the meeting and preside thereat. The
Secretary, or if the Secretary shall be absent from such meeting, any person
appointed by the chairman, shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep the
minutes thereof.

      SECTION 10. Resignations. Any director of the Corporation may resign at
any time by giving written notice of resignation to the Board or the Chairman of
the Board or the Secretary. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time
specified therein, or if the time when it shall become effective shall not be
specified therein, then it shall take effect immediately upon its receipt; and
unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not
be necessary to make it effective.

      SECTION 11. Vacancies. Any vacancy in the Board, whether arising from
death, resignation, an increase in the number of directors or any other cause,

      SECTION 1. Executive Committee. The Board, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, may designate not less than four of the directors then in
office to constitute an Executive Committee, each member of which unless
otherwise determined by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board,
shall continue to be a member of such Committee until the annual meeting of the
stockholders which shall be held next after designation as a member of such
Committee or until the earlier termination as a director. The Chief Executive
Officer shall always be designated as a member of the Executive Committee. The
Board may by resolution appoint one member as the Chairman of the Executive
Committee who shall preside at all meetings of such Committee. In the absence of
said Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer shall preside at all such meetings.
In the absence of both the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief
Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board shall preside at all such meetings.
In the absence of the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board, the President shall preside at
all such meetings. In the absence of all such persons, a majority of the members
of the Executive Committee present shall choose a chairman to preside at such
meetings. The Secretary, or if the Secretary shall be absent from such meeting,
any person appointed by the chairman, shall act as secretary of the meeting and
keep the minutes thereof.

      SECTION 2. Powers of the Executive Committee. To the extent permitted by
law, the Executive Committee may exercise all the powers of the Board in the
management of specified matters where such authority is delegated to it by the
Board, and also, to the extent permitted by law, the Executive Committee shall
have, and may exercise, all the powers of the Board in the management of the
business and affairs of the Corporation (including the power to authorize the
seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but
excluding the power to appoint a member of the Executive Committee) in such
manner as the Executive Committee shall deem to be in the best interests of the
Corporation and not inconsistent with any prior specific action of the Board. An
act of the Executive Committee taken within the scope of its authority shall be
an act of the Board. The Executive Committee shall render in the form of minutes
a report of its several acts at each regular meeting of the Board and at any
other time when so directed by the Board.

      SECTION 3. Meetings of the Executive Committee. Regular meetings of the
Executive Committee shall be held at such times, on such dates and at such
places as shall be fixed by resolution adopted by a majority of the Executive
Committee,


                                       8
<PAGE>

of which regular meetings notice need not be given, or as shall be fixed by the
Chairman of the Executive Committee or in the absence of the Chairman of the
Executive Committee the Chief Executive Officer and specified in the notice of
such meeting. Special meetings of the Executive Committee may be called by the
Chairman of the Executive Committee or by the Chief Executive Officer. Notice of
each such special meeting of the Executive Committee (and of each regular
meeting for which notice shall be required), stating the time and place thereof
shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each member of the Executive Committee, by
first-class mail, at least four days before the day on which such meeting is to
be held, or shall be sent by facsimile transmission or comparable medium, or be
delivered personally or by telephone, at least twenty-four hours before the time
at which such meeting is to be held; but notice need not be given to a member of
the Executive Committee who shall waive notice thereof as provided in Article IX
of these By-laws, and any meeting of the Executive Committee shall be a legal
meeting without any notice thereof having been given, if all the members of such
Committee shall be present thereat.

members of the Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business, and the act of a majority of the members of the Executive Committee
present at a meeting at which a quorum shall be present shall be the act of the
Executive Committee. Participating in a meeting by means of a conference
telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating
in the meeting to hear each other shall constitute presence at a meeting of the
Executive Committee. The members of the Executive Committee shall act only as a
committee and individual members shall have no power as such.

      SECTION 5. Other Committees. The Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, designate members of the Board to constitute other
committees, which shall have, and may exercise, such powers as the Board may by
resolution delegate to them, and shall in each case consist of such number of
directors as the Board may determine; provided, however, that each such
committee shall have at least three directors as members thereof. Such a
committee may either be constituted for a specified term or may be constituted
as a standing committee which does not require annual or periodic
reconstitution. A majority of all the members of any such committee may
determine its action and its quorum requirements and may fix the time and place
of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise provide. Participating in a
meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment
allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other shall
constitute presence at a meeting of such other committees.

      In addition to the foregoing, the Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, create a committee of indeterminate membership and
duration and not subject to the limitations as to the membership, quorum and
manner of meeting and acting prescribed in these By-laws, which committee, in
the event of a major disaster or catastrophe or national emergency which renders
the Board


                                       9
<PAGE>

incapable of action by reason of the death, physical incapacity or inability to
meet of some or all of its members, shall have, and may exercise all the powers
of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation
(including, without limitation, the power to authorize the seal of the
Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it and the power to
fill vacancies in the Board). An act of such committee taken within the scope of
its authority shall be an act of the Board.

      SECTION 6. Changes in Committees; Resignations; Removals; Vacancies. The
Board shall have power, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, at any
time to change or remove the members of, to fill vacancies in, and to discharge
any committee created pursuant to these By-laws, either with or without cause.
Any member of any such committee may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Board or the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary. Such resignation
shall take effect upon receipt of such notice or at any later time specified
therein; and, unless otherwise specified therein, acceptance of such resignation
shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any vacancy in any committee,
whether arising from death, resignation, an increase in the number of committee
members or any other cause, shall be filled by the Board in the manner
prescribed in these By-laws for the original appointment of the members of such
committee.

contract right and shall include the right to be paid advances of any expenses
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding,

the Corporation or its employee, the signatures of the Chairman of the Board, a
Vice Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary, and transfer agent or
a transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation upon such certificates may
be facsimiles, engraved or printed. In case any officer, transfer agent or
transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation ceases to be such officer,

may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if they
were still such officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk at the date of their
issue.

upon authorization by the registered holder thereof, or by an attorney thereunto
authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary or
with a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and on surrender of the certificate or
certificates for such shares properly endorsed, provided such shares are
represented by a certificate, or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer
power and the payment of all taxes thereon. The person in whose names shares of
stock shall stand on the


                                       16
<PAGE>

record of stockholders of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for
all purposes as regards the Corporation. Whenever any transfers of shares shall
be made for collateral security and not absolutely and written notice thereof
shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent or transfer clerk,
such fact shall be stated in the entry of the transfer.

      SECTION 4. Regulations. The Board may make such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-laws,
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificated or
uncertificated shares of stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize
any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents or one or more
transfer clerks and one or more registrars and may require all certificates of
stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

      SECTION 5. Fixing of Record Date. The Board shall fix a time not exceeding
sixty nor less than ten days prior to the date then fixed for the holding of any
meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
dissent of the stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose without
a meeting, as the time as of which the stockholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at such meeting or whose consent or dissent is required or may be expressed
for any purpose, as the case may be, shall be determined, and all persons who
were holders of record of voting stock at such time, and no others, shall be
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent, as the case may be. The Board may fix a time not exceeding sixty days
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making of any
distribution or the allotment of rights to subscribe for securities of the
Corporation, or for the delivery of evidences of rights or evidences of
interests arising out of any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock or
other securities, as the record date for the determination of the stockholders
entitled to receive any such dividend, distribution, allotment, rights or
interests, and in such case only the stockholders of record at the time so fixed
shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, allotment, rights or
interests.

      SECTION 6. Lost, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates. The holder of any
certificate representing shares of stock of the Corporation shall immediately
notify the Corporation of any loss, destruction or mutilation of such
certificate, and the Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued by it which the owner thereof shall
allege to have been lost or destroyed or which shall have been mutilated, and
the Corporation may, in its discretion, require such owner or the owner's legal
representatives to give to the Corporation a bond in such sum, limited or
unlimited, and in such form and with such surety or sureties as the Board in its
absolute discretion shall determine, to indemnify the Corporation against any
claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss or destruction
of any such certificate, or the issuance of such new certificate. Anything to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation, in its absolute discretion, may
refuse to issue any such new certificate, except pursuant to legal proceedings
under the laws of the State of New York.

certified public accountant or firm of such accountants who shall act as
auditors in making examinations of the consolidated financial statements of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. The auditors shall certify that the annual financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and shall
report on such financial statements to the stockholders and directors of the
Corporation. The Board's selection of auditors shall be presented for
ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting. Directors and officers,
when acting in good faith, may rely upon financial statements of the Corporation
represented to them to be correct by the officer of the Corporation having
charge of its books of account, or stated in a written report by the auditors
fairly to reflect the financial condition of the Corporation.

Stock options to purchase 46,879 shares in 1998 were outstanding, but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings because the options' exercise
price was greater than the average market price of the common shares, and
therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. Net earnings applicable to common
shareholders excludes preferred stock dividends of $10 million for the periods
ended June 30, 1998 and 1997.
