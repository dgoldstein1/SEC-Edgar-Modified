Ladies and Gentlemen:

<PAGE>

      1.    INTRODUCTION. International Business Machines Corporation, a New
York corporation (the "Issuer"), confirms its agreement with each of you
(individually an "Agent" and collectively the "Agents") with respect to the
issue and sale from time to time by the Issuer on or after the date hereof of up
to $12,107,437,190 in aggregate initial offering price of its Medium-Term Debt
Securities (or for Medium-Term Debt Securities denominated in currencies or
currency units other than U.S. dollars, the equivalent thereof based on the
prevailing exchange rates at the respective times such Medium-Term Securities
are first offered) (the "Securities") issued under Article Three of the
Indenture dated as of October 1, 1993, as supplemented by the First Supplemental
Indenture thereto dated as of December 15, 1995 (the "Indenture"), between the
Issuer and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Securities
will be issued, and the terms thereof established, from time to time by the
Issuer in accordance with the Indenture and the Procedures (as defined in
Section 3(d) hereof).

      2.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ISSUER. The Issuer represents
and warrants to, and agrees with, each Agent as follows:

            (a) Registration statements of the Issuer (Nos. 333-37034 and
      333-70521), relating to securities of the Issuer (collectively the
      "Registered Securities"), including the Securities, have been filed with
      the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and have become
      effective (such registration statements, as amended as of the Closing Date
      (as defined in Section 3(e) hereof), including all material incorporated
      by reference therein, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
      "Registration Statement," and the prospectus dated JUNE 20, 2000, a form
      of which is included in Registration Statement No. 333-37034, as
      supplemented as of the Closing Date, including all material incorporated
      by reference therein, being hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus").
      Any reference in this Agreement to amending or supplementing the
      Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of materials incorporated
      by reference in the Prospectus after the Closing Date and any reference in
      this Agreement to any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus shall be
      deemed to include any such materials incorporated by reference in the
      Prospectus after the Closing Date.

            (b) On the effective date of each registration statement included in
      the definition of Registration Statement, such registration statement
      conformed, and on the Closing Date, the Prospectus as then amended or
      supplemented will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of
      the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of
      1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust
      Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
      (the "Rules and Regulations"), and on its effective date each registration
      statement did not, and such Prospectus will not, include any untrue
      statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
      to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
      misleading, except that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or
      omissions from any of such documents based upon written information
      furnished to the Issuer by any Agent specifically for use therein.

      3. APPOINTMENT AS AGENT; SOLICITATIONS AS AGENT.

<PAGE>

            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, the Issuer
      hereby appoints each of the Agents an agent of the Issuer for the purpose
      of soliciting or receiving offers to purchase the Securities from the
      Issuer by others. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed
      to prevent the Issuer from selling at any time to any person any
      Registered Securities, including the Securities, directly on its own
      behalf or in a firm commitment underwriting pursuant to an underwriting
      agreement that does not provide for a continuous offering of such
      Securities. Each Agent agrees to use its reasonable efforts to solicit
      purchases of the Securities on the terms and subject to the conditions set
      forth herein and in the Procedures (as defined below).

            (b) On the basis of the representations and warranties contained
      herein, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each
      Agent agrees, as agent of the Issuer, to solicit offers to purchase the
      Securities upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus, as
      from time to time amended or supplemented.

            Upon receipt of notice from the Issuer as contemplated by Section
      4(b) hereof, the Agents shall suspend solicitation of offers to purchase
      the Securities until such time as the Issuer shall have furnished them
      with an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the
      Prospectus, as the case may be, contemplated by Section 4(b) and shall
      have advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.

            The Issuer reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend
      solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities commencing at any time
      for any period of time or permanently. Upon receipt of notice from the
      Issuer, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to
      purchase the Securities from the Issuer until such time as the Issuer has
      advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed. During any such
      suspension, the Issuer's obligations under Sections 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) and
      6(d) shall be suspended, except with respect to Notes held by an Agent for
      resale during the first 180 days after the Agent's purchase thereof and
      identified in a notice from the Agent to the Issuer as being held by such
      Agent for resale during such period.

            Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Issuer and the
      Agent soliciting such offer, the Agents are authorized to solicit offers
      to purchase Securities only in fully registered form in denominations of
      $1,000 or any multiple thereof. The authorized denominations of Securities
      not denominated in U.S. dollars will be determined by the Issuer at the
      time of sale. Each Agent shall communicate to the Issuer, orally or in
      writing, each reasonable offer to purchase the Securities received by it
      as Agent. The Issuer shall have the sole right to accept offers to
      purchase the Securities and may reject any such offer, in whole or in
      part. Each Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably
      exercised, without notice to the Issuer, to reject any offer to purchase
      the Securities received by it, in whole or in part, and any such rejection
      shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein.

<PAGE>

            No Security which the Issuer has agreed to sell pursuant to this
      Agreement shall be deemed to have been purchased and paid for, or sold, by
      the Issuer until such Security shall have been delivered to the purchaser
      thereof against payment by such purchaser.

            (c) At the time of delivery of, and payment for, any Securities sold
      by the Issuer as a result of a solicitation made by, or offer to purchase
      received by, an Agent, the Issuer agrees to pay such Agent a commission in
      accordance with the schedule set forth in Exhibit A hereto, unless
      otherwise agreed.

            (d) Administrative procedures respecting the sale of Securities (the
      "Procedures") shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Agents and the
      Issuer. The initial Procedures, which are set forth in Exhibit B hereto,
      shall remain in effect until changed by agreement among the Issuer and the
      Agents. Each Agent and the Issuer agree to perform the respective duties
      and obligations specifically provided to be performed by each of them
      herein and in the Procedures. The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee a
      copy of the Procedures as from time to time in effect.

            (e) The documents required to be delivered by Section 5 hereof shall
      be delivered at the offices of the Issuer in Armonk, New York, or counsel
      for the Issuer in New York City, not later than 10:00 A.M., New York City
      time, on the date of this Agreement or at such other place, and at such
      later time and date as may be mutually agreed by the Issuer and the
      Agents, such time and date being herein called the "Closing Date."

      4.    CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF THE ISSUER. The Issuer agrees with the Agents
that, in connection with each offering of Securities,

            (a) The Issuer will advise each Agent promptly of any proposal to
      amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (other
      than an amendment or supplement (i) providing solely for a change in the
      terms of the Securities, (ii) by means of the filing of materials
      incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, (iii) relating to an offering
      by the Issuer of Registered Securities other than the Securities or (iv)
      that is a pricing amendment or supplement relating to Securities the
      purchase of which was not solicited by any Agent) and will afford the
      Agents a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment
      or supplement; and the Issuer will also advise each Agent of the filing of
      any such amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission
      of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or
      of any part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance
      of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if
      issued.

            (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is
      required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of
      which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
      necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
      circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is
      delivered, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the
      Registration Statement or the

<PAGE>

      Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Rules and
      Regulations (other than as contemplated in the parenthetical clause of
      Section 4(a) hereof), the Issuer will promptly notify each Agent to
      suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities; and if the
      Issuer shall decide so to amend or supplement the Registration Statement
      or the Prospectus, it will promptly advise each Agent by telephone (with
      confirmation in writing) and will promptly prepare and file with the
      Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or
      omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at the time of any notification to
      suspend solicitations, any Agent shall own any of the Securities with the
      intention of reselling them as contemplated by Section 11 hereof, or the
      Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase Securities but the related
      settlement has not occurred, the Issuer, subject to the provisions of
      subsection (a) of this Section, will promptly prepare and file with the
      Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or
      omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.

            (c) The Issuer, during the period when a prospectus relating to the
      Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, will file promptly
      all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section
      13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Issuer will promptly
      furnish each Agent with copies of all material press releases or
      announcements to the general public which are not filed with the
      Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
      Act and are not otherwise available on the IBM home page on the Internet,
      at "http://www.ibm.com." The Issuer will also immediately notify each
      Agent of any downgrading in the rating of the Securities or any other debt
      securities of the Issuer, or any proposal to downgrade the rating of the
      Securities or any other debt securities of the Issuer, by any "nationally
      recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of
      Rule 436(g) under the Act), as soon as the Issuer learns of such
      downgrading or proposal to downgrade.

            (d) The Issuer will furnish to each Agent copies of the Prospectus
      and all amendments and supplements thereto, and all amendments to the
      Registration Statement after the date hereof (other than an amendment or
      supplement (i) relating to an offering by the Issuer of Registered
      Securities other than the Securities or (ii) that solely specifies the
      terms of the Securities the purchase of which was not solicited by any
      Agent), in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as are
      reasonably requested.

            (e) The Issuer will arrange for the qualification of the Securities
      for sale and the termination of their eligibility for investment under the
      laws of such jurisdictions as the Agents designate and will continue such
      qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the
      Securities.

            (f) So long as any Securities are outstanding, if so requested by
      the Agents, the Issuer will furnish to the Agents, (i) as soon as
      practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report
      to stockholders for such year, (ii) as soon as available, a copy of each
      report or definitive proxy statement of the Issuer, if any, filed with the

<PAGE>

      Commission under the Exchange Act or mailed to stockholders, and (iii)
      from time to time, such other information concerning the Issuer as the
      Agents may reasonably request.

            (g) Unless otherwise agreed, the Issuer will pay all expenses
      incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and
      will reimburse each Agent for any expenses (including fees and
      disbursements of counsel) incurred by it in connection with qualification
      of the Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for
      investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as such Agent may
      designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees
      charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities,
      for expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus and all supplements
      thereto, any preliminary prospectuses and any preliminary prospectus
      supplements, to each Agent and for the reasonable fees and disbursements
      of counsel to the Agents.

      5.    CONDITIONS OF OBLIGATIONS. The obligation of each Agent, whether
acting as agent of the Issuer or as principal under this Agreement, at any time
to solicit offers to purchase the Securities is subject to the accuracy, on the
date hereof, on the Closing Date, on the date of each such solicitation, and at
each of the times of acceptance and of delivery referred to in Section 6(a)
hereof and at each Representation Date (as defined in Section 6(b)), of the
representations and warranties of the Issuer herein, to the accuracy, on each
such date, of the statements of the Issuer's officers in any certificates made
pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance, on or prior to each such
date, by the Issuer of its obligations hereunder, and to each of the following
additional conditions precedent:

            (a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
      Statement or of any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceedings
      for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the
      Issuer or any Agent, shall be contemplated by the Commission.

            (b) The Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of the Closing
      Date, the date of such solicitation or any Representation Date, shall not
      contain any untrue statement of fact which, in the opinion of any Agent,
      is material or omits to state a fact which, in the opinion of any Agent,
      is material and is required to be stated therein or is necessary to make
      the statements therein not misleading.

            (c) There shall not have occurred between each trade and settlement
      date (i) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in
      or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Issuer or its
      subsidiaries which, in the judgment of such Agent, materially impairs the
      investment quality of the Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating
      of the Issuer's debt securities or public announcement that such debt
      securities are under surveillance or review, with possible negative
      implications, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
      organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act);
      (iii) any suspension or limitation of trading in securities generally on
      the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading
      on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the
      Issuer on any exchange or

<PAGE>

      in the over-the-counter market; (iv) any banking moratorium declared by
      Federal or New York authorities; or (v) any outbreak or escalation of
      major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration
      of war by Congress or any other substantial national or international
      calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of such Agent, the effect of any
      such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it
      impractical or inadvisable to proceed with solicitations of purchases of,
      or sales of, Securities.

            (d) At the Closing Date, the Agents shall have received:

                  (i) the opinion of the General Counsel of the Issuer (or any
            Assistant General Counsel, Associate General Counsel, or other
            internal Counsel of or representing the Issuer having knowledge of
            and competence in securities or other financial matters; the "Issuer
            Counsel"), or, at the election of the Issuer, the opinion of
            Cravath, Swaine & Moore, outside counsel for the Issuer, dated the
            Closing Date, to the effect that:

                        (A) the Issuer (x) has been duly incorporated and is
               validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws
               of the State of New York, with full corporate power and authority
               to own its properties and conduct its business as described in
               the Prospectus and (y) is duly qualified to do business as a
               foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of
               each jurisdiction within the United States which requires such
               qualification wherein it owns or leases material properties or
               conducts material business where such failure so to qualify may
               have a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
               earnings, business or properties of the Issuer;

                        (B) to the knowledge of opining counsel, there is no
               pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court
               or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator
               involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, of a character
               required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is
               not adequately disclosed in the Prospectus, and there is no
               franchise, contract or other document of a character required to
               be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or to
               be filed as an exhibit, which is not described or filed as
               required; and the statements in the Prospectus describing the
               terms of the Securities and the provisions of the Indenture
               fairly summarize the matters therein described; and

                        (C) none of the issue and sale of the Securities, the
               consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated herein
               or the fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict with, result
               in a breach of, or constitute a default under, (x) the charter or
               by-laws of the Issuer; (y) the terms of any indenture or other
               agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the
               Issuer or any of its subsidiaries is a party or bound, or (z) any
               order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the
               Issuer or any of its

<PAGE>

               subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative
               agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over
               the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries.

                        (D) the authorized Securities conform in all material
               respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus;

                        (E) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and
               delivered by the Issuer, has been duly qualified under the Trust
               Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding instrument
               enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms
               (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
               fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
               creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to
               general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
               enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
               law); and the Securities have been duly authorized by resolutions
               of the Board of Directors of the Issuer for issuance for a period
               beginning on the effective date of the Registration Statement and
               ending upon sale of all Securities authorized thereunder (the
               "Period"), subject to the establishment of certain terms of the
               Securities by officers of the Issuer authorized by such
               resolutions to establish such terms, and, when the terms of any
               such Security have been established as provided in such
               resolutions and in the Indenture and such has been executed and
               authenticated during such period in accordance with the
               provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the
               purchaser thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
               each such Security, assuming it does not violate any applicable
               law then binding on the Issuer, will constitute a valid and
               binding obligation of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the
               Indenture;

                        (F) the Registration Statement and any amendments
               thereto have become effective under the Act, and, to the
               knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the
               effectiveness of the Registration Statement, as amended, has been
               issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted
               or threatened;

                        (G) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed
               and delivered by the Issuer; and

                        (H) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any
               United States Federal or New York governmental agency or
               regulatory body is required for the consummation of the
               transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been
               obtained under the Act and such as may be required under the blue
               sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the issue and
               sale of the Securities and such other approvals (specified in
               such opinion) as have been obtained.

<PAGE>

                              (ii) such opining counsel shall also furnish a
               letter, dated the Closing Date, that shall state that such
               counsel has no reason to believe that: (A) the Registration
               Statement or any amendment thereof at the time it became
               effective contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
               omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
               necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that
               the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, includes an untrue
               statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
               necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
               of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
               (in each case, except for the financial statements and other
               information of an accounting or financial nature included
               therein, and the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1), included as
               an exhibit to the Registration Statement, as to which such
               counsel need express no view); and (B) the Registration Statement
               and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (except the
               financial statements and other information of an accounting or
               financial nature included therein, and the Statement of
               Eligibility (Form T-1), included as an exhibit to the
               Registration Statement, as to which such counsel need express no
               view), were not appropriately responsive in all material respects
               to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and
               the applicable rules and regulations thereunder.

            (e) At the Closing Date, the Agents shall have received a
      certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice
      President, and by the Treasurer, Controller, or Secretary or any Assistant
      Treasurer, Assistant Controller or Assistant Secretary of the Issuer in
      which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable
      investigation, shall state that (i) the representations and warranties of
      the Issuer in this Agreement are true and correct, (ii) the Issuer has
      complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to
      be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, (iii)
      no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
      or of any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose
      have been instituted or are threatened by the Commission, and (iv)
      subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the
      Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial
      position or results of operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries,
      except as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus or as described
      in such certificate.

            (f) At the Closing Date, the Agents shall have received a letter,
      dated such date, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC"), confirming that
      they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Act and
      the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published Rules and
      Regulations thereunder, that the response, if any, to Item 10 of the
      Registration Statement is correct insofar as it relates to them and
      stating in effect that:

                  (i) in their opinion, the audited financial statements and
            schedules thereto included or incorporated in the Registration
            Statement and Prospectus and

<PAGE>

            reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with
            the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the
            related published Rules and Regulations thereunder with respect to
            financial statements and financial statement schedules included or
            incorporated in annual reports on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act;

                  (ii) on the basis of a reading of the unaudited financial
            statements included or incorporated in the Registration Statement
            and Prospectus and of the latest unaudited financial statements made
            available by the Issuer and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain
            specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with
            generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily
            reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set
            forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the Board of
            Directors of the Issuer and the Pricing Committee appointed by the
            Board of Directors of the Issuer, IF ANY; and inquiries of certain
            officials of the Issuer who have responsibility for financial and
            accounting matters as to transactions and events subsequent to the
            date of the most recent financial statements included or
            incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus,
            nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:

                        (A) any unaudited financial statements included or
               incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus do not
               comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
               accounting requirements and with the published rules and
               regulations of the Commission with respect to financial
               statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form
               10-Q under the Exchange Act; or said unaudited financial
               statements are not fairly presented (except as permitted by Form
               10-Q) in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
               applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the
               audited financial statements included or incorporated in the
               Registration Statement and Prospectus; or

                        (B) any unaudited capsule information included or
               incorporated in the Registration Statement and Prospectus does
               not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited
               consolidated financial statements from which it was derived or
               was not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that
               of the audited financial statements included or incorporated in
               the Registration Statement and Prospectus; and

                  (iii) they have performed certain other procedures as a result
            of which they determined that certain information of an accounting,
            financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting,
            financial or statistical information derived from the general
            accounting records of the Issuer) set forth in the Registration
            Statement and the Prospectus, including the information included or
            incorporated in Items 1 and 7 of the Issuer's Annual Report on Form
            10-K incorporated therein or in "Management's Discussion and
            Analysis of Financial Condition and Results

<PAGE>

            of Operations" included or incorporated in any of the Issuer's
            Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated therein, agrees with the
            accounting records of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, excluding any
            questions of legal interpretation.

            References to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus in this
      subsection (f) are to such documents as amended and supplemented at the
      date of the letter.

            (g) The Agents shall have received from Davis Polk & Wardwell,
      counsel for the Agents, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date,
      with respect to the validity of the Securities, the Registration
      Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as they may require,
      and the Issuer shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they
      request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

            (h) With respect to any Security denominated in a currency other
      than the U.S. dollar, more than one currency or a composite currency or
      any Security the principal or interest of which is indexed to such
      currency, currencies or composite currency, there shall not have occurred
      a suspension or material limitation in foreign exchange trading in such
      currency, currencies or composite currency by a major international bank,
      a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the country or
      countries issuing such currency, currencies or composite currency, the
      outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving, the occurrence of any
      material adverse change in the existing financial, political or economic
      conditions of, or the declaration of war or a national emergency by, the
      country or countries issuing such currency, currencies or composite
      currency or the imposition or proposal of exchange controls by any
      governmental authority in the country or countries issuing such currency,
      currencies or composite currency.

            The obligation of each Agent, as agent of the Issuer, under this
      Agreement to solicit offers to purchase Securities at any time after the
      end of the Period is also subject to the delivery to the Agents before
      that date and thereafter, periodically as appropriate, of an opinion from
      either Issuer Counsel or Cravath, Swaine & Moore, to the effect of
      subparagraph (d)(i)(E) above with respect to the Securities to be issued
      during the period set forth therein (which shall include the period of
      contemplated solicitation) and such other documents and certificates
      (including an opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell to the effect of
      subparagraph (g) above) as the Agents may reasonably request before that
      date and the Issuer shall have furnished to Davis Polk & Wardwell such
      documents as they may reasonably request before that date for the purpose
      of enabling them to render such opinion.

            The Issuer will furnish the Agents with such conformed copies of
      such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably
      request.

      6.    ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE ISSUER. The Issuer agrees that:

            (a) Each acceptance by the Issuer of an offer for the purchase of
      Securities (whether through an Agent as agent or to one or more Agents as
      principal) and each

<PAGE>

      delivery of Securities (whether through an Agent as agent or to one or
      more Agents as principal) shall be deemed to be an affirmation that its
      representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and
      correct at the time of such acceptance and a covenant that such
      representations and warranties will be true and correct at the time of
      delivery to the purchaser of the Securities relating to such acceptance as
      though made at and as of each such time, it being understood that such
      representations and warranties shall relate to the Prospectus as amended
      or supplemented at each such time. Each such acceptance by the Issuer of
      an offer for the purchase of Securities shall be deemed to constitute an
      additional representation, warranty and agreement by the Issuer that, as
      of the settlement date for the sale of such securities, after giving
      effect to the issuance of such Securities, of any other Securities to be
      issued on or prior to such settlement date and of any other Registered
      Securities to be issued and sold by the Issuer on or prior to such
      settlement date, the aggregate amount of Registered Securities (including
      any Securities) which have been issued and sold by the Issuer will not
      exceed the amount of Registered Securities registered pursuant to the
      Registration Statement.

            (b) Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
      shall be amended or supplemented (other than by an amendment or supplement
      (i) that relates to an offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities
      other than the Securities or (ii) that solely specifies the terms of the
      Securities) (each such time being herein referred to as a "Representation
      Date"), the Issuer shall, concurrently with such amendment or supplement,
      furnish the Agents with a certificate, dated the date of delivery thereof,
      of the President or any Vice President, and by the Treasurer, the
      Controller, the Secretary or any Assistant Treasurer, Assistant Controller
      or Assistant Secretary of the Issuer, in form satisfactory to the Agents,
      to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate covering
      the matters set forth in Section 5(e) hereof which was last furnished to
      the Agents are true and correct at the time of such amendment or
      supplement as though made at and as of such time (except that such
      statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the
      Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such time and except that the
      statements contained in the certificate covering the matters set forth in
      clause (ii) of Section 5(e) shall be deemed to relate to the time of
      delivery of such certificate) or, in lieu of such certificate, a
      certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in Section
      5(e), modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and
      the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at the time of delivery of such
      certificate and, in the case of the matters set forth in clause (ii) of
      Section 5(e), to the time of delivery of such certificate; provided,
      however, that the Issuer shall deliver such certificate with respect to a
      Representation Date arising from the incorporation by reference into the
      Prospectus of a current report on Form 8-K or a quarterly report on Form
      10-Q only upon the reasonable request of the Agents.

            (c) At each Representation Date, the Issuer shall, if reasonably
      requested by the Agents, concurrently furnish the Agents with a written
      opinion or opinions, dated the date of such Representation Date, of Issuer
      Counsel or Cravath, Swaine & Moore, in form satisfactory to the Agents, to
      the effect set forth in Section 5(d) hereof, but modified, as necessary,
      to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or

<PAGE>


      supplemented at such Representation Date; provided, however, that in lieu
      of such opinion or opinions, counsel may furnish the Agents with a letter
      or letters to the effect that the Agents may rely on a prior opinion
      delivered under Section 5(d) or this Section 6(c) to the same extent as if
      it were dated the date of such letter (except that statements in such
      prior opinion shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and
      the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at such Representation Date).

            (d) At each Representation Date on which the Registration Statement
      or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented to include additional
      financial information as a result of filing of the Issuer's Annual Report
      on Form 10-K, and upon the reasonable request of the Agents, the Issuer
      shall cause PWC concurrently to furnish the Agents with a letter,
      addressed jointly to the Issuer and the Agents and dated the date of such
      Representation Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, to
      the effect set forth in Section 5(f) hereof but modified to relate to the
      Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented at
      such Representation Date, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect
      changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the
      accounting records of the Issuer; provided, however, that if the
      Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented solely
      to include financial information as of and for a fiscal quarter, PWC may
      limit the scope of such letter to the audited financial statements
      included in such amendment or supplement unless there is contained therein
      any other accounting, financial or statistical information that, in the
      reasonable judgment of the Agents, should be covered by such letter, in
      which event such letter shall also cover such other information and
      procedures as shall be agreed upon by the Agents.

            (e) The Issuer agrees that any obligation of a person who has agreed
      to purchase Securities as the result of solicitation by any Agent pursuant
      hereto to make payment for and take delivery of such Securities shall be
      subject to (i) the accuracy, on the related settlement date fixed pursuant
      to the Procedures, of the Issuer's representation and warranty deemed to
      be made to the Agents pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (a) of
      this Section 6, and (ii) the satisfaction, on such settlement date, of
      each of the conditions set forth in Sections 5(a), (b) and (c), it being
      understood that under no circumstance shall any Agent have any duty or
      obligation to exercise the judgment permitted under Section 5(b) or (c) on
      behalf of any such person.

            (f) The Issuer agrees to make generally available to its security
      holders "earning statements" satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of
      the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 158 thereunder, which requirement is
      deemed satisfied under such Rule through the Issuer's timely filing of
      periodic reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934.

      7.    INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

            (a) The Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and
      each person who controls such Agent within the meaning of either the Act
      or the Exchange Act

<PAGE>

      against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
      several, to which they or any of them may become subject, under the Act,
      the Exchange Act or other Federal or State statutory law or regulation, at
      common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
      liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
      any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
      contained in the registration statement relating to the Registered
      Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereto, or in any
      preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or arise out of or are based
      upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
      not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each Agent for any legal or other
      expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent in connection with
      investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
      action; provided, however, that (i) the Issuer will not be liable in any
      such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
      arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
      statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents in
      reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
      Issuer by any Agent specifically for use in connection with the
      preparation thereof and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any
      preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of
      any Agent (or any person controlling such Agent) through which the person
      asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the
      Securities which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a
      copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented),
      excluding documents incorporated therein by reference, at or prior to the
      earlier of the confirmation of the sale of such Securities or the delivery
      of the Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is
      required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material
      fact contained in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus was
      corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented
      prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person).
      This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the
      Issuer may otherwise have.

            (b) Each Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer,
      each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration
      Statement or any amendment thereto, and each person who controls the
      Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the
      same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuer to such Agent, but
      only with reference to written information relating to such Agent
      furnished to the Issuer by such Agent specifically for use in the
      preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This
      indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Agent
      may otherwise have.

            (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
      Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
      party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
      indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in
      writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
      indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may
      have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case
      any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies
      the indemnifying party of the

<PAGE>

      commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
      participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice
      delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid
      notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with
      counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the
      defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
      indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
      concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other
      indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those
      available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties
      shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal
      defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
      behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from
      the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to
      assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of
      counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified
      party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently
      incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof
      unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in
      connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the
      proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that
      the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than
      one separate counsel, approved by the Agents in the case of subparagraph
      (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are
      parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have
      employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the
      indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of
      the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment
      of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying
      party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such
      liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such
      clause (i) or (iii).

            (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
      circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a)
      of this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any
      reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Issuer on grounds of
      policy or otherwise, the Issuer and each Agent shall contribute to the
      aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or
      other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
      defending same) to which the Issuer and such Agents may be subject in such
      proportion so that each Agent is responsible for that portion represented
      by the percentage that the sum of aggregate commissions received by such
      Agent pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof in connection with the sale of the
      Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability relates bears to
      the aggregate principal amount of such Securities, and the Issuer is
      responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall
      any Agent be responsible for any amount in excess of the commissions
      received by it for such Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or
      liability relates, and (z) no person found liable for fraudulent
      misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall
      be entitled to contribution from any person who was found not liable for
      such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each
      person who controls any Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the
      Exchange Act shall have the same rights to

<PAGE>

      contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Issuer within
      the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the
      Issuer who shall have signed the Registration Statement or any amendment
      thereto, and each director of the Issuer shall have the same rights to
      contribution as the Issuer, subject in each case to clause (y) of this
      paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after
      receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding
      against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be
      made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify
      such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the
      omission to notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or
      parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or
      they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).

      8.    STATUS OF EACH AGENT. In soliciting offers to purchase the
Securities from the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement and in assuming its other
obligations hereunder (other than offers to purchase pursuant to Section 11
hereof), each Agent is acting solely as agent for the Issuer and not as
principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Issuer in
obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from
the Issuer has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Issuer, but such
Agent shall have no liability to the Issuer in the event any such purchase is
not consummated for any reason. If the Issuer shall default on its obligations
to deliver Securities to a purchaser who has agreed to purchase Securities as a
result of solicitation by any Agent pursuant hereto, and whose offer the Issuer
has accepted, the Issuer (i) shall hold the Agents harmless against any loss,
claim or damages arising from or as a result of such default by the Issuer, and
(ii) in particular, shall pay to the Agents any commission to which they would
be entitled in connection with such sale.

      9.    SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS. The respective
indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the
Issuer or its officers and of the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation,
or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Agent, the
Issuer or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any
controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason,
the Issuer shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by
it pursuant to Section 4(g) and the obligations of the Issuer under Section 4(f)
and Section 6(f) and the respective obligations of the Issuer and the Agents
pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. In addition, if any such
termination shall occur either (i) at a time when any Agent shall own any of the
Securities with the intention of reselling them as contemplated by Section 11
hereof or (ii) after the Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase Securities
solicited by any Agent pursuant hereto and prior to the related settlement, the
obligations of the Issuer under the last sentence of Section 4(b), under
Sections 4(a), 4(c), 4(d), 4(e) and Section 6 and, in the case of a termination
occurring as described in (ii) above, under Section 3(c) and under the last
sentence of Section 8, shall also remain in effect.

      10.   TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated for any reason at any
time by the Issuer as to any Agent or, in the case of any Agent, by such Agent
insofar as this Agreement

<PAGE>

relates to such Agent, upon the giving of one day's written notice of such
termination to the other parties hereto. Any settlement with respect to
Securities placed by an Agent occurring after termination of this Agreement
shall be made in accordance with the Procedures and each Agent agrees, if
requested by the Issuer, to take the steps therein provided to be taken by such
Agent in connection with such settlement.

      11.   PURCHASES AS PRINCIPAL. From time to time, any Agent may agree with
the Issuer to purchase Securities from the Issuer as principal. In such case the
purchasing Agent and the Issuer may, in their discretion, set forth the terms of
such purchase in a separate agreement (a "Purchase Agreement") to be entered
into between such Agent and the Issuer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C.
Upon acceptance by the Issuer of an offer to purchase Securities, unless the
Issuer and the purchasing Agent otherwise agree in writing, any such Purchase
Agreement or other written confirmation or communication transmitted by the
purchasing Agent to the Issuer or, in the absence of a Purchase Agreement or
other written confirmation or communication from the purchasing Agent, the oral
agreement with respect to the terms of the Securities and of their offer and
sale evidenced by the offer communicated by the purchasing Agent and accepted by
the Issuer, in each case together with the provisions of this Agreement, shall
constitute an agreement between the purchasing Agent and the Issuer for the sale
and purchase of such Securities (whether or not any Purchase Agreement or other
written confirmation or communication shall have been executed by the Issuer or
the purchasing Agent). In connection with any resale of Securities so purchased,
such Securities may be resold by such Agent at varying prices from time to time
or at a fixed public offering price or that such Agent may use a selling or
dealer group. Such Agent may reallow to any broker or dealer any portion of the
discount or commission payable pursuant hereto. A Purchase Agreement, to the
extent set forth therein, may incorporate by reference specified provisions of
this Agreement.

      12.   NOTICES. Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices and other

<PAGE>


      EXHIBIT B



      ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES




            The Medium-Term Notes Due One Year or More from Date of Issue (the
"Notes") are to be offered on a continuing basis by International Business
Machines Corporation (the "Issuer"). Chase Securities Inc., Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Salomon Smith Barney
Inc., as agents (each individually an "Agent" and collectively the "Agents"),
have agreed to use reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of the Notes pursuant
to an Agency Agreement dated as of JUNE 22, 2000 (the "Agency Agreement"), among
the Issuer and the Agents. No Agent will be obligated to purchase Notes for its
own account. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of
October 1, 1993 between the Issuer and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee (the
"Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as
of December 1, 1995 (collectively, the "Indenture"). The Notes will rank equally
with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and have
been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission").

            Each Note will be represented initially by either a global security
registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, as
Depositary ("DTC") (a "Book Entry Note") or a certificate issued in definitive
form (a "Certificate Note"). It is currently contemplated that both Fixed Rate
Notes (as defined below) and Floating Rate Notes (as defined below) may be
issued as Book-Entry Notes.

            Administrative procedures and specific terms of the Notes and the
offering, to the extent Notes are offered and sold through the Agents, are
explained below. Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be
handled for the Issuer by its Treasury Department. The Issuer will advise each
Agent in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with
whom each Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Notes and the
details of their delivery. To the extent that the following procedures conflict
with the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture or the Letter (as defined
below), the relevant provisions of the Note, the Indenture or the Letter shall
control.

<PAGE>

I.  CERTIFICATE NOTES AND GENERAL TERMS

            Unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer and the relevant agent, the
following administrative procedures and specific terms are applicable to
Certificate Notes and, except to the extent otherwise specified under II below,
Book-Entry Notes.

ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE:        Each Note will be dated the date of its
                            authentication.  Each Note will also bear
                            an original issue date which, with respect
                            to any Note (or portion thereof), shall
                            mean the date of its original issuance and
                            shall be specified therein.  The original
                            issue date shall remain the same for all
                            Notes subsequently issued upon transfer,
                            exchange or substitution of a Note,
                            regardless of their dates of
                            authentication.

MATURITIES:                 Each Note will mature on a date, selected
                            by the purchaser and agreed to by the
                            Issuer, which will be at least twelve
                            months after the date of issue; PROVIDED,
                            HOWEVER, that each Floating Rate Note (as
                            defined below) will mature on an Interest
                            Payment Date (as defined below) for such
                            Note.

REDEMPTION:                 The Floating Rate Notes will not be
                            redeemable prior to maturity, unless
                            otherwise specified in the applicable
                            Pricing Supplement.  The Fixed Rate Notes
                            (as defined below) either (i) will not be
                            redeemable prior to maturity, or (ii) will
                            be redeemable at the option of the Issuer
                            on or after a specified date prior to
                            maturity at par or at prices which will
                            decline annually by a fixed percentage
                            from a specified initial premium to par.
                            Unless otherwise specified in the
                            applicable pricing supplement, Redemption
                            Dates for redeemable Fixed Rate Notes will
                            correspond with the Interest Payment Dates
                            for such Notes.

PRICE TO PUBLIC:            Each Note will be issued at 100% of
                            principal amount, unless otherwise agreed
                            between the Issuer and the relevant Agent.

<PAGE>

DENOMINATIONS:              Unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer
                            and the relevant Agent, the denominations
                            of the Notes will be $100,000 and any
                            amount in excess thereof which is $1,000
                            or any multiple thereof.  The
                            denominations of Notes denominated in
                            currencies or currency units other than
                            U.S. dollars will be as agreed between the
                            Issuer and the relevant Agent.

                            commission. Delivery of any confirmation or Note
                            will be made in compliance with "Delivery of
                            Prospectus" below.

FAILS:                      In the event that a purchaser shall fail
                            to accept delivery of and make payment for
                            a Note on the settlement date, the
                            Presenting Agent will notify the Trustee
                            and the Issuer by telephone, confirmed in
                            writing.  If the Note has been delivered
                            to the Presenting Agent, as the Issuer's
                            agent, the Presenting Agent shall return
                            such Note to the Trustee.  If funds have
                            been advanced by the Presenting Agent for
                            the purchase of such Note, the Issuer
                            will, immediately upon receipt of such
                            notice, refund the payment previously made
                            to it by the Presenting Agent in
                            immediately available funds.  Such
                            payments will be made on the settlement
                            date, if possible, and in any event not
                            later than the Business Day following the
                            settlement date.  If such failure shall
                            have occurred for any reason other than
                            the failure of the Presenting Agent to
                            provide the Purchase Information to the
                            Issuer or to provide a confirmation to the
                            purchaser, the Issuer will reimburse the
                            Presenting Agent on an equitable basis for
                            its loss of the use of funds during the
                            period when they were credited to the
                            account of the Issuer.

                            Immediately upon receipt of the Note in respect of
                            which the failure occurred, the Trustee will cause
                            the Security Registrar to make appropriate entries
                            to reflect the fact that the Note was never issued
                            and will destroy the Note.

PROCEDURE FOR               The Issuer and the Agents will discuss
RATE CHANGES:               from time to time the rates to be borne by
                            the Notes that may be sold as a result of the
                            solicitation of offers by the Agents. Once any Agent
                            has recorded any indication of interest in Notes
                            upon certain terms, and communicated with the
                            Issuer, if the Issuer plans to accept an offer to
                            purchase Notes upon such terms, it will prepare a
                            pricing sticker reflecting the terms of such Notes
                            and, after approval from the Agents, will arrange to
                            have the required number of copies of the sticker
                            filed with the Commission within two Business Days
                            following such acceptance and will supply at least
                            five copies of such sticker to the Presenting Agent.
                            No settlements with respect to Notes upon such terms
                            may occur prior to such filing and the Agents will
                            not, prior to such filing, mail confirmations to
                            customers who have offered to purchase Notes upon
                            such terms. After such filing, sales, mailing of
                            confirmations and settlements may occur with respect
                            to Notes upon such terms, subject to the provisions
                            of "Delivery of Prospectus" below.

                            If the Issuer decides to "post" fixed interest rates
                            and a decision has been reached to change interest
                            rates, the Issuer will promptly notify each Agent.
                            Each Agent will forthwith suspend solicitation of
                            purchases. At that time, the Agents will recommend
                            and the Issuer will establish fixed interest rates
                            to be so posted. Following establishment of posted
                            fixed interest rates and prior to the filing of the
                            pricing sticker described in the preceding
                            paragraph, the Agents may only record indications of
                            interest in purchasing Fixed Rate Notes at the
                            posted fixed interest rates. After such filing,
                            sales, mailing of confirmations and settlements at
                            the posted rates may resume, subject to the
                            provisions of "Delivery of Prospectus" below.

                            Outdated stickers, and copies of the Prospectus to
                            which they are attached (other than those retained
                            for files), will be destroyed.

SUSPENSION OF               As provided in the Agency Agreement, the
SOLICITATION                Issuer may suspend Amendment or
AMENDMENT OR                solicitation of purchases at any time and,
                            upon receipt of notice

<PAGE>

SUPPLEMENT:                 from the Issuer, each Agent will forthwith suspend
                            solicitation until such time as the Issuer has
                            advised them that solicitation of purchases may be
                            resumed.

                            If the Agents receive the notice from the Issuer
                            contemplated by Section 4(b) of the Agency
                            Agreement, they will promptly suspend solicitation
                            and will only resume solicitation as provided in the
                            Agency Agreement. If the Issuer decides to amend or
                            supplement the Registration Statement or the
                            Prospectus relating to the Notes (other than by an
                            amendment or supplement that (i) only specifies the
                            terms of the Securities or (ii) relates to an
                            offering by the Issuer of Registered Securities
                            other than the Securities), it will promptly advise
                            each Agent and will furnish each Agent with the
                            proposed amendment or supplement in accordance with
                            the terms of the Agency Agreement. The Issuer will
                            promptly file or mail to the Commission for filing
                            such amendment or supplement, provide the Agents
                            with copies of any such amendment or supplement,
                            confirm to the Agents that such amendment or
                            supplement has been filed with the Commission and
                            advise the Agents that solicitation may be resumed.

                            Any such suspension shall not affect the Issuer's
                            obligations under the Agency Agreement; and in the
                            event that at the time the Issuer suspends
                            solicitation of offers to purchase Notes there shall
                            be any offers already accepted by the Issuer
                            outstanding for settlement, the Issuer will have the
                            sole responsibility for fulfilling such obligations.
                            The Issuer will in addition promptly advise the
                            Agents and the Trustee if such offers are not to be
                            settled and if copies of the Prospectus as in effect
                            at the time of the suspension may not be delivered
                            in connection with the settlement of such offers.

DELIVERY OF                 With respect to each purchase resulting
PROSPECTUS:                 from a solicitation by any Agent, a copy
                            of the Prospectus, as most recently amended or
                            supplemented on the date of delivery thereof (except
                            as provided below), but excluding materials
                            incorporated by reference therein, must be delivered
                            to a purchaser prior to or together with the earlier
                            of delivery of (i) the written

<PAGE>

                            confirmation provided for above, and (ii) any Note
                            purchased by such purchaser as a result of such
                            solicitation. The Issuer shall ensure that the
                            Presenting Agent receives the required number of
                            copies of the Prospectus and each amendment or
                            supplement thereto (including appropriate pricing
                            stickers), but excluding materials incorporated by
                            reference therein, by telecopy or overnight express
                            (for delivery not later than 11:00 a.m. on the
                            Business Day next following the trade date) to
                            enable the Presenting Agent to deliver such
                            confirmation or Note to such purchaser as
                            contemplated by these procedures and in compliance
                            with the preceding sentence. If, since the date of
                            acceptance of such purchaser's offer, the Prospectus
                            shall have been supplemented solely to reflect any
                            sale of Notes on terms different from those agreed
                            to between the Issuer and such purchaser or a change
                            in posted rates not applicable to such purchaser,
                            such purchaser shall not receive the Prospectus as
                            supplemented by such new supplement, but shall
                            receive the Prospectus as supplemented to reflect
                            the terms of the Notes being purchased by such
                            purchaser and otherwise as most recently amended or
                            supplemented on the date of delivery of the
                            Prospectus.

DTC dated as of March 10, 1989, and its obligations as a participant in DTC,
including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS"). Both Fixed and
Floating Rate Notes may be issued in book-entry form.

ISSUANCE:                   On any date of settlement (as defined
                            under "Settlement" below) for one or more
                            Book-Entry Notes, the Issuer will issue a
                            single global security in fully registered
                            form without coupons (a "Global Security")
                            representing up to $400,000,000 principal
                            amount of all such Notes that have the
                            same maturity date, redemption provisions,
                            if any, repayment provisions, if any,

                            Interest Reset Dates (as such terms are
                            defined in the applicable Prospectus
                            Supplement), interest reset period,
                            original issue date and original issue
                            discount provisions, in each case, to the
                            extent applicable (collectively, the
                            "Terms").  Each Global Security will be
                            dated and issued as of the date of its
                            authentication by the Trustee.  Each
                            Global Security will bear an "Issue Date",
                            which will be (i) with respect to an
                            original Global Security (or any portion
                            thereof), its original issue date, and
                            (ii) following a consolidation of Global
                            Securities, the most recent Interest
                            Payment Date to which interest has been
                            paid or duly provided for on the
                            predecessor Global Securities, regardless
                            of the date of authentication of such
                            subsequently issued Global Security.  No
                            Global Security will represent any
                            Certificated Note.

IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS:     The Issuer will arrange with the CUSIP
                            Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's
                            Corporation (the "CUSIP Service Bureau")
                            for the reservation of a series of CUSIP
                            numbers, consisting of approximately 50
                            CUSIP numbers relating to Global

                            Securities representing Book-Entry Notes.
                            The Issuer will obtain from the CUSIP
                            Service Bureau a written list of such
                            series of reserved CUSIP numbers and will
                            deliver to the Trustee and DTC a written
                            list of CUSIP numbers of such series.  The
                            Trustee will assign CUSIP numbers to
                            Global Securities as described below under
                            Settlement Procedure "C".  DTC will notify
                            the CUSIP Service Bureau periodically of
                            the CUSIP numbers that the Trustee has
                            assigned to Global Securities.  The
                            Trustee will notify the Issuer at any time
                            when fewer than 25 of the reserved CUSIP
                            numbers remain unassigned to Global
                            Securities, and if it deems necessary, the
                            Issuer will reserve additional CUSIP
                            numbers for assignment to Global
                            Securities representing Book-Entry Notes.
                            Upon obtaining such additional CUSIP
                            numbers, the Issuer shall deliver a list
                            of such additional CUSIP numbers to the
                            Trustee and DTC.

                            the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for
                            DTC, on the Securities Register maintained
                            under the Indenture.  The beneficial owner

                            with the book-entry system maintained by
                            DTC, and DTC will record in book-entry

                            shall be attached to the Global Security
                            resulting from such consolidation)
                            specifying (i) the CUSIP numbers of two or
                            more Outstanding Global Securities that
                            represent Book-Entry Notes having the same
                            Terms (other than original issue date) and
                            for which interest has been paid to the
                            same date, (ii) a date, occurring at least
                            30 days after such written notice is
                            delivered and at least 30 days before the
                            next Interest Payment Date for such
                            Book-Entry Notes, on which such Global
                            Securities shall be exchanged for a single
                            replacement Global Security and (iii) a
                            new CUSIP number to be assigned to such
                            replacement Global Security.  Upon receipt
                            of such a notice, DTC will send to its
                            Participants (including the Trustee) a
                            written reorganization notice to the
                            effect that such exchange will occur on
                            such date.  Prior to the specified
                            exchange date, the Trustee will deliver to
                            the CUSIP Service Bureau a written notice
                            setting forth such exchange date and the
                            new CUSIP number and stating that, as of
                            such exchange date, the CUSIP numbers of
                            the Global Securities to be exchanged will
                            no longer be valid.  On the specified
                            exchange date, the Trustee will exchange
                            such Global Securities for a single Global
                            Security bearing the new CUSIP number and
                            a new original issue date and the CUSIP
                            numbers of the exchanged Global Securities

                            immediately reassigned.  Notwithstanding
                            the foregoing, if the Global Securities to
                            be exchanged exceed $400,000,000 in
                            aggregate principal amount, one Global

                            to represent each $400,000,000 of
                            principal amount of the exchanged Global
                            Securities and an additional Global
                            Security will be authenticated and issued
                            to represent any remaining principal
                            amount of such Global Securities (see
                            "Denominations" below).

                            if the repayment option expires before maturity, the
                            same information (except frequency) concerning the

                            the Letter with regard to redemptions and
                            repayments of the Notes.  If a Global
                            Security is to be redeemed or repaid in
                            part, the Trustee will exchange such
                            Global Security for two Global Securities,
                            one of which shall represent the portion
                            of the Global Security being redeemed or
                            repaid and shall be canceled immediately
                            after issuance and the other of which
                            shall represent the remaining portion of
                            such Global Security and shall bear the
                            CUSIP number of the surrendered Global
                            Security.

DENOMINATIONS:              Unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer
                            and the relevant Agent, Book-Entry Notes
                            will be issued in principal amounts of
                            $1,000 or any multiple thereof.  Global
                            Securities will be denominated in
                            principal amounts not in excess of
                            $400,000,000.  If one or more Book-Entry
                            Notes having an aggregate principal amount
                            in excess of $400,000,000 would, but for
                            the preceding sentence, be represented by
                            a single Global Security, then one Global
                            Security will be issued to represent each
                            $400,000,000 principal amount of such
                            Book-Entry Note or Notes and an additional
                            Global Security will be issued to
                            represent any remaining principal amount
                            of such Book-Entry Note or Notes.  In such
                            a case, each of the Global Securities
                            representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes
                            shall be assigned the same CUSIP number.

                            If a sale is to be settled two Business Days after
                            the sale date, Settlement Procedures "A", "B" and
                            "C" shall be completed as soon as practicable but no
                            later than 11:00 a.m., 12:00 noon and 2:00 p.m., as
                            the case may be, on the first Business Day after the
                            sale date.

                            If a sale is to be settled more than two Business
                            Days after the sale date, Settlement Procedure "A"
                            shall be completed as soon as practicable but no
                            later than 11:00 a.m. on the first Business Day
                            after the sale date and Settlement Procedures "B"
                            and "C" shall be completed as soon as practicable
                            but no later than 12:00 noon and 2:00 p.m., as the
                            case may be, on the second Business Day after the
                            sale date. If the initial interest rate for a
                            Floating Rate Book-Entry Note has not been
                            determined at the time that Settlement Procedure "A"
                            is completed, Settlement Procedures "B" and "C"
                            shall be completed as soon as such rate has been
                            determined but no later than 12:00 noon and 2:00

                            settlement date. Settlement Procedure "I" is subject
                            to extension in accordance with any extension of
                            Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other events
                            specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect
                            on the settlement date.

                            If settlement of a Book-Entry Note is rescheduled or
                            canceled, the Trustee, upon receipt of notice, will
                            deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant Terminal
                            System, a cancellation message to such effect by no

<PAGE>

                            later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately
                            preceding the scheduled settlement date.

FAILURE TO SETTLE:          If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS
                            deliver order with respect to a Book-Entry
                            Note pursuant to Settlement Procedure "G",
                            the Trustee may deliver to DTC, through
                            DTC's Participant Terminal System, as soon
                            as practicable, a withdrawal message
                            instructing DTC to debit such Note to the
                            Trustee's participant account.  DTC will
                            process the withdrawal message, provided
                            that the Trustee's participant account
                            contains a principal amount of the Global
                            Security representing such Note that is at
                            least equal to the principal amount to be
                            debited.  If a withdrawal message is
                            processed with respect to all the
                            Book-Entry Notes represented by a Global
                            Security, the Trustee will mark such Global
                            Security "canceled", make appropriate
                            entries in its records and send such
                            canceled Global Security to the Issuer.
                            The cusip number assigned to such Global
                            Security shall, in accordance with CUSIP
                            Service Bureau procedures, be canceled and
                            not immediately reassigned.  If a
                            withdrawal message is processed with
                            respect to one or more, but not all, the
                            Book-Entry Notes represented by a Global
                            Security, the Trustee will exchange such
                            Global Security for two Global Securities,
                            one of which shall represent such
                            Book-Entry Note or Notes and shall be
                            canceled immediately after issuance and the
                            other of which shall represent the
                            remaining Book-Entry Notes previously
                            represented by the surrendered Global
                            Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of
                            the surrendered Global Security.

                            If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Note is not
                            timely paid to the Participants with respect to such
                            Note by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a
                            Person, including an indirect participant in DTC,
                            acting on behalf of such purchaser), such
                            Participants and, in turn, the Presenting Agent may
                            enter SDFS deliver orders through DTC's Participant
                            Terminal System reversing the orders entered
                            pursuant to Settlement Procedures "H" and "G",
                            respectively. Thereafter, the Trustee will deliver
                            the withdrawal message and take the applicable
                            related actions described in the

<PAGE>

                            preceding paragraph. If such failure shall have
                            occurred for any reason other than the failure of
                            the Presenting Agent to provide the Purchase
                            Information to the Issuer or to provide a
                            confirmation to the purchaser, the Issuer will
                            reimburse the Presenting Agent on an equitable basis
                            for its loss of the use of funds during the period
                            when they were credited to the account of the
                            Issuer.

                            Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to
                            settle with respect to a Book-Entry Note, DTC may
                            take any actions in accordance with its SDFS
                            operating procedures then in effect. In the event of
                            a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but
                            not all, the Book-Entry Notes to have been
                            represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will
                            provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedure
                            "E", for the authentication and issuance of a Global
                            Security representing the other Book-Entry Notes to
                            have been represented by such Global Security and
                            will make appropriate entries in its records.
