                    IBM ANNOUNCES SECOND-QUARTER 2000 RESULTS
                  2Q00 EPS increased 16%, excluding 1999 items


     ARMONK, N.Y., July 19, 2000 . . . IBM today announced second-quarter 2000
diluted earnings per common share of $1.06 compared with 1999 diluted earnings
per common share of $1.28 (or $.91 per diluted share in 1999 after excluding the
net benefit of $.37 per diluted share from the gain on the sale of the Global
Network and other 1999 actions). Excluding these 1999 items, IBM's
second-quarter 2000 diluted earnings per share increased 16 percent.
Second-quarter 2000 net income totaled $1.9 billion compared with $2.4 billion
in 1999 (or net income of $1.7 billion in 1999 after excluding the after-tax net
benefit of $687 million from the gain on the Global Network sale and the other
1999 actions). Second-quarter 2000 revenues declined 1 percent (flat at constant
currency) to $21.7 billion compared with the year-earlier period.

     Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., IBM chairman and chief executive officer, said:
"Our second-quarter results are right in line with our expectations and with the
view we've been expressing since last October. Essentially, we've had three
quarters of slow revenue growth, driven by a combination of the Y2K slowdown and
a series of actions we've taken to improve our business portfolio. During that
time, however, we have been able to produce satisfactory earnings growth.

     "We exited the second quarter with a significant shift in momentum in
several areas. Mid-way through the second quarter, for example, our services
business re-ignited. New signings in the quarter totaled $20 billion -- a record
quarter for IBM and what would have been a record year for many of our nearest
competitors. Driven by our leadership position in e-business, a number of our
product areas also experienced explosive growth, including Web management
software, e-business consulting, Web hosting, systems integration and wireless
chips. Importantly, we saw a firming of our server business, particularly Web
servers -- which grew revenues nearly 30 percent. Our high-end disk drive
revenues, led by our advanced Shark product, also grew 30 percent.

     "In a portfolio of our breadth and size, we often have units in
transition," Mr. Gerstner said. "Our hard disk drive business, while improving
quarter to quarter, is still a drag on our revenue growth. PCs, as well,
improved quarter to quarter, but we're not satisfied with the results.
Nevertheless, our outlook going forward is quite different from the one we faced
in the last three quarters, and we continue to be very encouraged about the
second half of this year."

     Second-quarter revenues from the Americas totaled $9.7 billion, a decrease
of 3 percent (3 percent at constant currency) compared with the same period of
last year. Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were $5.9 billion, down 9
percent (flat at constant currency). Asia-Pacific revenues grew 20 percent (13
percent at constant currency) to $4.3 billion. OEM revenues totaled $1.8
billion, a 6 percent decrease (7 percent at constant currency) compared with the
second quarter of 1999.

     Hardware revenues were $9.2 billion in the second quarter, a decrease of 5
percent (4 percent at constant currency) compared with last year's second
quarter. Web server revenues, led by advanced new high-end and mid-range models,
grew strongly. System/390 and AS/400 server revenues declined, primarily due to
year-over-year price reductions in the System/390 and a product transition in
the AS/400 line. Personal computer revenues declined, partly as a result of
parts shortages in certain product segments. Microelectronics
<PAGE>

revenues rose substantially in the quarter due to strong shipments of custom
chips. Storage revenues declined, largely because of an ongoing transition in
the company's hard disk drive product line.

     Revenues from IBM Global Services, including maintenance, grew 2 percent (4
percent at constant currency) in the second quarter to $8.2 billion. Excluding
maintenance, Global Services revenues increased 3 percent (4 percent at constant
currency) to $6.9 billion. Revenue comparisons for IBM Global Services were
adversely affected by the sale of the Global Network to AT&T in 1999 and by a
year-over-year decline in Y2K services business. After adjusting for these
factors, Global Services revenues (excluding maintenance) increased 10 percent.
IBM concluded the quarter with a total services contract backlog of
approximately $75 billion.

     Software revenues increased 2 percent (5 percent at constant currency) in
the second quarter to $3.2 billion. Revenues from the company's middleware
products -- which are used for e-business -- grew strongly, especially in Web
management and database software. During the quarter, IBM announced that it
would invest more than $1 billion over the next several years to expand
development, marketing and sales programs for its leading Web management
product, WebSphere. Overall operating systems revenues declined in the quarter,
primarily as a result of a decrease in AS/400 software revenues.

     Revenues from Global Financing increased 10 percent (11 percent at constant
currency) in the second quarter to $819 million.

     Revenues from the Enterprise Investments/Other area, which includes custom
hardware and software products for specialized customer uses, decreased 26
percent (25 percent at constant currency) year over year to $315 million.

     The company's overall gross profit margin was 36.7 percent in the second
quarter compared with 37.5 percent in the same period of 1999.

     Second-quarter expenses were $5.2 billion and the expense-to-revenue ratio
was 23.9 percent compared with 19.1 percent in the year earlier period (or 26.4
percent after excluding a 7.3-point improvement from the Global Network sale and
the other 1999 actions).

     IBM's tax rate in the second quarter was 30.0 percent compared with 40.8
percent in 1999 (or 30.0 percent after excluding 10.8 points due to the Global
Network sale and the other 1999 actions).

     IBM spent approximately $1.8 billion on common share repurchases in the
second quarter. The average number of basic common shares outstanding in the
quarter was 1,768 million compared with 1,812 million in the second quarter of
1999. There were 1,761 million basic common shares outstanding at June 30, 2000.

     Debt in support of operations, excluding global financing, increased $932
million from year-end 1999 to $2.5 billion, resulting in a
debt-to-capitalization ratio of 15 percent. Global financing debt declined $112
million from the end of 1999 to a total of $26.7 billion, resulting in a
debt-to-equity ratio of 5.7 to 1.

     Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2000 was $3.5 billion, or
$1.89 per diluted common share, compared with net income in 1999 of $3.9
billion, or $2.05 per diluted common share (or $1.69 per diluted share and net
income of $3.2 billion in 1999 after excluding the after-tax net benefit from
the Global Network sale and the other 1999 actions). Revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 2000 were $41.0 billion, a decrease of 3 percent (2 percent at
constant currency) compared with $42.2 billion for the first six months of 1999.

     Effective in the first quarter of this year, results reflect changes the
company made in the organization of its business segments, including the
transfer of the system-level product businesses from the Technology segment to
the Enterprise Systems segment and the transfer of point-of-sale products from
the
<PAGE>

Enterprise Investments segment to the Personal Systems segment. Also reflected
are changes the company made in its expense allocation methodology, allocating
expense items previously unallocated and enhancing shared expense allocation.
Second-quarter and first-half 1999 results have been reclassified to conform
with the 2000 presentation.
