                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
 
    IBM is in the business of providing customer solutions through the use of
advanced information technologies. The company operates primarily in the single
industry segment that creates value by offering a variety of solutions that
include, either singularly or in some combination, services, software, systems,
financing and technologies. The company provides these solutions to its
customers worldwide through sales and professional services units in North
America, Europe/Middle East/Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.
 
    The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future
revenues due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume
of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product
delivery schedules. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is
not material to an understanding of its business.
 
    IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its products.
Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others
under reasonable terms and conditions. IBM believes its business as a whole is
not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license, or any
particular group of patents or licenses.
 
    The following information is included in IBM's 1995 Annual Report to
Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:
 
       1. Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or
          services--Pages 75 and 76.
 
       2. Financial information by geographic areas--Pages 77 and 78.
 
       3. Amount spent during each of the last three years on research and
          development activities--Page 61.
 
       4. Financial information regarding environmental activities--Pages 62 and
          63.
 
       5. The number of persons employed by the registrant--Page 49.
 
       6. The management discussion overview--Page 36.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES:
 
    At December 31, 1995, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the
United States had aggregate floor space of 52.4 million square feet, of which
42.8 million was owned and 9.6 million was leased. Of these amounts, 9.7 million
square feet was vacant and 1.5 million square feet was being leased to non-IBM
businesses. Similar facilities in 17 other countries totaled 16.0 million square
feet, of which 12.8 million was owned and 3.2 million was leased. Of these
amounts, .8 million square feet was vacant and .5 million square feet was being
leased to non-IBM businesses.
 
    Although improved production techniques, productivity gains, and
restructuring actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space,
continuous upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological
leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand. For additional
information on expenditures for plant, rental machines, and other property,
refer to "Investments" on page 44 of IBM's 1995 Annual Report to Stockholders
which is incorporated herein by reference.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON
                          FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE
 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our report
dated January 19, 1996 (which refers to the change in the method of accounting
for postemployment benefits in 1993), appearing on page 35 of the 1995 Annual
Report to Stockholders of International Business Machines Corporation, (which
report and consolidated financial statements are incorporated by reference in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included an audit of the Financial
Statement Schedule listed in Item 14(a)2 of this Form 10-K. In our opinion, this
Financial Statement Schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements.

(A) Includes additions charged to costs and expenses less accounts written off
    and translation adjustments.
 
Note--
    The receivables upon which the above allowances are based are highly
diversified by geography, industry, and individual customer. With the growth of
the company's working capital financing business in 1995 and 1994, the
concentration of such financings for certain large dealers and remarketers of
information industry products has become more significant. The allowances for
receivable losses for the year ended 1995, approximate less than three and
one-half percent of the company's current receivables and one and one-half
percent of the company's non-current receivables. The allowances for the year
ended 1994, approximate less than three and one-quarter percent of the company's
current receivables and less than one and one-half percent of the company's non-
current receivables. The allowances for the year ended 1993, approximate less
than three and one-half percent of the company's current receivables and less
than two percent of the company's non-current receivables.

* In 1993, 1992, and 1991, incremental shares under stock plans and the effect
  of the convertible debentures and bonds were not considered for the fully
  diluted earnings per share calculation due to their antidilutive effect. As
  such, the amounts reported for primary and fully diluted earnings per share
  are the same.

 (1)  Earnings before income taxes and changes in accounting principle excludes the company's
      share in the income and losses of less-than-fifty percent-owned affiliates.
 (2)  Restated for AICPA Statement of Position, "Software Revenue Recognition."
 (3)  The company reported preferred stock dividends and transaction costs of $62 million for
      the year ended December 31, 1995. Excluded from the ratio computation are transaction
      costs of $42 million relating to the repurchase of Series A 7 1/2 percent preferred
      stock depositary shares. Included are preferred stock dividends of $20 million, or $37
      million representing the pre-tax earnings which would be required to cover such
      dividend requirements based on IBM's effective income tax rate. For the years ended
      December 31, 1994 and 1993, preferred stock dividends are also on a pre-tax basis.
 (A)  No ratios are shown for these periods as earnings were insufficient to cover fixed
      charges and combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends. As a result of the
      net loss incurred for the year ended December 31, 1993 earnings were inadequate to
      cover fixed charges and combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends by $8,478
      million and $8,525 million, respectively. As a result of the net loss incurred for the
      year ended December 31, 1992, earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by $8,962
      million.

    A supplemental Consolidated Statement of Operations schedule has been
provided for informational purposes only, to exclude the effects of the pre-tax
charge of $663 million which covered work force and asset reductions ($626
million) and a software writedown ($37 million), as well as a pre-tax gain of
$175 million due to settlement of certain contractual obligations resulting from
the 1994 sale of the Federal Systems Company (FSC) recorded in the fourth
quarter of 1995. The 1995 results also exclude the effects of the third quarter
charge of $1,840 million associated with the Lotus Development Corp.

in software amortization periods adopted in the first quarter of 1994. This
supplemental statement is shown in Exhibit V(a).
 
    The Lotus Development Corp. charge is discussed on pages 47 to 48 of IBM's

constitute presence at a meeting of the Executive Committee. The members of
the Executive Committee shall act only as a committee and individual
members shall have no power as such.

  SECTION 5.  Other Committees.  The Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, designate members of the Board to constitute other
committees, which shall have, and may exercise, such powers as the Board

committee may determine its action and its quorum requirements and may fix
the time and place of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise
provide. Participating in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or
similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the
meeting to hear each other shall constitute presence at a meeting of such
other committees.

committee, in the event of a major disaster or catastrophe or national
emergency which renders the Board incapable of action by reason of the
death, physical incapacity or inability to meet of some or all of its
members, shall have, and may exercise all the powers of the Board in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation (including,
without limitation, the power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it and the power to fill
vacancies in the Board). An act of such committee taken within the scope of
its authority shall be an act of the Board.

Board, at any time to change or remove the members of, to fill vacancies
in, and to discharge any committee created pursuant to these By-laws,

such notice or at any later time specified therein; and, unless otherwise
specified therein, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to

death, resignation, an increase in the number of committee members or any
other cause, shall be filled by the Board in the manner prescribed in these

  SECTION 1.  Execution of Contracts.  Except as otherwise required by law
or these By-laws, any contract or other instrument may be executed and
delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by any officer
(including any assistant officer) of the Corporation. The Board or the
Executive Committee may authorize any agent or employee to execute and
deliver any contract or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the
Corporation, and such authority may be general or confined to specific
instances as the Board or such Committee, as the case may be, may by
resolution determine.

  SECTION 2.  Loans.  Unless the Board shall otherwise determine, the
Chairman of the Board or a Vice Chairman of the Board or the President or

Board or the Executive Committee may from time to time designate or as may

whether civil or criminal (including an action or proceeding by or in the
right of the Corporation or any other corporation of any type or kind,
domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, for which any director or officer of the

was a director or officer of the Corporation, or served such other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise in any capacity, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in
settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees actually and
necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, or any
appeal therein. Such indemnification shall be a contract right and shall
include the right to be paid advances of any expenses incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, consistent with
the provisions of applicable law in effect at any time. Indemnification
shall be deemed to be 'permitted' within the meaning of the first sentence
hereof if it is not expressly prohibited by applicable law as in effect at
the time.

                                     SHARES

  SECTION 1.  Stock Certificates.  The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, or shall be uncertificated shares.  Each owner
of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, in
such form as shall be approved by the Board, certifying the number of
shares of stock of the Corporation owned.  To the extent that shares are
represented by certificates, such certificates of stock shall be signed in
























<PAGE>

of the Board or the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary and
sealed with the seal of the Corporation (which seal may be a facsimile,
engraved or printed); provided, however, that where any such certificate is
signed by a registrar, other than the Corporation or its employee, the
signatures of the Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, the
President, the Secretary, and transfer agent or a transfer clerk acting on
behalf of the Corporation upon such certificates may be facsimiles,
engraved or printed. In case any officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk
acting on behalf of the Corporation ceases to be such officer, transfer
agent, or transfer clerk before such certificates shall be issued, they may
nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if they
were still such officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk at the date of
their issue.

  SECTION 2.  Books of Account and Record of Stockholders.  There shall be
kept at the office of the Corporation correct books of account of all its
business and transactions, minutes of the proceedings of stockholders,
Board, and Executive Committee, and a book to be known as the record of
stockholders, containing the names and addresses of all persons who are
stockholders, the number of shares of stock held, and the date when the
stockholder became the owner of record thereof.

  SECTION 3.  Transfers of Stock.  Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made on the record of stockholders of the Corporation
only upon authorization by the registered holder thereof, or by an attorney
thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the
Secretary or with a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and on surrender of
the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed, provided
such shares are represented by a certificate, or accompanied by a duly
executed stock transfer power and the payment of all taxes thereon.
The person in whose name shares of stock shall stand on the record of 
stockholders of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all 
purposes as regards the Corporation.  Whenever any transfers of shares shall be
made for collateral security and not absolutely and written notice thereof shall
be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent or transfer clerk, such 
fact shall be stated in the entry of the transfer.

  SECTION 4.  Regulations.  The Board may make such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-laws,
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificated or
uncertificated shares of stock of the Corporation.  It may appoint, or
authorize any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents
or one or more transfer clerks and one or more registrars and may require
all certificates of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of
them.

  SECTION 5.  Fixing of Record Date.  The Board shall fix a time not
exceeding fifty nor less than ten days prior to the date then fixed for the
holding of any meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on
which the consent or dissent of the stockholders may be effectively
expressed for any purpose without a meeting, as the time as of which the
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or whose
consent or dissent is required or may be expressed for any purpose, as the
case may be, shall be determined, and all persons who were holders of
record of voting stock at such time, and no others, shall be entitled to
notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent, as the case may be.  The Board may fix a time not exceeding fifty
days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making
of any distribution or the allotment of rights to subscribe for securities


<PAGE>

of the Corporation, or for the delivery of evidences of rights or evidences
of interests arising out of any change, conversion or exchange of capital
stock or other securities, as the record date for the determination of the
stockholders entitled to receive any such dividend, distribution,
allotment, rights or interests, and in such case only the stockholders of
record at the time so fixed shall be entitled to receive such dividend,
distribution, allotment, rights or interests.

  SECTION 6.  Lost, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates.  The holder of any
certificate representing shares of stock of the Corporation shall
immediately notify the Corporation of any loss, destruction or mutilation
of such certificate, and the Corporation may issue a new certificate of
stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it which the
owner thereof shall allege to have been lost or destroyed or which shall
have been mutilated, and the Corporation may, in its discretion, require
such owner or the owner's legal representatives to give to the Corporation
a bond in such sum, limited or unlimited, and in such form and with such
surety or sureties as the Board in its absolute discretion shall determine,
to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it
on account of the alleged loss or destruction of any such certificate, or
the issuance of such new certificate. Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Corporation, in its absolute discretion, may refuse to
issue any such new certificate, except pursuant to legal proceedings under
the laws of the State of New York.

  SECTION 7.  Inspection of Records.  The record of stockholders and
minutes of the proceedings of stockholders shall be available for
inspection, within the limits and subject to the conditions and
restrictions prescribed by applicable law.

  SECTION 8.  Auditors.  The Board shall employ an independent public or
certified public accountant or firm of such accountants who shall act as
auditors in making examinations of the consolidated financial statements of
the Corporation and its subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. The auditors shall certify that the annual financial
statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and shall report on such financial statements to the
stockholders and directors of the Corporation. The Board's selection of
auditors shall be presented for ratification by the stockholders at the
annual meeting. Directors and officers, when acting in good faith, may rely
upon financial statements of the Corporation represented to them to be
correct by the officer of the Corporation having charge of its books of
account, or stated in a written report by the auditors fairly to reflect
the financial condition of the Corporation.

  Whenever under the provisions of any law of the State of New York, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws or any resolution of the
Board or any committee thereof, the Corporation or the Board or any
committee thereof is authorized to take any action after notice to the
stockholders, directors or members of any such committee, or after the
lapse of a prescribed period of time, such action may be taken without
notice and without the lapse of any period of time, if, at any time before
or after such action shall be completed, such notice or lapse of time shall
be waived in writing by the person or persons entitled to said notice or
entitled to participate in the action to be taken, or, in the case of a
stockholder, by an attorney thereunto authorized. Attendance at a meeting
requiring notice by any person or, in the case of a stockholder, by the
stockholder's attorney, agent or proxy, shall constitute a waiver of such
notice on the part of the person so attending, or by such stockholder, as
the case may be.

the stockholders at any annual or special meeting, if the notice thereof
mentions that amendment or repeal or the adoption of new By-laws is one of
the purposes of such meeting. These By-laws, subject to the laws of the
State of New York, may also be amended or repealed or new By-laws may be
adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board given at any
meeting, if the notice thereof mentions that amendment or repeal or the
adoption of new By-laws is one of the purposes of such meeting; provided,
however, that if any By-law regulating an impending election of directors

                                              Effective Spring 1995,
                           except ARTICLE III(A)
        which became effective                                   January 1996.



                             IBM Board of Directors

                   Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan
                   -------------------------------------------


ARTICLE I.     Purpose
               -------

International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), has, pursuant to
resolutions adopted on February 28, 1995, amended and restated the Deferred
Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the "Plan") which was established by
resolutions of the Board adopted on July 27, 1993 to amend, restate and combine
the Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") and Restricted Equity Award Plan ("REAP")
of the Board of Directors, to enable members of the Board of Directors (the
"Board") who are not then IBM employees ("Outside Directors") to defer receipt
of compensation for the services of Outside Directors to later years and to
provide part of the compensation for the services of Outside Directors in a
promise to deliver shares of IBM Capital Stock ("Shares").


ARTICLE II.    Maintenance of Records
               ----------------------

IBM shall maintain two bookkeeping accounts for each Outside Director, a Cash
Account and a Promised Fee Shares Account, which shall be credited in accordance
with the terms of this Plan and the elections of each Outside Director pursuant
to this Plan.


ARTICLE III.   Payment and Deferral of Fees
               ----------------------------

     (a)  Payment in Deferred Shares; Amounts Accrued Under Retirement Plan
          -----------------------------------------------------------------

          Sixty percent of the annual retainer fees to be earned by each outside
          Director ("Fees") shall be payable in the form of a promise by IBM to
          deliver Shares ("Promised Fee Shares") pursuant to ARTICLE VI hereof. 
          The Payment of such Promised Fee Shares shall be deferred until the
          Outside Director ceases to be a member of the Board.

          Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Promised Fee
          Shares included in the Promised Fee Shares Accounts of the Outside
          Directors pursuant to the resolutions adopted by the Board on January
          30, 1996 with respect to the elimination of retirement payments to
          Outside Directors shall be payable solely in cash in accordance with
          the provisions of ARTICLE VI hereof.  The payment of such Promised Fee
          Shares shall be deferred until the Outside Director ceases to be a
          member of the Board (in accordance with Rule 16a-1(c)(3)). Payment
          shall be made at that time only to those Outside Directors who have
          served five or more years as a Board member, subject to the discretion
          of the Board.

     (b)  Eligibility and Election
          ------------------------

          Any Outside Director may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion
          of the remainder of the Fees to be earned by such Outside Director by
          indicating such election to the Secretary of IBM on an Election Form
          supplied by the Secretary ("Deferral Election").  The Outside
          Director's election must specify (i) the portion of such Fees to be
          deferred, (ii) the "Deferral Period" (a minimum of one "Election
          Term"), (iii) the choice of deferral in cash or Promised Fee Shares,
          pursuant to ARTICLE VI hereof, and (iv) the time(s) of payment or
          delivery.  Each Deferral Election is irrevocable with respect to the
          Fees payable for the Deferral Period to which it applies.

          "Deferral Period" shall mean, with respect to a Deferral Election, the
          period of Fee payments that are being deferred pursuant to such
          Deferral Election.

          "Election Term" shall mean the period beginning on the date an Outside
          Director is elected to the Board and ending on the date of the next
          succeeding Annual Meeting of IBM Stockholders.



<PAGE>



     (c)  Credit for Amounts Deferred
          ---------------------------

          (i)     The Cash Account will be credited with the amount of Fees
          accrued during a Deferral Period and deferred as cash (such credit to
          be made when such Fees become payable), plus interest at an annual
          rate equal to the average of the first 26-week Treasury Bill issued in
          January and July of each year, computed from the date such Fees would
          have been paid had they not been deferred.

          (ii)    The Promised Fee Shares Account will be credited with the
          number of Shares, including fractions, which could have been purchased
          had the amount of the Fees accrued during a Deferral Period and
          deferred as Promised Fee Shares been used to purchase Shares on the
          date such Fees would have been paid had they not been deferred, at a
          price equal to Fair Market Value on such date.

          (iii)   "Fair Market Value" shall be the average of the high and low
          prices of Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date in
          question, provided that if no sales of Shares were made on said
          Exchange on that date, the average of the high and low prices reported
          for the preceding day on which sales of Shares were made on said
          Exchange.

          (iv)    Promised Fee Shares do not have voting rights.

     (d)  Advance Notice of Election
          --------------------------

          Any Deferral Election with respect to Fees to be earned during an
          Election Term shall be delivered to the Secretary of IBM:

                    (i)  in the case of Fees deferred and to be recorded in the
               Cash Account, on or before the date 30 days prior to the first
               date of such Election Term or, with respect to a new Outside
               Director, before the first date of such Election Term; or

                    (ii) in the case of Fees deferred and to be recorded in the
               Promised Fee Shares Account, on or before the date six months
               prior to the first date of such Election Term or, with respect to
               a new Outside Director, before the first date of such Election
               Term.

               Each Outside Director that does not provide notice to the
               Secretary of a Deferral Election in accordance with the preceding
               sentence will be deemed to have elected to defer receipt of all
               Fees (other than Fees automatically deferred) in the form of
               Promised Fee Shares.  The Deferral Period for such deemed
               election shall be the period beginning on the date an Outside
               Director is elected to the Board and ending on the date on which
               such Outside Director ceases to be a member of the Board.

     (e)  Duration of Election
          --------------------

          A Deferral Election may be made annually for the succeeding Election
          Term or, at the Outside Director's direction, shall continue from
          Election Term to Election Term unless a written request to modify or
          terminate that election for subsequent Election Terms is submitted to
          the Secretary of IBM on or before the date six months prior to the
          first date of the first such subsequent Election Term, provided that
                                                                 --------
          such six-month period may be reduced to 30 days if neither the
          Deferral Election being modified or terminated nor the modified
          Deferral Election provides for a deferral of Fees as Promised Fee
          Shares during such first Election Term.

     (f)  Financial Hardship
          ------------------

          In the event that an Outside Director incurs a severe financial
          hardship, the Outside Director's deferral schedule with respect to his
          or her Cash Account or Promised Fee Shares Account shall be revised by
          the Board (or an authorized Committee of the Board) to the extent
          reasonably necessary to eliminate the severe financial hardship.  Such
          severe financial hardship must be caused by an accident, illness, or
          event beyond the control of the Outside Director.

     (g)  Conversion of DCP Elections
          ---------------------------

          Ongoing elections under the DCP to defer Fees as share units and/or
          cash shall be continued and converted to elections to defer Fees into
          a Promised Fee Shares Account and/or a Cash Account, respectively, 




<PAGE>



          under the Plan, except to the extent the Outside Director elects prior
          to July 27, 1993 to change such an election to defer Fees into share
          units into an election to defer Fees into the Cash Account.

     (h)  Conversion of Pre-Amendment Elections
          -------------------------------------

          Ongoing elections under the Plan prior to amendment shall continue
          under the Plan as amended, except to the extent the Outside Director
          elects within 30 days after the effective date of the amendment to the
          Plan to change such an election by written notice to the Secretary,
          which election shall be effective with respect to all Fees payable
          following the date such election is made.


ARTICLE IV.  Dividends, Distributions and Adjustments
             ----------------------------------------

Whenever a cash dividend or any other distribution is paid with respect to
Shares, the Promised Fee Shares Account of each Outside Director shall be
credited with an additional number of Promised Fee Shares, equal to the number
of Shares, including fractional Shares, that could have been purchased had such
dividend or other distribution been paid on each Promised Fee Share in the
Promised Fee Shares Account (on the record date for such dividend or
distribution) and the amount of such dividend or value of such other
distribution been used to acquire additional Shares at the Fair Market Value on
the date such dividend or other distribution is paid.  The value of any such
other distribution on or related to Shares shall, at the option of the Board (or
an authorized Committee of the Board), be either determined by the Board or
independently established.

The amount in the account of an Outside Director as of July 27, 1993 under the
DCP in units equivalent to a number of Shares (including fractions of Shares)
and payable in cash only ("units") shall be converted under the Plan as of
July 27, 1993 to an amount in the same number of Shares (including fractions of

Director's Promised Award Shares Account.

The number of Promised Award Shares in the Promised Award Shares Account of an

Delivery of amounts from the Cash Account and Shares from the Promised Fee
Shares Account will be made to an Outside Director in accordance with his or her
applicable Deferral Elections or, if no election applies, promptly after the
date on which the Outside Director ceases to be a member of the Board; provided,
                                                                       --------

In the event of an Outside Director's death, such Outside Director's estates or
beneficiary, as appropriate, shall be paid the amount credited to his or her
Cash Account and an amount equal to the Fair Market Value on the date of death

receive in lieu thereof a cash payment.  In the case of Shares to be delivered
pursuant to a Deferral Election, the cash payment shall be equal to the Fair
Market Value of the Shares on the delivery date specified in the Deferral
Election.  In the case of shares to be delivered promptly after the date on
which a Director ceases to be a member of the Board, the cash payment shall be
equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares of the first day after such date. 
In any case when Shares are to be delivered, a cash payment will be so made in
lieu of delivering a fractional share.


ARTICLE VII.   Source of Shares
               ----------------

45,000 Shares as of July 27, 1993, plus an additional 25,000 Shares as of May 1,
1994, and as of each May 1 thereafter, shall be reserved and authorized for
delivery under the Plan from time to time.  These Shares may be provided from
newly-issued or repurchased Shares.  If any change is made in the number of
Shares outstanding or in the rights of such outstanding Shares (such as by stock
split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification, recapitalization, merger
or similar event), the Board (or an authorized Committee of the Board) may make
such adjustments in the number of or rights relating to Shares authorized to be
delivered pursuant to the Plan as the Board (or such Committee) determines is
equitable to preserve the respective rights of the participants in the Plan. 
Shares forfeited under the Plan or settled in cash in lieu of delivery shall not
reduce the number of Shares authorized under the Plan and shall not be deemed to
have been delivered under the Plan; provided, that the number of Shares settled
                                    --------
in cash in lieu of delivery shall not exceed the cumulative number of Shares
authorized for delivery under the Plan (without deduction for Shares delivered).

subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
attachment, garnishment, lien, levy or like encumbrance.  No such amount shall
in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts or liability of any Outside
Director.  Prior to delivery of Shares by IBM pursuant to Article VI, no
director shall have any right to transfer or assign any Shares, or any right to
receive any Share, credited to him under this Plan.  Any purported assignment
shall be null and void.


ARTICLE IX.  Outside Director's Rights Unsecured
             -----------------------------------

The right of an Outside Director to receive any cash payment or Shares hereunder
shall rank as an unsecured claim against IBM.  Assets that may be set aside for

for, or be subject to any prior claim by, an Outside Director or beneficiary.


ARTICLE X.   Effective Date
             --------------

The Plan became effective on July 27, 1993.  The amendment of the Plan providing
for the payment of one half of the Fees payable to each Outside Director in the
form of Promised Fee Shares, as provided in Article III(a), shall apply
commencing with the July 1995 Fee payment date.  The amendment of the other
provisions of the Plan shall become effective when the IBM Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan is authorized by the stockholders of IBM and shall
apply to the next succeeding quarterly Fee payment.


ARTICLE XI.   Amendment and Termination
              -------------------------

The Board or any authorized Committee of the Board may at any time terminate,
and may at any time and from time to time and in any respect amend, the Plan for
any reason; provided that the Plan may not be amended more than once every six
            --------

      International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies









Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information
presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of
organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and
delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. We
believe this structure provides reasonable assurance that transactions are
executed in accordance with management authorization, and that they are
appropriately recorded, in order to permit preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to adequately
safeguard, verify and maintain accountability of assets. An important element of
the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program.

To assure the effective administration of internal control, we carefully select
and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and
procedures, provide appropriate communication channels, and foster an
environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that
it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance
with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct
Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are
distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal
programs to assure that they are understood and followed.

Price Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants, is retained to examine IBM's
financial statements. Its accompanying report is based on an examination
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including a
review of the internal control structure and tests of accounting procedures and
records.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of outside
directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent
accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder
approval. The Audit Committee meets periodically and privately with the
independent accountants, with our internal auditors, as well as with IBM
management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure and
financial reporting matters.

      International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies












To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of International Business Machines

Corporation:



In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, appearing on

pages 50 through 78, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial

position of International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries at

December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their cash

flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial

statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on

our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with

generally accepted auditing standards, which require that we plan and perform

the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements

are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,

evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by

management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We

believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed

above.



As discussed in the note on accounting changes on pages 55 and 56, the company

changed its method of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993. We concur

with this change.

      International Business machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies









Overview

IBM made significant progress during 1995 in implementing its fundamental
strategies of transforming its traditional businesses to position them for the
emerging network-centric computing market and rapidly expanding its newer,
high-growth businesses. As a result, the company reported record revenues, with
the best rate of revenue growth since 1984.

Overall, as advances in network technology continue to create new and powerful
applications for our customers, the demand for computing power remains high. In
1995, shipments of System/390* servers delivered 59 percent more power than in
the prior year. Revenues from servers grew 9.0 percent, reflecting the delivery
of significant price/performance improvements to our customers. 

Revenue growth continued to be strong for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
merchant-market semiconductors and low-end storage files. Personal systems
clients continued to show growth, in both personal computers and RISC
System/6000* products. While revenue from storage products continued to decline,
shipments of the RAMAC* II product in the fourth quarter of 1995 were strong.

The company's services offerings continued to show strong growth and are now the
second largest source of revenue, behind hardware sales. The services gross
profit margin remains lower than the company's hardware offerings.

The company's software revenues grew primarily as a result of the acquisition of
Lotus Development Corporation (Lotus), which is discussed further on pages 47
and 48. On July 5, 1995, the company acquired all outstanding shares of Lotus
for approximately $3.2 billion ($2.9 billion in net cash). The company considers
Lotus to be an applications-enabling software company engaged in high-growth
segments of the software market. It is believed that the acquisition of Lotus
provides the company with an opportunity to successfully advance workgroup
technology from local area network environments to enterprisewide environments.

While much progress has been made, IBM must continue its pace of change as it
focuses increasingly on revenue growth, introduction of new offerings in the
network-centric computing market, and aligning its cost and expense structure in
strategic solutions areas.

*1993 revenue was reduced for revenue associated with the Federal Systems
Company, which was sold in 1994.


The overall gross profit margin increased to 42.2 percent, a 2.7 point
improvement over 1994, following a 1.0 point improvement in 1994 over 1993. The
increases are primarily driven by improved margins in hardware sales resulting
from cost improvements across most major product lines. The gross profit margins
also continue to be affected by hardware pricing pressures and the company's
shift to services revenue, which has a lower gross profit margin than the

Worldwide revenue from hardware sales increased 10.1 percent from 1994,
following an increase of 5.7 percent in 1994 from 1993. Worldwide gross profit
dollars from hardware sales increased 24.4 percent from 1994, following an
increase of 11.6 percent in 1994 from 1993.

Revenue from servers increased 9.0 percent from 1994, following a 2.7 percent
decrease versus 1993.  The 1995 increase reflected higher revenue from AS/400*,
RISC System/6000 and POWERparallel* servers, as well as a slight increase in
System/390 server revenue. System/390 shipments measured in MIPS increased 59
percent and 41 percent in 1995 and 1994, respectively, while POWERparallel
shipments more than doubled in 1995 over 1994. Although System/390 revenue grew
in 1995, it continues to experience competitive pricing pressures. The 1994
decrease was primarily due to declines in System/390 revenue, resulting from
competitive pricing pressures, partially offset by AS/400 server revenue growth
in 1994 over 1993, as the new advanced series of servers showed strong growth.

Personal system clients revenue grew 15.1 percent from 1994, following a 17.7
percent increase in 1994 from 1993. These increases resulted from higher revenue
from personal computers and strong growth from RISC System/6000 clients.

Storage products revenue decreased 6.9 percent in 1995 from 1994, following a
decrease of 26.1 percent in 1994 from 1993. These declines were a result of
continuing price competition across most storage products. Although revenue
decreased in 1995 from 1994, fourth quarter shipments of the RAMAC II product
were strong.

OEM hardware revenue grew 38.2 percent in 1995 versus 1994, following a 151.2
percent increase in 1994 over 1993. These increases were primarily attributable
to increased sales of merchant-market semiconductors and low-end storage files. 

Information on revenue by classes of similar products or services is included in
note Y on pages 75 and 76. The product trends demonstrated in this discussion
and in that disclosure are indicative, in all material respects, of hardware
sales activity.

The increase in the 1995 hardware sales gross profit margin was driven by
System/390 servers due to the increased shipment of the new Complementary Metal
Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) servers. In addition, personal computer clients, RISC
System/6000 servers and OEM products showed improved gross profit margins in
1995 versus 1994. The increase in hardware sales gross profit margin in 1994
versus 1993 was primarily driven by cost improvements in System/390 servers,
offset by lower personal computer client margins. Although the overall hardware
sales margin has been increasing, it continues to be adversely impacted by
pricing pressures on System/390 servers, personal computer clients and storage
products.

Services revenue, excluding maintenance, increased 30.9 percent in 1995 from
1994. The 1994 results, on an as-reported basis, did not include operational
results from FSC, which were included in 1993 results. When adjusted for the
effects of the FSC sale, services revenue increased 27.0 percent in 1994 over
1993. These increases were primarily driven by strong growth in outsourcing of
systems and networks, consulting and systems integration activity. 

Services gross profit dollars, excluding maintenance, increased 37.4 percent in
1995 versus 1994, following an increase of 35.9 percent in 1994 over 1993.
Adjusted for the FSC sale, 1994 gross profit dollars increased 54.0 percent over
1993. The 1993 gross profit dollars were impacted by adjustments required on
certain older contracts that were not expected to be profitable. The 1993
services gross profit margin adjusted for the FSC activity, excluding
maintenance, was 16.5 percent.

Maintenance revenue increased 2.6 percent in 1995 from 1994, following a
decrease of 1.0 percent in 1994 from 1993.  Gross profit dollars increased 4.7
percent year over year, following a decrease of 4.4 percent in 1994 from 1993.
Maintenance revenue and gross profit dollar improvements were the results of
currency benefits in 1995. Maintenance revenue and gross profit margins continue
to be adversely affected by the competitive environment and resulting pricing
pressures on maintenance offerings, as well as, in 1995, a mix toward products
having lower profit margins. This trend is expected to continue.

Software revenue increased 11.6 percent in 1995 from 1994, following an increase
of 3.6 percent in 1994 from 1993. The increase in 1995 was primarily due to
revenue generated by products offered by Lotus, which was purchased on July 5,
1995, and whose results are included in the company's 1995 results. The increase
in 1994 was primarily due to higher one-time charge revenue associated with RISC
System/6000 placements.

Software gross profit dollars increased $1,563 million (23.4%) in 1995 from
1994, following an increase of $23 million (.3%) in 1994 from 1993. As the
company continues its efforts to deliver software solutions to satisfy its
customers needs, a number of changes have evolved which have the effect of
reducing cost levels.

In the normal course of business, the amounts spent for software products are
either charged to research, development and engineering expense or capitalized;
then subsequently amortized as cost over the product's useful life. As the
company continues to improve the pace at which new products are introduced in
the marketplace, an increased percentage of the spending is charged to expense,
resulting in a growth of research, development and engineering expense dollars
from year to year. Because a lesser percentage of the spending is capitalized,
the result is lower software capital additions from year to year ($.8 billion in
1995 and $1.4 billion in 1994). Also, in reaction to changes in the marketplace,
in 1994 the company reduced the amortization periods for its software products
to a maximum of four years. The combined effects of these changes have resulted
in lower software carrying values in the company's Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position ($2,419 million, $2,963 million and $3,703 million at
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively). In addition to reducing the
amount of costs to be amortized in future periods, these lower balances will
lessen the company's risk of impairment and write-offs of its software products
due to changes in the marketplace. The amounts written off were $344 million in
1995, $491 million in 1994 and $327 million in 1993.

While these changes have contributed to the growth in software gross profit in
1995, they were partially offset by higher vendor royalty costs as the company
continues to seek solutions for its customers from many sources.

The reduction in amortization periods, which was made in 1994, resulted in a
charge that year to software cost of $296 million. Excluding the effect of this
charge, gross profit dollars would have been $6,962 million and the gross profit
margin would have been 61.4 percent in 1994.

Rentals and financing revenue increased 3.9 percent from 1994, following a
decrease of 17.8 percent in 1994 from 1993. The growth in 1995 revenue was a
result of increases in new financing originations versus 1994. However, revenue
was down from 1993 as older leases (1993 and prior originations) continued to
expire. Rentals and financing gross profit dollars decreased 3.4 percent from
1994, following a decline of 15.9 percent in 1994 from 1993. These decreases
were a reflection of both declining volumes and rental prices on high-end
products over the past few years, as well as a changing country mix.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 5.3 percent from
1994, which followed a decrease of 12.9 percent in 1994 from 1993. The 1995
results included two special items: a $626 million charge for work force
separations and asset reductions and a one-time gain of $175 million due to the
settlement of certain contractual obligations resulting from the 1994 sale of
FSC. The 1994 results included the before-tax gain from the FSC sale ($382
million). Excluding these items, 1995 SG&A expense would have increased .1
percent, and the decrease in 1994 would have been 10.9 percent. In addition, the
1995 results included six months of amortization of goodwill and operating
expenses resulting from the acquisition of Lotus, which amounted to
approximately $471 million. Without the two special items and the Lotus
expenses, 1995 SG&A expense would have decreased 2.8 percent from 1994.  The
company continues to focus on productivity, reengineering, expense controls and
prioritization of spending in order to have competitive expense to revenue
levels.

Research, development and engineering expense increased 37.7 percent in 1995,
following a decrease of 21.5 percent in 1994 from 1993. The increase was a
result of a $1,840 million charge for purchased in-process research and
development in connection with the Lotus acquisition. Excluding this item,
research, development and engineering expense would have decreased 4.4 percent
in 1995. Additionally, changes in the software development process coupled with
an increased pace to market continued to reduce the software capitalization
rate, which increased charges to research, development and engineering expense
from period to period. The reductions in both years reflected the company's
continued focus on productivity and expense controls, which resulted in
elimination of redundant efforts and reprioritization of development activities
to such areas as network-centric computing, microprocessors, RISC technology,
networking, personal computers and desktop software.

Other Income/Interest Expense

Interest expense                               725        1,227        1,273

Other income, principally interest, was $.9 billion in 1995, a decrease of 31.3
percent from 1994, following an increase of 23.7 percent in 1994 over 1993. The
1995 decrease reflected the continuing impact of the switch to the Real currency
by Brazil effective July 1994 and generally lower levels of cash balances versus
1994. The 1994 increase reflected higher levels of available cash and higher
interest rates versus 1993. 

In July 1994, the Brazilian government converted to a new currency, the Real.
The new currency was part of the government's economic plan to reduce inflation
and stabilize the economy. This change had the effect of lowering the company's
interest income and interest expense, as well as the exchange gains and losses
associated with the local currency cash deposits and borrowings. Other income
and interest expense amounts decreased significantly during the second half of
1994 and all of 1995 when compared to prior periods.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was a charge of $3,635 million in 1995, $2,134
million in 1994 and a benefit of $810 million in 1993. The 1995 provision was
based on earnings before income taxes of $7,813 million, resulting in an
effective tax rate of 47 percent for 1995, as compared to the 1994 provision,
which was based on earnings of $5,155 million, resulting in an effective tax
rate of 41 percent. The higher rate in 1995 resulted from expensing the
purchased in-process research and development as part of the acquisition of
Lotus with no corresponding tax benefit. Without the effect of this item, the
tax rate would have been 38 percent.  The effective tax rate of (9) percent in
1993 was principally due to limited tax benefits on restructuring charges, along
with a high effective tax rate on earnings in certain non-U.S. operations.  

The company accounts for income taxes under SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," which provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of
such assets is more likely than not. In assessing the likelihood of realization,
management considered estimates of future taxable income. The total amount of
U.S. federal taxable income needed to realize U.S. federal deferred tax assets,
net of valuation allowances, is approximately $11.0 billion as compared to
approximately $14.0 billion in 1994 and $15.0 billion in 1993. In estimating the
amount of U.S. taxable income that may be available to the company to utilize as
many deferred tax assets as possible, the last two years' U.S. taxable income
was considered. This was approximately $4.8 billion (estimated income) in 1995
and a $549 million loss in 1994. In addition, consideration was given to the
impact of prior years' restructuring actions on the company's future taxable
income and to tax planning strategies related to research and development costs.


Fourth Quarter

For the quarter ended December 31, 1995, the company had revenue of $21.9
billion, a 10.2 percent increase over the same period of 1994. Net earnings in
the fourth quarter were $1,711 million ($3.09 per common share), compared to net
earnings of $1,230 million ($2.06 per common share) in the fourth quarter of
1994. In the fourth quarter of 1995, the company recorded a pretax charge of
$663 million to cover work force separation costs and asset reductions ($626
million) and a software write-down ($37 million). These charges were partially
offset by a one-time gain of $175 million from the settlement of certain
contractual obligations resulting

from the 1994 sale of FSC. The company's fourth-quarter 1995 net earnings would
have been approximately $2.0 billion, or $3.66 per common share, before these
special items.

Revenue increased in all but one geographic area in the fourth quarter. United
States revenue was $7.8 billion, an increase of 12.0 percent compared to the
fourth quarter a year ago. Revenue from 

Europe/Middle East/Africa rose 7.1 percent year over year to $8.1 billion, Asia
Pacific revenue grew 19.3 percent to $4.1 billion, and revenue from Canada rose
2.6 percent to $.8 billion. Latin America revenue declined 3.3 percent from the
same period of 1994 to $1.1 billion.

Currency had an approximately 2 percent favorable effect on revenue in the
fourth quarter.

Hardware sales revenue increased 7.9 percent to $11.5 billion, compared to the
same period of last year. Personal computer, RISC System/6000 and System/390
revenue increased. AS/400 revenue declined compared to the fourth quarter of
last year as a result of ongoing product transitions. Storage product revenue
also fell due to year-over-year price reductions.

Services revenue grew 24.8 percent over the previous year to $4.1 billion,
reflecting continued strength across the company's services categories,
including outsourcing of systems and networks, consulting, systems integration,
networking and availability services, and education.

Software revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 9.0 percent compared to the
fourth quarter of 1994. Maintenance revenue increased .9 percent year over year
to $1.8 billion, while revenue from rentals and financing revenue grew 6.3
percent to $916 million.

The total gross profit margin was 41.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared
to 40.6 percent in the same period of 1994. 

Total expenses, before the special items, rose slightly compared to last year's
fourth quarter, primarily due to goodwill amortization and operating expenses
related to Lotus, which was acquired on July 5, 1995.

Financial Condition

During 1995, the company took a number of actions that are reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 1995, including
expenditures of $5.7 billion for the repurchase of common and preferred capital
stock, $2.9 billion net cash payments for the acquisition of Lotus, and $2.1
billion in payments related to restructuring charges incurred in prior periods.

Working Capital

Current assets declined $.6 billion from year-end 1994, with a reduction in
total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.8 billion, offset
by increases in accounts receivable of $1.9 billion and prepaid expenses of $.3
billion. The decrease in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

resulted primarily from the stock repurchases, the acquisition of Lotus and
restructuring payments, offset by cash generated from operations. The increase
in accounts receivable reflected strong year-end business volumes.

Total current liabilities increased $2.4 billion from December 31, 1994, with
increases of $.9 billion in taxes payable and $2.0 billion in short-term debt,
offset by a net decrease of $.5 billion in other current liabilities (a decrease
in other accrued expenses and liabilities, and increases in accounts payable,
and compensation and benefits). The increase in taxes payable is due to
improvement in the company's operating results in certain geographies.
Short-term debt increased to support the growth in customer financing assets.
The decline in other accrued expenses and liabilities resulted from lower
restructuring accrual balances due to implementation of the company's
restructuring programs.

Investments

The company's capital expenditures for plant, rental machines and other property
were $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 1995, an increase of $1.6
billion from 1994. The increase reflects the company's continuing investment in
high-growth advanced technology areas such as microelectronics and in the
managing of customers' information technology as part of the company's rapidly
growing services business. 

In addition to software development expense included in research, development
and engineering expense, the company capitalized $.8 billion of software costs
during 1995, versus the $1.4 billion capitalized in 1994. Amortization of
capitalized software costs amounted to $1.6 billion for 1995, a decrease of $.5
billion from 1994 (which included $.3 billion in accelerated amortization
resulting from a software amortization change implemented in the first quarter
of 1994).

Investments and sundry assets were $20.6 billion at December 31, 1995, an
increase of $.5 billion from December 31, 1994, primarily the result of
increases in prepaid pension assets and the goodwill associated with the
acquisition of Lotus, offset by a decline in deferred tax assets. 

Debt and Equity

Total debt/total capitalization                  49.1%              48.6%

The ratio of total debt to total capitalization increased in 1995 primarily due
to the retirement of repurchased capital stock during the year; total debt
declined by $.5 billion due to the retirement of $1.0 billion of "core" debt,
offset by an increase of $.5 billion in debt to maintain a constant leverage in
customer financing.

Other non-current liabilities of $14.4 billion increased $.3 billion from
year-end 1994, principally due to increases in non-current postretirement
benefit liabilities and deferred income, offset by declines in restructuring
accrual balances.

The company has accrued for environmental matters, including estimated costs of
cleanup of Superfund sites, operating facilities, and restoration and monitoring
costs related to the closure of facilities. The company also has environmental
programs in place that include investment in state-of-the-art facilities for
environmental protection, as well as other programs to ensure compliance with
government regulations and the company's commitment to responsible environmental
practices. Environmental costs, including costs of complying with existing
environmental regulations, are not expected to materially affect the company's
financial position or results of operations in future periods. Further
discussion appears in note M on pages 62 and 63.

Stockholders' equity declined $1.0 billion from December 31, 1994, primarily as
a result of common and preferred stock repurchases, partially offset by the
company's net earnings from operating results. The repurchased shares were
retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued. 

Currency Rate Fluctuations

Approximately 90 percent of the company's non-U.S. business is conducted in
local currency environments. Currency rate variations had favorable effects on
revenue results of approximately 4 percent in 1995, 2 percent in 1994 and an
unfavorable impact of 3 percent in 1993. As worldwide currencies strengthen
versus the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies
translate into more U.S. dollars. Changes in net worth arising from these
currency fluctuations are accumulated in the translation adjustments component
of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 1995, the cumulative translation
adjustment was $3.0 billion, an increase of $.4 billion over 1994.

In high-inflation environments, like parts of Latin America, translation
adjustments are reflected in period income, as required by SFAS 52, "Foreign
Currency Translation." Generally, the company minimizes currency risk in these
countries by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and by financing
operations locally.

The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to minimize currency
risks related to customer financing transactions and the repatriation of
dividends and royalties. Further discussion on currency and hedging appears in
note X on pages 72 through 75.

Liquidity

In December 1993, the company entered into a $10. 0 billion committed global
credit facility as part of the company's ongoing efforts to ensure appropriate
levels of liquidity. As of December 31, 1995, $8.9 billion was unused and still
available. Further discussion appears in note V on page 72.

At year-end 1995, the company had a net balance of $1.2 billion in assets under
management from the securitization of lease and trade receivables. This amount
is $.6 billion lower than the 1994 year-end balance of $1.8 billion. Further
discussion appears in note W on page 72.

In April 1995, Duff & Phelps upgraded its credit ratings for IBM and its rated
subsidiaries' senior long-term debt to "A+" from "A" and its preferred stock
rating to "A" from "A-".

In August 1995, Moody's Investors Service upgraded its credit ratings on the
senior long-term debt of IBM and its rated subsidiaries to "A-1" from "A-3" and
on IBM's preferred stock to "A-1" from "Baa-1".

Fitch Investors Service, in December 1995, upgraded its credit ratings for IBM
and its rated subsidiaries' senior long-term debt to "A+" from "A", short-term
debt to "F-1+" from "F-1", and its preferred stock rating to "A" from "A-".

The following table summarizes the company's cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities as prescribed by Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP), and reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows on page 52:

                                          =========    =========    ========

Net cash provided from operating activities declined $1.1 billion from the 1994
period reflecting a decrease in cash flows due to net changes in operating
assets and liabilities (primarily customer financing receivables), offset by the
improvement in net earnings.

The $1.6 billion increase in funds used in investing activities from the 1994
period is attributable to the company's acquisition of Lotus in July 1995,
partially offset by net cash inflows from the sale of marketable securities
during 1995. In addition, the 1994 period reflects $1.5 billion in proceeds from
the sale of FSC.

Net cash used in financing activities for 1995 resulted principally from
implementation of the company's preferred and common stock repurchase programs,
offset by higher levels of short-term borrowings associated with customer
financing.

The company's "core" business involves the sales of information technology
products and services as distinct from its customer financing and certain other
activities. The company believes it is important to understand the different
dynamics of these two sectors. Therefore, the company has derived a model for
separately measuring cash flow of the "core" business. The model is not intended
to replace the GAAP cash flow, but is supplementary in nature. Under this model,
"core" cash flow from operations was approximately $7.1 billion in 1995,
excluding the Lotus acquisition. Operations, as defined in this model, includes
operating and investing activities, but excludes the impact of changes in
customer financing assets and net cash proceeds from securitization of trade
accounts receivable, which are viewed as financing in nature.

FINANCING RISKS

Customer financing is an integral part of the company's total worldwide
offerings. Financial results of customer financing can be found in note O on
pages 63 through 66. Inherent in customer financing are certain risks: credit,
interest rate, currency and residual value. The company manages credit risk
through comprehensive credit evaluations and pricing practices. To manage the
risks associated with an uncertain interest rate environment, the company
pursues a funding strategy of substantially matching the terms of its debt with
the terms of its assets. Currency risks are managed by denominating liabilities
in the same currency as the assets.

Residual value risk is managed by developing projections of future equipment
values at lease inception, reevaluating these projections periodically, and
effectively deploying remarketing capabilities to recover residual values and
potentially earn a profit. In 1995 and 1994, the remarketing effort generated
profits. The following table depicts an approximation of the unguaranteed
residual value maturities for the company's sales-type leases, as well as a
projection of net book value of operating leases at the end of the lease terms
as of December 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995. The following table excludes
approximately $50 million of estimated residual value associated with
non-information technology equipment.

Lotus Development Corporation
- -----------------------------

On July 5, 1995, the company acquired all outstanding shares of Lotus for
approximately $3.2 billion ($2.9 billion in net cash).

The company engaged a nationally recognized, independent appraisal firm to
express an opinion on the fair market value of the assets acquired to serve as a
basis for allocation of the purchase price to the various classes of assets. The
appraisal included both tangible and identifiable intangible assets, as well as
software technology. The company allocated the total purchase price as follows:

The tangible net assets consisted primarily of cash, accounts receivable, land,
buildings, leasehold improvements and other personal property. The identifiable
intangible assets consisted of trademarks ($369 million) and assembled work
force, employee agreements, and leasehold interests totaling $173 million. The
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill will be amortized on a straight-line
basis over a five-year period.

The software technology valuation was accomplished through the application of an
income approach. Projected debt-free income, revenue net of provision for
operating expenses, income taxes and returns on requisite assets were discounted
to a present value. This approach was used for each of the Lotus product lines.
Software technology was divided into two categories: current software products
and in-process research and development.

Current software products included: "Current products" representing products
currently in the marketplace as of the acquisition date and "In
development-complete" for products still in the development stage and
technologically feasible.

The fair market value of the purchased current software products was determined
to be $290 million. This amount was recorded as an asset and is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over two years.

Purchased in-process research and development included the value of software
products still in the development stage and not considered to have reached
technological feasibility stage.

As a result of the valuation, the fair market value of the purchased in-process
research and development was determined to be $1,840 million. In accordance with
applicable accounting rules, this amount was expensed upon acquisition in the
third quarter of 1995.

Federal Systems Company

The sale of FSC to Loral Corporation for $1.503 billion in cash had a closing
date of March 1, 1994, and was effective January 1, 1994. This transaction
resulted in an after-tax net gain of $248 million ($.43 per common share) in the
company's first-quarter 1994 results. The net gain reflected the impact of
certain contractual, employee postemployment, and other obligations, which
included amounts for the Advanced Automation System contract for the Federal
Aviation Administration. In the fourth quarter of 1995, the company recorded a
before-tax gain of $175 million due to the conclusion of those contractual
obligations between the company and Loral Corporation. Additionally, as a result
of this sale, approximately 10,000 people transferred to Loral, retired, or are
on a preretirement leave from the company. The company has concluded all its
contractual obligations related to this sale.

In 1993, FSC had, on a stand-alone basis, net earnings of $58 million on
revenues of $2.3 billion.

As of December 31, 1995, regular employees increased 5,508 from 1994 mainly due
to hiring in high-growth areas of the business and emerging markets, and to
acquisition of business entities, particularly Lotus. Some of these entities,
while less than wholly-owned, are consolidated into the company's financial
statements. The increase of employees in the less than wholly owned subsidiaries
category in 1995 is due primarily to MiCRUS, a newly formed U.S. subsidiary with
763 employees, and Technology Service Solutions, an existing U.S. subsidiary
with 7,717 employees, an increase of 2,797 employees over last year.

The company's complementary work force comprises equivalent full-time employees
hired under temporary, part-time and limited-term employment arrangements to
meet specific business needs in a flexible and cost-effective manner.


Looking Forward

The record revenue the company reported in 1995 is one indication that its
fundamental strategies are working. However, there are still many challenges
ahead. To remain the leader in translating advanced information technology into
value for customers, IBM must be at the forefront of change in the emerging
model for network-centric computing. This means constantly improving the
company's mix of offerings, continuing the focus on productivity and efficiency
improvements, and concentrating on the emerging growth areas around the world.
It means identifying solutions and quickly introducing them to the company's
portfolio; and sometimes adding business partners, as with the acquisition of
Lotus and the announced merger with Tivoli Systems - both leading software
companies, with products and technology that complement and strengthen IBM's
offerings. There is much opportunity ahead, and the company is prepared to seize
it.

A  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International
Business Machines Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiary companies.
Investments in business entities in which IBM does not have control, but has the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies
(generally 20 - 50 percent ownership), are accounted for by the equity method.
Other investments are accounted for by the cost method.


REVENUE

Revenue from hardware sales or sales-type leases is recognized when the product
is shipped. Revenue from one-time-charge licensed software is recognized when
the program is shipped with an appropriate deferral for post-contract customer
support. This deferral is earned over the support period. Revenue from monthly
software licenses is recognized as license fees accrue; from maintenance and
services over the contractual period or as the services are performed; from
rentals and operating leases, monthly as the fees accrue; and from financing at
level rates of return over the term of the lease or receivable. Revenue is
reduced for estimated customer returns and allowances.


SELLING EXPENSES

Selling expenses are charged against income as incurred.


INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes. Deferred
income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and
liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts
recognized for tax purposes. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," these deferred
taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws.


TRANSLATION OF NON-U.S. CURRENCY AMOUNTS

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency
environment are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income
and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during
the year. Translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of
stockholders' equity. Inventories and plant, rental machines and other
non-monetary assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that
operate in U.S. dollars, or whose economic environment is highly inflationary,
are translated at approximate exchange rates prevailing when acquired. All other
assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Inventories
charged to cost of sales and depreciation are translated at historical exchange
rates. All other income and expense items are translated at average rates of
exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses that result from
translation are included in earnings.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
      International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies


CASH EQUIVALENTS

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of
purchase are carried at fair value and considered to be cash equivalents.


INVENTORIES

Raw materials, work in process, and finished goods are stated at the lower of
average cost or market.


DEPRECIATION

Plant, rental machines and other property are carried at cost, and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.
      

SOFTWARE

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed programs are
expensed as research and development. Costs incurred subsequent to establishment
of technological feasibility to produce the finished product are capitalized.
The annual amortization of the capitalized amounts is the greater of the amount
computed based on the estimated revenue distribution over the products'
revenue-producing lives, or the straight-line method, and is applied over
periods ranging up to four years. Periodic reviews are performed to ensure that
unamortized program costs remain recoverable from future revenues. Costs to
support or service licensed programs are charged against income as incurred, or
when related revenue is recognized, whichever occurs first.

        
RETIREMENT PLANS AND NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Current service costs of retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and life
insurance benefits are accrued for in the period. Prior service costs resulting
from amendments to the plans are amortized over the average remaining service
period of employees expected to receive benefits.


GOODWILL

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the periods
estimated to be benefited, currently not exceeding five years.
       

COMMON STOCK

Common stock refers to the $1.25 par value capital stock, as designated in the
company's Certificate of Incorporation. Earnings (loss) per common share amounts
are computed by dividing earnings (loss) after deduction of preferred stock
dividends and transaction costs by the average number of common shares
outstanding in the period.

B  ACCOUNTING CHANGES

The company implemented new accounting standards in 1995, 1994 and 1993. None of
these standards had a material effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the company.

                                    55

      International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies


Effective January 1, 1995, the company implemented SFAS 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," and SFAS 118, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures." These standards
prescribe impairment measurements and reporting related to certain loans.

The company implemented SFAS 116, "Accounting for Contributions Received and
Contributions Made," effective January 1, 1995. This standard requires that
contributions made, including unconditional promises to give, be recognized as
expenses in the period made, at their fair values.

In 1995, the company implemented SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." This standard
prescribes the method for asset impairment evaluation for long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles that are either held and used or to be disposed
of. The company was generally in conformance with this standard prior to
adoption.

In 1995, the company adopted the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising Costs."
This SOP provides guidance on financial reporting of advertising costs in annual
financial statements. The company was generally in conformance with this SOP
prior to adoption.

Effective January 1, 1994, the company implemented SFAS 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." This standard addresses the
accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities.

Effective January 1, 1993, the company implemented SFAS 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." While the company was generally in
conformance with the standard prior to adoption, a charge was taken to recognize
the cost of certain benefits primarily related to healthcare for employees on
disability.

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123,
"Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," which is effective for 1996. Under
SFAS 123, companies can elect, but are not required, to recognize compensation
expense for all stock-based awards, using a fair value methodology. The company
expects to implement in 1996 the disclosure only provisions, as permitted by
SFAS 123.

C RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The company is a leader in the creation, development and manufacture of advanced
information technologies, including computer systems, software, networking
systems, storage devices and microelectronics. These advanced technologies are
translated into value for our customers worldwide through our sales and
professional services units in more than 150 countries. At December 31, 1995,
approximately 65 percent of the company's net assets were located outside the
United States, primarily in the major economically developed countries of Europe
and Asia, with the highest being approximately 15 percent in Japan. Additional
geographic information on the company's assets can be found in note AA on pages
77 and 78.

The diversity and breadth of the company's product and services offerings,
customers, and geographic operations mitigate significantly the risk that a
severe impact will occur in the near term as a result of changes in its customer
base, competition, sources of supply, or composition of its markets. As a
result, it is unlikely that any one event, such as loss of any individual
customer or supplier, entrance of new competitors into specific markets, or
decline in business conditions in particular markets would have a severe impact
on the company's operating results.

Management uses estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Significant estimates
include collectibility of accounts receivable, warranty costs, profitability on
long-term contracts, as well as recoverability of capitalized software costs,
long-term fixed assets and residual values. The company regularly assesses these
estimates and, while actual results may differ from these estimates, management
believes that material changes will not occur in the near term.

The estimated reversal periods for the largest deductible temporary differences
are: Retiree Medical - 1 to 30 years; Restructuring - 1 to 7 years.

The valuation allowance applies to U.S. federal tax credits, state and local net
deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards, and net operating
losses in certain foreign jurisdictions that may expire before the company can
utilize them. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended
December 31, 1995, was a decrease of $683 million, of which approximately $600
million was due to the realization of previously unrecognized benefits in the
current year. It is reasonably possible that the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance could decrease significantly in the near term, depending on the
company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in multiple tax
jurisdictions.

For tax return purposes, the company has available tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $2,866 million, of which $67 million expire in 1996, $776 million
expire in 1998, $692 million expire in 1999 and the remainder thereafter. The
company also has state and local, and foreign tax loss carryforwards, the tax
effect of which is $539 million. Most of these carryforwards are available for
ten or more years.

Undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries included in consolidated
retained earnings amounted to $12,565 million at December 31, 1995, $11,280
million at December 31, 1994 and $10,915 million at December 31, 1993. These
earnings, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted substantially
free of additional tax. Accordingly, no material provision has been made for
taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings, nor is it
practicable to determine the amount of this liability.

I ADVERTISING

The company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted
to $1,219 million, $977 million and $716 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

J RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING

Research, development and engineering expenses amounted to $6,010 million in
1995, $4,363 million in 1994 and $5,558 million in 1993. Expenditures for
product-related engineering included in these amounts were $783 million, $981
million and $1,127 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Expenditures of $5,227 million in 1995, $3,382 million in 1994 and $4,431
million in 1993 were made for research and development activities covering basic
scientific research and the application of scientific advances to the
development of new and improved products and their uses. Of these amounts,
software-related activities were $2,997 million, $793 million and $1,097 million
in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Included in the 1995 research, development and engineering expenses as part of
software-related activities was a $1,840 million charge for purchased in-process
research and development in connection with the acquisition of Lotus in July
1995.

K RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

In 1993 and 1992, the company recorded restructuring charges of $8.9 billion
before taxes ($8.0 billion after taxes or $14.02 per common share) and $11.6
billion before taxes ($8.3 billion after taxes or $14.51 per common share),
respectively, as part of restructuring programs to streamline and reduce
resources utilized in the business. As of December 31, 1995, the company had
utilized all of the restructuring reserve balances except $225 million, which is
necessary for actions that have been delayed into 1996.

Remaining cash outlays associated with work-force-related activities are
expected to total $2.0 billion, of which $.5 billion will be expended in 1996.
Remaining amounts relate to the pension plan curtailment portion of the charge
and other postretirement payments, which will be made as required for funding
appropriate pension and other postretirement benefits in future years. Cash
requirements related to excess space charges are expected to be expended as
follows: $413 million in 1996, $321 million in 1997, $282 million in 1998 and
$851 million in 1999 and beyond.

L INTEREST ON DEBT

Interest paid and accrued on borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries
amounted to $1,600 million in 1995, $2,006 million in 1994 and $2,298 million in
1993. Of these amounts, $23 million in 1995, $20 million in 1994 and $46 million
in 1993 were capitalized. The remainder was charged to cost of rentals and
financing, and interest expense. The lower levels of expense were a result of
lower average interest rates and a decrease of total debt outstanding of $.5
billion in 1995 versus 1994 and a decrease of total debt outstanding of $5.2
billion in 1994 versus 1993. The average interest rate for total debt was 7.2
percent, 8.0 percent and 7.7 percent in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
       
M OTHER LIABILITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL

Other liabilities consists principally of accruals for nonpension postretirement
benefits, indemnity and retirement plan reserves for non-U.S. employees, and
restructuring charges. More detailed discussions of these liabilities appear in
note U, "Nonpension Postretirement Benefits," on pages 70 through 72; note T,
"Retirement Plans," on pages 68 through 70; and note K, "Restructuring Actions,"
above.

In addition, the company continues to participate in environmental assessments
and cleanups at a number of locations, including operating facilities,
previously owned facilities, and Superfund sites. The company accrues for all
known environmental liabilities for remediation cost when a cleanup program
becomes probable and costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimated environmental
costs associated with post-closure activities, such as the removal and
restoration of chemical storage facilities and monitoring, are accrued when the
decision is made to close a facility. The amounts accrued, which are
undiscounted and do not reflect any insurance recoveries, were $223 million and
$179 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The increase in the
accrual relates to expected costs of post-closure activities and reassessment of
remediation activities at operating facilities.

The amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of
investigation where neither the company's percentage of responsibility nor the
extent of cleanup required has been identified. Also excluded is the cost of
internal environmental protection programs that are primarily preventive in

                                        62

nature. Estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially impact the
financial position or results of the company's operations in future periods.
However, environmental cleanup periods are protracted in length, and
environmental costs in future periods are subject to changes in environmental
remediation regulations.

N CONTINGENCIES

On February 25, 1993, a consolidated and amended class action complaint was
filed against the company in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging violations of Section 12 of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint
alleges, among other matters, that the company disseminated false and misleading
statements concerning its financial condition and dividends during certain
periods of 1992, as a result of which plaintiffs were injured in connection with
their purchases of IBM stock during the period of September 30, 1992, through
December 14, 1992. The plaintiffs seek money damages. The company believes it
has good defenses to the allegations raised in the consolidated complaint and
intends to defend itself vigorously. The company does not believe that the
ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material effect on its results of
operations or its financial position.

O CUSTOMER FINANCING

The primary focus of IBM's worldwide customer financing offerings is to support
customers in their acquisitions of the company's products and services. This
support is provided both by IBM and through its financing subsidiaries, the
results of which are presented in this note in a consistent manner.

The following schedules reflect the financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows for customer financing in comparison to the company's
consolidated results with customer financing results reflected on the equity
basis. This involves presenting within a single line item the investment and
related return from customer financing as reflected in the company's
consolidated financial statements. For the statement of financial position,
customer financing's assets net of related liabilities, and after elimination of
applicable intracompany transactions, are shown separately as a single line
item, investment in customer financing. Eliminations primarily pertain to
internal mark-ups to fair value on equipment held on operating leases, and the
normal elimination of intracompany payables and receivables. With respect to the
statement of operations, net earnings for customer financing before applicable
taxes and after elimination of related intracompany transactions, are included
in the line description, other income. For the statement of cash flows, certain
cash flow activities are reclassified to be consistent with the classification
of such activities reflected in the company's Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows. Such reclassifications primarily pertain to cash flow activity related to
financing receivables.

Because customer financing is different in nature from the company's
manufacturing, development and services businesses, management believes that the
aforementioned type of comparative disclosure enhances the understanding and
analysis of the consolidated financial statements.

Customer financing debt at December 31, 1995, consisted of borrowings with
external financial institutions of $15,418 million and intracompany borrowings
of $4,304 million. Intracompany borrowings are made pursuant to loan agreements
between the parties at market rates of interest.

Customer financing earnings yielded a return on average invested capital of 22.6
percent in 1995, compared to 24.5 percent in 1994. Included within these results
are intracompany services and fees received for tax benefits provided to the
company resulting from tax deferrals generated by financing transactions.

Such fees are eliminated from the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The 1994
earnings included income resulting from IBM Credit Corporation's litigation
settlement with Comdisco, Inc. and from IBM Credit Corporation's sale of IBM
Credit Investment Management Corporation.

The provision for income taxes for customer financing is based on the statutory
income tax rate of each country, calculated on a separate return basis.


P RENTAL EXPENSE AND LEASE COMMITMENTS

Rental expense, including amounts charged to inventories and fixed assets and
excluding amounts charged to restructuring, was $1,145 million in 1995, $1,276
million in 1994 and $1,686 million in 1993. The table below depicts gross
minimum rental commitments, under non-cancelable leases; amounts related to
vacant space, which the company had reserved for in restructuring charges and
other actions; and sublease income commitments. These amounts generally reflect
activities related to office space.

Q LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

Incentive awards are provided to officers and other key employees under the
terms of the IBM 1994 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), which was
approved by stockholders in April 1994. The Plan is administered by the
Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of
Directors. The committee determines the type and certain terms, including
vesting provisions of the award to be granted, which may include stock,
restricted stock, stock options, Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), cash, or any
combination thereof. The number of shares that may be issued under the Plan for
awards granted wholly or partly in stock during the five-year term of the Plan
is 29,105,600, which approximated 5 percent of the outstanding common stock as
determined on February 10, 1994. Prior to April 25, 1994, awards were issued
under the IBM 1989 Long-Term Performance Plan and the IBM 1986 and predecessor
Stock Option Plans.

Options allow the purchase of IBM's common stock at 100 percent of the market
price on the date of grant, and have a maximum duration of 10 years. Payment by
optionees upon exercise of an option may be made using IBM stock, as well as
cash.

SARs provide eligible employees the difference between the average IBM stock
price on the date of grant and the average market price of the stock on the date
of exercising the right. SARs can be issued in tandem or combination with
options, and payment can be made to the employee in cash and/or stock of
equivalent value, at the company's discretion. There were approximately 2.7
million SARs outstanding at December 31, 1995, that were issued in 1993 at
$46.31 in combination with options. Under the terms of the award, the SARs vest
over four years and expire in 2003.

In April 1993, the Nominating and Executive Compensation Committee, the
committee of the Board of Directors then responsible for administering the plan,
approved management's plan to allow optionees, other than executive officers, to
voluntarily forfeit all of their existing IBM stock options, granted from 1984
through 1992, in exchange for a fewer number of new stock option grants. Under
this program, 18,054,615 options, at average prices ranging from $66.94 to
$159.50, were terminated, and 7,405,090 new options, at a price of $47.88, were
granted subject to certain conditions for vesting and exercise.

The options exercised in 1995 and 1994 were at an average option price of $50.76
and $46.42 per share, respectively. There were no options exercised in 1993. The

R STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

The IBM Employees 1995 Stock Purchase Plan enables employees and selected
officers and executives to purchase full or fractional shares of IBM common
stock through payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation.
The price an employee pays is 85 percent of the average market price on the last
day of an applicable pay period.

During 1995, employees purchased 4,479,340 shares, all of which were treasury
shares, for which $344 million was paid to IBM. There were 23,312,881 reserved
unissued shares available for purchase under the plan at December 31, 1995.


S STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

During 1995, the IBM Board of Directors authorized the company to purchase up to
$7.5 billion of IBM common stock. The company repurchased 50,906,300 shares at a
cost of $4,864 million during 1995, which resulted in a reduction of $63,632,875
in the stated capital (par value) associated with common stock. No shares were
repurchased in 1994 or 1993. The repurchased shares were retired and restored to
the status of authorized but unissued shares. The company plans to purchase
shares on the open market from time to time, depending on market conditions.

Also during 1995, the IBM Board of Directors authorized the company to purchase
all of its outstanding Series A 7 1/2 percent preferred stock depositary shares.
The company repurchased 8,534,289 shares at a cost of $870 million during 1995,
which resulted in a reduction of $85,343 in the stated capital (par value)
associated with preferred stock. The repurchased shares were retired and
restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares. The company plans to
purchase remaining shares on the open market and in private transactions from
time to time, depending on market conditions.


T RETIREMENT PLANS

The company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit retirement plans covering
substantially all regular employees. The total cost of all plans for 1995, 1994
and 1993 was $165 million, $681 million and $1,525 million, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost of the U.S. retirement plan and selected non-U.S.
plans for the years ended December 31 included the following components:

Net periodic pension cost is determined using the Projected Unit Credit
actuarial method. Prior service cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over
the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits.
An assumption is made for modified career average plans such that the average
earnings base period will be updated to the years prior to retirement.

Termination incentive expenses in 1993 represented the cost of special
retirement benefits offered to employees for a short period of time in exchange
for voluntary termination of service. Curtailment losses reflect the significant
reductions in the expected years of future service caused by termination
programs and represent the immediate recognition of associated prior service
cost and a portion of previously unrecognized actuarial losses. In 1993, the
curtailment losses and termination charges, referred to above, were included in
restructuring charges.

In 1994, the company introduced a non-qualified U.S. Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (SERP) effective January 1, 1995, which will be phased in over
three years. The SERP, which is unfunded, provides eligible executives defined
pension benefits, outside the IBM Retirement Plan, based on average earnings,
years of service, and age at retirement. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the
projected benefit obligation was $82 million and $64 million, respectively. The
net unrecognized costs of the SERP were $64 million and $61 million, and the
amounts included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position were
pension liabilities of $18 million and $3 million as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, respectively. These amounts are in addition to the U.S. retirement plan
financial information included herein.

The table below provides information on the status of the U.S. retirement plan
and material non-U.S. plans.

The effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition from
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in computing pension expense and
prepaid pension cost or pension liability is mitigated by the delayed
recognition provisions of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," with
the exception of the effects of curtailments and early terminations, which are
recognized immediately.

The U.S. plan's projected benefit obligation increased in 1995 primarily as a
result of a change in the discount rate assumption, which increased the
projected benefit obligation $3,217 million.

It is the company's practice to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet the
minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and with
regard to local tax laws. Additional amounts are contributed from time to time
when deemed appropriate by the company. Liabilities for amounts in excess of
these funding levels are accrued and reported in the company's Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position. In July 1993, the Board of Directors authorized
the issuance of up to 15 million shares of IBM common stock to be contributed to
the IBMRetirement Plan Trust Fund through 1994. Through December 31, 1994, the
company contributed 6,500,000 shares to the fund. The assets of the various
plans include corporate equities, government securities, corporate debt
securities and income-producing real estate.

U.S. Plan: U.S. regular, full-time and part-time employees are covered by a
noncontributory plan which is funded by company contributions to an irrevocable
trust fund, which is held for the sole benefit of employees. In 1994, the
company announced major changes to the plan that took effect in 1995. Under a
new formula, which is being phased in over five years, retirement benefits will
be determined based on points accumulated for each year worked and final average
compensation. To preserve benefits of employees close to retirement, service and
earnings credit will continue to accrue under the current core formula through
the year 2000 and upon retirement, these employees will receive the benefit from
either the new or current formulas, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested
upon the completion of five years of service. The number of individuals
receiving benefits at December 31, 1995 and 1994, was 92,133 and 85,009,
respectively.

Non-U.S. Plans: Most subsidiaries and branches outside the United States have
retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees, under which funds
are deposited under various fiduciary-type arrangements, annuities are purchased
under group contracts, or reserves are provided. Retirement benefits are based
on years of service and the employee's compensation, generally during a fixed
number of years immediately prior to retirement. The ranges of assumptions used
for the non-U.S. plans reflect the different economic environments within the
various countries.


U NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The company and its U.S. subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans
that provide medical, dental and life insurance for retirees and eligible
dependents. Plan cost maximums for those who retired prior to January 1, 1992,
will take effect beginning with the year 2001. Plan cost maximums for all other
employees will take effect upon retirement.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application
of the terms of medical, dental and life insurance plans, including the effects
of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial
assumptions. These actuarial assumptions included a projected healthcare cost
trend rate of 6 percent.

The effect of a 1 percent annual increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend
rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 1995, by approximately $35 million; the 1995 annual costs would not
be materially affected.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for U.S. retirees for the years ended
December 31 included the following components:

In 1995, the increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of
$510 million resulted principally from the change in the assumed discount rate,
partially offset by a decrease in the projected healthcare cost trend rate and
plan cost experience.

It is the company's practice to fund amounts for postretirement benefits with an
independent trustee, as deemed appropriate from time to time. The plan assets
include corporate equities and government securities. The accounting for the
plan is based on the written plan.

Certain of the company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have similar plans for retirees.
However, most retirees outside the United States are covered by
government-sponsored and administered programs, and the obligations and cost of
these programs are not significant to the company.


V LINES OF CREDIT

In December 1993, as part of IBM's ongoing efforts toward greater efficiency of
its treasury activities, and to ensure appropriate liquidity levels, the company
entered into a $10.0 billion committed global credit facility. Unused committed
lines of credit from this global facility and other previously existing
committed and uncommitted lines of credit at December 31, 1995, were $14.6
billion, compared to $15.1 billion at December 31, 1994. Interest rates on
borrowings vary from country to country depending on local market conditions.


W SALE AND SECURITIZATION OF RECEIVABLES

The company received total cash proceeds of approximately $3.4 billion and $12.6
billion in 1995 and 1994, respectively, from the sale and securitization of
primarily trade receivables. At year-end 1995, the company had a net balance of
$1.2 billion in assets under management from the securitization of lease and
trade receivables, compared to $1.8 billion at year-end 1994. No material gain
or loss resulted from these transactions. Recourse amounts associated with the
aforementioned sales and securitization activities are expected to be minimal,
and adequate reserves are in place to cover potential losses.


X FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following presents information on certain significant on- and off-balance
sheet financial instruments, including derivatives.

In assessing the fair value of these financial instruments, both derivative and
non-derivative, the company has used a variety of methods and assumptions, which
were based on estimates of market conditions and risks existing at December 31,
1995 and 1994. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the same or similar
instrument were used for the majority of marketable securities, long-term
investments and long-term debt. Other techniques, such as option pricing models,
estimated discounted value of future cash flows, replacement cost and
termination cost, have been used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. These values represent a general approximation of
possible value and may never actually be realized.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON-BALANCE SHEET (EXCLUDING DERIVATIVES)

Financial  assets for  which carrying values approximate  fair value
include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, notes  and
other accounts receivable and other investments.

Financial  liabilities  for which  carrying values  approximate fair
value  include  accounts  payable and  other  accrued  expenses  and
liabilities,  as well  as  short-term debt.  The fair  value  of the
company's  long-term  debt  was  approximately  $10,100  million and
$12,000 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The  company originates  financing  for  customers in  a  variety of
industries throughout the world, and  has a diversified portfolio of
capital  equipment  financing  for end  users  and  working  capital
financing  for  dealers. With  the growth  of the  company's working
capital financing business, the concentration of such financings for
certain  large  dealers  and  remarketers  of  information  industry
products  has  become  more  significant. Such  loans  are typically
collateralized  by  the  inventory  and accounts  receivable  of the
dealers and remarketers. The company does not believe that this risk
will have  a material  adverse effect  on its financial  position or
results of operations.

The following table  summarizes the company's marketable  securities
and other investments,  all of  which  were considered available for
sale.

IBM  has  guaranteed  certain loans  and  financial  commitments  of
affiliates. The  fair market  values of  these financial  guarantees
were $794  million and $727  million at December 31,  1995 and 1994,
respectively.  Additionally, the company is contingently liable  for
commitments  of various  ventures to  which it  is a  party and  for
certain receivables sold with recourse. These commitments, which  in
the aggregate were approximately  $200 million and  $900 million  at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, are not expected to have a
material  adverse  effect  on  the company's  financial  position or
results of operations.

The company's dealers had  unused lines of credit available from IBM
for working capital financing of approximately $1.0 billion and  $.9
billion at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Bracketed amounts are liabilities.
**Reclassified to conform to 1995 presentation.
**The estimated fair value of derivatives both on- and off-balance 
  sheet at December 31, 1995 and 1994, consists of assets of $153 
  million and $448 million and liabilities of $273 million and $239 
  million, respectively.

In the  normal course of business, the company enters into a variety
of derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of
currency exchange rate and interest rate risk management. 

The majority of the company's derivative transactions relates to the
matching  of liabilities  to  assets associated  with its  worldwide
customer financing business. The company issues debt, using the most
efficient capital  markets  and products,  which  may  result  in  a
currency or interest rate mismatch. Interest rate  swaps or currency
swaps are  then used to match  the interest rates  and currencies of
its debt to the  related customer financing receivables. These  swap
contracts are principally one to five years in duration. The company
uses  an  internal  regional  center  to  manage  the  cash  of  its
subsidiaries.  This regional center principally  uses currency swaps
to  convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner, predominantly for
the  company's European  subsidiaries. The  terms  of the  swaps are
generally less than one year. 

Additionally, the company uses derivatives to limit its exposure  to
loss resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange  rates
on anticipated  cash transactions between  foreign subsidiaries  and
the  parent company.  The  company receives  significant  dividends,
intracompany royalties  and net payments for goods and services from
its non-U.S. subsidiaries. In anticipation of these foreign currency
flows, and given the volatility of the currency markets, the company
selectively employs foreign currency options to manage the  currency
risk. The  terms of  these instruments  are generally less  than one
year.

        Interest  and  currency rate  differentials accruing  under interest
        rate  and  currency  contracts related  to  the  customer  financing
        business are recognized  over the life of  the contracts in interest
        expense,  and  the  effects of  contracts  related  to  intracompany
        funding are  recognized over  the life  of the contract  in interest
        income. For purchased options  that hedge anticipated  transactions,
        gains and losses are deferred  and recognized in other income in the
        same  period that  the underlying transaction occurs  or expires. At
        December 31, 1995 and 1994, there were no material deferred gains or
        losses. The premiums associated with entering into option  contracts
        are  generally amortized over  the life  of the options and  are not
        material to the company's results. Unamortized premiums are included
        in prepaid assets. All written options  are marked to market monthly
        and are not material to the company's results.

        The company  has used  derivative instruments  as an element  of its
        risk management strategy for many years. Although derivatives entail
        a risk  of non-performance  by counterparties,  the company  manages
        this risk by establishing  explicit dollar and term limitations that
        correspond  to  the   credit  rating  of  each   carefully  selected
        counterparty.  The company  has not sustained  a material  loss from
        these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
        on its results of operations or financial position in the future.

        Y  SEGMENT INFORMATION

        IBM is in  the business of providing  customer solutions through the
        use  of  advanced  information  technologies.  The company  operates
        primarily  in the  single industry  segment  that  creates value  by
        offering  a variety of solutions that  include, either singularly or
        in  some   combination,  services,   software,  systems,   products,
        financing and technologies. The schedule on page 76 shows revenue by
        classes  of similar  products or services. Financial  information by
        geographic area is summarized in note AA on pages 77 and 78.

        For purposes of classifying similar information technology products,
        general purpose  computer systems that  operate on a  large class of
        applications  are classified  as processor servers when  the systems
        are simultaneously used by multiple users at one time, or as clients
        when the systems are used by one user at a time. Servers include the
        System/390,  POWERparallel, AS/400,  RISC  System/6000  and personal
        computer server products.  Personal systems clients include personal
        computers  and  RISC  System/6000  client products.    Other clients
        include display-based terminals  and consumer and financial systems.
        Storage  consists  of  externally  attached  direct  access  storage
        devices  and tape  storage  devices. Other  peripherals consists  of
        advanced  function  printers   and  telecommunication  devices.  OEM
        hardware   consists  primarily   of   revenue  from   the  sale   of
        semiconductors and low-end storage files to external customers.

        These hardware classes of products represent groupings that  perform
        similar functions, as opposed to  the complete spectrum of  products
        associated  with IBM's  product divisions. Accordingly, they  do not
        represent the full  range of  any division's offerings, which  could
        include related peripherals, software and maintenance.

        Software   includes   both   applications   and   systems  software.
        Maintenance consists  of separately billed  charges for maintenance.
        Services  represents a  wide  range of  service offerings  including
        consulting,  education,  systems  design  and  development,  managed
        operations   and  availability  services.  Financing  and  other  is
        composed  primarily of  financing revenue and products  and supplies
        not otherwise classified.

Some products logically fit in more than one class and are assigned to a
specific class based on a variety of factors. Over time, products tend to 
overlap, merge into or split from existing classes as a result of changing 
technologies, market perceptions and/or customer use. For example, market 
demand may create requirements for technological enhancements to permit a 
peripheral product to be functionally integrated with a display, a
telecommunication device and a processor to form a workstation. Such 
interchangeability and technological progress tend to make year-to-year 
comparisons less valid than they would be in an industry less subject 
to rapid change.

        Z  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

        On January 31,  1996, the  company announced it  had entered  into a
        definitive merger agreement under which the company will  commence a
        cash  tender offer  for  Tivoli Systems  Inc. at  $47.50  per share.
        Tivoli, based  in Austin,  Texas, is  a leading provider  of systems
        management software and services that help customers reduce the cost
        and  complexity of  managing distributed  client/server  networks of
        personal computers and workstations.

        The net cash cost of  the transaction to the company is expected  to
        be  $743 million,  including  the purchase  of Tivoli's  outstanding
        shares, the vesting of a portion of the employee stock options, fees
        and expenses, less Tivoli's current cash.

        When the merger is completed, it will result in a one-time charge to
        the company's earnings. The charge primarily involves expensing,  as
        called  for  by  accounting requirements,  of  amounts  assigned  to
        research and  development of  Tivoli software  that has not  reached
        technological feasibility.  The charge will be  taken in the quarter
        in which the merger is completed. The specific amount  of the charge
        cannot be  determined  at this  time based  on  currently  available
        information.

        AA  GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

        Sales and services in the United States and Canada are  managed as a
        single enterprise. However,  in compliance with SFAS  14, "Financial
        Reporting for Segments of  a Business Enterprise," the United States
        is reported as a  separate geographic area. Canadian  operations are
        included in the "Americas" area.

        Non-U.S.  subsidiaries  operating  in  local  currency  environments
        account  for  approximately  90  percent of  the  company's non-U.S.
        revenue. The remaining 10 percent is from  subsidiaries and branches
        operating in U.S. dollars or in highly inflationary environments.

        In the Europe/Middle East/Africa area, European operations accounted
        for approximately 95 percent of revenue in 1995, 1994 and 1993.

        Interarea  transfers  consist  principally  of  completed  machines,
        subassemblies  and parts and  software. Machines,  subassemblies and
        parts  are generally  transferred at an intracompany  selling price.
        Software  transfers   represent  license  fees   paid  by   non-U.S.
        subsidiaries. The intracompany  selling price that relates  to fixed
        asset  transfers is  capitalized  and depreciated  by the  importing
        area.
