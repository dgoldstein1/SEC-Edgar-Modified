                       AMD REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

- --AMD earns a record $189.3 million, or $1.15 per share, on record quarterly
sales--

     SUNNYVALE, CA -- April 12, 2000 -- AMD today reported record sales of
$1,092,029,000 and record net income of $189,349,000 for the quarter ended April
2, 2000. Net income amounted to $1.15 per diluted share. The company reported
strong growth in each of its product groups - the Computation Products Group,
the Memory Group, and the Communications Group.

     Total revenues grew by 13 percent over the immediate-prior quarter ended
December 26, 1999, and by 73 percent over the like period of 1999. In the
immediate-prior quarter, AMD reported sales of $968,710,000 and net income of
$65,080,000, or $0.43 per diluted share. In the first quarter of 1999, AMD
reported sales of $631,593,000, and a net loss of $128,367,000, or $0.88 per
share.

      "AMD had the best quarter in its history," said W.J. Sanders III, chairman
and chief executive officer. "Each of our product groups reported significant
growth in the first quarter. Led by strength in PC processors and Flash memory
sales, sales from AMD's three product groups grew by more than 13 percent
sequentially and by more than 83 percent over the comparable period of 1999.

     "Unit sales of AMD Athlon(TM) processors increased by 50 percent to 1.2
million units," Sanders continued. "Total PC processor revenues grew 14 percent
sequentially and by more than 65 percent over the first quarter of 1999. Total
unit sales, including AMD Athlon and AMD-K6(R) family processors, reached a new
record at nearly 6.5 million units. Reflecting a richer PC processor portfolio
with the industry's broadest range of high-performance solutions, revenues from
AMD Athlon processors exceeded revenues from AMD-K6 family processors."

      During the quarter, AMD introduced the industry's first 1-gigahertz (GHz)
PC processor and 850-, 900-, and 950-megahertz (MHz) versions of the AMD Athlon
processor. AMD also began sampling two new versions of the AMD Athlon processor
family that incorporate on-chip L2 cache. The first, code-named "Thunderbird,"
is targeted at the performance segment of the PC market. The second, code-named
"Spitfire," is targeted at the value segment. Both products are planned for
shipment later this quarter.

     The company also commenced shipments of a 550-MHz AMD-K6-2 processor
targeted at the value segment of the desktop PC market and a 500-MHz AMD-K6-2
processor for mobile systems.

     The company reported that continuing strong demand for Flash memory devices
coupled with extraordinary operational execution resulted in record sales of
$327 million for the Memory Group, an increase of 19 percent from the immediate-
prior quarter and more than 150 percent from the comparable period of 1999.
During the quarter, AMD concluded multi-year agreements with Alcatel and Cisco
Systems to supply Flash memory products. AMD said it expects that demand for
Flash memory devices will continue to exceed supply for the remainder of the
year and into 2001.

     Communications Group sales increased by 7 percent over the immediate-prior
quarter and by 59 percent over the first quarter of 1999 driven by strength in
telecommunications line-card circuits and devices for physical-layer Ethernet
solutions.

     "Demand continues to be strong across each of our product groups.  With a
stronger product portfolio than at any time in our history, we look forward to
continuing growth," Sanders concluded.


Current Outlook

     The company's outlook statements are based on current expectations.  The
following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ
materially.

     The company currently projects sales in the second quarter to be modestly
higher than the record level of the first quarter.  The company's current
overall outlook is based on the following projections for its major product
lines:

      The company expects that unit shipments of PC processors could approach
the record level of the first quarter.  Unit shipments of AMD Athlon processors
are expected to increase to 1.8 million units, resulting in a richer mix and a
higher blended average selling price and higher revenues for PC processors.

     Communications Group sales are projected to grow by more than 10 percent
over first-quarter levels.

      AMD projects that Memory Group sales will grow in the high single-digit
range over the first quarter and resume double-digit growth in the third and
fourth quarters of 2000.  The company believes that demand for Flash memory
products will continue to exceed supply.

      With the Semiconductor Industry Association forecasting worldwide growth
in the range of 20 to 25 percent in 2000, the company believes it will continue
to grow faster than the industry, with total sales growth of more than 50
percent for the year as a whole.

Cautionary Statement

     This release contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this
release involve risks  and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ
materially from current expectations. There can be no assurance that demand for
the company's products will continue at current or greater levels, or that the
company will continue to grow revenues. There are also risks that the company
will not be able to produce the AMD Athlon processor in the volume, speed mix
or with the feature set necessary to meet customer requirements and the
company's plans and goals; that Intel Corporation pricing, marketing programs,
new product introductions or other activities targeted the company's processor
business will prevent attainment of the company's current processor sales plans;
that third parties may not provide timely or adequate infrastructure solutions
to support the AMD Athlon processor, including new derivative products scheduled
to begin shipment in the second quarter, and that the company will not be able
to grow demand for its PC processors sufficiently to utilize fully its processor
production capacity. We urge investors to review in detail the risks and
uncertainties in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
including but not limited to the report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
26, 1999.
