                       AMD REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS


  AMD reports record sales, record operating income, and record net income of
       $409 million; sales up by 82 percent from third quarter of 1999 -

     SUNNYVALE, CA -- October 11, 2000 -- AMD today reported record sales of
$1,206,549,000, record operating income of  $262,844,000, and record net income
of $408,567,000 for the quarter ended October 1, 2000. Net income amounted to
$1.18 per diluted share. The company's third-quarter results included a one-time
gain of $336,899,000 resulting from the sale of the company's voice
communications business (Legerity) during the quarter, and charges of
$22,980,000 relating to the retirement of senior secured notes. Net income
excluding one-time gains and charges was $219,301,000, or $0.64 per diluted
share, also a record.

     Aggregate sales of the company's flagship products - PC processors and
flash memory devices - more than doubled from the third quarter of 1999, and
grew by more than 10 percent sequentially from the second quarter of 2000. Total
sales grew by 82 percent from the third quarter of 1999. Notwithstanding the
absence of sales from the company's voice communications business, which was
sold during the quarter, total sales grew by slightly more than 3 percent from
the immediate-prior quarter.

     In the immediate-prior quarter, AMD reported sales of $1,170,437,000,
operating income of $250,197,000, and net income of $207,142,000, or $0.60 per
diluted share. In the like period of 1999, AMD reported sales of $662,192,000,
an operating loss of $98,990,000, and net loss of $105,545,000, or a loss of
$0.36 per share.

     For the first nine months of 2000, AMD reported sales of $3,469,015,000,
operating income of $693,710,000, and net income of $805,058,000, or $2.36 per
diluted share. For the same period of 1999, AMD reported total sales of
$1,888,894,000, an operating loss of $392,642,000, a net loss of $154,016,000,
or a loss of $0.52 per share. The results for the first nine months of 1999
included a one-time, after-tax gain of $259,236,000 from the sale of Vantis
Corporation, and restructuring and other special charges of $32,530,000.

     The earnings per share and number of shares used in the earnings-per-share
data for all periods presented reflect the two-for-one stock split that was
effective August 21, 2000.

     "Sales growth was led by continuing extraordinary demand for AMD flash
memory devices, whose sales more than doubled over the same period of 1999 and
grew by 17 percent sequentially on record unit sales," said W.J. Sanders III,
chairman and chief executive officer. "Demand for AMD flash memory products
continues to exceed supply. Demand also continues to be broadly based,
reflecting strength in cellular telephones, set-top boxes, automotive
applications, Internet infrastructure products, and mobile Internet appliances.

     "In a tougher market than anticipated, AMD achieved record PC processor
revenues on record unit sales, which were up more than 50 percent year-on-year
and 10 percent sequentially," Sanders said. "We continued our excellent
operational execution and met our aggressive goal of sequentially doubling
combined AMD Athlon(TM) and AMD Duron(TM) processor sales to more than 3.6
million units. Our position as the reliable provider of the world's fastest PC
processors contributed immensely to our success in gaining market share
worldwide, particularly in the performance sector.

                                       3

     "The newest version of the AMD Athlon processor, featuring performance-
enhancing on-chip L2 cache memory, is an overwhelming success, and demand
remains strong. The recently introduced AMD Duron processor is the performance
leader in the value space, and is on the steepest ramp of unit shipments of any
processor in AMD's history. We continue to work closely with our customers and
infrastructure partners to meet the challenge of providing the best performing
personal computers at all price points," Sanders concluded.

     The company's total bookings in the third quarter were a record, with a
book-to-bill ratio greater than 1:1.

Current Outlook

     The company's outlook statements are based on current expectations. The
following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ
materially. The company's current outlook is based on the following projections
for its flagship products.

     In the fourth quarter, the company again expects to sell out its production
of AMD Athlon processors. The company expects that sales of AMD Athlon
processors, AMD Duron processors, and PC processors in the aggregate will set
new records, individually and collectively, in both units and dollars. For the
year, the company expects that total sales of PC processors will easily exceed
earlier projections of 25 million units, with the final tally projected to be
approximately 28 million units, compared to last year's 18.8 million units. The
company projects that sales of AMD PC processors will be between 8 and 9 million
units in the fourth quarter based on a total market projected to be between 43
and 45 million units.

     The company's production capacity ramp will be the limiting factor in
growth in sales of AMD flash memory products in the fourth quarter. The company
projects that demand for AMD flash memory products will continue to exceed
supply for the foreseeable future.

     The company projects that total sales will grow in the high-single-digit
range sequentially, resulting in annual sales of approximately $4.8 billion,
compared to approximately $2.9 billion in 1999.

Cautionary Statement

     This release contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements in this release
involve risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ
materially from current expectations. There can be no assurance that demand for
the company's products will continue at current or greater levels, or that the
company will continue to grow revenues, operating profit, or earnings. There are
also risks that the company will not be able to produce the AMD Athlon and AMD
Duron processors in the volume, speed mix or with the feature set necessary to
meet customer requirements and the company's plans and goals; that Intel
Corporation pricing, marketing programs, new product introductions or other
activities targeting the company's processors business will prevent attainment
of the company's current processor sales plans; that third parties may not
provide timely or adequate infrastructure solutions to support the AMD Athlon
and AMD Duron processors; that the company will not be able to grow demand for
its PC processors sufficiently to utilize fully its processor production
capacity; and that uncertain global economic conditions or Middle East tensions
will cause lower than expected demand for the company's products. We urge
investors to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in the company's
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to the
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 1999.
