FUJITSU AMD SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1993, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Fujitsu Limited (Fujitsu) formed a
joint venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited (FASL or the Company), for the
development and manufacture of non-volatile memory devices. Through FASL, the
two companies have constructed and are operating an advanced integrated circuit
(IC) manufacturing facility in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, to produce Flash memory
devices. AMD has a 49.992% interest in FASL, and Fujitsu has the remaining
interest.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FISCAL YEAR.  The Company's fiscal year ends March 31.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. The accounting records of the Company are maintained in
accordance with accounting practices prevailing in Japan. The accompanying
financial statements, however, include adjustments that have not been recorded
in the legal books of account of the Company but are necessary to conform to
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP). These adjustments consist principally of depreciation under a different
method and its impact on the valuation of inventories, provision of deferred
income taxes, and adjustments stemming from the translation of the Company's
financial statements into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes.

CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are
readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or
less at the time of acquisition.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The functional currency of the Company is the
Japanese yen. Financial statements are translated into the U.S. dollar using the
exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a
weighted-average exchange rate for each period for income statement items.
Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders'
equity in the U.S. dollar financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.  Revenue is recognized from sales when products are shipped
to the customer.

INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (average method)
or market (net realizable value).

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation for U.S. GAAP purposes is provided on the straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes and on
accelerated methods for tax purposes.  Estimated useful lives for financial
reporting purposes are as follows: machinery and equipment 3 to 5 years;
buildings up to 26 years.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE. Net income per share has been computed using the
weighted-average common shares outstanding.  The Company has no potentially
dilutive securities.

FUJITSU AMD SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS
133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  SFAS 133
is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  This
Statement will require recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at
fair value and the changes in fair value will be recognized through earnings or
other comprehensive income, depending on the nature of the derivatives.  The
Company does not have any derivative instruments; therefore, SFAS 133 will have
no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operation or cash
flows.

USE OF ESTIMATES.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates,
and such differences may be material to the financial statements.

FINANCIAL PRESENTATION.  The Company has reclassified certain prior year amounts
on the financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company is 100 percent owned by AMD and Fujitsu, with AMD having a 49.992%
interest, and Fujitsu having the remaining interest. Under the terms of the
joint venture agreement, FASL production is allocated nearly equally between AMD
and Fujitsu. All of the Company's accounts receivable and sales as of and for
the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were with these related parties.
FASL made purchases from AMD, Fujitsu and Fujitsu's subsidiaries totaling $49
million, $62 million and $46 million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. At
March 31, 1999 and 1998, FASL owed AMD, Fujitsu and Fujitsu's subsidiaries
approximately $142 million and $125 million, respectively, which consisted of
loan, trade and royalty payables.

The Company has an agreement with Fujitsu Capital Limited (FCAP), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Fujitsu, to provide financing to FASL at lower interest rates than
banks. Had the Company obtained financing from a lender other than FCAP, the
additional interest expense would have been immaterial.  FASL completed
construction of the building for a second Flash memory device wafer fabrication
facility, FASL II, in the third quarter of 1997 at a site contiguous to the
existing FASL facility in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan.  Equipment installation is in
progress and the facility, including equipment, the completion of which is
anticipated in the second quarter of 2000, is expected to cost approximately $1
billion.  Approximately $368 million of such cost has been funded as of March
31, 1999.  Capital expenditures for FASL II construction to date have been
funded by cash generated from FASL operations and borrowings by FASL.  However,
to the extent that FASL is unable to secure the necessary funds for FASL II, AMD
and Fujitsu may be required to contribute cash or guarantee third-party loans in
proportion to their respective interests in FASL.  At March 31, 1999, AMD and
Fujitsu had loan guarantees outstanding totaling $114 million with respect to
such loans.  The planned FASL II costs are denominated in yen and are therefore
subject to change due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

FUJITSU AMD SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company has a severance benefit package for employees formerly employed by
Fujitsu.  FASL accrues the Company's share of severance benefits at year-end in
an amount to be settled with Fujitsu if the eligible employee terminates their
service with FASL and returns to Fujitsu or another Fujitsu group company.

4.  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130
(SFAS 130), "Reporting Comprehensive Income."  SFAS 130 establishes new rules
for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components; however,
the adoption of this statement had no impact on the net income or stockholders'
equity.  SFAS 130 requires unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities and the foreign currency translation adjustments, which prior to
adoption were reported separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in
other comprehensive loss.  Prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the requirements of SFAS 130.

As of March 31, 1999 and 1998 components of accumulated other comprehensive
loss, consisting only of cumulative translation adjustments, were $71,057,000
and $111,191,000 respectively.

5. INCOME TAXES

Provision for income taxes consists of:

6. SEGMENT REPORTING

In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131),  "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information," which the Company has adopted in the
current year.  As required by SFAS 131, the  Company has determined it has only
one principle business and one reportable segment: non-volatile memory devices.
FASL derives all of its revenues from sales of only one product, Flash memory
devices, and is not organized by multiple operating segments for the purposes of
making operating decision or assessing performance.  Accordingly, the Company
operates in one reportable segment.

The Company derives revenues from its sales to AMD and Fujitsu. All long-lived
assets are located in Japan.

2023.  The lease fee is revised every three years based on the fair market value
of the land.  In addition, certain manufacturing equipment is used under
operating lease contracts.  For each of the next five years and beyond, lease
obligations are:

Rent expense was $5,402,000, $1,151,000 and $573,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,

8. RETAINED EARNINGS

The amount of retained earnings available for dividends under the Commercial
Code in Japan is based on the amount recorded in the Company's books maintained
in accordance with Japanese accounting practices.  The adjustments included in
the accompanying financial statements but not recorded in the books as explained
in Note 2 have no effect on the determination of retained earnings available for
dividends under the Commercial Code in Japan.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In June 1999, a new transfer price agreement, which includes the basis for
determining the unit selling price, was approved by the Board of Directors.
Under the old transfer price agreement, the unit selling price was calculated
based on a percentage of AMD's ultimate average selling price at a
predetermined, nonnegotiable exchange rate.  Under the new transfer price
agreement, the unit selling price is calculated using approximately 106 percent
of cost of sales based on the Commercial Code in Japan.  Under the Commercial
Code in Japan, property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the declining
balance method.  The change is effectively applied to the unit selling price of
products shipped on and after April 1, 1999.

                        Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor
Limited as of March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March 31, 1999.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have also reported separately on the financial statements of Fujitsu AMD
Semiconductor Limited for the same years prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in Japan.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor
Limited at March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1999, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
