1.   NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1993, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Fujitsu Limited (Fujitsu) formed a
joint venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited (FASL or the Company), for the
development and manufacture of non-volatile memory devices. Through FASL, the
two companies have constructed and are operating an advanced integrated circuit
manufacturing facility in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, to produce Flash memory
devices. AMD has a 49.992% interest in FASL, and Fujitsu has the remaining
interest.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. The accounting records of the Company are maintained in
accordance with accounting practices prevailing in Japan. The accompanying
financial statements, however, include adjustments that have not been recorded
in the legal books of account of the Company but are necessary to conform to
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP). These adjustments consist principally of depreciation under a different
method and its impact on the valuation of inventories, provision of deferred
income taxes, and adjustments stemming from the translation of the Company's
financial statements into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The functional currency of the Company is the
Japanese yen. Financial statements are translated into the U.S. dollar using the
exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a
weighted-average exchange rate for each period for income statement items.
Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders'
equity in the U.S. dollar financial statements.

INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the
lower of cost (average method) or market (net realizable value).

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation for U.S. GAAP purposes is provided principally on the straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting
purposes and on accelerated methods for tax purposes.  Estimated useful lives
for financial reporting purposes are as follows: machinery and equipment 3 to 5
years; buildings up to 26 years.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE. In February 1997, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 (SFAS
128), "Earnings per Share."  SFAS 128 supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 15 (APB 15), "Earnings per Share," and other related Interpretations
and is effective for the periods ending after December 15, 1997. Net income per
share has been computed using the weighted-average common shares outstanding.
The Company has no potentially dilutive securities.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 (SFAS 130), "Reporting Comprehensive
Income." This

FUJITSU AMD SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                March 31, 1998
         (Information for the year ended March 31, 1996 is unaudited)

Statement establishes standards for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components.  SFAS 130 will be effective for the
Company's fiscal year 1999 and requires restatement of all previously reported
information for comparative purposes.  This Statement will require additional
disclosure but will have no impact on the Company's financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

USE OF ESTIMATES.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates,
and such differences may be material to the financial statements.

3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company is 100 percent owned by AMD and Fujitsu, with AMD having a 49.992%
interest, and Fujitsu having the remaining interest. Under the terms of the
joint venture agreement, FASL production is allocated nearly equally between AMD
and Fujitsu. All of the Company's accounts receivable and sales as of and for
the years ended March 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were with these related parties.
In 1998, 1997 and 1996, FASL made purchases from AMD and Fujitsu totaling $12
million, $14 million and $14 million, respectively. At March 31, 1998 and 1997,
FASL owed AMD, Fujitsu and Fujitsu's subsidiaries $125 million and $73 million,
respectively, which consisted of loan, trade and royalty payables.

The Company has an agreement with Fujitsu Capital Limited (FCAP), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Fujitsu, to provide financing to FASL at lower interest rates than
banks. Had the Company obtained financing from a lender other than FCAP, the
additional interest expense would have been immaterial.  FASL completed
construction of the building for a second Flash memory device wafer fabrication
facility, FASL II, in the third quarter of 1997 at a site contiguous to the
existing FASL facility in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan.  Equipment installation is in
progress and the facility including equipment, the completion of which is
anticipated in the second quarter of 2000, is expected to cost approximately
$1.1 billion.  Approximately $260 million of such cost has been funded as of
March 31, 1998.  Capital expenditures for FASL II construction to date have been
funded by cash generated from FASL operations and borrowings by FASL.  However,
to the extent that FASL is unable to secure the necessary funds for FASL II, AMD
and Fujitsu may be required to contribute cash or guarantee third-party loans in
proportion to their respective interests in FASL.  At March 31, 1998, AMD and
Fujitsu had loan guarantees outstanding totaling $94 million with respect to
such loans.  The planned FASL II costs are denominated in yen and are therefore
subject to change due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company has a severance benefit package for employees formerly employed by
Fujitsu.  FASL accrues the Company's share of severance benefits at year-end in
an amount to be settled with Fujitsu if the eligible employee terminates their
service with FASL and returns to Fujitsu or another Fujitsu group company.

4. OTHER RISKS

PRODUCTS. At present the only type of product produced by the Company is a Flash
memory device. The Company expects that its ability to maintain or expand its
current levels of revenues in the future will depend upon, among other things,
its dependence on AMD and Fujitsu in developing and marketing in a timely manner
its future generations of Flash memory devices.

MARKETS. The markets for the Company's products are characterized by rapid
technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer
requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and short
product life cycles. The market for Flash memory devices is primarily dependent
upon the market for communications devices, such as cellular phones and routers
(devices used to transfer data between local area networks).

CUSTOMERS.  The Company derives all of its revenues from sales to AMD and
Fujitsu. Under the terms of the joint venture, the production is allocated
nearly equally to AMD and Fujitsu.  The Company is dependent on the demand of
Flash memory devices from AMD and Fujitsu.

MATERIALS.  Certain of the raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture
of its products are available from a limited number of suppliers.  Shortages
could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or
increased demand in the industry.  If FASL were unable to procure certain of
such materials, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  To date, FASL has
not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining the necessary raw materials.

5. INCOME TAXES

Provision for income taxes consists of:

Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax
carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes.  Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and
liabilities as of March 31, 1998 and 1997 are as follows:

7. RETAINED EARNINGS

The amount of retained earnings available for dividends under the Commercial
Code in Japan is based on the amount recorded in the Company's books maintained
in accordance with Japanese accounting practices.  The adjustments included in
the accompanying financial statements but not recorded in the books as explained

                         Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor
Limited as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have also reported separately on the financial statements of Fujitsu AMD
Semiconductor Limited for the same years prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in Japan.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor
Limited at March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
