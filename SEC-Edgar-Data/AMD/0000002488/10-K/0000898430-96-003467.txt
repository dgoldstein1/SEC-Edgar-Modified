ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

  AMD's principal engineering, manufacturing, warehouse and administrative
facilities comprise approximately 3.07 million square feet and are located in
Santa Clara County, California and Austin, Texas. (See Item 1, Manufacturing and
Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition.) Over 2.54 million square feet of this space is in
buildings owned by the Corporation.

  The Corporation entered into certain operating leases for property containing
two buildings with approximately 360,000 square feet, located on 45.6 acres of
land in Sunnyvale, California at One AMD Place and 991 Stewart Avenue (One AMD
Place). In 1994, the Corporation began utilizing One AMD Place for its corporate
sales, marketing and administrative offices. This lease provides the Corporation
with the option to purchase One AMD Place during the lease term. At the end of
the lease term in 1998, the Corporation is obligated to either purchase One AMD
Place or arrange for its sale to a third party with a guarantee of residual
value to the seller. In 1993, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for
approximately 175,000 square feet located adjacent to One AMD Place (known as
AMD Square) to be used in connection with One AMD Place.

  The Corporation also owns or leases facilities containing approximately
730,000 square feet for its operations in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand (See
Item 1, Manufacturing and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.) Of the entire worldwide
facilities owned or leased by the Corporation, approximately 580,000 square feet
are currently vacant. In addition, approximately 180,000 square feet are
currently vacant until the construction of Fab 25 is completed. The Corporation
has entered into an agreement to lease 14.6/(1)/ acres of land in Suzhou,
China. The Corporation holds 74 undeveloped acres of land in the Republic of
Ireland. The Corporation also has an equity interest in 58 acres of land in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, which it has under a contract to sell that is expected
to close in 1996.

  AMD leases 34 sales offices in North America, six sales offices in Asia and
thirteen sales offices in Europe for its direct sales force. These offices are
located in cities in major electronics markets where concentrations of AMD's
customers are located.

  Leases covering the Corporation's facilities expire over terms of generally
one to twenty years. The Corporation anticipates no difficulty in either
retaining occupancy of any of its facilities through lease renewals prior to
expiration or through month-to-month occupancy, or replacing them with
equivalent facilities. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in the 1995 Annual Report to Stockholders.)

                                  ARTICLE I
                                   OFFICES

      Section 1.   The registered office shall be in the City of Wilmington, 
County of New Castle, State of Delaware.

      Section 2.   The corporation may also have offices at such other places
both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may

                                  ARTICLE II
                           MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

      Section 1.   Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of
stock of the Corporation having a preference over the Common Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances,
nominations for the election of directors may be made by or at the direction of
the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of
directors generally.  Subject to the foregoing, only a stockholder of record
entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more
persons for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders and only if
written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nominations has been
given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to
the Secretary of the Corporation and has been received by the Secretary not
later than the following dates: (i) with respect to an election to be held at an
annual meeting of stockholders, 90 days in advance of such meeting; and (ii)
with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders for
the election of directors, the close of business on the tenth day following the
date on which notice of such meeting if first given to stockholders.

Each such notice shall set forth:

      (a)   the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the
nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated;

                                       1
<PAGE>
 
      (b)   a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear
in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons
specified in the notice;

      (c)   a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person
or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by
the stockholder; and

      (d)   such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such
stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed
pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the
nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors.

      To be effective, each notice of intent to make a nomination given
hereunder shall be accompanied by the written consent of each nominee to serve
as a director of the Corporation if elected.

      The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with the provisions hereof and, if he should so determine,
he shall declare to the meeting that such nomination was not properly brought
before the meeting and shall not be considered.

      Section 2. Annual meetings of the stockholders shall be held on the third
Wednesday in May if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then at the
next secular day following, at 4:00 p.m., or at such other date and time as
shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in
the notice of the meeting, at which they shall elect by plurality vote, a Board
of Directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before
the meeting.

      Section 3. Written notice of the annual meeting stating the place, date
and hour of the meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at
such meeting not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the
meeting.

      Section 4. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least
ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the
meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the
meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.
The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present.

      Section 5. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or
purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, may be called by the chairman and shall be called by the chairman
or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors.

      Section 6. Written notice of a special meeting stating the place, date and
hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called,
shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the
meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.

      Section 7. At any special meeting of stockholders only such business shall
be conducted as shall have been set forth in the notice of special meeting. At
an annual meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as
shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought
before an annual meeting, business must be (I) specified in the notice of the
meeting (or any supplemental thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise (a) properly requested
to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder or record entitled to vote in
the election of directors generally, and (b) constitute a proper subject to be
brought before such meeting.

      For business (other than the election of directors) to be properly
brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have
given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation.  To
be timely, a stockholder's notice must be given, either by personal delivery or
by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation and
must have been received by the Secretary no later than 90 days in advance of
such meeting.  A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to
each matter (other than the election of directors) the stockholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired
to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such
business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the
Corporation's books, of the stockholder intending to propose such business (c)
the class and number of shares 

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stock-
holder, (d) a representative that the stockholder is a holder of record of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to
appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present such business, and (e)
any material interest of the stockholder in such business.

      Notwithstanding anything in the Bylaws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 7.  The chairman of the annual meeting
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that (i) the
business proposed to be brought before the meeting was not a proper subject
therefor and/or (ii) such business was not properly brought before the meeting
and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7, and, if he should so
determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly
brought before the meeting or not a proper subject therefore shall not be
transacted.  Notwithstanding compliance with the requirements of this Section 7,
the chairman presiding at any meeting of the stockholders may, in his sole
discretion, refuse to allow a stockholder or stockholder's representative to
present any proposal which the corporation would not be required to include in a
proxy statement under any rule promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

      For purposes of this Section 7, and Section 1 of Article II of these
Bylaws, reference to a requirement to deliver notice to the Corporation a set
number of days in advance of an annual meeting shall mean that such notice must
be delivered such number of days in advance of the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the
                                 --------  -------                            
date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more
than 60 days from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the
close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or
the 10th day following the day on which notice of such meeting is first given to
stockholders.  For purposes of these Bylaws, notice of such meeting shall be
deemed to be first given to stockholders when disclosure of such date is first
made in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press
or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the
Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13,
14 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

      Section 8. The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of
business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at
any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present or represented. At such adjourned meeting, at which a quorum shall be
present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is for more
than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

      Section 9.  When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or of
the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required in which case
such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

      Section 10. Each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders 
be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital
stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted
on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period.

      Section 11. Whenever the vote of stockholders at a meeting thereof is
required or permitted to be taken for or in connection with any corporate
action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with if the
written consent of the stockholders having not less than such percentage of the
number of votes as may be required by the Certificate of Incorporation,
applicable law, rule or regulation is delivered to the corporation at its
registered office in the State of Delaware or at its principal place of business
or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the books in
which the proceedings of the stockholders are recorded; provided that in no case
shall the written consent be by the holders of stock having less than the
minimum percentage of the vote required by statute for the proposed corporate
action, and provided that prompt notice must be given to all stockholders of the
taking of corporate action without a meeting and by less than unanimous written
consent.

      Section 12. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls
for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be
announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation may to the extent not prohibited by law adopt by
resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent
with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the
chairman of any meeting of

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgement of such
chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules,
regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or
prescribed by the Chairman of the meeting, may to the extent not prohibited by
law include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an
agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of
record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such
other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine (iv) restrictions
on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof; and (v)
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.
Unless, and to the extent, determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman
of the meeting, meetings or stockholders shall not be required to be held in
accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
 
                                 ARTICLE III
                                  DIRECTORS

      Section 1. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole 
board shall be not less than three (3) nor more than eleven (11).  The first
board shall consist of three (3) directors.  Thereafter, within the limits above
specified, the number of directors shall be determined by resolution of the
Board of Directors or by the stockholders at the annual meeting.  The directors
shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided
in Section 2 of this Article, and each director elected shall hold office until
his successor is elected and qualified.  Directors need not be stockholders.

      Section 2. Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of
the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless
sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of
directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of
filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in
office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted
immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon
application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of
the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote
for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such
vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by
the directors then in office.

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
      Section 3.  The business of the corporation shall be managed by its
Board of Directors which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do
all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these By-Laws directed or required to be exercised or done
by the stockholders.

      Section 4.  The provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of this Article are
subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of any series of the
Preferred Serial Stock of the Corporation with respect to the election of
directors in the event the corporation defaults in the payment of dividends, the
term of office of any director so elected and the filling of any vacancy in the
office of any director so elected.  In connection therewith, so long as any
shares of any such series are outstanding, the number of directors authorized by
resolution of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders at the annual
meeting pursuant to Section 1 of this Article shall be such that upon the
exercise of the holders of shares of any such series of any right to elect a
specified number of directors the number of directors of the corporation would
not exceed the maximum number of directors designated in Section 1 of this
Article.


                       MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

      Section 5.  Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings,
both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.

      Section 6.  The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors
shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the
stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be
necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the
meeting, provided a quorum shall be present.  In the event of the failure of the
stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected
Board of Directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and
place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and
place as shall be specified in a notice given hereinafter provided for special
meetings of the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver
signed by all of the directors.

      Section 7.  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held
without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be
determined by the Board.

      Section 8.  Special meetings of the board may be called by the
chairman upon notice thereof given to each director either by mail not less than
48 hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone or telegram on 24 hours'

may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.  Special meetings shall
be called by the chairman, the president or the secretary in like manner or on
like notice on the written request of two directors.

      Section 9.  At all meetings of the board a majority of the directors
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum
shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation.  If a
quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the
directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

      Section 10.  Pursuant to Section 141(i) of the Delaware Corporation

Incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken
without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be,
consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.


                          COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS

      Section 12.  The Board of Directors may, in the manner provided by
law, designate one or more committees of the board.  Any such committee, to the
extent provided in the enabling resolution, shall have and may exercise the
powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs
of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed
to all papers which may require it; provided that in the absence or
disqualification of any member of such committee or committees, the member or
members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether
or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of
the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member.  Such committee or committees shall have such name 

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the
Board of Directors.

      Section 13.  Meetings of a committee may be called by any member of
the committee  upon notice thereof given to each member either by mail not less
than 48 hours before the date of the meeting, by telephone or telegram on 24
hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such
meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.  Except as may
be otherwise specifically provided by the Board, at all Committee meetings a
majority of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business and the act of a majority of the members voting at any
meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the committee; if a
quorum shall not be present at any committee meeting the members present thereat
may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.  Each committee
shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of
Directors when required.

                           COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
                                        
      Section 14.  The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum
for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as
director.  No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the
corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.  Members
of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending
committee meetings.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                    NOTICES

corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be

issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his

against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the

respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any
other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date
which shall be not more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of
such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action.  A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, provided;
however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date of the adjourned
meeting.

             (b)   In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors.  Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize
or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the
Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date.  The Board of
Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date
on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.
If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days
of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its
principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of stockholders' meetings are recorded,
to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation.  Delivery shall be by hand
or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  If no record date
has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

                                INDEMNIFICATION

      Section 1.   Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action
by or in the right of the corporation) (a "third party proceeding") by reason of
the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans (an indemnitee"),
against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action, suit or proceeding by judgement, order, settlement,
conviction, or ipon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a
manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

      Section 2.   Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right
of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (together with third party
proceedings "proceedings") by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans (an "indemnitee"), against expenses (including attorneys' fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine
upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court
shall deem proper.


                        AUTHORIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION

      Section 3.   Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, or
officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as
the case may be.   Such determination shall be made (i)  by a majority  vote of
the directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even
though less than a quorum, or (ii) if there are no such directors or if such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii)
by the stockholders.  To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding, described above, or in defense of any claim, issue
or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including
attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection
therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
      Section 4.   For the purposes of any determination under Section 3 of
this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted or refrained from
acting in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his
action or forbearance from acting was unlawful, if his action, or forbearance as
the case may be, is based on the records or books of account of the corporation
or other enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the
corporation or other enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice
of legal counsel for the corporation or other enterprise or on information or
records given or reports made to the corporation or other enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected with reasonable care by the corporation or other enterprise.  The term
"other enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or
any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
which such person is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer or employee.  The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be
deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a
person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.


           PROCEDURES FOR INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

      Section 5(a).   Any indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 or
advancement of expenses under Section 6 accompanied by the requisite undertaking
of this Article VIII shall be made promptly, and in any event within ninety
days, upon the written request of the person seeking indemnification or
advancement of expense, unless, in the case of indemnification a determination
is reasonably and promptly made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of
the directors who are not parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question,
even though less than a quorum, that such person acted in a manner set forth in
such Sections 1 or 2, as the case may be, as to justify the Corporation's not
indemnifying such person.  In the event there are no such directors or if such
directors so direct, the Board of Directors shall promptly direct that
independent legal counsel shall give its opinion in writing whether such person
acted in the manner set forth in such Sections 1 or 2, as the case may be, as to
justify the Corporation's not indemnifying such person.

              (b)   The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses 
granted by this Article shall be enforceable by such person in the Court of 
Chancery of the State of Delaware, if the Board of Directors or independent
legal counsel denies the claim, in whole or in part, or if no disposition of
such claim is made within ninety days. The costs and expenses incurred by such

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
person in connection with successfully establishing his right to
indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be
indemnified by the corporation.


                          EXPENSES PAYABLE IN ADVANCE

      Section 6.   Except as limited by Section 5 of this Article, expenses
incurred in defending a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall
be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
director, officer or employee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as
authorized in this Article VIII.


                NON-EXCLUSIVITY AND SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION

      Section 7.   The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by or granted pursuant to the other Sections of this Article VIII shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification
or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, contract,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action
in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the
persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the
fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.  The provisions of this Article VIII
shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not
specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has
the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of Delaware law or
otherwise.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or
granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or
employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such person.



                                   INSURANCE

behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the 

                                       19
<PAGE>
 
request of the corporation as a director, officer or employee of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any
such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him against such
liability under the provisions of this Article VIII, or otherwise under Delaware
law.


             MEANING OF "CORPORATION" FOR PURPOSES OF ARTICLE VIII

      Section 9.   For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "the
Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in
a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers or employees,
so that any person who is or was a director, officer or employee, of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer or employee of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect
to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

      Section 10.   Subject to Subject 5(b) hereof, the Corporation shall be
required to indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee was authorized in writing by the Board of
Directors.


                                   ARTICLE IX
                                   AMENDMENTS

      Section 1.   These by-laws may be altered, amended or repealed or new
by-laws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, when
such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors, by the Certificate of
Incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of
Directors or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of
Directors if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new by-
laws be contained in the notice of such meeting.
