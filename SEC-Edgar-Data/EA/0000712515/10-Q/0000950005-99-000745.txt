                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The consolidated  financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments
(consisting  only  of  normal  recurring  accruals)  that,  in  the  opinion  of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
period.  The  results  of  operations  for the  current  interim  period are not
necessarily  indicative  of results to be expected  for the current  year or any
other period.  Certain  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the fiscal
2000 presentation.

These consolidated  financial  statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated  financial statements and notes thereto included in Electronic Arts
Inc. (the "Company")  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 1999 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  ("Commission") on
June 29, 1999.

Note 2. Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included
in other current  assets,  was  $44,259,000 and $35,057,000 at June 30, 1999 and
March 31,  1999,  respectively.  The  long-term  portion of  prepaid  royalties,
included in other assets,  was  $16,343,000  and $7,602,000 at June 30, 1999 and
March 31, 1999, respectively.

Note 6. Comprehensive Income

Income,"  which   establishes   standards  for  reporting  and  the  display  of
comprehensive income and its components (revenues,  expenses,  gains and losses)

Note 7. Acquisitions

During the quarter  ended June 30,  1998,  the  Company  acquired  two  software
development  companies.  In  connection  with these  acquisitions,  the  Company
incurred a charge of $2,279,000 for acquired in-process  technology.  The charge
was made after the Company  concluded  that the  in-process  technology  had not
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking
into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products
and resale of the software.

Note 8. Earnings Per Share

The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method (in thousands except per share amounts):

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
for the three  months  ended June 30,  1999 and 1998 were  options  to  purchase
193,808,  and  18,810  shares of common  stock,  respectively,  as the  options'
exercise  price was greater than the average  market price of the common shares.
For the three months ended June 30, 1999, the weighted-average exercise price of
the respective options was $52.81.

Note 9.  New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is  effective  as of the  beginning  of the first  quarter  of the  fiscal  year
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company is determining the effect of SFAS 133
on its financial statements.

Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in particular Management's Discussion and
Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations  contains  forward
looking statements  regarding future events or our future financial  performance
that involve certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in "Risk
Factors"  below at pages 20 to 22, as well as in our Annual  Report on Form 10-K
for the  fiscal  year ended  March 31,  1999 as filed  with the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  on June  29,  1999  and  other  documents  filed  with the
Commission.  Actual events or actual future results may differ  materially  from
any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties.

We derive revenues  primarily from shipments of  entertainment  software,  which
includes EA Studio CD products for dedicated  entertainment  systems  ("CD-video
games"), EA Studio CD personal computer products ("PC-CD"),  EA Studio cartridge
products  and  Affiliated  Label  ("AL")  products  that are  published by third
parties and  distributed  or  co-published  by us. We also derive  revenues from
licensing  of EA Studio  products  and AL products  through  hardware  companies
("OEMs") and online subscription revenues.

North America Net Revenues

North  America  net  revenues  increased  compared  to the same period last year
primarily due to increased sales of PC-CD and PlayStation  titles as well as the
distribution  of AL products.  PC-CD  revenues  increased  due to the  continued
strong  sales of Sim  City  3000 as well as  current  titles  released  for this
platform including Need for Speed: High Stakes.  Total North America PlayStation
revenues  increased due to the greater  installed  base of this console,  strong
catalog  sales and the  release of three  titles for this  platform.  Affiliated
label revenues increased due to the distribution of products published by Square
EA, which began in the second quarter last year.

<PAGE>


International Net Revenues

The decrease in international net revenues compared to the same period last year
was mainly  attributable  to decreases  in sales for Europe and Japan  partially
offset by an increase in Asia Pacific revenues.  European net revenues decreased
due to  decreases  in  PlayStation  and N64 sales,  mainly  attributable  to the
shipment  of World Cup 98 in the prior  year.  This was  partially  offset by an
increase in AL  revenues,  primarily  due to sales of products  published by ABC
Software,  which was acquired in July 1998.  Net  revenues  for Japan  decreased
primarily  due to  decreases  in sales of  PlayStation  and N64  titles,  mainly
attributable  to the  shipment of FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98 in the prior year,
partially  offset by an increase in PC-CD sales,  due to sales of Sim City 3000.
Sales in the Asia Pacific region  increased due to higher PC-CD and  PlayStation
title sales, primarily due to the shipment of two locally developed products.

PlayStation Product Net Revenues

We released three PlayStation titles during the first quarter of fiscal 2000 and
fiscal 1999. The decrease in  PlayStation  sales for the three months ended June
30, 1999 compared to the prior year was primarily  attributable  to the shipment
of World Cup 98 and Road  Rash 3D in the prior  year.  We expect  revenues  from
PlayStation  products to grow in fiscal 2000, but as revenues for these products
increase,  we do not expect to maintain  the same  growth  rates as those in the
prior years.

Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, we are
authorized to develop and distribute  CD-based software products compatible with
the  PlayStation.  Pursuant  to the Sony  Agreement,  we  engage  Sony to supply
PlayStation CDs for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability to
control our supply of PlayStation  CD products or the timing of their  delivery.
See Risk  Factors  - "Our  platform  licensors  are our  chief  competitors  and
frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products", below.

Personal Computer CD Product Net Revenues

We released  five PC-CD titles in the first  quarter of the current  fiscal year
for the IBM personal  computer and  compatibles  including Need for Speed:  High
Stakes and Dungeon  Keeper 2, compared to two for the same period last year. The
increase in sales of PC-CD products for the three months ended June 30, 1999 was
attributable  to the shipment of key titles  released during the quarter as well
as strong  catalog  sales of titles  such as Sim City 3000 and Triple  Play 2000
released in the prior quarter.  This increase was partially  offset by the prior
year  shipment  of World Cup 98. We  expect  revenues  from  PC-CD  products  to
continue to grow in fiscal 2000, but as revenues for these products increase, we
do not expect to maintain these growth rates.

N64 Product Net Revenues

The  decrease in N64 revenues was due to the prior year  release of World Cup 98
compared to no new releases in the current  period.  This decrease was partially
offset by strong  catalog  sales for the three months ended June 30, 1999. We do
not expect significant growth in revenues for N64 products in fiscal 2000.

Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64
cartridges  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have  little  ability to
control our supply of N64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery. A shortage
of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to
obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.

In connection  with our purchases of N64  cartridges for  distribution  in North
America,  Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to
Nintendo's  acceptance  of  purchase  orders  from  us for  purchases  of  these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk. See Risk Factors--"Our  platform licensors are our
chief  competitors and frequently  control the  manufacturing  of our video game
products", below.

Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues

The  increase in  Affiliated  Label net revenues for the three months ended June
30, 1999 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to higher sales
of AL  products  in  Europe  and  North  America.  The  increase  was  primarily
attributable to the  distribution of products by ABC Software in Switzerland and
Square EA in North America.  We expect  revenues from AL products to continue to
grow in fiscal 2000,  but as revenues  for these  products  increase,  we do not
expect to maintain these growth rates.

  as a percentage of net revenues               45.9%            49.1%


The  decrease in costs of goods sold as a  percentage  of net  revenues  for the
three  months  ended June 30,  1999  compared  to the same  period last year was
primarily  due to

                                       14

increased  sales of higher margin PC-CD  products and higher sales of internally
developed titles such as Sim City 3000 and Dungeon Keeper 2.

Marketing and Sales
                                          June 30,        June 30,         %

  as a percentage of net revenues               18.2%            18.9%

Marketing  and sales  expenses  for the three  months  ended  June 30,  1999 was
comparable with the same period last year. Although we had additional  headcount
expenses  related  to the  continued  expansion  of our  worldwide  distribution
business, this was offset by lower advertising spending.

General and Administrative
                                          June 30,        June 30,         %

  as a percentage of net revenues                9.4%             8.7%

The increase in general and  administrative  expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 1999 was due primarily to an increase in payroll and occupancy costs to
support the increased growth in North America and Europe  operations,  including
expenses relating to the acquisition of ABC in July 1998.

Research and Development
                                          June 30,        June 30,         %

  as a percentage of net revenues               25.5%            20.3%

The  increase in research  and  development  expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 1999 was due to: the  acquisition  of Westwood in  September  1998;  an
increase  in  online   development;   additional   headcount   related  expenses
attributable to increased in-house  development  capacity due to a higher number
of SKUs to be released in fiscal 2000; and spending for next generation  console
products.

Charge for Acquired In-Process Technology

  as a percentage of net revenues               N/A               1.3%

In connection with the acquisition of two software development companies, in the
first  quarter of fiscal  1999,  we incurred a total  charge of  $2,279,000  for
acquired in-process technology. This charge was made after we concluded that the
in-process  technology  had not  reached  technological  feasibility  and had no
alternative  future use after taking into

                                       15

consideration the potential for usage of the software in different  products and
resale of the software.

Amortization of Intangibles

Software and other acquisitions made in prior periods.

Interest and Other Income, Net

                                          June 30,        June 30,         %
                                            1999            1998         change
                                       -------------    -------------  ---------

  as a percentage of net revenues                2.2%             1.6%

Interest and other  income,  net,  increased for the three months ended June 30,
1999 compared to the same period last year  primarily due to the gain on sale of
marketable  securities and a gain on sale of a minority interest in an affiliate
in the  current  year.  This  was  partially  offset  by lower  interest  income
attributable to lower cash balances as compared to the prior year period.

Income Taxes

  effective tax rate                            32.0%            33.0%

The  Company's  effective  tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 1999 was
lower than the comparable prior year period primarily as a result of a projected
higher  portion  of  international  income for  fiscal  2000  subject to a lower
foreign tax rate as compared to the prior year.

Minority Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture

                                          June 30,        June 30,         %

  as a percentage of net revenues                0.0%            (0.1%)

In the first  quarter of fiscal  1999,  we formed EA Square KK, which is seventy
percent owned by us and thirty  percent owned by Square Co. Ltd.  ("Square"),  a
leading  developer and publisher of  entertainment  software in Japan.  Minority
interest for the three  months

ended June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998  represents  Square's  30% interest in the
net loss (income) of EA Square KK.

  as a percentage of net revenues                1.2%             2.1%

The  decrease in net income for the three months ended June 30, 1999 as compared
to the prior year  period was  primarily  related to higher  revenues  and gross
profits offset by higher operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As  of  June  30,  1999,  our  working  capital  was  $337,914,000  compared  to
$333,256,000  at  March  31,  1999.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments increased by approximately  $6,845,000 during the three months ended
June 30, 1999 as we used  $2,699,000 of cash in operations  and  $18,781,000  in
capital expenditures,  offset by $13,729,000 provided through the sale of equity
securities  under  our  stock  plans  as well as  proceeds  from  the sale of an
affiliate and the sale of marketable securities.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns decreased from $72,850,000 at March 31,
1999 to $55,355,000 at June 30, 1999.  Reserves have been charged for returns of
product and price protection  credits issued for products sold in prior periods.
Management  believes these reserves are adequate based on historical  experience
and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances.

Our principal  source of liquidity is $319,667,000 in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements on both a short-term
and long-term basis.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

Background of Year 2000 Issues

         Many currently  installed  computer  systems and software  products are
unable to distinguish  between twentieth century dates and twenty-first  century
dates because such systems may have been developed  using two digits rather than
four to determine the applicable year. For example,  computer programs that have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than  the  year  2000.   This  error   could   result  in  system   failures  or
miscalculations  causing  disruptions  of  operations,  including,  among  other
things, a temporary inability to process  transactions,  send invoices or engage
in similar normal business activities. As a result, many companies' software and
computer  systems  may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such "Year
2000" requirements.

State of Readiness

         Our  business is dependent  on the  operation of numerous  systems that
could  potentially  be impacted by Year 2000  related  problems.  Those  systems
include, among others: hardware and software systems used to deliver products to
our  customers;  communications  networks  such

                                       17

<PAGE>


as the Internet and private  intranets,  upon which we depend to receive  orders
from our  customers;  the  internal  systems  of our  customers  and  suppliers;
products sold to customers; the hardware and software systems used internally in
the  management  of our business;  and  non-information  technology  systems and
services  used in the  management  of our  business,  such as  power,  telephone
systems and building systems.

     Based on an  analysis  of the systems  potentially  impacted by  conducting
business  in the  twenty-first  century,  we are  applying a phased  approach to
making such systems, and accordingly,  our operations,  ready for the year 2000.
Beyond  awareness  of the issues and scope of  systems  involved,  the phases of
activities in progress include:  an assessment of specific  underlying  computer
systems, programs and hardware; renovation,  replacement or redeployment of Year
2000  non-compliant  technology;   validation  and  testing  of  technologically
compliant Year 2000  solutions;  and  implementation  of the Year 2000 compliant
systems.

     As a third party  providing  software  products,  we are  dependent  on the
hardware and software  products used to deliver such  products and services.  If
such products are  inoperable due to Year 2000 issues,  our business,  financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. An inventory of
our internal  business  systems,  and software and hardware  upgrades  have been
completed to ensure Year 2000 compliance.

Costs

         To date we have not incurred significant costs directly related to Year
2000 issues,  even in cases where non-compliant  information  technology systems
were redeployed or replaced.

         We believe that future  expenditures  to upgrade  internal  systems and
applications will not have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial
condition  and  results of  operations  and are  primarily  included  within our
ongoing  system  development  plan. In addition,  while the  potential  costs of
redeploying  personnel and of any delays in implementing  other projects are not
known, the costs are anticipated to be immaterial.


Risks of the Year 2000 Issues

     Our financial  information  systems include an integrated suite of business
applications  developed and supported by Oracle Corporation.  These applications
systems are in place and currently support daily operations in the United States
and in Europe.  Based on representations made by Oracle Corporation and upon our
limited tests, we believe these systems to be Year 2000 compliant.

     We believe our software products are Year 2000 compliant;  however, success
of our Year 2000  compliance  efforts may depend on the success of our customers
dealing with their Year 2000 issues. Customer difficulties with Year 2000 issues
might require us to devote additional  resources to resolve underlying problems.
Failures of our computer systems or third parties' computer systems could have a
material  adverse  impact on our ability to conduct  business.  For  example,  a
significant  percentage  of purchase  orders  received  from our  customers  are
computer generated and electronically  transmitted.  In addition,  the Year 2000
could  affect the  ability of  consumers  to use our PC based  products.  If the
computer  systems  on which the  consumers  use our  products  are not Year 2000
compliant,  such  noncompliance  could affect the consumers' ability to use such
products.

Contingency Plans

     We continue to assess  certain of our Year 2000 exposure  areas in order to
determine what additional  steps beyond those  identified by our internal review
in the United States are  advisable.

                                       18

<PAGE>


We have  developed a  contingency  plan for handling Year 2000 problems that are
not  detected  and  corrected  prior to their  occurrence.  We believe  that the
systems, which represent the principal exposures,  have been identified,  and to
the extent  necessary,  are in the process of being modified to become Year 2000
compliant.  Additionally,  we have  conducted  tests of our  principal  business
systems to verify  that those  systems are Year 2000  compliant.  Any failure to
address any  unforeseen  Year 2000 issues could adversely  affect our  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

EURO CONVERSION

     On January 1, 1999,  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European
Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing  currencies (the
"legacy  currency") and the one common legal currency known as the "Euro".  From
January 1, 1999  through June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their
legacy  currencies  or the Euro to transact  business.  By July 1, 2002,  at the
latest,  the  conversion  to the Euro will be  complete at which time the legacy
currencies will no longer be legal tender.  The fixed  conversion  rates between
their existing  currencies have eliminated exchange rate risk between the member
countries.

The  conversion to the Euro has reduced the number of forward  contracts that we
use to hedge the exchange  rate risk.  The forward  contracts  that were used to
hedge the individual legacy currencies have been replaced by a single Euro hedge
contract  and  the  intercompany  transactions  among  subsidiaries  within  the
European Union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk.

We do not  anticipate  any  material  impact  from  the Euro  conversion  on our
financial  information systems which currently  accommodate multiple currencies.
Computer  software  changes  necessary  to comply  with the Year 2000 issues are
generally compliant to the Euro conversion issue. Due to numerous uncertainties,
we cannot  reasonably  estimate the effect that the Euro  conversion  issue will
have on our pricing or market  strategies,  and the impact, if any, it will have
on our financial condition and results of operations.

Risk Factors

EA's  business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties  which may affect our
future financial  performance.  Some of those important risks and  uncertainties
which may cause  our  operating  results  to vary or which  may  materially  and
adversely affect our operating results are as follows:

- - Product  development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting
quarterly results difficult. Product development schedules, particularly for new
hardware platforms and high-end  multimedia PCs are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms
and  the  learning  process,   research  and  experimentation   associated  with
development  for new  technologies.  For example,  SimCity  3000,  the follow on
product to SimCity 2000, was expected to ship in fiscal 1998, at the time of the
merger with Maxis. Due to additional  development  delays,  that product did not
ship until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. Also, Tiberian Sun, which was
expected  to ship in  fiscal  1999 at the time of the  acquisition  of  Westwood
Studios,  is not expected to be released until the second quarter of fiscal 2000
due to development delays.  Additionally,  development risks for CD-ROM products
can cause particular  difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter.  Our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to
meet our product  release  schedules,  and our  failure to meet those  schedules
could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts' expectations
for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

- - New video game  platforms  create  additional  technical  and  business  model
uncertainties.  A large  portion of our  revenues  are derived  from the sale of
products for play on proprietary  video game  platforms such as the  PlayStation
and the N64. The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance
of the new video  game  hardware  systems  and the life  span of older  hardware
platforms and our ability to accurately  predict  which  platforms  will be most
successful.

Sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed
for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large  installed  bases or
will continue  product  development  for older hardware  platforms that may have
shorter  life cycles than we  expected.  Conversely,  if we do not develop for a
platform that achieves significant market acceptance, or discontinue development
for a platform that has a longer life cycle than  expected,  our revenue  growth
may be adversely affected.

For  example,  while the Sega  Dreamcast  console is  scheduled to launch in the
United States in late calendar 1999 and has already  launched in Japan,  we have
no products under development for this platform.  Accordingly,  we will not have
products   available  should  this  platform  achieve  wide  market  acceptance.
Similarly,  we  intend  to  launch  a  variety  of  products  for the  new  Sony
PlayStation platform,  the PlayStation II, expected to be released in the United
States in September  2000.  Should that platform not achieve wide  acceptance by
consumers,  we will have spent a  disproportionate  amount of our  resources for
this platform.  Additionally,  we have not negotiated publishing agreements with
Sony, Sega or Nintendo for their next generation  platforms,  and we do not know
whether the terms of those agreement will be favorable.

- - The  business  models and  technology  for  e-commerce  and online  gaming are
unproven.  While we do not  currently  derive  significant  revenues from online
sales of our packaged products or from games played online, we believe that both
will become a more  significant  factor in our business  and in the  interactive
gaming business generally in the future.

E-commerce is becoming an  increasingly  popular method for conducting  business
with consumers.  How that form of distribution  will affect the more traditional
retail distribution,  at

                                       20

<PAGE>


which we have  historically  excelled,  and over what time period, is uncertain.
Additionally,  technology,  staffing  and support for sales  direct to consumers
differ from that required for sales to resellers.

Online gaming,  and  particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as our Ultima
Online product,  has many risks not currently associated with most packaged good
sales including, but not limited to, the following:

         In "massively  multiplayer" games such as Ultima Online,  unanticipated
player  conduct  significantly  affects the  performance of the game, and social
issues raised by players' conduct frequently determine player satisfaction.
Our ability to effectively proctor such games is uncertain.

         The  current   business  model  is  as  yet   experimental   and  maybe
unsustainable;  whether  revenues will continue to be sufficient to maintain the
significant support,  service and product enhancement demands of online users is
uncertain.  We have little experience in pricing  strategies for online games or
in predicting usage patterns of our customers.

         Additionally,  the  speed  and  reliability  of the  Internet  and  the
performance of a user's Internet  service  provider are not controlled by us but
impact  both  e-commerce  and online  game  performance.  Whether  the  Internet
infrastructure  will be  adequate  to meet  increasing  demand  will  affect our
ability to grow our Internet dependent businesses.

- - Our business,  our products,  and our  distribution  are subject to increasing
regulation in key territories.  Legislation is increasingly introduced which may
affect the content of our products and their distribution.  For example, privacy
rules in the United States and Europe  impose  various  restrictions  on our web
sites. Those rules vary by territory while of course the Internet  recognizes no
geographical  boundaries.  Other  countries  such as Germany  have  adopted laws
regulating content  transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current
United  States laws. In the United  States,  in response to recent  events,  the
federal and several state  governments are considering  content  restrictions on
products such as those made by us as well as  restrictions  on  distribution  of
such products. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business.

- - Our platform  licensors are our chief  competitors and frequently  control the
manufacturing  of  our  video  game  products.   Our  agreements  with  hardware
licensors,  which are also our chief  competitors,  typically  give  significant
control to the licensor  over the approval and  manufacturing  of our  products.
This fact could, in certain  circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products
approved,  manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events, control of the
approval and manufacturing  process by the platform licensors increases both our
manufacturing  lead  times  and  costs  as  compared  to  those  we can  achieve
independently.  For example,  in prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining
approvals for and  manufacturing of PlayStation  products which caused delays in
shipping  those  products.  The  potential  for  additional  delay or refusal to
approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors.  Such
occurrences   would  harm  our  business  and  adversely  affect  our  financial
performance.

- - We face intense  competition for talent from highly valued Internet companies.
Competition for employees in the interactive  software business  continues to be
intense. Recently, the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining key
employees is from Internet companies.  The high market valuations,  large equity
positions  for  key  executives  and  creative   talent  and  fast  stock  price
appreciation of these companies make their compensation  packages  attractive to
those who are already working in more mature  companies.  This situation

                                       21

creates  difficulty  for us to  compete  for the  attraction  and  retention  of
executive and key creative talent.

- - Foreign Sales and Currency  Fluctuations.  For the three months ended June 30,
1999,  international  net  revenues  comprised  45% of  total  consolidated  net
revenues.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999,  international net revenues
comprised 42% of total  consolidated  net revenues.  We expect  foreign sales to
continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenues.  Such
sales are  subject to  unexpected  regulatory  requirements,  tariffs  and other
barriers.  Additionally,  foreign sales are primarily  made in local  currencies
which may fluctuate.  As a result of current economic conditions in Asia, we are
subject to additional foreign currency risk. Though we do not currently derive a
significant  portion of revenues  and  operating  profits from sales in Asia and
other  developing  countries,  our foreign  currency  exposure  may  increase as
operations  in these  countries  grow and if  current  economic  trends  in Asia
continue. Any of these factors may significantly harm our business.

- - Fluctuations in Stock Price. Due to analysts' expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given
period.  As a result of the factors  discussed in this report and other  factors
that may arise in the future,  the market price of our common stock historically
has been,  and may  continue to be subject to  significant  fluctuations  over a
short period of time.  These  fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us,
to  changes  in  analysts'  earnings  estimates,  or to  factors  affecting  the
computer,  software,  entertainment,  media  or  electronics  industries  or the
securities markets in general.  For example,  during the fiscal year ended March
31,  1999,  the price per share of our common stock ranged from $33.88 to $56.00
and from $45.63 to $54.81 during the three months ended June 30, 1999.

Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Item 3:  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

         We are  exposed to  various  market  risks,  including  the  changes in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential
loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts
used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short-term  investments are subject
to market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject
to  interest  rate risk due to their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies thereby limiting our risk. Gains and
losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.  At
June 30, 1999, we had foreign  exchange  contracts,  all with maturities of less
than nine  months to purchase  and sell  approximately  $174,584,000  in foreign
currencies,  primarily British Pounds,  Canadian Dollars,  German  Deutschmarks,
Japanese Yen and other European currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and  the  forward  rate,   plus  the  unamortized   premium  or  discount.   The
counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational
commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these
contracts  are not  considered  to be material.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to
manage  foreign  exchange  risks,  there can be no  assurances  that our hedging
activities will adequately  protect us against the risks associated with foreign
currency fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts  at June  30,  1999.  The  information  is  provided  in  U.S.  dollar
equivalents  and presents the notional  amount  (forward  amount),  the weighted
average  contractual  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  fair  value.  All
contracts mature within nine months.

                                       --------       ---------        --------

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity. At June 30, 1999, our
cash equivalents,  short-term and long-term investments included debt securities
of  $254,386,000.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to manage  interest  rate risks,
there can be no  assurances  that we will be  adequately  protected  against the
risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

The table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates
of our investment portfolio at June 30, 1999:

         consultation  with  counsel,  considers  that  any  liability  from the
         disposition of such lawsuits in the aggregate would not have a material
