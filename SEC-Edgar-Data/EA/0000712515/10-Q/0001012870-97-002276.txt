                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring accruals) that, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
period.  The results of operations for the current interim period are not
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the current year or any
other period.  As discussed at Note 9, the accompanying financial statements
have been restated to reflect the pooling of Maxis, Inc.  Certain amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 1998 presentation.

These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes thereto included in Electronic Arts Inc. (the
"Company") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997
as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") on June 23,
1997 and certain other information included in the Company's Registration
Statement on Form S-4 as filed with the Commission on June 25, 1997.

NOTE 2. CASH AND INVESTMENTS

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with insignificant
interest rate risk and with maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase. Short-term investments include securities with maturities greater than
three months and less than one year, except for certain investments with stated
maturities greater than one year.  Long-term investments consist of securities
with maturities greater than one year.

The Company accounts for investments under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, ("SFAS 115"). The Company's policy is to protect the value of its
investment portfolio and to minimize principal risk by earning returns based on
current interest rates.  Management determines the appropriate classification of
its debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
designation as of each balance sheet date.  Debt securities are classified as
held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold
the securities to maturity. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are
carried at amortized cost, which is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest
income.  Debt securities, not classified as held-to-maturity, are classified as
available for sale and are stated at fair value which approximates cost.
Securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

NOTE 8.   FOREIGN CURRENCY

The Company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge
foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets, liabilities and other
obligations, primarily intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign
currencies.  The Company does not use forward exchange contracts for speculative
or trading purposes. The Company transacts business in various foreign
currencies, including European and Canadian currencies. At September 30, 1997,
the Company had foreign exchange contracts, all having maturities of 90 days or
less,  to purchase and sell approximately $16,300,000 in foreign currencies,
primarily German Deutschmarks, Swedish Krona, Netherlands Guilders and British
Pounds. Gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are designated and
effective as hedges of existing transactions are recognized in income in the
same period as losses and gains on the underlying transactions are recognized
and generally offset.

The difference between the face value and market value of these contracts is not
significant.  The counterparties to these contracts are substantial and credit
worthy multinational commercial banks.  The risks of counterparty nonperformance
associated with these contracts are not considered to be material.

NOTE 9 -   ACQUISITION OF MAXIS, INC.

On July 25, 1997, the Company completed a merger with Maxis, Inc. ("Maxis"), a
California-based interactive software developer.   Under the transaction,
approximately 4.1 million shares of Electronic Arts' stock were exchanged for
all outstanding Maxis common stock. The transaction was accounted for as a
pooling of interests.  The accompanying financial statements, notes and analyses
have been restated for all periods presented to reflect this transaction.

In conjunction with the merger of Maxis, the Company recorded costs of
$10,792,000.  This charge included direct transaction fees for investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, and other related costs of approximately
$2,781,000 and costs associated with integrating the operations of the two
companies of approximately $8,011,000.  Included in the integration costs were
redundant facility costs, severance payments,  equipment abandonment costs and
other asset write downs, contract termination charges and other related
expenses.  Of the total merger costs, approximately $5,185,000 related to cash
expenditures while approximately $5,607,000 related to noncash charges.  As of
September 30, 1997,  approximately $1,250,000 was accrued for expected future
cash expenditures.  The Company anticipates that the majority of these
expenditures will be made by the end of the 1998 fiscal year.

North America net revenues increased $27,195,000, or 29.1%, for the three months
ended September 30, 1997 compared to the same period last year primarily due to
increased sales of Sony PlayStation ("PlayStation") titles and increased
Affiliated Label revenues resulting from key releases of new products from
certain affiliates.  North American PlayStation sales reflected the increase in
installed base of consoles and the release of eight titles for this platform
versus three in the comparable prior year period.  Total North American
PlayStation revenue increased $28,804,000, or 82.1%, to $63,887,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 1997.  Affiliated Label revenues increased
$12,995,000, or 167.3%, in comparison to the same period in the prior year
primarily attributable to the release of The Lost World: Jurassic Park
("Jurassic Park") co-published by the Company and Dreamworks Interactive.  The
increase in North America net revenues was offset by a decrease in net revenues
from the sales of 16-bit cartridge and, to a lesser degree, PC CD and Sega
Saturn ("Saturn") titles.  The decrease in PC CD net revenues was attributable
to fewer titles released for this platform compared to the same period last
year.  Though North America net revenues are expected to grow in fiscal 1998,
they may not grow at as high a rate as compared to this quarter.

For the six months ended September 30, 1997, North America net revenue increased
$37,734,000, or 27.1%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the
increased installed base of the PlayStation and the related increase in sales of
products for this platform.  Net revenues from the sale of PlayStation products
increased to $85,437,000 for the six months ended September 30, 1997 from
$45,341,000 for the comparable prior year period.  This reflects the release of
twelve new PlayStation titles compared to seven in the prior year.  In addition
to increased PlayStation revenues, Affiliated Label revenues increased
$16,531,000 to $30,330,000 for the six months ended September 30, 1997.  The
majority of this increase was attributable to the release of Jurassic Park,
noted above, and the continued distribution of products of Accolade, Inc.,  a
key affiliate added in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.  The net increase
above was offset by decreased 16-bit, PC CD and Saturn  revenues.  16-bit
revenues decreased $13,806,000 compared to the prior year due to the completed
transition to 32-bit CD- video games.  PC CD and Saturn revenues decreased
$1,855,000 and $2,711,000, respectively, from the prior year. As noted above, PC
CD revenues decreased due to fewer titles released for this platform compared to
the same prior year period.

International net revenues increased $25,362,000, or 57.8%, for the three months
ended September 30, 1997 compared to the same period last year. The increase
resulted from the increased distribution of Affiliated Label titles, worldwide
growth in installed base of the PlayStation, and the continued growth in the PC
CD market. For the three months ended September 30, 1997, international
Affiliated Label sales grew $16,543,000, or 193.5%, due to the release of
Jurassic Park and the continued distribution of products for Twentieth Century
Fox Home Entertainment ("Fox") and other affiliates. Net revenue from the sale
of PlayStation products increased $10,218,000, or 88.5%, over all regions. PC CD
revenues increased $2,137,000, or 13.6%, compared to the prior year primarily
due to the release of Dungeon Keeper in the quarter ended June 30, 1997 and
stronger PC CD sales in Japan. Though international revenues are expected to
grow in fiscal 1998, they may not grow at as high a rate as in prior periods.
<PAGE>
 
The increase in international revenues for the three months ended September 30,
1997 was primarily due to a 60.2% increase in European net revenues consisting
of higher sales of AL and PlayStation products offset by a decrease in 16-bit
revenues. Total net revenues in Europe were $54,520,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 1997 compared to $34,031,000 in the same period last year.
European PlayStation sales increased $9,128,000, or 122.4% reflecting the
worldwide growth in installed base of this platform.  European AL sales
increased $13,565,000 due to key releases from certain affiliates in the quarter
including Jurassic Park, noted above, and continued distribution under an
exclusive international agreement with Fox and under agreements with other
affiliates.

Sales in the South Asia Pacific region increased by 46.1% to $8,929,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 1997 compared to $6,111,000 in the prior year
due to increased sales of Affiliated Label and PlayStation titles resulting from
both the increase in installed base of these platforms and the growth in sales
offices throughout the region, including Singapore, New Zealand and Hong Kong.
Revenues from the sale of Affiliated Label titles increased $2,592,000, or
324.0%, to $3,392,000 as a result of key releases from certain affiliates and
continued distribution of Fox titles, as noted above.

Net revenues in Japan for the second fiscal quarter 1998 were $5,777,000
compared to $3,722,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year. The
increase in revenues in the current fiscal quarter was due primarily to the
increase in sales of PC CD products compared to the prior fiscal year.  Revenues
on this platform were not significant in the prior year period.

International net revenues for the six months ended September 30, 1997,
increased $49,800,000, or 57.3%, in comparison to the prior year.  The increase
resulted from the growth in the Affiliated Label sales; the greater installed
base of the PlayStation and related product releases;  and the continued growth
of the PC CD market.  For the six months ended September 30, 1997, international
Affiliated Label revenues increased $24,759,000, or 147.3%, compared to prior
year as a result of releases of key titles from certain affiliates worldwide and
the continued distribution of Fox titles in Europe and South Asia Pacific.  For
the six months ended September 30, 1997, PlayStation revenues grew $14,134,000,
or 56.3%, compared to prior year while PC CD revenues increased $13,168,000, or
43.9%, compared to the prior year.  PC CD sales increased primarily as a result
of strong sales of Dungeon Keeper in Europe, which was released in the first
fiscal quarter of 1998, as well as growth in South Asia Pacific and Japan PC CD
sales.

The Company released ten 32-bit CD-video game products during the second quarter
of fiscal 1998 comprised of eight for the PlayStation, including Madden NFL 98,
Nascar 98 and Nuclear Strike and two for the Saturn, Madden NFL 98 and Warcraft
2. The increase in sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 1997
compared to the prior year periods is attributable to the greater installed base
of PlayStation consoles and the related release of key titles for this platform
during the quarter offset by a decline in Saturn revenues.

For the three and six months ended September 30, 1997, total 32-bit video game
revenue increased $35,894,000 and $51,189,000, respectively, compared to the
same periods in the prior year.  The majority of this increase was attributable
to PlayStation sales which were $85,645,000, compared to $46,623,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 1996. For the six months ended September 30,
1997 and 1996, PlayStation revenues were $124,662,000 and $70,432,000,
respectively.  The Company expects revenues from PlayStation products to
continue to grow in fiscal 1998, but as revenues for these products increase,
the Company does not expect to maintain the rates achieved in fiscal 1997 again
in fiscal 1998.

Net revenue from the sale of other 32-bit products, primarily from sales of
products for the Saturn, were $5,212,000 for the quarter ended September 30,
1997 compared to $8,340,000 for the same period in the prior year.  For the six
months ended September 30, 1997 and 1996 other 32-bit revenues were $9,425,000
and $12,466,000, respectively.    As the installed base of Saturn consoles has
not achieved the growth rates of PlayStation consoles, the Company's revenues
from sales of Saturn products are declining and are expected to decline further
in future years. The Company plans fewer releases of Saturn products in fiscal
1998 than fiscal 1997 and does not plan further releases of Saturn products
after the quarter ending December 31, 1997.

The Company released five PC CD titles in the second quarter of the current
fiscal year for the IBM personal computer and compatibles including NHL 98 and
Ultima Online, compared to nine for the same period last year. The decrease in
PC CD revenues for the three months ended September 30, 1997 compared to the
prior year is due to fewer releases on the platform compared to the prior year.

PC CD sales for the quarter ended September 30, 1997 in North America decreased
$4,318,000 which was offset by an increase in international PC CD sales of
$2,137,000 primarily in Europe and Japan.  The increase in sales of PC CD
products for the six months ended September 30, 1997 is attributable to growth
in the PC CD market worldwide, expansion of the Company's direct distribution
worldwide and the release of Dungeon Keeper during the first quarter.  Though PC
CD revenues are expected to grow in fiscal 1998, they may not grow at as high a
rate as in prior periods.

For the three and six months ended September 30, 1997, 64-bit revenue was
comprised of sales of FIFA Soccer 64 for the Nintendo 64 ("N64"), which was
released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.  The Company released no new
titles for the N64 for the three and six months ended September 30, 1997.  In
March 1997, the Company signed a licensing agreement with Nintendo to develop,
publish and market certain sports products for the N64.  Due to the development
time necessary for these products, the Company does not anticipate shipping more
than two products for the N64 in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998.

Under the terms of its licensing agreement with Nintendo, the Company engages
Nintendo to manufacture its N64 cartridges for distribution.  Accordingly, the
Company has little ability to control its supply of cartridges or the timing of
their delivery.  A shortage of microchips or other factors outside the control
of the Company could impair the Company's ability to obtain an adequate supply
of cartridges.  In connection with the Company's purchases of N64 cartridges for
distribution in North America, Nintendo requires that the Company provide it
irrevocable letters of credit prior to Nintendo's acceptance of purchase orders
from the Company for purchases of these cartridges.  For purchases of N64
cartridges for distribution in Japan and Europe, Nintendo requires the Company
to make cash deposits.  Furthermore, Nintendo maintains a policy of not
accepting returns.  Because of these and other factors,  the carrying of an
inventory of cartridges entails significant investment and risk.  See Hardware

The increase in Affiliated Label net revenues for the three and six months ended
September 30, 1997 compared to the prior year period was due to higher sales of
Affiliated Label products in Europe, North America and South Asia Pacific. The
increase for the quarter ended September 30, 1997 is due primarily to the
release of Jurassic Park, co-published by Dreamworks Interactive and the
Company.  The increase for the six months ended September 30, 1997 is due to the
release of Jurassic Park , noted above, the addition of Accolade, Inc. as an
Affiliate in March 1997, and the continued distribution under an exclusive
international agreement with Fox and under agreements with other affiliates.

The increase in costs of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues for the
three and six months ended September 30, 1997 compared to the same period last
year was primarily due to increased sales of lower margin affiliated label
titles, the decrease in PC CD sales as a proportion of total net revenues and
higher professional, celebrity and manufacturing royalties on PC CD and CD-video
game titles.

</TABLE>

The increase in marketing and sales expenses for the three and six months ended
September 30, 1997 was primarily attributable to increased television and print
advertising worldwide to support new releases and increased cooperative
advertising associated with higher revenues as compared to the prior year.
Marketing and sales expenses also increased due to additional headcount related
to the continued expansion of the Company's worldwide distribution business and
increased trade show expenses.

</TABLE>

The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 1997 was due primarily to additional bad debt  reserves taken in
the prior year related to potentially uncollectible accounts from a customer who
filed for bankruptcy in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year and savings
attributable to the integration of Maxis in the second quarter of fiscal 1998.
This decrease was offset by an increase in payroll and occupancy costs due to
the opening of additional international offices and additional depreciation
related to the installation of new management information systems worldwide.
The increase in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended
September 30, 1997 was primarily due to higher payroll, occupancy and
depreciation expenses, noted above, offset by Maxis savings and lower bad debt
expenses.

The increase in research and development expenses for the three and six months
ended September 30, 1997 was due to additional headcount related expenses
attributable  to increased in-house development capacity, higher development
costs per title and additional depreciation of computer equipment.  These
increases were partially offset by lower royalty write-offs against artist
advances attributable to more successful titles.

Operating income was lower for the three months ended September 30, 1997
compared to the same period last year while the operating loss for the six
months ended September 30, 1997 was less than the prior year. Exclusive of the
merger costs, noted above, operating income increased for both the three and six
month periods in comparison to the prior year due to increased revenue and
related gross profit margins partially offset by increased operating expenses.

Interest and other income, net, increased for the three months ended September
30, 1997 compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher interest
income attributable to higher cash balances as compared to the prior year
period.  Interest and other income, net decreased for the six months ended
September 30, 1997 primarily due to lower gains on sales of marketable
securities of $2,070,000 compared to $5,456,000 in the prior year period offset
by higher interest income as noted above.

The minority interest represents VEI's 35% interest in EAV.  No minority
interest in EAV was recorded for the losses generated in the three months ended
September 30, 1997 as VEI's interest in the net equity of EAV has fallen below
zero.  Minority interest for the six months ended September 30, 1997 reflects
only a portion of reported losses for EAV as the net equity of EAV fell below
zero in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.

The decrease in net income for the three and six months ended September 30, 1997
as compared to the prior year period was primarily related to the merger costs
of $10,792,000 related to the acquisition of Maxis and higher operating
expenses, offset by higher revenues and gross profits. Exclusive of the merger
costs, net income for the three months ended September 30, 1997 increased due to
additional income while the six month period increase in net income compared to
the prior year was offset by lower gains on sales of marketable securities in
fiscal 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

As of September 30, 1997, the Company's working capital was $297,429,000
compared to $284,863,000 at March 31, 1997.  Cash and short term investments
decreased by approximately $27,416,000 during the six months ended September 30,
1997 as the Company used $23,877,000 of cash in operations and $16,646,000 in
capital expenditures offset by proceeds from the Company's employee stock
programs.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased slightly from $43,268,000 at
March 31, 1997 to $43,514,000 at September 30, 1997.  Reserves have been charged
for returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in
prior periods.  Management believes these reserves are adequate based on
historical experience and its current estimate of potential returns and
allowances.

Inventory levels at September 30, 1997 increased slightly compared to March 31,
1997 due to seasonal increases related to the upcoming holiday season and to
support growth of business worldwide.

In connection with the Company's purchases of Sony products to be distributed in
Japan, Sony of Japan requires cash deposits totaling one-third of purchase
orders.  Additionally, Nintendo of Japan requires cash deposits on all orders of
N64 cartridge products in Japan.   In lieu of letters of credit, EAV utilizes a
line of credit to fund these deposits for purchases of Sony and Nintendo
products in Japan and for other operating requirements.  At September 30, 1997,
EAV had approximately $4,100,000 outstanding on this line.

The Company's principal source of liquidity is $240,725,000 in cash and short-
term investments.  Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements for the foreseeable
future.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE
- ------------------------------------

Future operating results of the Company depend upon many factors and are subject
to various risks and uncertainties.  Some of those important risks and
uncertainties which may cause the Company's operating results to vary or which
may materially and adversely affect the Company's operating results are as
follows:

THE INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION.  The interactive software business has
historically been a volatile and highly dynamic industry affected by changing
technology, limited hardware platform life cycles, hit products, competition,
component supplies, seasonality, consumer spending and other economic trends.
The business is also intensely competitive.  A variety of companies offer
products that compete directly with one or more of the Company's products.
These direct competitors vary in size from very small companies to companies
with financial, managerial and technical resources comparable to or greater than
those of the Company.  Typically, the Company's chief competitor on dedicated
game platforms is the hardware manufacturer/licensor itself, to which the
Company must pay royalties, and in the case of Sony and Nintendo, manufacturing
charges.  For example, Sony has aggressively launched sports product lines that
directly compete with the Company's sports products on the PlayStation.  In
addition, competition for creative talent has intensified, and the attraction
and retention of key personnel by the Company is increasingly difficult.

PRODUCTS.  Interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans
of only 3 to 12 months.  In addition, the market is crowded with a large number
of titles competing for limited shelf space at retail. The Company's future
success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce new
competitive products on a timely basis and to get those products distributed
widely at retail.  To compete successfully, new products must adapt to new
hardware platforms and emerging industry standards, provide additional
functionality and be successfully distributed in numerous changing worldwide
markets.  If the Company were unable, due to resource constraints or
technological or other reasons, to successfully develop and distribute such
products in a timely manner, this inability would have a material adverse effect
on its operating results and financial condition.

DEVELOPMENT.  Product development schedules, particularly for new hardware
platforms and high-end multimedia PCs are difficult to predict because they
involve creative processes, use of new development tools for new platforms and
the learning process, research and experimentation associated with development
for new technologies.  New CD-ROM product releases are frequently including more
content and are more complex, time-consuming and costly to develop  and,
accordingly, cause additional development and scheduling risk.  For example,
Dungeon Keeper for PCCD, originally scheduled to ship in the quarter ended June
1996, shipped in the quarter ended June 1997. In addition, Warcraft 2 on 32-bit
platforms scheduled for shipment in the quarter ended June 1997, did not ship
until the quarter ended September 1997. Also, SimCity 3000, the follow on
product to SimCity 2000, was scheduled to ship in October 1997 at the time of
the merger with Maxis. Due to additional development delays, it is unlikely that
this product will ship during the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998.
Additionally, development risks for CD-ROM products can cause particular
difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead
times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter.
Manufacturing lead times during the year for CD-based products have been as
brief as one to three weeks; cartridge products more typically have had a six to
twelve week lead
<PAGE>
 
time for manufacture. The Company's revenues and earnings are dependent on its
ability to meet its product release schedule and its failure to meet those
schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts'
expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

PLATFORM CHANGES.  A large portion of the Company's revenues are derived from
the sale of products designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms
such as the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and the N64.  The interdependent nature of
the Company's business and that of its hardware licensors brings significant
risks to the Company's business.  The success of the Company's products is
significantly affected by market acceptance of the new video game hardware
systems and the life span of older hardware platforms, and the Company's ability
to accurately predict these factors with respect to each platform.  In many
cases, the Company will have expended a large amount of development and
marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems (such as the
new 32-bit systems) that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will
have continued product development for older hardware platforms that may have
shorter life cycles than the Company expected.  Conversely, if the Company does
not choose to develop for a platform that achieves significant market
acceptance, or discontinues development for a platform that has a longer life
cycle than expected, the Company's revenue growth may be adversely affected.
For example, the Company signed an agreement with Nintendo to develop and
publish a line of EA SPORTS products for the N64 in March of 1997, nearly seven
months after introduction of that platform in North America.  Due to long
development times associated with this platform, the Company will not ship more
than two N64 products under this agreement in significant during the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1998.

The Company believes that investment in products for the 32-bit market,
including both PCCD and CD-video game platforms (particularly the PlayStation)
has been strategically important in positioning the Company for the now
completed transition to 32-bit machines.  The Company continues to believe that
such investment is important and will continue its aggressive development
activities for 32-bit platforms.  Although the PlayStation has achieved
significant market acceptance in all geographic territories, there can be no
assurance that its growth will continue at the present rates, particularly with
the introduction of the N64 by Nintendo.  The introduction and market acceptance
of the N64, particularly in North America, may adversely affect the growth rate
of the 32-bit CD-platforms.  While the Company has a broad range of products
available and under development for the PlayStation and for PCCD, the Company
will not ship more than two products for the N64 in any significant quantities
until calendar year 1998, as noted above.

HARDWARE COMPANIES.  The Company's contracts with hardware licensors, which are
also some of the Company's chief competitors, often grant significant control to
the licensor over the manufacturing of the Company's products.  This fact could,
in certain circumstances, leave the Company unable to get its products
manufactured and shipped to customers.  In most events, control of the
manufacturing process by hardware companies increases both the manufacturing
lead times and the expense to the Company  as compared to the lead times and
costs that the Company can achieve independently.  For example, the Company, in
prior years, experienced delays in the manufacturing of PlayStation products
which caused delays in shipping those products.  The results of future periods
may be affected by similar delays.  Finally, the Company's contracts with its
hardware licensors often require the Company to take significant risks in
holding or 
<PAGE>
 
prepaying for its inventory of products. In particular, the Company's agreement
with Nintendo for N64 products requires prepayment of costly cartridge-based
inventory, minimum orders and no rights of return.

REVENUE AND EXPENSES.  A substantial majority of the revenue of the Company in
any quarter typically results from orders received in that quarter and products
introduced in that quarter.  The Company's expenses are based, in part, on
development of products to be released in the future.  Certain overhead and
product development expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues.  This
trend is increasing as the Company increases the proportion of products
developed internally.  As a result, the Company's quarterly results of
operations are difficult to predict, and small delays in product deliveries may
cause quarterly revenues, operating results and net income to fall significantly
below anticipated levels.  The Company typically receives orders shortly before
shipments, making backlog an unreliable indicator of quarterly results.  A
shortfall in shipments at the end of any particular quarter may cause the
results of that quarter to fall significantly short of anticipated levels.

FILM AND VIDEOTAPE. The Company produces film and videotape to include in
certain products pursuant to agreements between certain of the Company's
subsidiaries with SAG, AFTRA and Equity.  However, the costs of video production
are significantly higher than for software production, and for products which
include a substantial amount of video such as certain interactive movies, the
costs of producing the video component is significantly higher than the cost of
developing the software component.  Accordingly, more units of such products
must be sold to recoup the development and production costs.  There can be no
assurance that these products which include significant film or videotape
components will be commercially successful enough to recoup development costs.
In addition, the Company's agreements with SAG and AFTRA expire during the
current calendar year, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to renegotiate favorable terms.

GROSS MARGINS.  Gross margins as a percent of net revenues for the three and six
months ended September 30, 1997 decreased compared to the comparable prior year
period.  The decrease was mainly due to increases in the mix of lower margin
Affiliated Label revenues due to the expansion of distribution worldwide and
releases of major titles by key affiliates and the lower proportion of revenues
associated with sales of higher margin PC CD products to total revenues.

The mix in sales of the Company's products have a significant effect on gross
margins as a percentage of net revenues. If the proportion of PC CD net revenues
increase in relation to AL revenues, margins may increase. Conversely, if AL
revenues as a proportion of total revenues increase overall margins may continue
to decrease. In addition, as the Company begins to ship N64 products in
significant quantities, margins may decline due to the higher cost of goods
associated with this cartridge-based platform. Further, gross margins continue
to be affected by increases in professional and celebrity royalties. Also, while
the costs of development of new products for 32- and 64-bit systems have
increased, overall cost of goods are not declining. For products on platforms
for which the Company is required to purchase its goods from the hardware
companies, the Company is unable to achieve cost reductions through
manufacturing efficiencies, and in addition have to pay manufacturing royalties
to hardware companies. Additionally, higher distribution expenses for operations
in Europe and North America continue to put pressure on margins and retailers
also continue to require significant price protection for products. With an
increasing
<PAGE>
 
number of titles available for advanced platforms, such requirements for price
protection may increase. The Company also anticipates that retail and wholesale
prices for interactive entertainment products may decrease and gross margins may
be further adversely affected.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION.  Both the video game and PC businesses have become
increasingly "hits" driven.  Additional marketing and advertising funds are
required to drive and support "hit" products, particularly television
advertising.   There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to
produce "hit" titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

The Company has stock-balancing programs for its personal computer products
that, under certain circumstances and up to a specified amount, allow for the
exchange of personal computer products by resellers.  The Company also typically
provides for price protection for its personal computer and video game system
products that, under certain conditions, allows the reseller a price reduction
from the Company for unsold products. The Company maintains a policy of
exchanging products or giving credits, but does not give cash refunds.
Moreover, the risk of product returns may increase as new hardware platforms
become more popular or market factors force the Company to make changes in its
distribution system.  The Company monitors and manages the volume of its sales
to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking
in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for
substantial price protection in subsequent periods.  The Company believes that
it provides adequate reserves for returns and price protection which are based
on estimated future returns of products, taking into account promotional
activities, the timing of new product introductions, distributor and retailer
inventories of the Company's products and other factors, and that its current
reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection requirements for
current in-channel inventory.  However, there can be no assurance that actual
returns or price protection will not exceed the Company's reserves. See Revenue
                                                                        -------
and Expenses, above.

The distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold have
been characterized by change, including consolidations and financial
difficulties of certain distributors and retailers and the emergence of new
retailers such as general mass merchandisers.  The development of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes.  The bankruptcy or
other business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render the
Company's accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could have
an adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of the
Company.  In the quarter ended September 1996, the Company recorded $2,300,000
in bad debt expenses related to potentially uncollectible receivables from a
customer who filed for bankruptcy.  In addition, an increasing number of
companies are competing for access to these channels. The Company's arrangements
with its distributors and retailers may be terminated by either party at any
time without cause.  Distributors and retailers often carry products that
compete with those of the Company.  Retailers of the Company's products
typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources for
which there is intense competition.  There can be no assurance that distributors
and retailers will continue to purchase the Company's products or provide the
Company's products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.

EMPLOYEES.  Competition for employees in the interactive software business is
intense and increasing as competition in the industry increases.  In the last
fiscal year, recruiting 
<PAGE>
 
of the Company's employees generally, and its executive officers in particular,
has been intense. Large software and media companies frequently offer
significantly larger cash compensation than does the Company, placing pressure
on the Company's base salary and cash bonus compensation. Small start-up
companies such as those proliferating in the online business areas offer
significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies
like the Company to match without significant stockholder dilution. While
executive turnover has decreased in fiscal 1998 as compared to prior years,
virtually all of the executives continue to experience intense recruiting
pressure. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to
attract and retain enough qualified employees in the future.

FOREIGN SALES AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  For the six months ended September 30,
1997 and for the  fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, international net revenues
comprised 44% and 45% of total consolidated net revenues, respectively.  The
Company expects foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and
growing portion of the Company's revenues.  Such sales are subject to unexpected
regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers.  Additionally, foreign
sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate.  There can be
no assurance that these or other factors will not have an adverse effect on the
Company's future operating results.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  The Company has a number
of equity investments in affiliates, including small developers, such as
Firaxis; other publishers, such as Accolade, Inc. and Stormfront; and new
ventures such as Mpath Interactive.  Additionally, the Company has equity
investments in the 3DO Company and in 3Dfx, a developer of advanced graphics
microchips for personal computers.  These companies are generally small and
without significant financial resources.  Financial difficulties for any of
these companies could cause a reduction in the value of the Company's
investment.  For example, in fiscal 1996 the Company wrote off its investment in
SportsLab in its entirety.

FLUCTUATIONS IN STOCK PRICE.  Due to analysts' expectations of continued growth
and other factors, any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's Common Stock in
any given period.  As a result of the factors discussed in this quarterly report
and other factors that may arise in the future, the market price of the
Company's Common Stock historically has been, and may continue to be subject to
significant fluctuations over a short period of time.  These fluctuations may be
due to factors specific to the Company, to changes in analysts' earnings
estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment, media
or electronics industries or the securities markets in general.  For example,
during the most recently completed fiscal year, the price per share of the
Company's common stock ranged from $24.75 to $39.13 and in the first six months
of the current fiscal year ranged from $20.13 to $37.50.

SEASONALITY. The Company's business is highly seasonal.  The Company typically
experiences its highest revenues and profits in the calendar year-end holiday
season and a seasonal low in revenues and profits in the quarter ending in June.

ACQUISITION OF MAXIS, INC.  On July 25, 1997, the Company and Maxis, Inc.
completed a merger of the two companies. The Company incurred aggregate direct
transaction costs of approximately $2.8 million associated with the merger, as
well as, approximately $8.0 million in costs associated with integrating the two
companies.  These costs were 
<PAGE>
 
recognized as a one time charge to operations in the quarter ended September
30, 1997. Actual costs may exceed the estimates already recorded as
unanticipated expenses associated with the integration of the two companies may
arise. Accordingly, the Company may incur additional material charges in
subsequent quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the integration
of the two companies.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance
should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in
future periods.
