Note 6. Acquisitions

In July 1998,  the  Company  acquired  ABC  Software  AG and ABC  Software  GmbH
(collectively "ABC"), independent distributors of entertainment, edutainment and
application software in Switzerland and Austria, respectively, for approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash acquired of  $5,099,000)  and $570,000 in other
consideration. The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method.
The  excess  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of the net  tangible  assets
acquired of  approximately  $7,377,000  was  allocated  to goodwill and is being
amortized over 7 years.

In September 1998, the Company  completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of the  Irvine,  California  - based  Virgin  Studio
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction  expenses.  The  excess  purchase  price  over of the  net  tangible
liabilities  assumed was $129,982,000 of which, based on management's  estimates
prepared in conjuction with a third party valuation consultant,  $41,836,000 was
allocated to purchased  in-process  research and development and $88,146,000 was
allocated to other intangible  assets.  Amounts  allocated to other  intangibles
include franchise trade names of $32,357,000, existing technology of $6,510,000,
workforces  of  $1,680,000  and  other  goodwill  of  $47,599,000  and are being
amortized  over lives  ranging from two to twelve  years.  Purchased  in-process
research and development includes the value of products in the development stage
that are not  considered to have reached  technological  feasibility  or to have
alternative future use. Accordingly, this non-recurring item was expensed in the
Consolidated  Statement of Operations upon consummation of the acquisition.  The
non-recurring  charge for  in-process  research and  development  reduced  basic
earnings per share by approximately  $0.59 in the fiscal second quarter of 1999.
The results of  operations  of Westwood and the  estimated  fair value of assets
acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  are  included  in the  Company's  financial
statements from the date of acquisition.

Note 7. Earnings Per Share
<TABLE>
The following summarizes the computation of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS") and
Diluted   EPS.   Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net   earnings   divided  by  the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method (in thousands except per share amounts):

Note 8.  New Accounting Pronouncement

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is effective for all fiscal quarters  beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company
is determining the effect of SFAS 133 on its financial statements.

In March 1998, the American  Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  issued
Statement  of  Position  ("SOP  98-1"),  Accounting  for the  Costs of  Computer
Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires that certain
costs  related to the  development  or  purchase  of  internal-use  software  be
capitalized  and amortized over the estimated  useful life of the software.  SOP
98-1 is effective for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning
after December 15, 1998. The Company does not expect the adoption of SOP 98-1 to
have a material impact on its results of operation.

The Company derives revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software,
which   includes  EA  Studio   Compact  Disk  ("CD")   products  for   dedicated
entertainment  systems  ("CD-video  games"),  EA  Studio  CD  personal  computer
products  ("PC-CD"),  EA Studio  cartridge  products and Affiliated Label ("AL")
products that are published by third parties and  distributed by EA. The Company
also derives  revenues from  licensing of EA Studio  products and AL products to
hardware companies ("OEMs") and online subscription revenues.

North America net revenues increased $66,479,000,  or 55.1%, and $79,344,000, or
44.9%,  for the three and six months ended  September  30,  1998,  respectively,
compared to the same periods last year. This increase was due to strong sales of
Nintendo 64 ("N64") and PlayStation titles including Madden NFL 99 and NASCAR 99
for both platforms which were both released in the second fiscal quarter.  Total
North America N64 revenues  increased  $44,388,000 and $49,951,000 for the three
and six month periods,  respectively,  as compared to the same periods last year
due to the release of two titles for this platform in the second fiscal  quarter
and one in the first fiscal  quarter versus no releases in the

                                       12
<PAGE>

same periods last year.  For the three and six months ended  September 30, 1998,
PlayStation   net  revenues  for  North  America   increased   $21,112,000   and
$37,029,000,  respectively,  in comparison to the same periods last year. Though
North  America's  net  revenues are expected to continue to grow in fiscal 1999,
the Company does not expect to maintain these growth rates.

International net revenues decreased $10,544,000,  or 15.2% for the three months
ended  September 30, 1998 compared to the same period last year. The decrease in
international  revenues was primarily attributable to lower sales in Europe as a
result of the  timing of  available  new  product  releases  applicable  to that
marketplace.  Total net revenues in Europe were $45,732,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 1998 compared to $54,520,000 for the same period last year.

For  the six  months  ended  September  30,  1998,  international  net  revenues
increased  $31,100,000,  or 22.8%,  compared to the same  period last year.  The
increase in  international  revenues  was  attributable  to a growth in sales in
Europe and Japan primarily attributable to the success of World Cup 98 in Europe
and FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98 in Japan,  respectively,  which  released in the
quarter ended June 30, 1998. Total net revenues in Europe were  $132,526,000 for
the six months ended  September 30, 1998 compared to  $107,201,000  for the same
period last year.  For the six months  ended  September  30,  1998,  Japan sales
increased by 75.9% to $18,839,000  compared to  $10,713,000  for the same period
last year.

International  sales were also affected by a decline in net revenue in Japan and
the Asia Pacific regions due to weaknesses of local  currencies  compared to the
prior year. Though sales in local currencies  increased from the prior year, net
revenues in the Asia  Pacific  region  decreased by 9.7% to  $8,061,000  for the
three months ended September 30, 1998 compared to $8,929,000 for the same period
last year.  For the six months ended  September  30, 1998,  net revenues in Asia
Pacific  decreased  12.5% to $16,424,000  compared to  $18,775,000  for the same
period last year.  Sales in Japan for the three months ended  September 30, 1998
decreased by 15.4% to $4,889,000 primarily due to exchange rate comparisons. For
the six months ended  September  30, 1998,  the exchange rate  comparisons  were
offset by the success of FIFA: Road to World Cup 98, as noted above.

The Company  released  seven 32-bit  CD-video  game  products  during the second
quarter of fiscal 1999 comprised solely of titles for the PlayStation, including
Madden NFL 99, NASCAR 99, NCAA Football 99, NHL 99 and Moto-Racer 2, compared to
eight  PlayStation  and two Saturn  games for the same  period  last  year.  The
increase in 32-bit sales for the three and six months ended  September  30, 1998
compared to the prior year was  attributable  to the greater  installed  base of
PlayStation consoles, the related release of

                                       13
<PAGE>

key titles  for this  platform  during the  quarter  and  strong  catalog  sales
partially offset by a decline in Saturn revenues.

For the three and six months ended  September 30, 1998,  PlayStation  sales were
$97,891,000  and  $193,848,000,   respectively,   compared  to  $85,645,000  and
$124,662,000 in the comprable  prior year periods.  For the three and six months
ended September 30, 1998 PlayStation  sales grew 14.3% and 55.5%,  respectively.
The Company expects  revenues from  PlayStation  products to continue to grow in
fiscal 1999, but as revenues for these products  increase,  the Company does not
expect to maintain the rates achieved in fiscal 1998 again in fiscal 1999.

Net revenues  from the sale of other 32-bit  products,  primarily  from sales of
products for Saturn,  were  $337,000 for the quarter  ended  September  30, 1998
compared to $5,212,000 for the same period in the prior year. For the six months
ended  September  30, 1998 and 1997 other  32-bit  revenues  were  $624,000  and
$9,425,000, respectively.

The  Company  released  nine PC-CD  titles in the second  quarter of the current
fiscal year for the IBM personal  computer and  compatibles  including  Need for
Speed III: Hot Pursuit, compared to five for the same period last year.

Sales of PC-CD products for the three months ended  September 30, 1998 were flat
compared  to the prior year as  increased  North  America  sales were  offset by
decreases  in the  international  territories.  The  decrease  in sales of PC-CD
products for the six months ended  September 30, 1998 is primarily  attributable
to a decline in sales of Maxis titles for this period.

The Company  released two N64 titles in the second quarter of the current fiscal
year  compared to no new releases in the prior year.  For the three months ended
September 30, 1998 the increase in N64 revenues was due to the release of Madden
NFL 99 and NASCAR 99. For the six months ended  September  30,  1998,  net sales
increased due to the successful  first quarter release of World Cup 98 primarily
in Europe.  Sales of N64 products  are  expected to grow in fiscal 1999,  but as
revenues for these products increase, they may not grow at the current rate.

Under  the  terms  of  the  N64  Agreement,  the  Company  engages  Nintendo  to
manufacture its N64 cartridges for distribution by the Company. Accordingly, the
Company has little ability to control its supply of N64 cartridges or the timing
of their delivery.

In connection with the Company's purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution in
North America,  Nintendo requires the Company to provide  irrevocable letters of
credit prior to Nintendo's  acceptance  of purchase  orders from the Company for
purchases of these cartridges.  For purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution
in Japan and  Europe,  Nintendo  requires  the  Company  to make cash  deposits.
Furthermore,  Nintendo  maintains  a  policy  of not  accepting  returns  of N64
cartidges.  Because of these and other factors,  the carrying of an inventory of
cartridges entails significant capital and risk. See Hardware Companies, below.

The  increase  in  Affiliated  Label net  revenues  for the three  months  ended
September  30, 1998 was  primarily  due to sales of Parasite  Eve  published  by
Square  EA which was  released  in the  second  fiscal  quarter  of 1999 and the
acquisition of ABC, an independent  software distributor of primarily Affiliated
Label  products in  Switzerland  and Austria,  in July 1998.  This  increase was
partially  offset by a decline in sales of Jurassic  Park which  released in the
comparable  prior year quarter.  Additionally,  the increase in AL sales for the
three and six  months  ended  September  30,  1998 was  offset as the prior year
periods included sales of products from Creative Wonders, an affiliate which was
sold in the third fiscal quarter of 1998.

Cost of goods sold as a  percentage  of net  revenues for the three months ended
September  30,  1998 was  comparable  to the  same  period  last  year due to an
increase  in sales  of N64  products,  offset  by a  decrease  in sales of PC-CD
products.  For the six months ended  September 30, 1998, cost of goods sold as a
percentage  of revenues  decreased  due to an  increase in sales of  PlayStation
products,  offset by a decrease in sales of higher margin PC-CD  products and an
increase in lower margin N64 product sales

The increase in marketing and sales  expenses for the three and six months ended
September 30, 1998 was primarily  attributable to increased television and print
advertising  to support  new  releases  and  increased  cooperative  advertising
associated  with higher  revenues in North America and Europe as compared to the
prior  year  periods.  Marketing  and  sales  expenses  also  increased  due  to
additional  headcount  related  to the  continued  expansion  of  the  Company's
worldwide  distribution  business.  Increases were  partially  offset by savings
attributable to the acquisition of Maxis, Inc. in July, 1997.

The increase in research and  development  expenses for the three and six months

attributable to the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios Inc. and certain assets of
the  Irvine,  California  - based  Vigin  Studio  (collectively  "Westwood")  in
September 1998 and Tiburon Entertainment, Inc. in April 1998, higher development
costs per title and an increase in support for Ultima Online.

In  connection  with the  purchase of Westwood in  September  1998,  the Company
allocated  $41,836,000 of the $122,688,000 purchase price to in-process research
and development  projects.  This allocation  represents the estimated fair value
based on  risk-adjusted  cash  flows  related  to the  incomplete  research  and
development projects. At the date of acquisition,  this amount was expensed as a
non-recurring   charge  as  the  in-process   technology  had  not  yet  reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Westwood had three
major PC-CD projects in progress at the time of the acquisition including two in
the  best-selling  franchise  Command  and  Conquer  and  one in the  critically
acclaimed  Lands of Lore series.  Costs to complete these  projects,  as well as
several other projects acquired,  are expected to be approximately $9.1 million,
$10.6 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.  The
Company  currently  expects to complete  the  development  of these  projects at
various dates through fiscal 2001 and to publish the products upon completion.

The nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology
into commercially  viable products  principally  relate to the completion of all
planning,  designing  and testing  activities  necessary to  establish  that the
product  can be produced to meet its design  requirements  including  functions,
features and technical  performance  requirements.  Though the Company currently
expects that the acquired in process technology will be successfully  developed,
there can be no  assurance  that  commercial  or  technical  viability  of these
products will be achieved. Furthermore, future developments in the entertainment
software industry, changes in computer or videogame console technology,  changes
in other product offerings or other  developments may cause the Company to alter
or abandon these plans.

The  value  assigned  to  purchased  in-process  technology  was  determined  by
estimating the completion  percentage of research and development efforts at the
acquisition date,  forecasting risk adjusted revenues considering the completion
percentage,  estimating  the  resulting  net cash  flows from the  projects  and
discounting  the  net  cash  flows  to  their  present  values.  The  completion
percentages  were  estimated  based on cost incurred to date,  importance of the
completed  development  tasks and the elapsed portion of the total project time.
The revenue projection used to value the in-process  research and development is
based on unit sales  forecasts for worldwide  sales  territories and adjusted to
consider only the revenue related to development  achievements  completed at the
acquisition  date. Net cash flow estimates include cost of goods sold and sales,
marketing and general and administrative  expenses and taxes forecasted based on
historical operating characteristics.  In addition, net cash flow estimates were
adjusted to allow for fair return on working  capital and fixed assets,  charges
for  franchise  and  technology  leverage  and return on other  intangibles.  An
appropriate risk adjusted  discount rate was used to discount the net cash flows
back to their  present  value.  The  remaining  identified  intangibles  will be
amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over two to twelve years based on expected
useful  lives of  franchise  tradenames,  existing  products  and  technologies,
retention of workforce,  and other intangible  assets. If these projects are not
successfully  developed,  the Company may not realize the value  assigned to the
in-process research and development  projects.  In addition,  the value of other
acquired intangible assets may also become impaired.

For the six months ended September 30, 1998, the charge for in-process  research
and development also included write-offs  associated with the acquisition of two
software development companies in the first quarter of fiscal 1999.

</TABLE>
The Company's  effective  tax rate for the three and six months ended  September
30, 1998 was  negatively  affected as there was no tax  benefit  recorded  for a
portion of the charges related to the acquired in-process technology.  Excluding
the effect of these charges, the effective tax rate for the three and six months
ended  September  30, 1998 would have been 33.0% as compared to a 34.5% tax rate
in the  corresponding  prior  year  periods.  The  lower  rate of 33.0%  results
primarily  from having a higher  estimated  proportion of  international  income
subject to a lower foreign effective tax rate for the fiscal year.

minority  interest  for the  three  and six  months  ended  September  30,  1998
represents Square's 30% interest in the net income of EA Square KK.

For the three and six months ended  September  30, 1997,  the minority  interest
represented  the 35% interest in Electronic  Arts Victor ("EAV") owned by Victor
Entertainment  Industries,  Inc. ("VEI"). The Company acquired the remaining 35%
minority  ownership  interest in EAV held by VEI in December  1997.  No minority
interest in EAV was recorded for the losses  generated in the three months ended
September  30, 1997 as VEI's  interest in the net equity of EAV had fallen below
zero.

The decrease in net income for the three and six months ended September 30, 1998
as compared to the prior year  period was  primarily  related to the charges for
acquired  in-process  technology  as well as higher  product  development  costs
associated  with the  acquisition  of new  studios  partially  offset  by higher
revenues and gross  profits.  For the three and six months ended  September  30,
1997,  net income  was  reduced  by merger  costs in the  amount of  $10,792,000
associated with the acquisition of Maxis, Inc.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of  September  30,  1998,  the  Company's  working  capital was  $255,421,000
compared to  $408,098,000  at March 31, 1998.  Cash and  short-term  investments
decreased by  approximately  $214,221,000  during the six months ended September
30, 1998 as the Company used  $30,586,000 of cash in operations and  $67,871,000
in capital  expenditures,  $134,493,000 in the  acquisition of new  subsidiaries
offset by proceeds from the Company's employee stock programs.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from $51,575,000 at March 31,
1998 to  $56,543,000  at  September  30,  1998.  Reserves  have been charged for
returns of product and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in
prior  periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves  are  adequate  based  on
historical  experience  and  its  current  estimate  of  potential  returns  and
allowances.

The  Company's  principal  source  of  liquidity  is  $160,339,000  in cash  and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment  requirements for the foreseeable
future.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

         Background of Year 2000 Issues

         Many currently  installed  computer  systems and software  products are
unable to distinguish  between twentieth century dates and twenty-first  century
dates because such systems may have been developed  using two digits rather than
four to determine the applicable year. For example,  computer programs that have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than  the  year  2000.   This  error   could   result  in  system   failures  or
miscalculations  causing  disruptions  of  operations,  including,  among  other
things, a temporary inability to process  transactions,  send invoices or engage
in similar normal business activities. As a result, many companies' software and
computer  systems  may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such "Year
2000" requirements.

         State of Readiness

         The  Company's  business  is  dependent  on the  operation  of numerous
systems that could potentially be impacted by Year 2000 related problems.  Those
systems include, among others: hardware and software systems used by the Company
to  deliver  products  to its  customers  communications  networks  such  as the
Internet and private  intranets,  which the Company depends on to receive orders
from products to its customers;  the internal systems of the Company's customers
and  suppliers;  products sold to customers;  the hardware and software  systems
used  internally  by  the  Company  in  the  management  of  its  business;  and
non-information  technology  systems  and  services  used by the  Company in the
management  of its  business,  such as power,  telephone  systems  and  building
systems.

         Based on an analysis of the systems potentially  impacted by conducting
business in the twenty-first  century, the Company is applying a phased approach
to making such systems, and accordingly, the Company's operations, ready for the
year 2000.  Beyond  awareness of the issues and scope of systems  involved,  the
phases of activities in progress include:  an assessment of specific  underlying
computer systems, programs and hardware;  renovation replacement or redeployment
of Year 2000 non-compliant technology; validation and testing of technologically
compliant Year 2000  solutions;  and  implementation  of the Year 2000 compliant
systems.

                                       21

<PAGE>

         As a third party providing software products,  the Company is dependent
on the  hardware  and  software  products  used to  deliver  such  products  and
services. If such products are inoperable due to Year 2000 issues, the Company's
business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  results  operations  could be
adversely affected.  An inventory of the Company's internal business systems has
been  completed and planned  software and hardware  upgrades to ensure Year 2000
compliance  are in process.  The  upgrades to these  systems are  expected to be
completed by June 1999.

         Costs

         To date the Company has not incurred significant costs directly related
to Year 2000 issues,  even in cases where non-compliant  information  technology
systems were redeployed or replaced.

The Company  believes that future  expenditures to upgrade  internal systems and
applications will not have a material adverse effect on its business,  financial
condition  and  results of  operations  and are  primarily  included  within the
Company's  ongoing  system  development  plan. In addition,  while the potential
costs of redeploying  personnel and of any delays in implementing other projects
is not known, the costs are anticipated to be immaterial.

         Risks of the Year 2000 Issues

         The Company's financial information systems include an integrated suite
of business  applications  developed and supported by Oracle Corporation.  These
applications systems currently support daily operations in the United States and
Europe.  Based on  representations  made by Oracle  Corporation and upon limited
tests by the  Company,  the  Company  believes  these  systems  to be Year  2000
compliant.

         The Company  believes  its software  products are Year 2000  compliant;
however, success of the Company's Year 2000 compliance efforts may depend on the
success  of  its  customers  dealing  with  their  Year  2000  issues.  Customer
difficulties  with  Year  2000  issues  might  require  the  Company  to  devote
additional resources to resolve underlying  problems.  Failures of the Company's
and/or third parties'  computer  systems could have a material adverse impact on
the Company's ability to conduct business. For example, a significant percentage
of purchase orders received from the Company's  customers are computer generated
and  electronically  transmitted.  In  addition,  the Year 2000 could affect the
ability of consumers to use the PC based  products  sold by the Company.  If the
computer systems on which the consumers use the Company's  products are not Year
2000 compliant,  such  noncompliance  could affect the consumers  ability to use
such products.

         Contingency Plans

         The Company continues to assess certain of its Year 2000 exposure areas
in order to determine  what  additional  steps beyond  those  identified  by the
Company's  internal review in the United States are advisable.  The Company does
not presently  have a contingency  plan for handling Year 2000 problems that are
not detected and corrected prior to their occurrence. Any failure of the Company
to address any unforeseen Year 2000 issue could  adversely  affect the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union
are  scheduled  to establish  fixed  conversion  rates  between  their  existing
currencies  (the "legacy  currency")  and the one common legal currency known as
the "Euro".  From January 1, 1999 through  June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be
able to use their legacy currencies or the Euro to transact business. By July 1,
2002, at the latest,  the  conversion to the Euro will be complete at which time
the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender. The conversion to the Euro
will eliminate currency exchange rate risk between the member countries.

The Company does not anticipate any material  impact from the Euro conversion on
its  financial   information  systems  which  currently   accommodate   multiple
currencies.  Computer  software  changes  necessary to comply with the Year 2000
issue are  generally  compliant to the Euro  conversion  issue.  Due to numerous
uncertainties,  the Company cannot reasonably  estimate the effect that the Euro
conversion issue will have on its pricing or market strategies,  and the impact,
if any, it will have on its financial condition and result of operations.

Factors Affecting Future Performance

Future operating results of the Company depend upon many factors and are subject
to  various  risks  and  uncertainties.   Some  of  those  important  risks  and
uncertainties  which may cause the Company's  operating results to vary or which
may  materially  and  adversely  affect the Company's  operating  results are as
follows:

The Industry and Competition. The interactive software business has historically
been a volatile and highly  dynamic  industry  affected by changing  technology,
limited  hardware  platform life cycles,  hit products,  competition,  component
supplies, seasonality, consumer spending and other economic trends. The business
is also  intensely  competitive.  A variety of  companies  offer  products  that
compete  directly  with  one or more of the  Company's  products.  These  direct
competitors  vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial,
managerial  and technical  resources  comparable to or greater than those of the
Company.  Typically,  the Company's chief competitor on dedicated game platforms
is the  hardware  manufacturer/licensor  itself,  to which the Company  must pay
royalties,  and in the case of Sony and  Nintendo,  manufacturing  charges.  For
example,  Sony has  aggressively  launched  sports  product  lines that directly
compete with the  Company's  sports  products on the  PlayStation.  In addition,
competition  for  creative  talent  has  intensified,  and  the  attraction  and
retention of key personnel by the Company is increasingly difficult.

Products.  Interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans
of only 3 to 12 months. In addition, the packaged goods market is crowded with a
large number of titles  competing for limited retail shelf space.  The Company's
future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce
new competitive products on a timely basis and, in the packaged goods market, to
get those products  distributed widely at retail. To compete  successfully,  new
products must adapt to new hardware  platforms and emerging industry  standards,
provide additional content and functionality and be successfully  distributed in
numerous changing worldwide markets. If the Company were unable, due to resource
constraints or  technological  or other  reasons,  to  successfully  develop and
distribute  such  products  in a timely  manner,  this  inability  would  have a
material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition.

Development.  Product  development  schedules,  particularly  for  new  hardware
platforms  and high-end  multimedia  PCs are  difficult to predict  because they
involve creative  processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms and
the learning process,  research and experimentation  associated with development
for new technologies.  CD-ROM products  frequently  include more content and are
more  complex,  time-consuming  and costly to develop  and,  accordingly,  cause
additional development and scheduling risk than earlier generation products. For
example, Populous 3 for PC-CD and PlayStation were scheduled for shipment in the
fiscal  year ended  March 31,  1998 are now  expected to ship in the fiscal year
ending  March 31, 1999.  Also,  SimCity  3000,  the follow on product to SimCity
2000, was expected to ship in fiscal 1998, at the time of the merger with Maxis.
Due to additional  development  delays,  it is anticipated that this product may
not ship until the fourth  fiscal  quarter  of 1999.  Additionally,  development
risks for  CD-ROM  products  can cause  particular  difficulties  in  predicting
quarterly  results  because  brief  manufacturing  lead times  allow  finalizing
products and projected release dates late in a quarter.  The Company's  revenues
and earnings are dependent on its ability to meet its product release  schedule.
Its failure to meet those  schedules could result in revenues and earnings which
fall short of analysts'  expectations for any individual  quarter and the fiscal
year.

Platform Changes. A large portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the
sale of products  designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms such
as the  PlayStation  and the N64.  The  interdependent  nature of the  Company's
business  and that of its hardware  licensors  brings  significant  risks to the
Company's  business.  The success of the  Company's  products  is  significantly
affected by market  acceptance  of the new video game  hardware  systems and the
life

                                       24

<PAGE>

span of older  hardware  platforms,  and the  Company's  ability  to  accurately
predict these factors with respect to each platform.  In some cases, the Company
will have  expended a large amount of  development  and  marketing  resources on
products  designed for new video game  systems that have not yet achieved  large
installed  bases or will have continued  product  development for older hardware
platforms  that  may  have  shorter  life  cycles  than  the  Company  expected.
Conversely,  if the  Company  does not  choose to develop  for a  platform  that
achieves  significant  market  acceptance,  or  discontinues  development  for a
platform  that has a longer  life cycle than  expected,  the  Company's  revenue
growth may be adversely affected.  For example,  Sega has announced that it will
introduce its next generation console platform,  Dreamcast, in Japan in December
1998,  and it is expected to be released in North America in late calendar 1999.
The market  acceptance of this  platform may affect the revenue  growth on other
platforms for which the Company currently develops.

Multiplayer  Online  Gaming.   While  the  Company  does  not  currently  derive
significant  revenues from online games,  the Company  believes that multiplayer
online gaming will become a more  significant  factor in the Company's  business
and in the interactive gaming business  generally in the future.  Online gaming,
and particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as the Company's Ultima Online
product,  has at least four general areas of risk not currently  associated with
most packaged good sales.  First,  the speed and reliability of the internet and
the performance of the players'  internet service provider are not controlled by
the Company but impact game  performance.  Second,  in  "massively  multiplayer"
games such as Ultima Online,  unanticipated player conduct significantly affects
the  performance  of the game,  and social  issues  raised by  players'  conduct
frequently determine player  satisfaction.  The Company's ability to effectively
proctor such games is uncertain.  Third,  the current  business  model is as yet
experimental  and maybe  unsustainable;  whether  revenues  will  continue to be
sufficient to maintain the significant support,  service and product enhancement
demands of online  users is  uncertain.  The  Company has little  experience  in
pricing  strategies  for online  games or in  predicting  usage  patterns of its
customers.  Finally,  the legal  standards that may apply to online products are
uncertain;  the Company has recently been sued in an action alleging  defects in
Ultima  Online,  regulation  of the  internet  and the  content  it  carries  is
regularly  proposed  by  various  legislators,  and  piracy of  online  games is
difficult to prosecute under existing  intellectual property laws. The viability
of this segment,  generally, and the Company's ability to compete in the segment
will depend  significantly  on these and other  factors  outside  the  Company's
control.

Hardware Companies.  The Company's contracts with hardware licensors,  which are
also some of the Company's chief competitors, often grant significant control to
the licensor over the manufacturing of the Company's products.  This fact could,
in  certain  circumstances,  leave  the  Company  unable  to  get  its  products
manufactured  and  shipped  to  customers.   In  most  events,  control  of  the
manufacturing  process by hardware  companies  increases both the  manufacturing
lead times and the  expense to the  Company  as  compared  to the lead times and
costs that the Company can achieve  independently.  For example, the Company, in
prior years,  experienced  delays in the  manufacturing of PlayStation  products
which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The results of future periods
may be affected by similar  delays.  Finally,  the Company's  contracts with its
hardware  licensors  often  require  the  Company to take  significant  risks in
holding or prepaying for its inventory of products. In particular, the Company's
agreement  with  Nintendo  for  N64  products  requires   prepayment  of  costly
cartridge-based inventory, minimum orders and no rights of return.

Revenue and Expenses.  A  substantial  majority of the revenue of the Company in
any quarter  typically  results from orders received and products  introduced in
that quarter.  The Company's  expenses are based,  in part,  on  development  of
products to be released in the future.  Certain overhead and product development
expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues.  This trend is increasing
as the Company increases the proportion of products developed  internally.  As a
result, the Company's  quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict,
and small delays in product deliveries may cause quarterly  revenues,  operating
results  and net income to fall  significantly  below  anticipated  levels.  The
Company typically  receives orders shortly before

                                       25

<PAGE>

shipments,  making  backlog an  unreliable  indicator  of quarterly  results.  A
shortfall  in  shipments  at the end of any  particular  quarter  may  cause the
results of that quarter to fall significantly short of anticipated levels.

Gross  Margins.  Though  gross  margins  for the  Company's  products as a whole
increased for the six months ended  September 30, 1998, the Company expects that
margins  may be  comparable  to or decline  from  fiscal 1998 levels for several
reasons.  First,  the mix in sales of the  Company's  products has a significant
effect on gross margins. As the Company releases more N64 products,  which carry
significantly lower margins due to high cost of goods, overall gross margins may
decline.  Similarly,  if the proportion of AL revenues  increases in relation to
other revenues,  margins may also decline. Further, gross margins continue to be
affected by increases in professional and celebrity  license fees and royalties.
Also,  while the costs of  development  of new  products  for  32-bit and 64-bit
systems have increased,  overall costs of goods are not declining significantly.
For  products on  platforms  for which the  Company is required to purchase  its
goods  from the  hardware  companies,  the  Company  is unable to  achieve  cost
reductions   through   manufacturing   efficiencies,   and  in  addition,   pays
manufacturing royalties to hardware companies. Additionally,  retailers continue
to require significant price protection for products.  With an increasing number
of  titles  available  for  advanced  platforms,  such  requirements  for  price
protection may increase.  The Company also anticipates that retail and wholesale
prices for interactive entertainment products may decrease and gross margins may
be further adversely affected.

Marketing and  Distribution.  Both the video game and PC businesses  have become
increasingly  "hits"  driven.  Additional  marketing and  advertising  funds are
required to drive and support  "hit"  products,  particularly  expenditures  for
television advertising. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue
to produce "hit" titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

The Company has  stock-balancing  programs  for its personal  computer  products
that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount,  allow for the
exchange of personal computer products by resellers.  The Company also typically
provides for price  protection  for its personal  computer and video game system
products that, under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price reduction
from the  Company  for  unsold  products.  The  Company  maintains  a policy  of
exchanging products or giving credits, but does not give cash refunds. Moreover,
the risk of product returns may increase as new hardware  platforms  become more
popular or market factors force the Company to make changes in its  distribution
system.  The Company  monitors  and manages the volume of its sales to retailers
and  distributors  and their  inventories  as  substantial  overstocking  in the
distribution  channel  can  result  in  high  returns  or  the  requirement  for
substantial price protection in subsequent periods. The Company believes that it
provides  adequate  reserves for returns and price protection which are based on
estimated   future  returns  of  products,   taking  into  account   promotional
activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer
inventories of the Company's  products and other  factors,  and that its current
reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection requirements for
current  in-channel  inventory.  However,  there can be no assurance that actual
returns or price protection will not exceed the Company's reserves.  See Revenue
and Expenses, above.

The distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold have
been   characterized   by  change,   including   consolidations   and  financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer could render the Company's
accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible,  which could have an adverse
effect on the  operating  results and  financial  condition of the  Company.  In
addition,  an  increasing  number of companies are competing for access to these
channels.  The Company's arrangements with its distributors and retailers may be
terminated by either party at any time without cause. Distributors and retailers
often carry  products  that compete with those of the Company.  Retailers

                                       26

<PAGE>

of the Company's  products  typically  have a limited  amount of shelf space and
promotional  resources for which there is intense  competition.  There can be no
assurance  that  distributors  and  retailers  will  continue  to  purchase  the
Company's  products or provide the Company's  products  with adequate  levels of
shelf space and promotional support.

Employees.  Competition  for  employees  in the  interactive  software  business
continues to be intense.  Large software and media  companies  frequently  offer
significantly  larger cash compensation than does the Company,  placing pressure
on the  Company's  base  salary  and cash  bonus  compensation.  Small  start-up
companies  such as  those  proliferating  in the  online  business  areas  offer
significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies
like the  Company  to match  without  significant  stockholder  dilution.  While
executive  turnover  decreased  in  fiscal  1998  and for the six  months  ended
September 30, 1998 as compared to prior periods, many key executives continue to
experience  intense  recruiting  pressure.  There can be no  assurance  that the
Company  will be  able to  continue  to  attract  and  retain  enough  qualified
employees in the future.

Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations.  For the six months ended September 30,
1998 and the fiscal  year  ended  March 31,  1998,  international  net  revenues
comprised  40% and 43% of total  consolidated  net revenues,  respectively.  The
Company expects  foreign sales to continue to account for a significant  portion
of the  Company's  revenues.  Such sales are  subject to  unexpected  regulatory
requirements,  tariffs  and  other  barriers.  Additionally,  foreign  sales are
primarily made in local currencies  which may fluctuate.  As a result of current
economic  conditions  in Asia,  the  Company is subject  to  additional  foreign
currency  risk.  Though the  Company  does not  currently  derive a  significant
portion  of  revenues  and  operating  profits  from  sales  in Asia  and  other
developing  countries,  the Company's  foreign currency exposure may increase as
the Company's  operations in these countries grow and if current economic trends
in Asia continue. There can be no assurance that these or other factors will not
have an adverse effect on the Company's future operating results.

Investments  in  Affiliates.  The Company has a number of equity  investments in
affiliates,  including small developers, such as Firaxis; other publishers, such
as Accolade, Inc., The 3DO Company and NovaLogic, Inc.; and new ventures such as
Mpath Interactive. Additionally, the Company has a minority investment in Square
Electronic  Arts,  LLC, a joint venture between the Company and Square Co., Ltd.
These  companies  are  generally  small and may not have  significant  financial
resources.  Financial  difficulties  for any of these  companies  could  cause a
reduction in the value of the Company's investment.

Fluctuations in Stock Price.  Due to analysts'  expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock in
any given period.  As a result of the factors discussed in this quarterly report
and  other  factors  that  may  arise in the  future,  the  market  price of the
Company's common stock  historically has been, and may continue to be subject to
significant  fluctuations over a short period of time. These fluctuations may be
due to  factors  specific  to the  Company,  to changes  in  analysts'  earnings
estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment,  media
or  electronics  industries or the securities  markets in general.  For example,
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 the price per share of the Company's
common stock  ranged from $20.13 to $46.94 and from $38.13 to $55.56  during the
six months ended September 30, 1998.

Seasonality.  The Company's  business is highly seasonal.  The Company typically
experiences its highest  revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end  holiday
season and a seasonal  low in revenues and profits  during the  quarters  ending
June and September.


Because  of the  foregoing  factors,  as well as  other  factors  affecting  the
Company's operating results and financial condition,  past financial performance
should  not be  considered  a  reliable

                                       27

indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

         The Company is subject to pending claims. Management,  after review and
