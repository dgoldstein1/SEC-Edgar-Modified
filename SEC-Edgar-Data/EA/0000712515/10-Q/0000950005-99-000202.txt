income in North America for the three and nine months ended December 31, 1998 as
compared to the prior year periods was attributable to the allocation of certain
research  and  development  expenses  relative to a new  worldwide  cost sharing
agreement.

Note 6. Acquisitions

In July 1998,  the  Company  acquired  ABC  Software  AG and ABC  Software  GmbH
(collectively "ABC"), independent distributors of entertainment, edutainment and
application software in Switzerland and Austria, respectively, for approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash acquired of  $5,099,000)  and $570,000 in other
consideration. The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method.
The  excess  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of the net  tangible  assets
acquired of  approximately  $7,377,000  was  allocated  to goodwill and is being
amortized over 7 years.

In September 1998, the Company  completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of the  Irvine,  California  - based  Virgin  Studio
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction  expenses.  The preliminary  allocation of the excess purchase price
over the net tangible  liabilities  assumed was $129,982,000 of which,  based on
management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation
consultant,  $41,836,000  was  allocated  to purchased  in-process  research and
development and $88,146,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts
allocated to other  intangibles  include  franchise  trade names of $32,357,000,
existing  technology of $6,510,000,  workforces of $1,680,000 and other goodwill
of  $47,599,000  and are being  amortized  over lives ranging from two to twelve
years.  Purchased  in-process  research  and  development  includes the value of
products  in the  development  stage  that are not  considered  to have  reached
technological  feasibility or to have alternative future use. Accordingly,  this
non-recurring item was expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations upon
consummation  of  the  acquisition.  The  non-recurring  charge  for  in-process
research and development reduced basic earnings per share by approximately $0.59
in the fiscal second  quarter of 1999. The results of operations of Westwood and
the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included
in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Note 7. Earnings Per Share

The following summarizes the computation of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS") and
Diluted   EPS.   Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net   earnings   divided  by  the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Note 8.  New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is effective for all fiscal quarters  beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company
is determining the effect of SFAS 133 on its financial statements.


In March 1998, the American  Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  issued
Statement  of  Position  ("SOP  98-1"),  Accounting  for the  Costs of  Computer
Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires that certain
costs  related to the  development  or  purchase  of  internal-use  software  be
capitalized  and amortized over the estimated  useful life of the software.  SOP
98-1 is effective for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning
after December 15, 1998. The Company does not expect the adoption of SOP 98-1 to
have a material impact on its results of operations.

In December 1998, AcSEC issued SOP 98-9,  "Software  Revenue  Recognition,  with
Respect to Certain  Arrangements,"  which required  recognition of revenue using
the "residual method" in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not
exist for one or more of the undelivered elements in the arrangement.  Under the
"residual method," the total fair value of the undelivered  elements is deferred
and subsequently recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2.

The Company does not expect the adoption of SOP 98-9 will have a material impact
on its results of operations.

The Company derives revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software,
which   includes  EA  Studio   Compact  Disk  ("CD")   products  for   dedicated
entertainment  systems  ("CD-video  games"),  EA  Studio  CD  personal  computer
products  ("PC-CD"),  EA Studio  cartridge  products and Affiliated Label ("AL")
products that are published by third parties and  distributed by EA. The Company
also derives  revenues from  licensing of EA Studio  products and AL products to
hardware companies ("OEMs") and online subscription revenues.

North America net revenues increased $71,981,000, or 31.3%, and $151,325,000, or
37.2%,  for the three and nine months ended  December  31,  1998,  respectively,
compared to the same periods last year due to increased sales of PlayStation and
Nintendo  64 ("N64")  titles as well as the  distribution  of  Affiliated  Label
titles.  For the three and nine months ended December 31, 1998,  PlayStation net
revenues for North America increased $32,750,000 and $69,778,000,  respectively,
in comparison  to the same periods last year due to more titles  released in the
third fiscal quarter  compared to the same period last year  including  Westwood
titles  acquired in September  1998,  the greater  installed base of

PlayStation consoles and a larger market for PlayStation  products.  Total North
America N64 revenues increased $9,827,000 and $59,777,000 for the three and nine
month  periods,  respectively,  as compared to the same periods last year due to
more  titles  released  in the  current  year as well as a  larger  N64  market.
Affiliated  Label revenues  increased  $40,262,000 and $39,623,000 for the three
and nine months  ended  December 31, 1998,  respectively,  primarily  due to the
distribution  of products  published  by Square EA and  Accolade.  Though  North
America's  net revenues  are  expected to continue to grow in fiscal  1999,  the
Company may not maintain these growth rates.

International net revenues increased $56,929,000,  or 35.3%, and $88,029,000, or
29.6%,  for the three and nine months ended  December  31,  1998,  respectively,
compared to the same periods last year. The increase in  international  revenues
was  primarily  attributable  to higher  sales in Europe.  Total net revenues in
Europe were  $195,856,000  and  $328,382,000 for the three and nine months ended
December 31, 1998,  respectively,  compared to $140,778,000 and $247,979,000 for
the same  respective  periods last year.  European  revenues  increased due to a
larger  PlayStation market as well as sales of PlayStation titles including FIFA
99,  released in the third fiscal quarter and World Cup 98 released in the first
fiscal quarter.

Total net revenues in Japan were  $8,428,000 and  $27,267,000  for the three and
nine months ended  December 31, 1998,  respectively,  compared to $5,318,000 and
$16,031,000 for the same respective periods last year. The increase in Japan was
due to  strong  sales of  PlayStation  titles  including  World Cup 98 and Theme
Aquarium,  for the three  months,  and  FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98 for the nine
months ended December 31, 1998, respectively.

Total net revenues in the Asia Pacific  region  decreased by 8.4% to $13,811,000
and 10.7% to  $30,235,000  for the three and nine months ended December 31, 1998
compared to the same periods  last year due to the weakness in Asian  currencies
and a decrease in Affiliated Label product sales.

The Company  released six 32-bit CD-video game products during the third quarter
of fiscal 1999 comprised solely of titles for the PlayStation, including FIFA 99
and Knockout Kings, compared to four PlayStation and three Saturn titles for the
same  period  last year.  The  increase  in 32-bit  sales for the three and nine
months ended  December 31, 1998 compared to the prior year was  attributable  to
the greater installed base of PlayStation consoles,  more titles released in the
third  fiscal  quarter as compared  to the same  period  last year,  the related
release of key titles for this  platform  during the quarter and strong  catalog
sales partially offset by a decline in Saturn revenues.

For the three and nine months ended  December 31, 1998,  PlayStation  sales were
$222,271,000  and  $416,118,000,  respectively,  compared  to  $146,526,000  and
$271,188,000 in the comparable prior year periods. For the three and nine months
ended December 31, 1998,  PlayStation sales grew 51.7% and 53.4%,  respectively.
The Company expects  revenues from  PlayStation  products to continue to grow in
fiscal 1999, but as revenues for these products  increase,  the Company does not
expect to maintain these growth rates.

Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony  Agreement"),  as amended,  the
Company is  authorized  to develop and  distribute  CD-based  software  products
compatible with the  PlayStation.  Pursuant to the Sony  Agreement,  the Company
engages  Sony  to  supply  PlayStation  CDs  for  distribution  by the  Company.
Accordingly,   the  Company  has  limited  ability  to  control  its  supply  of
PlayStation CD products or the timing of their delivery. See Hardware Companies,

The Company released ten PC-CD titles in the third quarter of the current fiscal
year for the IBM personal  computer and compatibles  including FIFA 99, compared
to thirteen for the same period last year.

Sales of PC-CD  products for the three months ended  December 31, 1998 increased
3.9% compared to the prior year as increased  sales in Europe,  primarily due to
the releases of FIFA 99 and Populous - The Beginning, were partially offset by a
decrease in North  America due to fewer product  releases  compared to the prior
year. The decrease in sales of PC-CD products for the nine months ended December
31, 1998 is primarily  attributable to a decline in sales in North America, Asia
Pacific  and Japan due to fewer  product  releases  compared  to the prior  year
partially  offset by an increase in sales in Europe due to sales of World Cup 98
and FIFA 99.

The Company  released four N64 titles in the third quarter of the current fiscal
year compared to two releases in the comparable prior year period. For the three

primarily  due to more title  releases  for this  platform  compared to the same
periods last year and a larger

N64 market.  Sales of N64  products  are  expected to continue to grow in fiscal
1999, but as revenues for these products  increase,  the Company does not expect
to maintain these growth rates.

Under  the  terms  of  the  N64  Agreement,  the  Company  engages  Nintendo  to
manufacture its N64 cartridges for distribution by the Company. Accordingly, the
Company has little ability to control its supply of N64 cartridges or the timing
of their delivery.

In connection with the Company's purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution in
North America,  Nintendo requires the Company to provide  irrevocable letters of
credit prior to Nintendo's  acceptance  of purchase  orders from the Company for
purchases of these cartridges.  For purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution
in Japan and  Europe,  Nintendo  requires  the  Company  to make cash  deposits.
Furthermore,  Nintendo  maintains  a  policy  of not  accepting  returns  of N64
cartridges.  Because of these and other factors, the carrying of an inventory of
cartridges entails significant capital and risk. See Hardware Companies, below.

The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues for the three

was due to lower  professional  and  celebrity  royalties,  as a percent  of net
revenues,  partially offset by higher  manufaturing  royalties and product costs
associated with increased PlayStation and N64 sales.

</TABLE>

The increase in marketing and sales expenses for the three and nine months ended
December 31, 1998 was primarily  attributable to increased  television and print
advertising  to support  new  releases  and  increased  cooperative  advertising
associated  with higher  revenues in North America and Europe as compared to the
prior  year  periods.  Marketing  and  sales  expenses  also  increased  due  to
additional  headcount  related  to the  continued  expansion  of  the  Company's
worldwide  distribution  business.  Increases were  partially  offset by savings
attributable to the acquisition of Maxis, Inc. in July, 1997.

The  increase  in general  and  administrative  expenses  for the three and nine
months ended December 31, 1998 was due primarily to an increase in headcount and
occupancy  costs to support the  increase in growth in North  America and Europe
operations,   including   additional   offices   opened  in  Europe,   including
Switzerland and Austria, compared to the same periods last year.

The increase in research and development  expenses for the three and nine months
ended  December  31,  1998  was due to  additional  headcount  related  expenses
attributable to the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios Inc. and certain assets of
the  Irvine,   California-based  Virgin  Studio  (collectively   "Westwood")  in
September 1998 and Tiburon Entertainment, Inc. in April 1998, higher development
costs per title, as products are including more content and are more complex and
time consuming to develop, and an increase in development for Ultima Online.

In  connection  with the  purchase of Westwood in  September  1998,  the Company
allocated  $41,836,000 of the $122,688,000 purchase price to in-process research
and development  projects.  This preliminary allocation represents the estimated
fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete  research
and development projects.  At the date of acquisition,  this amount was expensed
as a  non-recurring  charge as the  in-process  technology  had not yet  reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Westwood had three
major PC-CD projects in progress at the time of the acquisition including two in
the  best-selling  franchise  Command  and  Conquer  and  one in the  critically
acclaimed Lands of Lore series.  As of the acquisition  date,  costs to complete
the Westwood projects  acquired were expected to be approximately  $9.1 million,
$10.6 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.  The
Company believes there has been no significant  changes to these estimates as of
December 31, 1998. The Company  currently expects to complete the development of
these  projects at various dates through fiscal 2001 and to publish the products
upon completion.

The nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology
into commercially  viable products  principally  relate to the completion of all
planning,  designing  and testing  activities  necessary to  establish  that the
product  can be produced to meet its design  requirements  including  functions,
features and technical  performance  requirements.  Though the Company currently
expects that the acquired in process technology will be successfully  developed,
there can be no  assurance  that  commercial  or  technical  viability  of these
products will be achieved. Furthermore, future developments in the entertainment
software industry, changes in computer or videogame console technology,  changes
in other product offerings or other  developments may cause the Company to alter
or abandon these plans.

The  value  assigned  to  purchased  in-process  technology  was  determined  by
estimating the completion  percentage of research and development efforts at the
acquisition date,  forecasting risk adjusted revenues considering the completion
percentage,  estimating  the  resulting  net cash  flows from the  projects  and
discounting  the  net  cash  flows  to  their  present  values.  The  completion
percentages  were  estimated  based on cost incurred to date,  importance of the
completed  development  tasks and the elapsed portion of the total project time.
The revenue projection used to value the in-process  research and development is
based on unit sales  forecasts for worldwide  sales  territories and adjusted to
consider only the revenue related to development  achievements  completed at the
acquisition  date. Net cash flow estimates include cost of goods sold and sales,
marketing and general and administrative  expenses and taxes forecasted based on
historical operating characteristics.  In addition, net cash flow estimates were
adjusted to allow for fair return on working  capital and fixed assets,  charges
for  franchise  and  technology   leverage  and  return  on  other  intangibles.
Appropriate risk adjusted  discount rates ranging from 20% to 22.5% were used to
discount  the net  cash  flows  back  to  their  present  value.  

                                       17
<PAGE>

The remaining identified  intangibles will be amortized on a straight-line basis
over  over two to twelve  years  based on  expected  useful  lives of  franchise
tradenames,  existing  products and  technologies,  retention of workforce,  and
other intangible assets. The Company expects to finalize its cash flow estimates
by March,  1999. If these projects are not successfully  developed,  the Company
may not realize the value  assigned to the in-process  research and  development
projects.  In addition,  the value of other acquired  intangible assets may also
become impaired.

Additionally,  for the nine  months  ended  December  31,  1998,  the charge for
in-process research and development also included write-offs associated with the
acquisition of two software development companies in the first quarter of fiscal
1999.

For the three and nine months ended  December 31, 1997,  the Company  incurred a
charge of $1,500,000 for acquired  in-process  technology in connection with the
acquisition of the remaining 35% minority  ownership interest in Electronic Arts
Victor,  Inc. in December 1997. This charge was made after the Company concluded
that the in-process  technology had no alternative  future use after taking into
consideration  the  potential  usage of the software in  different  products and
resale of the software.

For the three and nine months ended  December 31, 1998, the decrease in interest
and other income,  net, was primarily  attributable to the sale of the Company's
50%  ownership  interest in Creative  Wonders  LLC in  December  1997.  The sale
resulted in a gain of $12,625,000 in the prior fiscal year.

</TABLE>

The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 1998 was
negatively  affected as there was no tax benefit  recorded  for a portion of the
charges related to the acquired in-process  technology.  Excluding the effect of
these  charges,  the  effective  tax rate for the  three and nine  months  ended
December  31,  1998 would have been 32.0% as compared to a 33.0% tax rate in the
corresponding prior year periods. The lower rate of 32.0% results primarily from
reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

         Background of Year 2000 Issues

         Many currently  installed  computer  systems and software  products are
unable to distinguish  between twentieth century dates and twenty-first  century
dates because such systems may have been developed  using two digits rather than
four to determine the applicable year. For example,  computer programs that have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than  the  year  2000.   This  error   could   result  in  system   failures  or
miscalculations  causing  disruptions  of  operations,  including,  among  other
things, a temporary inability to process  transactions,  send invoices or engage
in similar normal business activities. As a result, many companies' software and
computer  systems  may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such "Year
2000" requirements.

         State of Readiness

         The  Company's  business  is  dependent  on the  operation  of numerous
systems that could potentially be impacted by Year 2000 related problems.  Those
systems include, among others: hardware and software systems used by the Company
to  deliver  products  to its  customers  communications  networks  such  as the
Internet and private  intranets,  which the Company depends on to receive orders
from products to its customers;  the internal systems of the Company's customers
and  suppliers;  products sold to customers;  the hardware and software  systems
used  internally  by  the  Company  in  the  management  of  its  business;  and
non-information  technology  systems  and  services  used by the  Company in the
management  of its  business,  such as power,  telephone  systems  and  building
systems.

         Based on an analysis of the systems potentially  impacted by conducting
business in the twenty-first  century, the Company is applying a phased approach
to making such systems, and accordingly, the Company's operations, ready for the
year 2000.  Beyond  awareness of the issues and scope of systems  involved,  the
phases of activities in progress include:  an assessment of specific  underlying
computer systems, programs and hardware;  renovation replacement or redeployment
of Year 2000 non-compliant technology; validation and testing of technologically
compliant Year 2000  solutions;  and  implementation  of the Year 2000 compliant
systems.

         As a third party providing software products,  the Company is dependent
on the  hardware  and  software  products  used to  deliver  such  products  and
services. If such products are inoperable due to Year 2000 issues, the Company's
business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  results  operations  could be
adversely affected.  An inventory of the Company's internal business

                                       21
<PAGE>

systems has been completed and planned software and hardware  upgrades to ensure
Year 2000 compliance are in process.  The upgrades to these systems are expected
to be completed by June, 1999.

         Costs

         To date the Company has not incurred significant costs directly related
to Year 2000 issues,  even in cases where non-compliant  information  technology
systems were redeployed or replaced.

         The Company  believes  that  future  expenditures  to upgrade  internal
systems  and  applications  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on its
business,  financial  condition  and  results of  operations  and are  primarily
included  within the Company's  ongoing  system  development  plan. In addition,
while  the  potential  costs  of  redeploying  personnel  and of any  delays  in
implementing  other  projects  is not  known,  the costs are  anticipated  to be
immaterial.

         Risks of the Year 2000 Issues

         The Company's financial information systems include an integrated suite
of business  applications  developed and supported by Oracle Corporation.  These
applications  systems are in place and currently support daily operations in the
United  States.  In Europe,  the  Company  is in the  process  of  upgrading  or
replacing these application  systems and expects to substantially  complete this
process by April, 1999. Based on representations  made by Oracle Corporation and
upon limited tests by the Company, the Company believes these systems to be Year
2000 compliant.

         The Company  believes  its software  products are Year 2000  compliant;
however, success of the Company's Year 2000 compliance efforts may depend on the
success  of  its  customers  dealing  with  their  Year  2000  issues.  Customer
difficulties  with  Year  2000  issues  might  require  the  Company  to  devote
additional resources to resolve underlying  problems.  Failures of the Company's
and/or third parties'  computer  systems could have a material adverse impact on
the Company's ability to conduct business. For example, a significant percentage
of purchase orders received from the Company's  customers are computer generated
and  electronically  transmitted.  In  addition,  the Year 2000 could affect the
ability of consumers to use the PC based  products  sold by the Company.  If the
computer systems on which the consumers use the Company's  products are not Year
2000 compliant,  such  noncompliance  could affect the consumers  ability to use
such products.

         Contingency Plans

         The Company continues to assess certain of its Year 2000 exposure areas
in order to determine  what  additional  steps beyond  those  identified  by the
Company's  internal  review in the United States are  advisable.  The Company is
currently developing a contingency plan for handling Year 2000 problems that are
not detected and corrected prior to their  occurrence.  The Company expects this
plan will be completed by June 30, 1999. The Company  believes that the systems,
which represent the principal exposures, have been identified, and to the extent
necessary,  are in the process of being modified to become Year 2000  compliant.
Additionally,  the Company will be conducting  tests of its  principal  business
systems to verify that those systems are Year 2000 compliant. Any failure of the
Company to address any  unforeseen  Year 2000 issue could  adversely  affect the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union
established  fixed  conversion  rates between  their  existing  currencies  (the
"legacy  currency") and the one common legal currency known as the "Euro".  From
January 1, 1999  through June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their
legacy  currencies  or the Euro to transact  business.  By July 1, 2002,  at the
latest,  the  conversion  to the Euro will be  complete at which time the legacy
currencies  will no  longer be legal  tender.  The  conversion  to the Euro will
eliminate currency exchange rate risk between the member countries.

The Company does not anticipate any material  impact from the Euro conversion on
its  financial   information  systems  which  currently   accommodate   multiple
currencies.  Computer  software  changes  necessary to comply with the Year 2000
issue are  generally  compliant to the Euro  conversion  issue.  Due to numerous
uncertainties,  the Company cannot reasonably  estimate the effect that the Euro
conversion issue will have on its pricing or market strategies,  and the impact,
if any, it will have on its financial condition and results of operations.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE

Future operating results of the Company depend upon many factors and are subject
to  various  risks  and  uncertainties.   Some  of  those  important  risks  and
uncertainties  which may cause the Company's  operating results to vary or which
may  materially  and  adversely  affect the Company's  operating  results are as
follows:

The Industry and Competition. The interactive software business has historically
been a volatile and highly  dynamic  industry  affected by changing  technology,
limited  hardware  platform life cycles,  hit products,  competition,  component
supplies, seasonality, consumer spending and other economic trends. The business
is also  intensely  competitive.  A variety of  companies  offer  products  that
compete  directly  with  one or more of the  Company's  products.  These  direct
competitors  vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial,
managerial  and technical  resources  comparable to or greater than those of the
Company.  Typically,  the Company's chief competitor on dedicated game platforms
is the  hardware  manufacturer/licensor  itself,  to which the Company  must pay
royalties,  and in the case of Sony and  Nintendo,  manufacturing  charges.  For
example,  Sony has  aggressively  launched  sports  product  lines that directly
compete with the  Company's  sports  products on the  PlayStation.  In addition,
competition  for  creative  talent  has  intensified,  and  the  attraction  and
retention of key personnel by the Company is increasingly difficult.

Products.  Interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans
of only 3 to 12 months. In addition, the packaged goods market is crowded with a
large number of titles  competing for limited retail shelf space.  The Company's
future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce
new competitive products on a timely basis and, in the packaged goods market, to
get those products  distributed widely at retail. To compete  successfully,  new
products must adapt to new hardware  platforms and emerging industry  standards,
provide additional content and functionality and be successfully  distributed in
numerous changing worldwide markets. If the Company were unable, due to resource
constraints or  technological  or other  reasons,  to  successfully  develop and
distribute  such  products  in a timely  manner,  this  inability  would  have a
material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition.

Development.  Product  development  schedules,  particularly  for  new  hardware
platforms  and high-end  multimedia  PCs are  difficult to predict  because they
involve creative  processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms and
the learning process,  research and experimentation  associated with development
for new technologies.  CD-ROM products  frequently  include more content and are
more  complex,  time-consuming  and costly to develop  and,  accordingly,  cause
additional development and scheduling risk than earlier generation products. For
example,  SimCity 3000,  the follow on product to SimCity 2000,  was expected to
ship in fiscal  1998,  at the time of the merger with Maxis.  Due to  additional
development delays, this product did not ship until the fourth fiscal quarter of
1999. Also,  Tiberian Sun, which was expected to ship in fiscal 1999 at the time
of the acquisition of Westwood  Studios,  will not be released until fiscal 2000
due to development delays.  Additionally,  development risks for CD-ROM products
can cause particular  difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter.  The  Company's  revenues and  earnings are  dependent on its
ability  to meet  its  product  release  schedule.  Its  failure  to meet  those
schedules  could result in revenues  and earnings  which fall short of analysts'
expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

Platform Changes. A large portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the
sale of products  designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms such
as the  PlayStation  and the N64.  The  interdependent  nature of the  Company's
business  and that of its hardware  licensors  brings  significant  risks to the
Company's  business.  The success of the  Company's  products  is  significantly
affected by market  acceptance  of the new video game  hardware  systems and the
life

                                       24

<PAGE>

span of older  hardware  platforms,  and the  Company's  ability  to  accurately
predict these factors with respect to each platform.  In some cases, the Company
will have  expended a large amount of  development  and  marketing  resources on
products  designed for new video game  systems that have not yet achieved  large
installed  bases or will have continued  product  development for older hardware
platforms  that  may  have  shorter  life  cycles  than  the  Company  expected.
Conversely,  if the  Company  does not  choose to develop  for a  platform  that
achieves  significant  market  acceptance,  or  discontinues  development  for a
platform  that has a longer  life cycle than  expected,  the  Company's  revenue
growth may be  adversely  affected.  For  example,  Sega has  released  its next
generation  console  platform,  Dreamcast,  in Japan in December 1998, and it is
expected to be  released  in North  America in late  calendar  1999.  The market
acceptance of this platform may affect the revenue growth on other platforms for
which the Company currently develops.

Multiplayer  Online  Gaming.   While  the  Company  does  not  currently  derive
significant  revenues from online games,  the Company  believes that multiplayer
online gaming will become a more  significant  factor in the Company's  business
and in the interactive gaming business  generally in the future.  Online gaming,
and particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as the Company's Ultima Online
product,  has at least four general areas of risk not currently  associated with
most packaged good sales.  First,  the speed and reliability of the internet and
the performance of the players'  internet service provider are not controlled by
the Company but impact game  performance.  Second,  in  "massively  multiplayer"
games such as Ultima Online,  unanticipated player conduct significantly affects
the  performance  of the game,  and social  issues  raised by  players'  conduct
frequently determine player  satisfaction.  The Company's ability to effectively
proctor such games is uncertain.  Third,  the current  business  model is as yet
experimental  and maybe  unsustainable;  whether  revenues  will  continue to be
sufficient to maintain the significant support,  service and product enhancement
demands of online  users is  uncertain.  The  Company has little  experience  in
pricing  strategies  for online  games or in  predicting  usage  patterns of its
customers.  Finally,  the legal  standards that may apply to online products are
uncertain;  though the action  against  the Company  alleging  defects in Ultima
Online was  dismissed,  regulation of the internet and the content it carries is
regularly  proposed  by  various  legislators,  and  piracy of  online  games is
difficult to prosecute under existing  intellectual property laws. The viability
of this segment,  generally, and the Company's ability to compete in the segment
will depend  significantly  on these and other  factors  outside  the  Company's
control.

Hardware Companies.  The Company's contracts with hardware licensors,  which are
also some of the Company's chief competitors, often grant significant control to
the licensor over the manufacturing of the Company's products.  This fact could,
in  certain  circumstances,  leave  the  Company  unable  to  get  its  products
manufactured  and  shipped  to  customers.   In  most  events,  control  of  the
manufacturing  process by hardware  companies  increases both the  manufacturing
lead times and the  expense to the  Company  as  compared  to the lead times and
costs that the Company can achieve  independently.  For example, the Company, in
prior years,  experienced  delays in the  manufacturing of PlayStation  products
which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The results of future periods
may be affected by similar  delays.  Finally,  the Company's  contracts with its
hardware  licensors  often  require  the  Company to take  significant  risks in
holding or prepaying for its inventory of products. In particular, the Company's
agreement  with  Nintendo  for  N64  products  requires   prepayment  of  costly
cartridge-based inventory, minimum orders and no rights of return.

Revenue and Expenses.  A  substantial  majority of the revenue of the Company in
any quarter  typically  results from orders received and products  introduced in
that quarter.  The Company's  expenses are based,  in part,  on  development  of
products to be released in the future.  Certain overhead and product development
expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues.  This trend is increasing
as the Company increases the proportion of products developed  internally.  As a
result, the Company's  quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict,
and small delays in product deliveries may cause quarterly  revenues,  operating
results  and net income to fall 

                                       25

<PAGE>

significantly  below anticipated  levels.  The Company typically receives orders
shortly before  shipments,  making backlog an unreliable  indicator of quarterly
results. A shortfall in shipments at the end of any particular quarter may cause
the results of that quarter to fall significantly short of anticipated levels.

Gross  Margins.  Though  gross  margins  for the  Company's  products as a whole
increased for the nine months ended December 31, 1998, the Company  expects that
margins  may  fluctuate  in any  particular  period and may  decline for several
reasons.  First,  the mix in sales of the  Company's  products has a significant
effect on gross margins. As the Company releases more N64 products,  which carry
significantly lower margins due to high cost of goods, overall gross margins may
decline.  Similarly,  if the proportion of AL revenues  increases in relation to
other revenues,  margins may also decline. Further, gross margins continue to be
affected by increases in professional and celebrity  license fees and royalties.
Also,  while the costs of  development  of new  products  for  32-bit and 64-bit
systems have increased,  overall costs of goods are not declining significantly.
For  products on  platforms  for which the  Company is required to purchase  its
goods  from the  hardware  companies,  the  Company  is unable to  achieve  cost
reductions   through   manufacturing   efficiencies,   and  in  addition,   pays
manufacturing royalties to hardware companies. Additionally,  retailers continue
to require significant price protection for products.  With an increasing number
of  titles  available  for  advanced  platforms,  such  requirements  for  price
protection may increase.  The Company also anticipates that retail and wholesale
prices for interactive entertainment products may decrease and gross margins may
be further adversely affected.

Marketing and  Distribution.  Both the video game and PC businesses  have become
increasingly  "hits"  driven.  Additional  marketing and  advertising  funds are
required to drive and support  "hit"  products,  particularly  expenditures  for
television advertising. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue
to produce "hit" titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

The Company has  stock-balancing  programs  for its personal  computer  products
that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount,  allow for the
exchange of personal computer products by resellers.  The Company also typically
provides for price  protection  for its personal  computer and video game system
products that, under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price reduction
from the  Company  for  unsold  products.  The  Company  maintains  a policy  of
exchanging products or giving credits, but does not give cash refunds. Moreover,
the risk of product returns may increase as new hardware  platforms  become more
popular or market factors force the Company to make changes in its  distribution
system.  The Company  monitors  and manages the volume of its sales to retailers
and  distributors  and their  inventories  as  substantial  overstocking  in the
distribution  channel  can  result  in  high  returns  or  the  requirement  for
substantial price protection in subsequent periods. The Company believes that it
provides  adequate  reserves for returns and price protection which are based on
estimated   future  returns  of  products,   taking  into  account   promotional
activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer
inventories of the Company's  products and other  factors,  and that its current
reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection requirements for
current  in-channel  inventory.  However,  there can be no assurance that actual
returns or price protection will not exceed the Company's reserves.  See Revenue
and Expenses, above.

The distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold have
been   characterized   by  change,   including   consolidations   and  financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer could render the Company's
accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible,  which could have an adverse
effect on the  operating  results and  financial  condition of the  Company.  In
addition,  an  increasing  number of companies are competing for access to these
channels.  The Company's arrangements with its

                                       26

<PAGE>

distributors and retailers may be terminated by either party at any time without
cause.  Distributors  and retailers often carry products that compete with those
of the Company.  Retailers of the Company's  products  typically  have a limited
amount of shelf  space and  promotional  resources  for which  there is  intense
competition.  There can be no assurance  that  distributors  and retailers  will
continue to purchase the Company's  products or provide the  Company's  products
with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.

Employees.  Competition  for  employees  in the  interactive  software  business
continues to be intense.  Large software and media  companies  frequently  offer
significantly  larger cash compensation than does the Company,  placing pressure
on the  Company's  base  salary  and cash  bonus  compensation.  Small  start-up
companies  such as  those  proliferating  in the  online  business  areas  offer
significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies
like the  Company  to match  without  significant  stockholder  dilution.  While
executive  turnover  decreased  in  fiscal  1998 and for the nine  months  ended
December 31, 1998 as compared to prior periods,  many key executives continue to
experience  intense  recruiting  pressure.  There can be no  assurance  that the
Company  will be  able to  continue  to  attract  and  retain  enough  qualified
employees in the future.

Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations.  For the nine months ended December 31,
1998 and the fiscal  year  ended  March 31,  1998,  international  net  revenues
comprised  41% and 43% of total  consolidated  net revenues,  respectively.  The
Company expects  foreign sales to continue to account for a significant  portion
of the  Company's  revenues.  Such sales are  subject to  unexpected  regulatory
requirements,  tariffs  and  other  barriers.  Additionally,  foreign  sales are
primarily made in local currencies  which may fluctuate.  As a result of current
economic  conditions  in Asia,  the  Company is subject  to  additional  foreign
currency  risk.  Though the  Company  does not  currently  derive a  significant
portion  of  revenues  and  operating  profits  from  sales  in Asia  and  other
developing  countries,  the Company's  foreign currency exposure may increase as
the Company's  operations in these countries grow and if current economic trends
in Asia continue. There can be no assurance that these or other factors will not
have an adverse effect on the Company's future operating results.

Investments  in  Affiliates.  The Company has a number of equity  investments in
affiliates,  including small developers, such as Firaxis; other publishers, such
as Accolade, Inc., The 3DO Company and NovaLogic, Inc.; and new ventures such as
Mpath Interactive. Additionally, the Company has a minority investment in Square
Electronic  Arts,  LLC, a joint venture between the Company and Square Co., Ltd.
These  companies  are  generally  small and may not have  significant  financial
resources.  Financial  difficulties  for any of these  companies  could  cause a
reduction in the value of the Company's investment.

Fluctuations in Stock Price.  Due to analysts'  expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock in
any given period.  As a result of the factors discussed in this quarterly report
and  other  factors  that  may  arise in the  future,  the  market  price of the
Company's common stock  historically has been, and may continue to be subject to
significant  fluctuations over a short period of time. These fluctuations may be
due to  factors  specific  to the  Company,  to changes  in  analysts'  earnings
estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment,  media
or  electronics  industries or the securities  markets in general.  For example,
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 the price per share of the Company's
common stock  ranged from $20.13 to $46.94 and from $33.88 to $56.00  during the
nine months ended December 31, 1998.

Seasonality.  The Company's  business is highly seasonal.  The Company typically
experiences its highest  revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end  holiday
season and a seasonal  low in revenues and profits  during the  quarters  ending
June and September.

Because  of the  foregoing  factors,  as well as  other  factors  affecting  the
Company's operating results and financial condition,  past financial performance
should  not be  considered  a  reliable  indicator  of future  performance,  and
investors  should not use historical  trends to anticipate  results or trends in
future periods.
