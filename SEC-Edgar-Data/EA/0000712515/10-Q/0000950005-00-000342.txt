                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The consolidated  financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments
(consisting  only  of  normal  recurring  accruals)  that,  in  the  opinion  of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
period.  The  results  of  operations  for the  current  interim  period are not
necessarily  indicative  of results to be expected  for the current  year or any
other period.  Certain  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the fiscal
2000 presentation.

These consolidated  financial  statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated  financial statements and notes thereto included in Electronic Arts
Inc. (the "Company")  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 1999 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  ("Commission") on
June 29, 1999.

Note 2. Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included
in other current  assets,  was  $50,801,000 and $35,057,000 at December 31, 1999
and March 31, 1999,  respectively.  The long-term portion of prepaid  royalties,
included in other assets,  was  $13,948,000  and $7,602,000 at December 31, 1999
and March 31, 1999, respectively.

Note 6. Comprehensive Income

In fiscal  1999,  the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income,"  which   establishes   standards  for  reporting  and  the  display  of
comprehensive income and its components (revenues,  expenses,  gains and losses)
in financial statements. SFAS 130 requires classification of other comprehensive
income in a  financial  statement  and  display  of other  comprehensive  income
separately  from  retained  earnings  and  additional  paid-in  capital.   Other
comprehensive income includes primarily foreign currency translation adjustments
and unrealized gains (losses) on investments.

necessarily  update information if any forward looking statement later turns out
to be inaccurate.  Risk and uncertainties that may affect our future results and
performance  include,  but are not limited to those  discussed under the heading
"Risk  Factors" below at pages 21 to 23, as well as in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999 as filed with the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  on June  29,  1999  and  other  documents  filed  with the
Commission.

We derive revenues  primarily from shipments of  entertainment  software,  which
includes EA Studio CD products for dedicated entertainment systems (that we call
CD-video games),  EA Studio CD personal  computer products (or PC-CD), EA Studio
cartridge  products and Affiliated  Label (or AL) products that are published by
third parties and  distributed or  co-published  by us. We also derive  revenues
from  licensing of EA Studio  products and  Affiliated  Label  products  through
hardware companies (or OEMs) and online subscription revenues.

North America Net Revenues

The increase in North  America net revenues for the three months ended  December
31, 1999,  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to:

o    A 41% increase in PlayStation  revenues due to the shipment of key releases
     including  NBA Live 2000,  Tomorrow  Never  Dies,  Knockout  Kings 2000 and
     continued strong sales of Madden NFL 2000.

o    A 33% increase in PC-CD  revenues  due to new  releases  such as Theme Park
     World and catalog sales of Sim City 3000 and Command and Conquer:  Tiberian
     Sun.

o    Offset by a decline in AL revenues  primarily due to the  acquisition of an
     affiliate,  Accolade,  in the first quarter of the current fiscal year by a
     third party.

For the nine months ended  December 31, 1999,  the increase in North America net
revenues  compared  to the same period  last year was  attributed  to:

o    A 55%  increase in PC-CD  revenues due to strong sales of Sim City 3000 and
     Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun.

o    A 25% increase in PlayStation revenues due to the release of titles such as
     NBA 2000 and Tomorrow Never Dies in the third fiscal quarter and Madden NFL
     2000 in the second fiscal quarter of the current year.

o    As well as a 16% increase in AL revenues  primarily due to the distribution
     of titles published by Square EA offset by the acquisition of an affiliate,
     Accolade, by a third party.

International Net Revenues

The increase in  international  net revenues for the three months ended December
31, 1999, compared to the same period last year was primarily attributable to:

o    A 26% increase in European  PlayStation  revenues  driven by the release of
     Tomorrow Never Dies and FIFA 2000, which was partially offset by a decrease
     in N64 revenues due to a weak market for N64 products.

o    An increase in Asia Pacific  revenues due to the release of Tomorrow  Never
     Dies and catalog sales of Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun.

o    Offset of  increases by a decline in  PlayStation  revenues in Japan due to
     strong prior year comparisons of World Cup 98 and Theme Aquarium.

For the nine months  ended  December 31,  1999,  the  increase in  international
revenues compared to the same period last year was due to:

o    A 52%  increase  in  Europe  PC-CD  revenues  due to sales of  Command  and
     Conquer:  Tiberian  Sun,  Sim City  3000,  Dungeon  Keeper 2 and Theme Park
     World, which were offset by a decrease in N64 revenues due to a weak market
     for N64 products.

o    A 78% increase in Asia Pacific  PC-CD  revenues  also due to the success of
     Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Sim City 3000.

o    Offset a 68%  decline  in by Japan  PlayStation  revenue  primarily  due to
     strong  sales of FIFA:  Road to the World Cup and World Cup 98 in the prior
     year.

PlayStation Product Net Revenues

The increase in PlayStation revenue for the three months ended December 31, 1999
was due to more  products  released  compared to the same  period last year.  We
released 10  PlayStation  titles in the current  quarter  compared to six in the
prior year. Key releases for the quarter include FIFA 2000, Tomorrow Never Dies,
NBA 2000 and Knockout Kings 2000.

For the nine months ended December 31, 1999 we released 20 PlayStation  products
compared to 16 in the same period last year.  Key  releases for the year include
FIFA 2000,  Tomorrow  Never Dies,  Madden NFL 2000,  NBA 2000 and Knockout Kings
2000.

We expect  revenues  from  PlayStation  products to grow in fiscal 2000,  but as
revenues  for these  products  increase,  we do not expect to maintain  the same
growth  rates as those in the prior  years.  Sony has  announced  the release of
PlayStation  II in the United  States  and Europe in the fall of 2000.  Although
PlayStation  products will be playable on the PlayStation II, we expect sales of
current PlayStation products to decline in the coming fiscal year.

Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, we are
authorized to develop and distribute  CD-based software products compatible with
the  PlayStation.  Pursuant  to the Sony  Agreement,  we  engage  Sony to supply
PlayStation CDs for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability to
control our supply of PlayStation  CD products or the timing of their  delivery.
See Risk  Factors  - "Our  platform  licensors  are our  chief  competitors  and
frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products".

Personal Computer CD Product Net Revenues

For the three months ended  December 31, 1999 PC-CD  revenues  increased  due to
strong sales of catalog titles such as Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Sim
City 3000. We released 10 PC-CD products during the quarter  compared to nine in
the same period last year.  Key releases for the quarter  included FIFA 2000 and
Theme Park World.

For the nine months  ended  December  31,  1999 we  released  21 PC-CD  products
compared to 20 in the same period last year.  The  increase  for the nine months
ended December 31, 1999 was primarily due to the success of Command and Conquer:
Tiberian Sun, released in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 and catalog sales of
Sim City 3000,  released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.  Other key titles
released in the current year included FIFA 2000 and Need For Speed IV.

We expect  revenues from PC-CD  products to grow in fiscal 2000, but as revenues
for these products increase,  we do not expect to maintain the same growth rates
as those in the prior periods.

N64 Product Net Revenues

For the three months ended December 31, 1999, revenues were flat compared to the
same period last year,  primarily  due to a weak  market for N64  products.  Key
releases for the quarter included Knockout Kings 2000 and NBA 2000.

For the nine months ended December 31, 1999 the decrease in N64 revenues was due
to the weak market for N64 products as well as strong  comparisons  of World Cup
98 in the prior year. Key releases for the year included WCW Mayhem and Knockout
Kings  2000.  We expect  revenues  from N64  products  to continue to decline in
fiscal 2000.

Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64
cartridges  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have  little  ability to
control our supply of N64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery. A shortage
of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to
obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.

In connection  with our purchases of N64  cartridges for  distribution  in North
America,  Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to
Nintendo's  acceptance  of  purchase  orders  from  us for  purchases  of  these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk. See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our
chief  competitors and frequently  control the  manufacturing  of our video game
products".

Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues

The  decrease  in  Affiliated  Label net  revenues  for the three  months  ended
December 31, 1999 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the
acquisition of Accolade by a third party.  Prior year titles  distributed  under
the  Accolade  agreement  included  Test Drive V and Test Drive:  Off Road 2 for
PlayStation and PC-CD. This decrease was partially offset by the distribution of
titles by DreamWorks, Interactive and Square EA, including Final Fantasy VIII.

For the nine months  ended  December 31, 1999 AL revenues  increased  due to the
distribution  of titles by Square EA,  including  Final Fantasy VIII,  partially
offset by the termination of our distribution  agreement with Accolade which was
acquired by a third party.

</TABLE>


Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods  sold as a  percentage  of net  revenues  decreased  for the three
months ended  December 31, 1999 compared to the same period last year  primarily
due to:

o    An increase in sales of higher margin PlayStation titles.

o    A decrease in sales of lower margin N64 titles.

o    An overall  decrease in sales of  Affiliated  Label  titles  combined  with
     higher  average  margins  in ALs  resulting  from a  higher  percentage  of
     co-published titles.

For the nine months ended December 31, 1999,  cost of goods sold as a percentage
of revenues decreased due to:

o    Increased sales of higher margin PC-CD titles.

o    Higher sales of higher margin AL co-published titles.

o    A decrease in sales of lower margin N64 titles.

o    Higher sales of internally  developed titles including Command and Conquer:
     Tiberian Sun and Sim City 3000.

Marketing and Sales

Marketing  and sales  expenses  for the three  months  ended  December  31, 1999
increased primarily due to increased television,  print and Internet advertising
to support a higher  number of  releases  in the  quarter  compared  to the same
period last year.

For the nine months  ended  December  31,  1999,  marketing  and sales  expenses
increased in absolute  dollars due to increased  television,  print and Internet
advertising to support higher revenues.  The increase was also due to additional
headcount  expenses  related  to  the  continued   expansion  of  our  worldwide
distribution business.

General and Administrative

General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  for the three and nine months
ended  December 31, 1999  primarily  due to an increase in payroll and occupancy
costs to support the increased growth in North America and Europe operations.

Research and Development

Research and development  expenses increased for the three and nine months ended
December 31, 1999 due to:

o    Additional  headcount related expenses  attributable to increased  in-house
     development  capacity  due to a higher  number of SKU's to be  released  in
     fiscal 2000.

o    An increase in online development  spending,  including the acquisition and
     integration  of PlayNation,  an online  software  developer,  in the second
     quarter of the current fiscal year.

o    An increase in development  spending for next generation  console  products
     including development for the PlayStation II.

Charge for Acquired In-Process Technology

In connection  with the  acquisition of Westwood in September 1998, we allocated
and  expensed   $41,836,000  of  the  purchase  price  to  acquired   in-process
technology.  Additionally,  in connection  with the  acquisition of two software
development companies,  in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, we incurred a total
charge of $2,279,000 for acquired in-process technology. These charges were made
after we concluded that the in-process  technology had not reached technological
feasibility  and had no alternative  future use after taking into  consideration
the potential for usage of the software in different  products and resale of the
software.

Amortization of Intangibles

The increase in  amortization  of intangibles for the nine months ended December
31, 1999 resulted primarily from the acquisition of Westwood in September 1998.

Interest and Other Income, Net

Interest and other  income,  net,  increased  in absolute  dollars for the three
months ended  December 31, 1999 compared to the same period last year  primarily
due to  higher  interest  income  and  realized  gains on  sales  of  marketable
securities.  These  increases  were  partially

                                       17
<PAGE>

offset by a write-off  of a note  receivable  from an  affiliate  in the current
quarter as well as a gain on sale of land in the same quarter last year.

For the nine months ended  December 31, 1999,  interest and other  income,  net,
increased  compared to the same period last year primarily due to realized gains
on sales of marketable  securities and the sale of our interest in an affiliate.
These gains were partially  offset by a write-off of a note  receivable  from an
affiliate  in the current year as well as a gain on sale of land  recognized  in
the prior year.

Income Taxes

The Company's  effective  tax rate for the three and nine months ended  December
31, 1999 was lower than the comparable  prior year period  (excluding the effect
of the one-time  charges in the prior year) primarily as a result of a projected
higher  portion  of  international  income for  fiscal  2000  subject to a lower
foreign tax rate as compared to the prior year. The tax rate for the nine months
ended  December  31,  1998 was  negatively  affected as there was no tax benefit
recorded  for a  portion  of the  charges  related  to the  acquired  in-process
technology.  Excluding the effect of these  charges,  the effective tax rate for
the nine months ended December 31, 1998 would have been 33.0%.

Net Income

The  increase  in net income for the three  months  ended  December  31, 1999 is
primarily  related to higher  revenues and gross profits as compared to the same
periods last year partially offset by higher operating expenses.

For the  nine  months  ended  December  31,  1999 the  increase  was also due to
one-time  charges  for  purchased  in  process  technology  in the  prior  year.
Excluding  the  one-time  charges in the prior year,  net income would have been
$88,464,000  for the nine months ended  December  31, 1998.  The increase in net
income, excluding the prior year one-time charges, was $24,855,000 or 28%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December  31,  1999,  our working  capital  was  $451,757,000  compared to
$333,256,000  at  March  31,  1999.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments decreased by approximately  $65,652,000 during the nine months ended
December 31, 1999 as we used  $84,103,000 of cash in operations and  $85,023,000
in capital  expenditures,  offset by  $68,477,000  provided  through the sale of
equity securities under our stock plans, proceeds from the sale of an affiliate,
and the sale of marketable securities.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from $72,850,000 at March 31,
1999 to $83,300,000 at December 31, 1999. Reserves have been charged for returns
of  product  and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in prior
periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves are adequate based on historical
experience and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances.

Our principal  source of liquidity is $247,170,000 in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements on both a short-term
and long-term basis.

Future Commitments with America Online, Inc.

In November  1999, we entered into a five-year  agreement  with America  Online,
Inc. ("AOL") to become exclusively responsible for game content on the AOL Games
Channel in North America and for content in the games channels on these four AOL
brands:  AOL.com,  CompuServe,  Netcenter/Netscape  and ICQ.  Under terms of the
agreement,  we  guaranteed  AOL $81  million as  follows:

o    $50 million for carriage payments  (including certain advertising fees) for
     rights to program the Games  Channel on AOL and the game  channels on AOL's
     four other Internet  properties.  We paid $25 million upon signing. We will
     pay AOL $6.25 million at launch of Electronic  Arts' online and  e-Commerce
     business  division's  ("EA.com") web site,  which we expect to occur in the
     summer of fiscal year 2001, and $6.25 million for each of three  successive
     annual anniversaries.

o    $31 million as an advance of minimum  guaranteed revenue share for revenues
     generated  by  advertising,  subscriptions,  anchor  tenancies,  and  other
     commercial  transactions  on EA.com's  sites.  We paid AOL $11 million upon
     signing and will pay them four annual installments of $5 million.

We also made a commitment to spend $15 million in offline  media  advertisements
promoting EA.com's online games, including those on the AOL service,  during the
term of the agreement.

Tracking Stock Proposal

The  stockholders  of  Electronic  Arts are scheduled to vote on a proposal (the
"Tracking  Stock  Proposal") to authorize the issuance of a new series of common
stock to be designated as Class B common stock  ("Tracking  Stock")  intended to
reflect the performance of EA.com.  At the time of authorization of the Tracking
Stock,  Electronic  Arts' existing common stock will be re-classified as Class A
common  stock  ("Class A Stock")  and that stock will be intended to reflect the
performance  of  Electronic  Arts' core  business  ("EA")  including a "Retained
Interest" in EA.com.

Upon  authorization  of the Tracking Stock,  Electronic Arts will sell shares to
AOL representing 10% of the equity value of EA.com and issue shares representing
5% of the equity of EA.com in exchange  for 103,227  shares of  Electronic  Arts
Class A common stock issued in conjunction  witht the purchase of Kesmai to News
America  Incorporated.  The  Company  will  also  issue a  warrant  to AOL which
represents 5 percent of the initial equity attributable to EA.com

YEAR 2000 DISCLOSURE

As of the date of this filing,  we have not incurred  any  significant  business
disruptions as a result of Year 2000 issues.  However,  while no such occurrence
has  developed,  Year 2000 issues that may arise  related to key  suppliers  and
service  providers  may  not  become  apparent  immediately.  We  have  received
assurances of Year 2000  compliance  from key  suppliers.  We have also received
assurances  from key  service  providers  such as  financial  institutions,  our
payroll service provider, and our retirement plan administrator as to their Year
2000  readiness.  We will  continue to monitor our own systems and our  business
partners to identify and address any  potential  risk  situations related to the
Year 2000. We can provide no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by
these suppliers and service providers due to noncompliance in the future.


Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union
established  fixed  conversion  rates between  their  existing  currencies  (the
"legacy  currency") and the one common legal currency known as the "Euro".  From
January 1, 1999  through June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their
legacy  currencies  or the Euro to transact  business.  By July 1, 2002,  at the
latest,  the  conversion  to the Euro will be  complete at which time the legacy
currencies will no longer be legal tender.  The fixed  conversion  rates between
their existing  currencies have eliminated exchange rate risk between the member
countries.

The  conversion to the Euro has reduced the number of forward  contracts that we
use to hedge the exchange  rate risk.  The forward  contracts  that were used to
hedge the individual legacy currencies have been replaced by a single Euro hedge
contract  and  the  intercompany  transactions  among  subsidiaries  within  the
European Union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk.

We do not  anticipate  any  material  impact  from  the Euro  conversion  on our
financial  information systems which currently  accommodate multiple currencies.
Due to numerous uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that the
Euro  conversion  issue will have on our pricing or market  strategies,  and the
impact,  if any,  it  will  have  on our  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.

Risk Factors

Electronic Arts' business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties  which may
affect our  future  financial  performance.  Some of those  important  risks and
uncertainties  which  may  cause  our  operating  results  to vary or which  may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows:

Product  Development  Schedules Are Frequently  Unreliable  and Make  Predicting
Quarterly Results Difficult

         Product development schedules,  particularly for new hardware platforms
and high-end  multimedia  personal  computer,  or PCs, are  difficult to predict
because they involve creative  processes,  use of new development  tools for new
platforms and the learning process, research and experimentation associated with
development  for new  technologies.  For example,  SimCity  3000,  the follow on
product to SimCity 2000, was expected to ship in fiscal 1998, at the time of our
acquisition of Maxis. Due to additional development delays, that product did not
ship until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. Also, Tiberian Sun, which was
expected  to ship in  fiscal  1999 at the time of our  acquisition  of  Westwood
Studios,  was not  released  until the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2000 due to
development  delays.  Additionally,  development  risks for CD-ROM  products can
cause  particular  difficulties  in predicting  quarterly  results because brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter.  Our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to
meet our product  release  schedules,  and our  failure to meet those  schedules
could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts' expectations
for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

New  Video  Game  Platforms  Create  Additional  Technical  and  Business  Model
Uncertainties

         A large  portion of our  revenues are derived from the sale of products
for play on proprietary  video game platforms such as the Sony  PlayStation  and
Nintendo 64. The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance
of the new video  game  hardware  systems  and the life  span of older  hardware
platforms and our ability to accurately  predict  which  platforms  will be most
successful.

         Sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products
designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved  large  installed
bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may
have shorter life cycles than we expected.  Conversely, if we do not develop for
a  platform  that  achieves   significant  market  acceptance,   or  discontinue
development  for a platform  that has a longer  life cycle  than  expected,  our
revenue growth may be adversely affected.

         For example, the Sega Dreamcast console launched in Japan in early 1999
and in the  United  States  in  September  of 1999.  We have no  products  under
development  for  this  platform.  Should  this  platform  achieve  wide  market
acceptance,  our revenue growth may be adversely affected.  Similarly, we intend
to launch a variety  of  products  for the new Sony  PlayStation  platform,  the
PlayStation  II,  expected to be  released  in the United  States in the fall of
2000.  Should that platform not achieve wide  acceptance  by consumers,  we will
have  spent a  disproportionate  amount  of our  resources  for  this  platform.
Additionally,  we have not negotiated  publishing  agreements with Sony, Sega or
Nintendo  for their next  generation  platforms,  and we do not know whether the
terms of those agreements will be favorable.

Our Business Is Both Seasonal and Cyclical

         Our business is seasonal with a significant  percentage of our revenues
occurring in the December  quarter.  Our  business is also  cyclical;  videogame
platforms have  historically  had a life cycle of four to six years, and decline
as more advanced  platforms are being  introduced.  As one group of platforms is
reaching the end if its cycle and new platforms are  emerging,  buying  patterns
may change.

                                       21
<PAGE>

Purchases of products for older  platforms  may slow at a faster rate than sales
of new platforms.  We are currently beginning such a platform  transition.  Sega
introduced its latest platforms in the United States in September 1999, and Sony
expects to ship its  PlayStation  II product in the fall of 2000.  Nintendo  has
also  announced  that a new system will be released  in calendar  year 2000.  We
expect sales of our products for the current Nintendo and Sony platforms to slow
in anticipation of those new platforms,  and to slow  significantly  upon market
release of those new platforms.

The Impact of e-Commerce and Online Games on Our Business Is Not Known

         While we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales
of our packaged products,  we believe that such form of distribution will become
a more significant factor in our business in the future.  E-Commerce is becoming
an increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers.  How that
form of distribution will affect the more traditional  retail  distribution,  at
which we have historically had success, and over what time period, is uncertain.
In addition, we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and
become a significant factor in the interactive games business  generally.  We do
not know  how that  increase  generally,  or the  emerging  business  of  EA.com
specifically, will affect sales of packaged goods.

Our  Business,  Our  Products,  and Our  Distribution  Are Subject to Increasing
Regulation in Key Territories

         Legislation is increasingly  introduced which may affect the content of
our products and their  distribution.  For example,  privacy rules in the United
States and Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary
by territory while of course the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries.
Other countries such as Germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted
over the Internet  that are stricter  than current  United  States laws.  In the
United  States,  in response  to recent  events,  the federal and several  state
governments are considering content  restrictions on products such as those made
by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products.  Any one or more
of these factors could harm our business.

Our Platform  Licensors Are Our Chief  Competitors  and  Frequently  Control the
Manufacturing of Our Video Game Products

         Our  agreements  with  hardware  licensors,  which  are also our  chief
competitors,  typically  give  significant  control  to the  licensor  over  the
approval  and  manufacturing  of our  products.  This  fact  could,  in  certain
circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products  approved,  manufactured and
shipped to customers.  In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing
process by the platform  licensors  increases both our manufacturing  lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve  independently.  For  example,  in
prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining  approvals for and manufacturing
of  PlayStation  products which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The
potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products
continues with our platform licensors.  Such occurrences would harm our business
and adversely affect our financial performance.

We Face Intense Competition for Talent from Highly Valued Internet Companies

         Competition  for  employees  in  the  interactive   software   business
continues to be intense.  Recently,  the most intense competition for recruiting
and retaining key employees is from Internet  companies,  including EA.com.  The
large equity positions  frequently offered to key executives and creative talent
in such companies and the actual or perceived  opportunity for rapid stock price
appreciation of these companies make their compensation  packages  attractive to
those who are already working in more mature  companies.  This situation creates
difficulty  for us to compete for the  attraction and retention of executive and
key creative talent.

                                       22
<PAGE>

Proliferation  and  Assertion  of  Patents  Poses  Serious  Risks to Our  Online
Business.

         Many  patents  have been issued that may apply to widely used  Internet
technologies.  Additionally,  many less  recently  issued  patents are now being
asserted against Internet  implementations of older  technologies.  Several such
patents have been asserted against us. For example,  we currently have a lawsuit
pending regarding our publication of games that can be played over the Internet.
Such  claims  can harm our  business.  We will  incur  substantial  expenses  in
evaluating  and defending  against such claims,  regardless of the merits of the
claims.  In the event that there is a  determination  that we have  infringed  a
third  party  patent,  we could  incur  significant  monetary  liability  and be
prevented from using the rights in the future.

Online Games Have Risks That Are Not Associated with Our Traditional Business

         Online  games,  particularly  multiplayer  games,  pose risks to player
enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales. Players frequently
would not be  acquainted  with other  players,  which may  adversely  affect the
playing experiencing.  Social issues raised by a player's conduct may impact the
experience  for other players.  We have not  determined  whether or how we might
monitor or proctor  player  behavior to mitigate  behavior that impairs the game
experience.  In addition,  there are substantial  technical challenges to be met
both in the  introduction  of our games online and the  maintaining an effective
game  playing  environment  over  time.  If  these  risks  are not  successfully
controlled and technical challenges resolved,  potential customers for our games
may be unwilling to play in  sufficient  volume to allow us to attain or sustain
profitability.

Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations

         For fiscal 1999 and the nine months of fiscal 2000,  international  net
revenues  comprised 42% and 38% respectively of total consolidated net revenues.
We expect  foreign  sales to continue to account for a  significant  and growing
portion  of our  revenues.  Such  sales are  subject  to  unexpected  regulatory
requirements,  tariffs  and  other  barriers.  Additionally,  foreign  sales are
primarily made in local currencies  which may fluctuate.  As a result of current
economic conditions in Asia, we are subject to additional foreign currency risk.
Though  we do not  currently  derive  a  significant  portion  of  revenues  and
operating profits from sales in Asia and other developing countries, our foreign
currency  exposure may increase as  operations  in these  countries  grow and if
current economic trends in Asia continue. Any of these factors may significantly
harm our business.

Fluctuations in Stock Price

         Due to analysts'  expectations  of continued  growth and other factors,
any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect
on the trading price of our common stock in any given period. As a result of the
factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future,
the market price of our common stock  historically has been, and may continue to
be  subject  to  significant  fluctuations  over a short  period of time.  These
fluctuations  may be due to factors  specific  to us, to  changes  in  analysts'
earnings   estimates,   or  to  factors   affecting  the   computer,   software,
entertainment,  media or  electronics  industries or the  securities  markets in
general.  For example,  since the  beginning of fiscal year 2000,  the price per
share of our common stock ranged from $45.6250 to $120.9375.

Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Item 3:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk


MARKET RISK

We are  exposed  to  various  market  risks,  including  the  changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates and interest  rates.  Market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and short-term  investments are subject to
market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to
interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies,  thereby,  limiting our risk. Gains
and losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.
At December 31, 1999, we had foreign exchange contracts,  all with maturities of
less than  three  months to  purchase  and sell  approximately  $285,575,000  in
foreign currencies,  primarily British Pounds, European Currency Units ("Euro"),
Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen and other currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and  the  forward  rate,   plus  the  unamortized   premium  or  discount.   The
counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational
commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these
contracts  are not  considered  to be material.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to
manage  foreign  exchange  risks,  there can be no  assurances  that our hedging
activities will adequately  protect us against the risks associated with foreign
currency fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts at December  31,  1999.  The  information  is provided in U.S.  dollar

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity. At December 31, 1999,
our  cash  equivalents,  short-term  and  long-term  investments  included  debt
securities of $186,612,000.  Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate
risks,  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately  protected against
the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

The table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates
of our investment portfolio at December 31, 1999:
