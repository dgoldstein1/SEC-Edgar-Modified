            SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

   Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended requires
VeriSign's directors and officers and persons who own more than 10% of
Verisign's common stock to file initial reports of ownership and reports of
changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
and the Nasdaq Stock Market. These persons are required by SEC regulations to
furnish VeriSign with copies of all section 16(a) forms that they file.

   Based solely on its review of the copies of the forms furnished to VeriSign
and written representations from the executive officers and directors, VeriSign
believes that all section 16(a) filing requirements for the year ended December
31, 1999 were met with the exception of the following James D. Bidzos filed a
report on Form 4 for the month of July one day late. Stratton D. Sclavos filed
a report on Form 4 for the months of December one day late and David Cowan
filed a report on Form 5 for 1999 one day late. Additionally, three Forms 5,
which were originally submitted via fax within the required time period, have a
later filing date resulting from the illegibility of the documents as printed
by the fax machine at the SEC.

Notes:
(1) Options granted in 1999 were granted under VeriSign's 1998 Equity
    Incentive Plan. These options become exercisable with respect to 25% of
    the shares covered by the option on the first anniversary of the date of
    grant and with respect to an additional 6.25% of these shares each quarter
    thereafter. These options have a term of seven years. Upon specific
    changes in control of VeriSign, this vesting schedule will accelerate as
    to 50% of any shares that are then unvested.
(2) Potential realizable values are net of exercise price but before taxes,
    and are based on the assumption that the common stock of VeriSign
    appreciates at the annual rate shown, compounded annually, from the date
    of grant until the expiration of the seven-year term. These numbers are
    calculated based on Securities and Exchange Commission requirements and do
    not reflect VeriSign's projection or estimate of future stock price
    growth.
(3) VeriSign granted options to purchase 6,869,950 shares of common stock to
    employees during 1999.
(4) Options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value
    per share of VeriSign common stock, as quoted on the Nasdaq National
    Market.

Notes:
(1) Options shown were granted under VeriSign's 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1997
    Stock Option Plan and 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, and are subject to
    vesting as described in footnote (1) to the option grant table above.
(2) Based on a value of $190.94, the closing price per share of VeriSign's
    common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on December 31, 1999, net of
    the option exercise price.

   No compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance to occur
over a period longer than one year was paid pursuant to a long-term incentive
plan during 1999 to any named executive officer. VeriSign does not have any
defined benefit or actuarial plan under which benefits are determined
primarily by final compensation and years of service with any of the named
executive officers.

Compensation Arrangements with Executive Officers

   In November 1996, Dana L. Evan was granted an option to purchase 680,000
shares of common stock, Arnold Schaeffer was granted an option to purchase
800,000 shares of common stock and Richard A. Yanowitch was granted an option
to purchase 1,160,000 shares of common stock, at exercise prices ranging from
$0.03 to $1.50. Each of these options is subject to the standard four-year
vesting schedule under the 1995 Stock Option Plan or, in some circumstances,
is immediately exercisable, subject to VeriSign's right to repurchase shares
subject to these options, which repurchase right lapses on a schedule similar
to the vesting schedule for options granted under the 1995 Stock Option Plan.
However, upon the occurrence of specific change-in-control transactions, 50%
of each of these named executive officer's then-unvested options will become
vested or, if applicable, the right of repurchase will lapse as to 50% of the
shares covered by the right of repurchase. As of December 31, 1999, 245,500
shares subject to these options were unvested.

Director Compensation

     Directors do not receive any cash fees for their service on the board or
any board committee, but they are entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at board
and board committee meetings. All board members are eligible to receive stock
options under VeriSign's stock option plans, and outside directors receive
stock options pursuant to automatic grants of stock options under the 1998
Directors Stock Option Plan, or the Directors Plan.

     In October 1997, the board adopted, and in January 1998 the stockholders
approved, the Directors Stock Option Plan and reserved a total of 500,000
shares, as adjusted for stock splits, of VeriSign's common stock for issuance
under that plan. As of December 31, 1999, options to purchase 300,000 shares
of common stock had been granted under the Directors' Plan and 200,000 shares
remained available for future grant. If proposal no. 7 is approved, an
additional 250,000 shares will be reserved for future grant. Members of the

                                      vi
<PAGE>

board who are not employees of VeriSign, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate
of VeriSign are eligible to participate in the Directors Plan. The option
grants under the Directors Plan are automatic and nondiscretionary, and the
exercise price of the options is 100% of the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant. Each new director who is eligible to participate
will initially be granted an option to purchase 60,000 shares on the date that
director first becomes a director. These grants are referred to as "Initial
Grants." On each anniversary of a director's Initial Grant or most recent grant
if that director did not receive an Initial Grant, each eligible director will
automatically be granted an additional option to purchase 30,000 shares if that
director has served continuously as a member of the board since the date of
that director's Initial Grant, or most recent grant if that director did not
receive an Initial Grant. The term of these options is ten years. They will
terminate seven months following the date the director ceases to be a director
or, if VeriSign so specifies in the grant, a consultant of VeriSign (twelve
months if the termination is due to death or disability). All options granted
under the Directors Plan will vest as to 6.25% of the shares each quarter after
the date of grant, provided the optionee continues as a director or, if
VeriSign so specifies in the grant, as a consultant of VeriSign. Additionally,
immediately prior to the dissolution or liquidation of VeriSign or a "change in
control" transaction, all options granted under the Directors Plan will
accelerate and will be exercisable for a period of up to six months following
the transaction, after which period any unexercised options will expire. In
July 1999, VeriSign granted to each of Messrs. Bidzos, Chenevich, Compton,
Cowan and Tomlinson an option to purchase 30,000 shares of its common stock
under the Directors Plan with an exercise price of $41.19 per share.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

     No interlocking relationship exists between the board or compensation
committee and the board of directors or compensation committee of any other
company.

                REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF VERISIGN

   Under Item 402(a)(9) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, neither the "Report of the Compensation Committee" nor the
material under the caption "Performance Graph" shall be deemed to be filed with
the SEC for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall the
report or the graph be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any past or
future filing by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act or the
Securities Act.

   The compensation committee of the board of directors administers VeriSign's
executive compensation program. The current members of the compensation
committee are D. James Bidzos, William Chenevich and David J. Cowan. Each of
these persons is a non-employee director within the meaning of section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and an "outside director" within the
meaning of section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. None of Mr. Bidzos, Mr.
Chenevich or Mr. Cowan has any interlocking relationships as defined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

General Compensation Philosophy

   The role of the compensation committee is to set the salaries and other
compensation of the executive officers and other key employees of VeriSign, and
to make grants under, and to administer, the stock option and other employee
equity and bonus plans. VeriSign's compensation philosophy for executive
officers is to relate compensation to corporate performance and increases in
stockholder value, while providing a total compensation package that is
competitive and enables VeriSign to attract, motivate, reward and retain key
executives and employees. Accordingly, each executive officer's compensation
package may, in one or more years, be comprised of the following three
elements:

  .  base salary that is designed primarily to be competitive with base
     salary levels in effect at high technology companies in the Silicon
     Valley that are of comparable size to VeriSign and with which VeriSign
     competes for executive personnel;

  .  annual variable performance awards, such as bonuses, payable in cash and
     tied to the achievement of performance goals, financial or otherwise,
     established by the compensation committee; and

  .  long-term stock-based incentive awards, which strengthen the mutuality
     of interests between the executive officers and VeriSign's stockholders.

Executive Compensation

   Base Salary. Salaries for executive officers for 1999 were generally
determined on an individual basis by evaluating each executive's scope of
responsibility, performance, prior experience and salary history, as well as
the salaries for similar positions at comparable companies. In addition,
VeriSign's Human Resources department provided information to the compensation
committee regarding salary range guidelines for specific positions.

   Annual Incentive Awards. VeriSign has established a management incentive
plan. Certain employees, including executive officers, are eligible to
participate in this plan. Target bonuses are established based on a percentage
of base salary and become payable upon the achievement of specified total
company financial goals and personal and team objectives. The compensation
committee administers this plan with regard to Mr. Sclavos. Mr. Sclavos
administers the plan with regard to the other executive officers.

   Long-Term Incentive Awards. The compensation committee believes that equity-
based compensation in the form of stock options links the interests of
executive officers with the long-term interests of VeriSign's stockholders and
encourages executive officers to remain in VeriSign's employ. Stock options
generally have value for executive officers only if the price of VeriSign's
stock increases above the fair market value on the grant date and the officer
remains in VeriSign's employ for the period required for the shares to vest.

                                      viii
<PAGE>

   VeriSign grants stock options in accordance with the Equity Incentive Plan.
In 1999, stock options were granted to some executive officers as incentives
for them to become employees or to aid in the retention of executive officers
and to align their interests with those of the stockholders. Stock options
typically have been granted to executive officers when the executive first
joins VeriSign, in connection with a significant change in responsibilities
and, occasionally, to achieve equity within a peer group. The compensation
committee may, however, grant additional stock options to executive officers
for other reasons. The number of shares subject to each stock option granted is
within the discretion of the compensation committee and is based on anticipated
future contribution and ability to impact VeriSign's results, past performance
or consistency within the officer's peer group. In 1999, the compensation
committee considered these factors, as well as the number of unvested option
shares held by the officer as of the date of grant. At the discretion of the
compensation committee, executive officers may also be granted stock options to
provide greater incentives to continue their employment with VeriSign and to
strive to increase the value of VeriSign's common stock. The stock options
generally become exercisable over a four-year period and are granted at a price
that is equal to the fair market value of VeriSign's common stock on the date
of grant.

Chief Executive Officer Compensation

   Mr. Sclavos' base salary, target bonus, bonus paid and long-term incentive
awards for 1998 were determined by the compensation committee in a manner
consistent with the factors described above for all executive officers.

Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) Limitation

   Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deduction to $1.0
million for compensation paid to executives of public companies. Having
considered the requirements of section 162(m), the compensation committee
believes that grants made pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan meet the
requirements that such grants be "performance based" and are, therefore, exempt
from the limitations on deductibility. Historically, the combined salary and
bonus of each executive officer has been below the $1.0 million limit. The
compensation committee's present intention is to comply with section 162(m)
unless the compensation committee feels that required changes would not be in
the best interest of VeriSign or its stockholders.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

   The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the
beneficial ownership of VeriSign's common stock as of March 3, 2000 by:

  .  each person who is known by VeriSign to own beneficially more than 5% of
     VeriSign's common stock;

  .  each director of VeriSign;

  .  each of the named executive officers of VeriSign; and

  .  all directors and executive officers of VeriSign as a group.

   The percentage ownership is based on 114,820,683 shares of common stock
outstanding at March 3, 2000. Shares of common stock that are subject to
options currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of March 3, 2000,
are deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership
of the person holding those options but are not deemed outstanding for
computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise
indicated in the footnotes following the table, the persons and entities named
in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all
shares beneficially owned, subject to community property laws where
applicable.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

   Since January 1, 1999, there has not been, nor is there currently proposed,
any transaction or series of similar transactions to which VeriSign or any of
its subsidiaries was or is to be a party in which the amount involved exceeded
or will exceed $60,000 and in which any director, executive officer or holder
of more than 5% of the common stock of VeriSign or any member of the immediate
family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect
material interest other than (1) the compensation agreements, which are
described where required in "Executive Compensation," and (2) the transactions
described below.

   Legal Fees. During 1999, the law firm of Tomlinson Zisko Morosoli & Maser
LLP, of which Mr. Tomlinson is a partner, provided legal services to VeriSign
on a variety of matters. VeriSign paid to Tomlinson Zisko Morosoli & Maser LLP
an aggregate of approximately $738,000 in 1999.

   VeriSign believes that all of the transactions set forth above were made on
terms no less favorable to it than could have been obtained from unaffiliated
third parties. All future transactions between VeriSign and its officers,
directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates will be approved by a
majority of the board, including a majority of the independent and
disinterested directors of the board, and will be on terms no less favorable to
VeriSign than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
