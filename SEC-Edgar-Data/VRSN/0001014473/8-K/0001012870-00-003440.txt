Item 2.  Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

         On June 8, 2000, VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign") completed the acquisition
of Network Solutions, Inc. ("Network Solutions"), through the merger of a
wholly-owned subsidiary of VeriSign with and into Network Solutions, with
Network Solutions surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of VeriSign (the
"Merger"). The Merger is intended to be a tax-free reorganization and will be
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

         In connection with the Merger, VeriSign issued approximately 78 million
shares of VeriSign common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Network Solutions. VeriSign also assumed Network Solutions' outstanding stock
options. Each Network Solutions share was exchanged for 1.075 shares of VeriSign
common stock. Each outstanding Network Solutions stock option was adjusted to
reflect this exchange ratio. Stratton D. Sclavos, the President and Chief
Executive Officer of VeriSign, was a member of the board of directors of Network
Solutions prior to the merger. In connection with the Merger, William A. Roper,
Jr. and Michael A. Daniels, directors of Network Solutions, were appointed to
the board of directors of VeriSign.

         A press release announcing the completion of the transaction is
attached as an exhibit to this report.

Item 5.  Other Events.

         On June 8, 2000, VeriSign held its annual meeting of stockholders, at
which stockholders approved the Merger, an amendment to VeriSign's certificate
of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to
1,000,000,000 shares, and an amendment to VeriSign's bylaws to increase the
permitted number of directors. The Certificate of Amendment of the Third Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amendment to the Amended and
Restated Bylaws were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") as Exhibits 4.03 and 4.04, respectively, to the VeriSign Registration
Statement on Form S-8 filed with the SEC on June 14, 2000. In addition, VeriSign
stockholders elected Kevin R. Compton and David J. Cowan as directors for three
year terms, approved increases in the number of shares authorized for issuance
under VeriSign's 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
and 1998 Directors Stock Option Plan, and ratified the appointment of KPMG LLP
as VeriSign's independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2000.
