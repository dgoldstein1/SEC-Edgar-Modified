ITEM 2:  ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

          On July 6, 1998, VeriSign, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Registrant"
                                                                    ---------- 
or "VeriSign"), acquired SecureIT, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("SecureIT"),
    --------                                                     --------   
pursuant to the merger (the "Merger") of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant
                             ------                                             
with and into SecureIT.  The Merger was effected pursuant to an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 6, 1998 ("Plan of Reorganization").  The
                                                  ----------------------        
Merger was accounted for as a "pooling of interests" transaction for accounting
purposes and was structured to be a "tax-free" reorganization for federal income
tax purposes.  The directors and executive officers of Registrant were not
changed as a result of the Merger. SecureIT is in the business of providing
professional services, training and products for the deployment of enterprise
and Internet information security solutions.  Following the Merger, it is
intended that SecureIT will continue its historical business.

          Pursuant to the Merger, a total of approximately 1,666,188 shares of
Registrant's Common Stock (including 176,619 shares of Registrant's Common Stock
held in escrow to secure certain indemnification obligations of the former
SecureIT shareholders) were issued in exchange for all the issued and
outstanding shares of SecureIT's capital stock and approximately 208,809 shares
of Registrant's Common Stock have been reserved for issuance upon the exercise
of outstanding options to purchase Common Stock of SecureIT which have been
assumed by Registrant pursuant to the terms of the Merger.  Registrant filed a
Registration Statement on Form S-8 with respect to the assumed SecureIT options
with the Commission on July 7, 1998.

          The shares of Registrant's Common Stock received by the former
SecureIT shareholders have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "1933 Act"), in reliance upon the exemption from registration
                 --------                                                    
provided by Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation change promulgated
thereunder.  Pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, the Registrant
and the SecureIT shareholders entered into a Registration Rights Agreement
providing for the grant of certain piggyback and Form S-3 registration rights to
the Secure IT shareholders with respect to the Registrant's Common Stock
received by such shareholders in the Merger commencing after the date upon which
Registrant has publicly released a report including financial statements of
Registrant that include at least thirty (30) days of post-Merger combined
operating results of Registrant and SecureIT.

          Contemporaneously with the Merger, Jagtar S. Chaudhry, the former
Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer of
SecureIT entered into an employment and non-competition agreement with SecureIT,
as the surviving corporation in the Merger.

          The information set forth in VeriSign's press release dated July 6,
1998 and filed as an exhibit to this report is incorporated herein by reference.

                                          -----                             
corporation ("SecureIT"), and the undersigned shareholders of SecureIT (the
              --------

                                    RECITALS

     A.  Newco will merge with and into SecureIT in a reverse triangular 
merger (the "Merger"), with SecureIT to be the surviving corporation of the
             ------                                                        
Merger, all pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Certificate of
                                     ---------              --------------
Merger") and the applicable provisions of the laws of Georgia.  Upon the
- ------                                                                  
effectiveness of the Merger, the outstanding capital stock of SecureIT will be
converted into shares of Common Stock of VeriSign and outstanding stock options
to purchase shares of capital stock of SecureIT will be assumed by VeriSign and
converted into options to purchase shares of Common Stock of VeriSign, in the
manner and on the basis determined herein and as provided in the Certificate of
Merger.

     B.  The Merger is intended to be treated as a "pooling of interests" for
accounting and financial reporting purposes and a tax-free reorganization
pursuant to the provisions of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), by virtue of the provisions of Section
                          ----                                          
368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above-recited facts and the mutual
promises, covenants and conditions contained herein, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

     1.   PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

          1.1   The Merger.  The Certificate of Merger has been filed with the
                ----------                                                    
Secretary of State of the State of Georgia on the Effective Date.  The effective
time of the Merger  (the "Effective Time") will occur as specified in the
                          --------------                                 
Certificate of Merger or upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger.  Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger,
Newco will be merged with and into SecureIT in a statutory merger pursuant to
the Certificate of Merger and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Georgia laws as follows:

                1.1.1  Conversion of SecureIT Shares.  Each share of common 
                       -----------------------------   
stock, no par value of SecureIT (the "SecureIT Common Stock"), that is issued 
                                      ---------------------    
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the
Merger and at the Effective Time, 
<PAGE>
 
and without further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into
a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par
value of VeriSign ("VeriSign Common Stock") that is equal to the Conversion
                    ---------------------  
Ratio (as defined in Section 1.1.2 below), subject to the provisions of Section
1.1.3 regarding the elimination of fractional shares.

          1.1.2  Conversion Ratio.  The "Conversion Ratio" for the conversion of
                 ----------------        ----------------                       
SecureIT Common Stock means 0.164806 of a share of VeriSign Common Stock for
each share of SecureIT Common Stock, provided, however, that in no event shall
the number of shares of VeriSign Common Stock issued or issuable by VeriSign
under this Agreement exceed 1,875,000.

          1.1.3  Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares of VeriSign Common
                 -----------------                                          
Stock will be issued in connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof, the
holder of any shares of SecureIT Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of VeriSign Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.1.1, after aggregating all shares of VeriSign Common Stock to be received by
such holder pursuant to Section 1.1.1, will receive from VeriSign, promptly
after the Effective Time, an amount of cash equal to the per share market value
of VeriSign Common Stock (based on the closing sale price of VeriSign Common
Stock on the last trading day prior to the Effective Date, as quoted on the
Nasdaq National Market and as reported in the Wall Street Journal (the "Closing
                                                                        -------
Price") multiplied by the fraction of a share of VeriSign Common Stock to which
- -----                                                                          
such holder would otherwise be entitled.

          1.1.4  Conversion of Newco Shares.  Each share of Newco Common Stock,
                 --------------------------                                    
no par value ("Newco Common Stock"), that is issued and outstanding immediately
               ------------------                                              
prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without further
action on the part of the sole stockholder of Newco, be converted into and
become one (1) share of SecureIT Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately after the Effective Time, and the share of SecureIT Common Stock
into which the shares of Newco Common Stock are so converted shall be the only
share of capital stock of SecureIT that is issued and outstanding immediately
after the Effective Time.

          1.1.5  Assumption and Conversion of SecureIT Options.  Each option
                 ---------------------------------------------              
issued by SecureIT heretofore to acquire SecureIT Common Stock ("SecureIT
Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by
virtue of the Merger and at the Effective Time and without any further action on
the part of any holder thereof, be assumed by VeriSign and converted into an
option (a "VeriSign Option") to purchase that number of shares of VeriSign
           ---------------                                                
Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of SecureIT Common
Stock subject to such SecureIT Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per share of VeriSign Common Stock
equal to the exercise price per share of SecureIT Common Stock that was in
effect for such SecureIT Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided
by the Conversion Ratio; provided, however, that if the foregoing calculation
                         --------  -------                                   
would result in an assumed and converted SecureIT Option being converted into a
VeriSign Option that, after aggregating all the shares of VeriSign Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such VeriSign Option, would be exercisable for a
fraction of a share of VeriSign Common Stock, then the number of shares of
VeriSign Common Stock 
<PAGE>
 
subject to such VeriSign Option will be rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of VeriSign Common Stock. The terms, exercisability, vesting schedule,
status as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code (if
applicable) or as a nonqualified stock option, and all other terms and
conditions of each SecureIT Option that is converted into an VeriSign Option in
the Merger will (except as otherwise provided in the terms of such SecureIT
Options), to the extent permitted by law and otherwise reasonably practicable,
be unchanged and continue in effect after the Merger. Pre-Merger employment
service with SecureIT will be credited to each holder of a SecureIT Option for
purposes of applying any vesting schedule contained in a SecureIT Option to
determine the number of shares of VeriSign Common Stock that are exercisable
under the VeriSign Option into which such SecureIT Option is converted in the
Merger.

     1.2  Escrow Agreement.
          ---------------- 

          1.2.1  Escrow.  At the Effective Time, VeriSign will withhold 176,619
                 -------

Merger pursuant to Section 1.1.1 (the "Escrow Shares") and will deliver

certificates representing such Escrow Shares to Chase Manhattan Bank & Trust
Company N.A., San Francisco, California, or a similar institution, as escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent"), together with related stock transfer powers, to be
            ------------                                                      
held by the Escrow Agent as security for the SecureIT Shareholders'
indemnification obligations under Section 6 and pursuant to the provisions of an
escrow agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit B entered into by
                                              ---------                
VeriSign, the Escrow Agent, the SecureIT Shareholders and the Representative (as
defined in Section 1.2.2 below) (the "Escrow Agreement").  The Escrow Shares
                                      ----------------                      
will be represented by a certificate or certificates issued in the names of the
SecureIT Shareholders in proportion to their respective interests therein and
will be held by the Escrow Agent during the time periods specified in the Escrow
Agreement.

          1.2.2  Escrow Agreement Representative.  By their approval of the
                 -------------------------------                           
Merger, the SecureIT Shareholders will be conclusively deemed to have consented
to, approved and agreed to be personally bound by:  (i) the indemnification
provisions of Section 6; (ii) the Escrow Agreement; and (iii) the appointment of
Jay S. Chaudhry as the representative of the SecureIT Shareholders (the
                                                                       
"Representative") under the Escrow Agreement and as the attorney-in-fact and
- ---------------                                                             
agent for and on behalf of each SecureIT Shareholder as provided in the Escrow
Agreement; and (iv) the taking by the Representative of any and all actions and
the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Representative under the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the

governed by the Escrow Agreement, and all rights or obligations arising under
the Escrow Agreement so long as all SecureIT Shareholders are treated in the
same manner. The SecureIT Shareholders will be bound by all actions taken by the
Representative in connection with the Escrow Agreement, and VeriSign will be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Representative. In performing
the functions specified in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the
Representative will not be liable to any SecureIT Shareholder in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any out-of-pocket costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the Representative in connection with actions taken
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement will be paid by the SecureIT
Shareholders to the Representative pro rata in proportion to their respective
percentage interests in the Escrow Shares.

          1.3  Exchange of Certificates.  At and after the Effective Time, each
               ------------------------                                        
certificate representing outstanding shares of SecureIT Common Stock will
represent the number of shares of VeriSign Common Stock into which such shares
of SecureIT Common Stock have been converted, and such shares of VeriSign Common
Stock will be deemed registered in the name of the holder of such certificate.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of shares of
SecureIT Common Stock will surrender (a) the certificates for such shares (the
"SecureIT Certificates") to VeriSign for cancellation or (b) an affidavit of
- ----------------------                                                      
lost certificate (or nonissued) and a bond in form reasonably satisfactory to
VeriSign or its transfer agent (a "Bond").  Promptly following the Effective
                                   ----                                     
Time and receipt of the SecureIT Certificates and/or the Bonds, VeriSign will
cause its transfer agent to issue to such surrendering holder certificate(s) for
the number of shares of VeriSign Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.1.1, subject to Section 1.1.3 hereof, less the shares of
VeriSign Common Stock deposited into escrow pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof, and
VeriSign or its transfer agent will pay by check to each tendering holder cash
in lieu of fractional shares in the amount payable to such holder under Section
1.1.3.

               1.3.1  All shares of VeriSign Common Stock (and, if applicable, 
cash in lieu of fractional shares) delivered upon the surrender of SecureIT
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be delivered to the
registered holder or placed in escrow with the Escrow Agent, as applicable.
After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers of
the shares of SecureIT Common Stock on the stock transfer books of SecureIT. If,
after the Effective Time, SecureIT Certificates are presented for transfer or
for any other reason, they will be canceled and exchanged and certificates
therefor will be delivered or placed in escrow as provided in Section 1.2
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except to the extent waived by
VeriSign, any SecureIT Certificate that is not properly submitted to VeriSign
for exchange and cancellation within three years after the Effective Time shall
no longer evidence ownership of or any right to receive shares of VeriSign
Common Stock and all rights of the holder of such SecureIT Certificate, with
respect to the shares previously evidenced by such SecureIT Certificate, shall
cease.
<PAGE>
 
               1.3.2  Until SecureIT Certificates representing SecureIT Common
Stock outstanding prior to the Merger are surrendered pursuant to Section 1.3
above, such certificates will be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence ownership
of (a) the number of shares of VeriSign Common Stock into which the shares of
SecureIT Common Stock will have been converted, subject to the obligation to
place a portion thereof in escrow as required hereby, and (b) if applicable,
cash in lieu of fractional shares.

               ---------------------                                           
existence of Newco will cease and Newco will be merged with and into SecureIT
and SecureIT will be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving
                                                                   ---------

Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into
one (1) outstanding share of SecureIT Common Stock; (e) the directors of Newco

          1.5  Further Assurances.  SecureIT and each of the SecureIT
               ------------------                                    
Shareholders agree that if, at any time after the Effective Time, VeriSign
considers or is advised that any further deeds, assignments, instruments or
assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to
carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective
Time, then VeriSign, the Surviving Corporation, and their respective officers

incurred by them with respect to any audits by the Internal Revenue Service or
any state taxing agency or authority for tax years or periods prior to the
Effective Time and with respect to the preparation of each such SecureIT
Shareholder's tax return with respect to the tax year of SecureIT ended at the

               ----------------------

SecureIT Shareholder who receives shares of VeriSign Common Stock in the Merger
pursuant to Section 1.1.1 will be granted registration rights on Form S-3 under
the Securities Act on the terms, and subject to the conditions and limitations,
of the Registration Rights Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C (the 
                                                        ---------       
"Registration Rights Agreement") upon such SecureIT Shareholder's execution and
 -----------------------------                                                 
delivery of such Registration Rights Agreement to VeriSign.

          1.8  Listing of Additional Shares.  On the Effective Date, or as soon
               ----------------------------                                    
thereafter as practicable, VeriSign agrees to file with the Nasdaq National
Market a Notification Form for Listing of Additional Shares with respect to the
shares of VeriSign Common Stock being issued upon conversion of the SecureIT
Common Stock in the Merger and upon exercise of the VeriSign Options to be
issued in the Merger upon conversion of outstanding SecureIT Options.

          1.9  Form S-8 Registration.  VeriSign will (with the cooperation and
               ---------------------                                          
assistance of SecureIT and the SecureIT Shareholders) cause the shares of
VeriSign Common Stock that are subject to the VeriSign Options that are to be
issued upon the conversion of the SecureIT Options under Section 1.1.4 to be
registered on a registration statement on Form S-8 (or successor form)
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the
                                                        ---            
Securities Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and
will use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Form S-8
registration statement or registration statements for so long as such VeriSign
Options remain outstanding and VeriSign Common Stock is registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act").  VeriSign will use
                                                  --------                      
its best efforts to file a Form S-8 registration statement covering the shares
of VeriSign Common Stock that are subject to the VeriSign Options referred to
above within five (5) business days after the Effective Time.

          1.10  Tax-Free Reorganization.  The parties intend to adopt this
                -----------------------                                   
Agreement as a tax-free plan of reorganization and to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the provisions of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, by virtue of
the provisions of Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.  The shares of VeriSign
Common Stock issued in the Merger will be issued solely in exchange for the
issued and outstanding shares of SecureIT Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, and no other transaction other than the Merger represents, provides
for or is intended to be an adjustment to the consideration paid for the
SecureIT Common Stock.  Except for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, no
consideration that could constitute "other property" within the meaning of
Section 356 of the Code will be paid by VeriSign for shares of SecureIT Common
Stock in the Merger.  In addition, VeriSign represents that it presently
intends, and that at the Effective Time it will intend, to continue SecureIT's
historic business or use a significant portion of SecureIT's business assets in
a business.  On the Effective Date, the officers of VeriSign and officers of
SecureIT have executed and delivered officers' tax representation certificates
in the form of Exhibit 1.10, and the representations and other statements set
               ------------                                                  
forth therein are incorporated in this Agreement by this reference to the same
extent as if VeriSign or SecureIT, respectively, had made such statements
herein.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, VeriSign makes no
representation or warranty to SecureIT or to any SecureIT Shareholder regarding
the tax treatment of the Merger or whether the Merger will qualify as a tax-free
plan of 
<PAGE>
 
reorganization under the Code. Each SecureIT Shareholder agrees to rely on such
SecureIT Shareholder's own tax advisers as to the tax attributes of the Merger
to such SecureIT Shareholder and understands that neither VeriSign's legal
counsel and accountants nor SecureIT has guaranteed nor will guarantee to such
SecureIT Shareholder that the Merger will be a tax-free reorganization.

          1.11  Pooling of Interests.  The parties acknowledge that, as a
                --------------------                                     
material inducement to VeriSign to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
Merger, the Merger is intended to be treated as a "pooling of interests" for
accounting and financial reporting purposes.  Accordingly, concurrently with the

are required by the laws of any such jurisdiction to be filed in order to enable
SecureIT to be taxed as a S corporation under such tax laws for all tax periods
for which SecureIT has prepared its tax returns on the basis that it was a S

by the SEC or by any state securities authorities, that the Restricted
Securities to be received by the SecureIT Shareholder pursuant to the Merger

securities" under Rule 144(d) of the Securities Act, and have been issued in

Subject to Sections 6.2.3(b) and 6.2.6, all representations, warranties and
covenants of SecureIT and the SecureIT Shareholders contained in this Agreement
will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of VeriSign, until that date (the "ESCROW
RELEASE DATE") which is the earlier of (i) the termination of this Agreement or
(ii) May 1, 1999; provided, however, that those representations and warranties
                  --------  -------                                           
respecting matters addressed by the audited financial statements of the combined
corporation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, together with a report
thereon from VeriSign's independent auditors, shall expire upon the date on
which such financial statements are first released to the public.

          6.2  Indemnification by SecureIT Shareholders.
               ---------------------------------------- 

               6.2.1  Agreement to Indemnify.  The SecureIT Shareholders will 
                      ----------------------    
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless VeriSign and the Surviving
Corporation and their 
<PAGE>
 
respective officers, directors, agents, stockholders and employees, and each
person, if any, who controls or may control VeriSign or the Surviving
Corporation within the meaning of the Securities Act (each hereinafter referred
to individually as an "Indemnified Person " and collectively as "Indemnified 
                       ------------------                        -----------
Persons") from and against any and all claims,  demands, suits, causes actions, 
- -------
of actions, losses, costs, demonstrable damages, liabilities and reasonable
expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, other
professionals' and experts' reasonable fees and court or arbitration costs
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "Damages") incurred and arising out of
                                          -------                              
any breach of, or default in, any of the representations, warranties or
covenants given or made by SecureIT in this Agreement or in the SecureIT
Disclosure Letter or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the SecureIT
pursuant hereto (if such breach or default existed at the Effective Date). Any
claim of indemnity made by an Indemnified Person under this Section 6.2 must be
raised in a writing delivered to the Representative and the Escrow Agent by no
later than the Escrow Release Date.

          6.2.2  Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
                 ----------                                                   
in seeking indemnification for Damages under Section 6.2.1, the Indemnified
Persons will exercise their remedies with respect to the Escrow Shares and any
other assets deposited in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  Except as
set forth in Section 6.2.3, (i) no SecureIT Shareholder will have any liability
to an Indemnified Person under Section 6.2.1 of this Agreement except to the
extent of such SecureIT Shareholder's portion of the Escrow Shares deposited
under the Escrow Agreement and (ii) the remedies set forth in this Section 6.2.2
will be the exclusive remedies of VeriSign and the other Indemnified Persons
under Section 6.2.1 of this Agreement against any SecureIT Shareholder for any
breach of, or default in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants
given or made by the SecureIT in this Agreement or in any certificate, document
or instrument delivered by or on behalf of the SecureIT pursuant hereto.  In
addition, the indemnification provided for in Section 6.2.1 shall not apply
unless and until the aggregate Damages for which one or more Indemnified Persons
seeks or has sought indemnification hereunder exceeds a cumulative aggregate of
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the "Deductible"), in which event the
                                              ----------                      
SecureIT Shareholders shall, subject to the foregoing limitations, be liable to
indemnify the Indemnified Persons for all Damages in excess of the Deductible.
The limitations on the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section
6.2.2 shall not be applicable to Damages incurred and arising out of any matters
            ---                                                                 
set forth in Section 6.2.3 or 6.2.6 below.

               6.2.3  Exceptions to Indemnity Limitations.
                      ----------------------------------- 

               (a) In addition to, and separate from, the foregoing agreement to
indemnify set forth in Section 6.2.1, each SecureIT Shareholder agrees,
severally and not jointly, to defend and indemnify VeriSign and each other
- -------------------------                                                 
Indemnified Person from and against any and all Damages incurred and arising out
of (i) claims of intentional fraudulent conduct, intentional misrepresentation
or other willful misconduct by such SecureIT Shareholder, (ii) any criminal
matters involving SecureIT or any such SecureIT Shareholder, (iii) any failure
of such SecureIT Shareholder to have good, valid and marketable title to any
issued and outstanding shares of SecureIT Common Stock held (or asserted to have
been held) by such SecureIT Shareholder, free 
<PAGE>
 
and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, or to have the full right,
capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and to vote such person's
shares of SecureIT Stock in favor of the Merger and any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) any claim concerning the breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.3 (including without
limitation any claim on account of purchases or repurchases of SecureIT stock
arising prior to the Effective Time), (v) any action or inaction by the SecureIT
Shareholders inconsistent with the requirements for S corporations, and (vi) any
claim under Section 7.8 below. A SecureIT Shareholder's liability under the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.2.3 shall be in addition to any
liability of such SecureIT Shareholder under Section 6.2.1 and shall not be
subject to the limitations on such SecureIT Shareholder's liability set forth in
Section 6.2.2 and shall not be limited to such SecureIT Shareholder's Escrow
Shares.

          (b) Any claim for Damages made by an Indemnified Person against the
SecureIT Shareholders as a result of any failure of SecureIT and/or the SecureIT
Shareholders to have an effective S election for any taxable period prior to the
Effective Time shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections
6.1.1 or 6.2.2.  Nevertheless, for purposes of this Section 6.2.3(b), Damages
for which VeriSign may make a claim shall be limited to the excess of (i) the
total amount of all Taxes for which SecureIT may be liable as a C corporation
for federal and state income tax purposes for taxable periods prior to the
Effective Time (calculating SecureIT's C corporation taxable income for purposes
of this Section 6.2.3(b) by a hypothetical closing of SecureIT's books and
records immediately prior to the Effective Time), all interest and penalties
incurred in connection therewith, and reasonable fees and expenses of
professionals engaged in connection with the resolution of any claim arising
with respect to such Taxes over (ii) the Tax Dividend (as hereinafter defined)
that would have been paid to the SecureIT Shareholders had SecureIT had an
effective S election, but which was not paid by SecureIT to the SecureIT
Shareholders.  For purposes of this Section 6.2.3(b), "Tax Dividend" means the
amount payable pursuant to the cash distribution to the SecureIT Shareholders
declared by the Board of Directors of SecureIT on July 3, 1998 as if the S
election were effective.  Recovery of such claims shall be made only from the
Tax Escrow Shares, as defined in, and subject to the terms and conditions of,
the Escrow Agreement.

          6.2.4  Survival of Claims.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
                 ------------------                                            
if, prior to the expiration of a particular representation, warranty or
obligation, an Indemnified Person makes a claim for indemnification under either
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement with respect to a breach of such
representation or warranty, then the Indemnified Person's rights to
indemnification under this Section 6.2 for such claim shall survive any
expiration of such representation, warranty or obligation.

          6.2.5  Indemnification Procedures.  Promptly after the receipt by
                 --------------------------                                
VeriSign of notice or discovery of any claim, damage or legal action or
proceeding giving rise to indemnification rights under this Agreement, VeriSign
will give the Representative and the Escrow Agent written notice of such claim,
damage, legal action or proceeding (a "Claim") in accordance with Section 1(c)
                                       -----                                  
of the Escrow Agreement.  Within ten days of delivery of such written notice,
the Representative may, at the expense of the SecureIT Shareholders, elect to
take 
<PAGE>
 
all necessary steps properly to contest any Claim involving third parties or to
prosecute such Claim to conclusion or settlement satisfactory to the
Representative. If the Representative makes the foregoing election, VeriSign
will have the right to participate at its own expense in all proceedings. If the
Representative does not make such election, VeriSign shall be free to handle the
prosecution or defense of any such Claim, will take all necessary steps to
contest the Claim involving third parties or to prosecute such Claim to
conclusion or settlement satisfactory to VeriSign, and will notify the
Representative of the progress of any such Claim, will permit the
Representative, at the sole cost of the Representative or the SecureIT
Shareholders, to participate in such prosecution or defense and will provide the
Representative with reasonable access to all relevant information and
documentation relating to the Claim and VeriSign's prosecution or defense
thereof. In any case, the party not in control of the Claim will cooperate with
the other party in the conduct of the prosecution or defense of such Claim.
Neither party will compromise or settle any such Claim without the written
consent of either VeriSign (if the Representative defends the Claim) or the
Representative (if VeriSign defends the Claim), such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

          6.2.6  Vora Litigation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
                 ---------------

J.S. Chaudhry and P.J. Chaudhry (collectively, "Chaudhry") shall take all steps
                                                --------                       
to contest these claims and to defend against such claims to conclusion or
settlement at the sole expense of Chaudhry.  Chaudhry will notify SecureIT of
the progress of any such claims.  In the defense thereof by Chaudhry, SecureIT
(including the Surviving Corporation) will cooperate with Chaudhry and will
provide Chaudhry with reasonable access to all relevant information and
documentation relating to the claims in the control or possession of SecureIT.
Chaudhry will indemnify and hold harmless SecureIT, the Surviving Corporation,
VeriSign and the Indemnified Persons from Damages incurred or arising out of the
Vora Litigation, including all amounts paid in settlement thereof (provided the
settlement is approved by Chaudhry).  Chaudhry's liability under the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.2.6 shall be in addition to any
liability of Chaudhry under Section 6.2.1 and shall not be subject to the
limitations on liability set forth in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2.2 and shall not be
limited to Chaudhry's Escrow Shares.

     7.   MISCELLANEOUS

          7.1  Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.  The internal laws of the
               ---------------------------------                           
State of California (irrespective of its choice of law principles) will govern
the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the
interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto.
Any dispute hereunder ("Dispute") shall be settled by arbitration in (a) San
                        -------                                             
Francisco, California, in the case of an arbitration initiated by the SecureIT
Shareholders and (b) in Atlanta, Georgia, in the case of an arbitration
initiated by VeriSign and, except as herein specifically stated, any such
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration
rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules") then in effect.
                                                ---------                   
However, in all events, these arbitration provisions shall govern over any
conflicting 
<PAGE>
 
rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the AAA Rules. Any judgment
upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the
authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in
any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a Dispute.

          7.1.1  Compensation of Arbitrator. Any such arbitration will be
                 --------------------------                              
conducted before a single arbitrator who will be compensated for his or her
services at a rate to be determined by the parties or by the American
Arbitration Association, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting
rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to agree upon his
or her rate of compensation.

          7.1.2  Selection of Arbitrator.  The American Arbitration Association
                 -----------------------                                       
will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who
are lawyers familiar with contract law and mergers and acquisitions; provided,
however, that such lawyers cannot work for a firm then performing services for
either party, that each party will have the opportunity to make such reasonable
objection to any of the arbitrators listed as such party may wish and that the
American Arbitration Association will select the arbitrator from the list of
arbitrators as to whom neither party makes any such objection.  In the event
that the foregoing procedure is not followed, each party will choose one person
from the list of arbitrators provided by the American Arbitration Association
(provided that such person does not have a conflict of interest), and the two
persons so selected will select from the list provided by the American
Arbitration Association the person who will act as the arbitrator.

          7.1.3  Payment of Costs.  VeriSign and SecureIT or the SecureIT
                 ----------------                                        
Shareholders after the Closing will bear the expense of deposits and advances
required by the arbitrator in equal proportions, but either party may advance
such amounts, subject to recovery as an addition or offset to any award.  The
arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator,
all costs, fees and expenses related to the arbitration, including reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other professionals incurred by
the prevailing party.

          7.1.4  Burden of Proof.  For any Dispute submitted to arbitration, the
                 ---------------                                                
burden of proof will be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial
proceeding.

          7.1.5  Award.  Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings
                 -----                                                     
hereunder, the arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law
and a written opinion setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision
reached and will deliver such documents to each party to this Agreement along
with a signed copy of the award.

          7.1.6  Terms of Arbitration.  The arbitrator chosen in accordance with
                 --------------------                                           
these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the
terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement.

                      ----------------           
provided in this Agreement, arbitration will be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the parties for any Dispute arising out of this Agreement.

          7.2  Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns.  Neither party
               -----------------------------------------------                
hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto.  This Agreement will be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

          7.3  Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement, or the
               ------------                                             
application thereof, is for any reason held to any extent to be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto.  The parties further agree to replace such
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

          7.4  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
               ------------                                                  
each of which will be an original as regards any party whose name appears
thereon and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
This Agreement will become binding when one or more counterparts hereof,
individually or taken together, bear the signatures of both parties reflected
hereon as signatories.

          7.5  Other Remedies.  Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
               --------------                                                   
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law on such party,
and the exercise of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other.

          7.6  Amendment and Waivers.  Any term or provision of this Agreement
               ---------------------                                          
may be amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.  The
waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof will
not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding
breach or default.  This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time before or after approval of the SecureIT Shareholders.

          7.7  No Waiver.  The failure of any party to enforce any of the
               ---------                                                 
provisions hereof will not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such
party thereafter to enforce such provisions.  The waiver by any party of the
right to enforce any of the provisions hereof on any occasion will not be
construed to be a waiver of the right of such party to enforce such provision on
any other occasion.

          7.8  Expenses.  Each party will bear its respective expenses and fees
               --------                                                        
of its own accountants, attorneys, investment bankers and other professionals
incurred with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.  VeriSign will pay at or immediately 
<PAGE>
 
following the Effective Date the reasonable accounting, attorneys' and
investment banker fees and expenses and other fees and expenses incurred by
SecureIT in connection with the Merger in an amount not to exceed $1,200,000
(the "Maximum Fee Amount"). In the event that such Merger expenses exceed
      ------------------                      
the Maximum Fee Amount, any such excess fees or expenses shall be paid by
VeriSign but shall be reimbursed to VeriSign as a "Claim" (as such term is
defined in the Escrow Agreement) under the Escrow Agreement.

          7.9  Notices.  Any notice or other communication required or permitted
               -------

          7.10  Construction of Agreement.  The language hereof will not be
                -------------------------                                  
construed for or against either party.  A reference to an article, section or
exhibit will mean an article or section in, or an exhibit to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise explicitly set forth.  The titles and headings in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not in any manner limit the
<PAGE>
 
construction of this Agreement.  For the purposes of such construction, this
Agreement will be considered as a whole.

          7.11  No Joint Venture.  Nothing contained in this Agreement will be
                ----------------                                              
deemed or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between the
parties hereto.  No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an agent,
employee or legal representative of any other party.  No party will have the
power to control the activities and operations of any other, and the parties'
status is, and at all times, will continue to be, that of independent
contractors with respect to each other.  No party will have any power or
authority to bind or commit any other.  No party will hold itself out as having
any authority or relationship in contravention of this Section.

          7.12  Further Assurances.  Each party agrees to cooperate fully with
                ------------------                                            
the other party and to execute such further instruments, documents and
agreements and to give such further written assurances as may be reasonably
requested by the other party to evidence and reflect the transactions provided
for herein and to carry into effect the intent of this Agreement.

          7.13  Absence of Third Party Beneficiary Rights.  No provisions of
                -----------------------------------------                   
this Agreement are intended, nor will be interpreted, to provide or create any
third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client,
customer, affiliate, partner or employee of any party hereto or any other person
or entity, unless specifically provided otherwise herein, and, except as so
provided, all provisions hereof will be personal solely between the parties to
this Agreement.

          7.14  Public Announcement.  VeriSign and SecureIT will issue a press
                -------------------                                           
release approved by both parties announcing the Merger as soon as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement. VeriSign may issue such press
releases, and make such other disclosures regarding the Merger, as it determines
to be required or appropriate under applicable securities laws or NASD rules
after reasonable consultation, where possible, with SecureIT.  SecureIT will not
make any other public announcement or disclosure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  SecureIT will take all reasonable precautions
to prevent any trading in the securities of VeriSign by officers, directors,
employees and agents of SecureIT, (a) having knowledge of any material
information regarding VeriSign provided hereunder until the information in
question has been publicly disclosed or (b) to the extent that such trading
would adversely affect the treatment of the Merger as a "pooling of interests"
for accounting purposes.

          7.15  Confidentiality.  Except as expressly authorized by VeriSign in
                ---------------                                                
writing, SecureIT will not directly or indirectly divulge to any person or
entity or use any VeriSign Confidential Information, except as required for the
performance of its duties under this Agreement.  Except as expressly authorized
by SecureIT in writing, VeriSign will not directly or indirectly divulge to any

         ---------------------------------                                 
designated by VeriSign as confidential whether developed by VeriSign or
disclosed to VeriSign by a third party, (b) the source code to any VeriSign
software and any trade secrets relating to any of the foregoing, and

Information" and "SecureIT Confidential Information" also include the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, except as disclosed in accordance with Section
7.14 above. The foregoing restriction will apply to information about a party
whether or not it was obtained from such party's employees, acquired or
developed by the other party during such other party's performance under this
Agreement, or otherwise learned. The foregoing restrictions will not apply to
information that (i) has become publicly known through no wrongful act of the
receiving party, (ii) has been rightfully received from a third party authorized
by the party which is the owner, creator or compiler to make such disclosure
without restriction, (iii) has been approved or released by written
authorization of the party which is the owner, creator or compiler, or (iv) is
being or has therefore been disclosed pursuant to a valid court order after a
reasonable attempt has been made to notify the party which is the owner, creator
or compiler.

          7.16  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the exhibits hereto and the
                ----------------                                              
accompanying letter from VeriSign regarding SecureIT employees constitute the
entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or
understandings, inducements or conditions, express or implied, written or oral,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The express
terms hereof control and supersede any course of performance or usage of trade
inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.

          7.17  Post-Closing Covenant.  VeriSign, SecureIT and each of the
                ---------------------                                     
SecureIT Shareholders hereby agree to co-operate with each other in good faith
following the Effective Date to agree the allocation of items of tax
significance (such as income, deductions, and credits, etc.) between the short
tax year of SecureIT ended at the Effective Time and the remaining tax year of
SecureIT commencing immediately after the Effective Time.  VeriSign shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all tax returns
for SecureIT for the period ending on or prior to the Effective Date that are
due to be filed after the Effective Date.  VeriSign shall permit the SecureIT
Shareholders to review and comment on each such tax return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing.  The Secure IT Shareholders may request
revisions to such tax returns, which revisions shall be made subject to
VeriSign's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  VeriSign,
SecureIT and the SecureIT Shareholders hereby also agree to cooperate with each
other in good faith following the Effective Date in connection with any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.  Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the providing of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of 
<PAGE>
 
any material provided hereunder. VeriSign, SecureIT and the SecureIT
Shareholders agree: (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to SecureIT relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Effective Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by VeriSign, SecureIT or any SecureIT Shareholder, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to
give the other parties reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if any other party so requests,
VeriSign, SecureIT or any SecureIT Shareholder, as the case may be, shall allow
the other party to take possession of such books and records. If, following the
Effective Date, SecureIT becomes subject to an audit by the Internal Revenue
Service or any state taxing agency or authority for tax years or periods prior
to the Effective Time (including, but not limited to, any such short tax year
resulting from the Merger), the SecureIT Shareholders will be responsible for
such audit(s) and shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve all such audits in
a manner consistent with the intentions of SecureIT and VeriSign as expressed in
this Agreement.

     A.  The Company and the Holders are parties to that certain Amended and
Restated Investors' Rights Agreement dated as of November 15, 1996 (the "RIGHTS

corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with and into SecureIT
(the "MERGER").  The Plan provides, among other things, that the shares of
Common Stock of SecureIT that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger will be converted into shares of Common Stock of VeriSign (the
"MERGER SHARES") upon the effective time of the Merger.

     C.  In connection with the Merger, the SecureIT Shareholders have been
granted, among other things, certain piggyback registration rights with respect
to a certain number of Merger Shares issued to the SecureIT Shareholders in the
Merger pursuant to the terms of a certain Registration Rights Agreement, dated
July 6, 1998, entered into between the Company and the SecureIT Shareholders
(the "SECUREIT RIGHTS AGREEMENT").

     D.  The parties hereto agree to amend the Rights Agreement to permit the
inclusion of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of Merger
Shares issued to the SecureIT Shareholders in the Merger (the "PIGGYBACK
REGISTRABLE PORTION") in any demand registration effected by the Holders
pursuant to Section 1.2 of the Rights Agreement during the period commencing on
the date upon which VeriSign publicly releases a report including financial
statements of VeriSign that include at least thirty days of post-Merger combined
operating results of VeriSign and SecureIT and ending on January 30, 1999 (the
"REGISTRATION PERIOD").

     E.  Section 3.7 of the Rights Agreement provides that any provision of the
Rights Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Company and the
<PAGE>
 
Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Rights
Agreement) then outstanding, and the undersigned Holders hold a majority of such
Registrable Securities.  Pursuant to Section 3.7 of the Rights Agreement, an
amendment effected in accordance with Section 3.7 is binding upon each holder of
any Registrable Securities then outstanding, each future holder of all such
Registrable Securities and the Company.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above-recited facts and the mutual
promises, covenants and conditions contained herein, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

     1.  INCLUSION OF MERGER SHARES IN DEMAND REGISTRATION.  Notwithstanding the
         -------------------------------------------------                      
provisions of Section 1.14 of the Rights Agreement, in the event that a
registration statement covering Registrable Securities is filed by the Company
under the Act upon the request of Holders in accordance with the terms of
Section 1.2(a) of the Rights Agreement during the Registration Period (a "DEMAND
REGISTRATION"), the Holders agree that the Company may include in such Demand
Registration, in addition to the Registrable Securities held by the Holders and
subject to Section 2 below, up to that number of Merger Shares equal to the
Piggyback Registrable Portion of the Merger Shares that are requested by the
SecureIT Shareholders to be included in such registration pursuant to the terms
of the SecureIT Rights Agreement.

     2.  UNDERWRITTEN DEMAND REGISTRATION.  Notwithstanding the provisions of
         --------------------------------                                    
Section 1.2(b) of the Rights Agreement, in the event that such Demand
Registration is an underwritten offering, and the underwriter advises the
Initiating Holders (as defined in the Rights Agreement) in writing that
marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be
underwritten in such Demand Registration, then the number of shares that may be
included in the underwriting shall be allocated among the Holders and the
SecureIT Shareholders in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the amount of
Registrable Securities and/or Merger Shares owned by each Holder and each
SecureIT Shareholder, in accordance with Section 1.2(b) of the Prior Rights
Agreement, pari passu, treating each SecureIT Shareholder as if such SecureIT
Shareholder were a Holder under the Rights Agreement and as if such SecureIT
Shareholder's Merger Shares were Registrable Securities for the purpose of said
Section 1.2(b), provided, however, that, in no event, shall the number of shares
to be included by the SecureIT Shareholders exceed the Piggyback Registrable
Portion of the Merger Shares.

     3.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  Except as specifically set forth above, all terms
         ----------------                                                    
and conditions of the Rights Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
This Amendment shall be deemed to form an integral part of the Rights Agreement
and shall be governed by California law.  In the event of any inconsistency or
conflict between the provisions of the Rights Agreement and this Amendment, the
provisions of this Amendment will prevail and govern.

     4.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  The provisions of this Amendment shall be
         ----------------------                                            
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted
successors and assigns.
<PAGE>
 
     5.  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  Each party hereby covenants and agrees that it
         ------------------                                                 
shall execute and deliver such deeds and other documents as may be required to
implement any of the provisions of this Amendment.

     6.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of
         ------------                                                          
which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one
and the same instrument.

     7.  EFFECTIVENESS OF AMENDMENT.  As provided in Section 3.7 of the Rights
         --------------------------                                           
Agreement, this Amendment shall be binding upon each holder of any Registrable
Securities outstanding as of the date hereof, any future holder of all such
Registrable Securities and the Company.  This Amendment shall be become
effective and binding upon (a) the execution of this Amendment by the Company
and the holders of a majority of the currently outstanding Registrable
Securities, and (b) the consummation of the Merger.

For Immediate Release


VERISIGN ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF SECUREIT

Acquisition Complements Company's Enterprise Digital Certificate and Public Key
Infrastructure Solutions

MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, JULY 6, 1998 - VeriSign, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRSN), the leading
provider of digital certificate and public key infrastructure (PKI) services
announced today that it has acquired privately-held SecureIT, Inc., a leading
provider of Internet-related security services. The acquisition extends
VeriSign's leadership in providing enterprises with fully-operational digital
certificate and PKI solutions and services to deploy secure intranet, extranet,
and e-commerce applications.  VeriSign has issued  approximately 1,666,000
shares of VeriSign common stock to purchase all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of SecureIT and has assumed SecureIT's outstanding employee stock
options. The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.

SecureIT, Inc. delivers a range of Internet security services--including
architectural consulting, integration, testing, and education --which enable
enterprises to deploy secure electronic commerce and communications
applications. The company's specially trained security consultants and unique
security methodologies help organizations design, implement and test secure end-
to-end solutions. SecureIT also offers certified educational programs and
packaged security management tools to help customers  monitor and enhance their
Internet-based applications and services. SecureIT's customer base spans several
industry segments and includes a large number of leading organizations such as
AT&T, Bell Atlantic, CheckFree, Cox Enterprises, First Union Corporation,
General Electric, Reuters and Turner Broadcasting.

"Enterprises worldwide are beginning to realize the power and economic benefits
of using secure Internet-based solutions for business-critical applications such
as electronic document exchange, supply chain management, and customer support,"
said Stratton Sclavos, president and CEO of VeriSign.  "Our customers are now
accelerating their deployment plans for these applications and are looking for
the kind of security expertise  and implementation support that SecureIT
delivers."

"We believe that VeriSign and SecureIT are an excellent fit in terms of
products, markets, customer focus and culture," said Jay Chaudhry, CEO of
SecureIT.  "SecureIT has been helping enterprises secure their network
infrastructures through the use of firewalls, proxy servers, certificate enabled
web servers and other security technologies.  We think the natural next step is
to expand the use of digital certificates and PKI to enable more advanced
solutions such as virtual private networks and secure messaging."

VeriSign plans to offer SecureIT's services through both its direct and indirect
sales channels and will collaborate with the SecureIT staff to further enhance
the educational programs that SecureIT delivers. SecureIT's consultants will add
VeriSign OnSite to their suite of integrated security solutions and will promote
digital certificate and PKI-enabled applications to their existing customer
base. SecureIT's consulting and training services will also be extended to
include advanced PKI and OnSite implementation skills.

VeriSign OnSite is the only digital certificate solution to provide enterprises
with a fully-operational and highly scaleable PKI, allowing customers to achieve
rapid time-to-market with the lowest resource investment and total cost of
ownership.  OnSite is also based on open standards which allows enterprises to
integrate their digital certificate and PKI solution with hundreds of third
party and custom applications, as opposed to using standalone, proprietary
security software.

solutions used by enterprises, Web sites and consumers to conduct secure
communications and transactions over the Internet and IP-based private networks.
