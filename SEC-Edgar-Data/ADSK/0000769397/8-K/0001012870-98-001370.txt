ITEM 2.   ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
          ------------------------------------ 

     On May 4, 1998, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of May 4,
1998 (the "Agreement") among the Registrant, Autodesk Development B.V., Autodesk
GmbH (collectively, "Autodesk"), Genius CAD Software GmbH ("Genius") and Dr.
Georg Baumann, Autodesk acquired from Genius certain assets related to Genius's
mechanical applications business (the "Acquired Assets").  Genius is a German
limited liability company which develops and markets application software
products primarily for the mechanical computer-aided design market.

     Pursuant to the Agreement, Autodesk paid $68,000,000 cash in exchange for
the Acquired Assets, which, among other things, consist of: (i) all intellectual
property rights to Genius's mechanical design software application suite (the
"Technology"), including all patents and copyrights (and all applications
therefor) and certain trade and service marks relating to the Technology, (ii)
all rights of Genius under specified contracts and third-party licenses relating
to the Technology, (iii) a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to
Genius's internal order processing software, (iv) a worldwide, non-exclusive,
royalty-free license to certain trade and service marks of Genius in connection
with the marketing of the Technology, and (v) certain fixed assets and
inventory.  Certain of the Acquired Assets constitute physical property, and
were used by Genius in the conduct of its mechanical computer-aided design
software business.  Autodesk presently intends to continue to use certain such
assets for similar purposes, subject to changing needs of its business.

     The consideration paid by Autodesk for the Acquired Assets pursuant to the
Agreement was determined pursuant to arms' length negotiations and took into
account various factors concerning the valuation of the acquired business,
including the book value of the Acquired Assets.  The cash used in payment for
the Acquired Assets was from Autodesk's general working capital.

          --------------------------------- 

     (a)  Financial Statements of Business Acquired
          -----------------------------------------

materiality threshold of Rule 3-05(b)(2)(i) of Regulation S-X (17 C.F.R. (S)
210.3-05(b)(2)(i)), financial information of the acquired business is not
required to be filed pursuant to Item 7(a) of this Form 8-K.


     (b)  Pro Forma Financial Information.
          ------------------------------- 

          Pro forma financial information is not required to be filed pursuant
to Item 7(b) of this Form 8-K because separate financial statements of the
acquired business are not included in this filing, see 17 C.F.R. (S) 210.11-

     This ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into so
as to be effective on May 4, 1998 by and between Autodesk, Inc., a Delaware
corporation.  The Swiss branch of Autodesk Development B.V., a Netherlands
corporation, and Autodesk GmbH, a German limited liability company, subject to
the limitations set forth below (jointly and severally "AUTODESK"), and Genius
CAD Software GmbH, a German limited liability company ("GENIUS").  Dr. Georg
Baumann, an individual and a citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany ("DR.
BAUMANN") is a signatory party to this Agreement only for the limited purposed
specified in Sections 1.7 (vi), 2.8, 2.11, 2.12, 2.23, 2.27, 5.6, 5.17, 7.1 and
10 of this Agreement, and for the purposes set forth in the other agreements
referred to specifically in those Sections, and for no other purpose whatsoever.
Autodesk GmbH is a signatory party to this Agreement only to the extent that the
provisions of this Agreement and the agreements contemplated herein, relate to
the fixed Genius Assets (as defined in Section 1.1 and Schedule 1.1(f)), the New
                                                       --------------           
Autodesk Employees (as defined in Section 1.8(a) and Schedule 1.8), the Sub-

Agreement (as described in Section 5.14 and EXHIBIT K).  Where appropriate,
Autodesk GmbH shall be referred to as a distinct entity in this Agreement.

                                    RECITALS

     A.  Genius is engaged in the business of developing and marketing software
products to third parties, including products which provide tools for mechanical
design professionals. The above activities of Genius shall be collectively
referred to as the "BUSINESS".

     B.  Autodesk and Autodesk's Board of Directors believe that it
is in the best interests of Autodesk and its shareholders, and Genius and its
Managing Directors believe that it is in the best interests of Genius and its
shareholders, that Autodesk acquire certain assets of, and assume certain of the
liabilities of Genius (the "ACQUISITION") in consideration of a cash payment by
Autodesk (as described in Section 1.5(a)) and the assumption by Autodesk of the
Assumed Liabilities (as described in Section 1.3).  A portion of the funds
otherwise payable in cash by Autodesk in connection with the Acquisition shall
be placed in escrow, and the payment of such amount shall be contingent upon
certain events and conditions which are set forth in the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement (Exhibit A).

     C.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the primary purpose of
this Agreement is to transfer certain software technology developed and under
development by Genius which constitute a major component of the Genius Assets
(as defined in Section 1.1), and that the transfer of tangible personal property
such as computer diskettes, schematics and manuals contemplated hereby is
incidental to such primary purpose.


     D.  It is recognized by Autodesk that Genius will continue to operate as an
ongoing business and retains all ownership to the name "Genius".

     Therefore, the parties agree as follows:

                             --------- 

     c)  Value Added Tax.  Autodesk shall pay to Genius the applicable German or
         ---------------                                                        
other value added tax ("VAT") payable by with respect to the Acquisition and
other transactions contemplated herein no later than one (1) week before such
VAT is due and payable, provided that Genius no later than two (2) weeks before
the date such payment is due shall have submitted to Autodesk a properly
prepared invoice specifying the amounts of VAT estimated in good faith by Genius
to be due and the due date(s) for such VAT payment(s).  Such invoice shall be
addressed to Faberstrasse 9 92224 Amberg, Germany.  To the extent that Autodesk
or Autodesk's local subsidiary has a claim for a refund of VAT in the
jurisdiction in which the VAT was assessed, Autodesk shall have the right to
assign such claim to Genius no later than one (1) week before the above due date
in order to enable Genius to set off the claim so assigned against their
respective obligation to pay VAT.  Upon request, Genius shall use its best
efforts to facilitate securing such assignment and set off.  The parties shall
cooperate in using all methods available under governing law to minimize VAT
liability.

     d)  Other U.S. Taxes.  Autodesk shall bear and pay and, if appropriate,

withholding taxes, documentary charges, recording fees or similar taxes,
charges, fees or expenses ("U.S. SALES TAXES") that may become payable in
connection with the sale of the Genius Assets to Autodesk imposed by the taxing
authority of, or a taxing authority within, the United States.  Other than in
relation to the Allocation which shall be governed by the provisions of Section
1.6, the parties shall cooperate with each other to the extent reasonably
requested and legally permitted to minimize any such U.S. Sales Taxes.

     e)  Other German Taxes.  Except as set forth in Section 1.5(c), Genius
         ------------------                                                
shall bear and pay and, if appropriate, shall reimburse Autodesk for any sales
taxes, use taxes, transfer taxes, withholding taxes, documentary charges,
recording fees or similar taxes, charges, fees or expenses imposed by the
Federal Republic of Germany that may become payable in connection 

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
with the sale of the Genius Assets to Autodesk ("GERMAN SALES TAXES"). Other
than in relation to the Allocation which shall be governed by the provisions of
Section 1.6, the parties shall cooperate with each other to the extent
reasonably requested and legally permitted to minimize any such German Sales
Taxes.

1.6  Preliminary Allocation.  On or before Closing, Autodesk and Genius shall

Section 1.5 is to be allocated among the Genius Assets (the "PRELIMINARY
ALLOCATION"), which Preliminary Allocation shall be as set forth in Schedule
                                                                    --------
1.6; provided, however, that mutually acceptable modifications to the
Preliminary Allocation resulting from changes in Genius' financial position
since the Summary Financial Information (as defined in Section 2.5) shall be
permitted.  The parties shall make best efforts to agree upon a final allocation
("FINAL ALLOCATION") within forty-five (45) days of Closing.  To assist in such
allocation, Genius shall provide a summary listing of product inventory held by
Genius at Closing and a final listing of the fixed Genius Assets transferred to
Autodesk GmbH at Closing.  The Final Allocation shall be conclusive and binding
upon Autodesk and Genius for all purposes, and the parties agree that all tax
returns and reports (including U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 8594
if such form is required to be prepared and filed by a party hereto in
accordance with the provisions of the Code) and all financial statements shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with (and the parties shall not otherwise
file a tax return position inconsistent with) the Final Allocation unless they
are required to do so by the IRS, the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany or
any state or local taxing authority (in which case the parties shall attempt to
negotiate a mutually acceptable alternative).  Both the Preliminary Allocation
and the Final Allocation shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Section
1060 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and the

valid right, interest or license to use the Baumann Licensed Materials being

Licensed Materials in the conduct of the Business currently and in the past does
not conflict with and has not conflicted with the intellectual property rights

                                            -------------               
principal terms and conditions of any such agreement, written or oral, with
respect to such fees.

2.20 Labor Matters. Schedule 2.20 contains the following information concerning
     -------------  -------------                                              
all New Autodesk Employees:  date of birth, date of service commencement, other
fringe or welfare benefits, and salary and bonuses for the period from January
1, 1997 until April 30, 1998.  Genius is in compliance in all material respects
with all currently applicable laws and regulations respecting employment,
discrimination in employment, terms and conditions of employment and wages and
hours and occupational safety and health and employment practices, and is not
engaged in any unfair labor practice.  Genius has not received any notice from
any Governmental Entity, and to the knowledge of Genius there has not been
asserted before any Governmental Entity, any claim, action or proceeding to
which Genius is a party or involving Genius, and there is neither pending nor,
to Genius' knowledge, threatened any investigation or hearing concerning Genius
arising out of or based upon any such laws, regulations or practices.  No work
stoppage or labor strike against Genius is pending, or, to the best knowledge of
Genius threatened.

2.21 Insurance.  Schedule 2.21 lists all insurance policies and fidelity bonds
     ---------   -------------                                                
covering the Genius Assets or the Business (other than those policies or bonds
which apply exclusively to that portion of the Business which consists of the
Retained Assets) and Genius' employees.  Except as expressly set forth in
Schedule 2.21, there is no claim by Genius pending under any of such policies or
- -------------                                                                   
bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies or bonds.  All premiums payable under all such
policies and bonds have been paid, and Genius is otherwise in full compliance
with the terms of such policies and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing
substantially similar insurance coverage).  Such policies of insurance and bonds
are of the type and in amounts customarily carried by persons conducting
businesses similar in size, type and otherwise, as relevant and material, to
those of Genius in the same locales and meet applicable governmental
requirements, if any, for such insurance.  Genius has no knowledge of any
threatened termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any of
such policies.

2.22 Compliance with Laws.  To the knowledge of Genius, Genius has complied
     --------------------                                                  
with, and Genius has not received any notices of violation with respect to, any
statute, law or regulation, German or foreign, applicable to Genius.

2.23 Complete Copies of Materials.  Unless Genius or Dr. Baumann have advised
     ----------------------------                                            
Autodesk to the contrary in writing prior to the Closing, Genius, and to the
extent applicable, Dr. Baumann, have delivered or made available a true and
complete copy of each document that has been requested by Autodesk or its
counsel from each such person in relation to this Agreement.

                                       29

2.24 Materials and Parts.  There is no actual or, to the knowledge of Genius,
     -------------------                                                     
threatened shortage of materials or parts from any source which reasonably would
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the portion of the Business
which is being acquired by Autodesk herein.

2.25 Inventories.  All of the inventories of Genius reflected on the Summary
     -----------                                                            
Financial Information and Genius' books and records on the date hereof (as
adjusted to eliminate any production costs allocated to inventory) were
purchased, acquired or produced in the ordinary and regular course of business
and in a manner consistent with Genius' regular inventory practices and are set
forth on Genius' books and records in accordance with the practices and
principles of Genius consistent with the method of treating said items in prior
periods.  None of the inventory of Genius reflected on the Summary Financial
Information or on Genius' books and records as of the date hereof (as adjusted
to eliminate any production costs allocated to inventory) (in either case net of
the reserve therefor) is obsolete, defective or in excess of the needs of the
business of Genius reasonably anticipated during the next six (6) months so as
to cause a Material Adverse Effect after the Closing.  The presentation of
inventory on the Summary Financial Information conforms to generally accepted
accounting principles in the Federal Republic of Germany, and such inventory is
worth its stated value or more.

2.26 No Insolvency.  Genius will not be rendered insolvent by the sale, transfer
     -------------                                                              
and assignment of the Genius Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

2.27 Representations Complete.  None of the representations or warranties made
     ------------------------                                                 
by Genius and/or Dr. Baumann (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules), nor any
statement made in any Exhibit or certificate furnished by Genius or Dr. Baumann
pursuant to this Agreement, contains or will contain at the Closing Date, any
untrue statement of a material fact, or to the knowledge of Genius or Dr.
Baumann omits or will omit at the Closing Date to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading.  There is no fact,
circumstance or condition of any kind or nature whatsoever known to Genius which
reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been
set forth in this Agreement, except those facts concerning general economic,
financial, technical, legislative, regulatory or other matters such as may
generally impact all businesses of the type operated by Genius.

provision of the governing documents of Autodesk or (ii) statute, law,

than voluntary notices to competition authorities, to the knowledge of Autodesk,

Agreement by Autodesk, nor the consummation or performance of the Acquisition or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby by Autodesk, will (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) contravene, conflict with or result in a
material violation of, or give any Governmental Entity or other person the right
to challenge any of such transactions or to exercise any remedy or obtain any

course of any litigation between any of the parties hereto.  This provision,
however, shall supplement, but shall not supersede or otherwise modify, the

Autodesk.

5.4  Expenses.  Whether or not the Acquisition is consummated, all fees and

contemplated hereby including, without limitation, all legal, accounting,
financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third parties
("THIRD PARTY EXPENSES") incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation
and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the

obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and expenses.

5.5  Public Disclosure.  Unless otherwise required by law (in which case the
     -----------------                                                      
disclosing party shall employ best efforts to provide the other parties hereto
with as much notice as possible under applicable law of the requirement of
disclosure and the content of the disclosure) or by this Agreement, prior to the
Closing Date, no disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) of the
subject matter of or Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be made unilaterally by Genius or Autodesk, unless approved by
the other party prior to any such release (which approval shall not be withheld
unreasonably and shall be given or refused promptly).  Notwithstanding this
Section 5.5 or anything else in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that
Autodesk and Genius may publicly disclose this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby not earlier than May 4, 1998.  Such disclosure may be in the
form of the issuance of the press release(s) substantially as set forth in
Exhibit L ("APPROVED PRESS RELEASE(S)"), as well as providing question and
- ---------                                                                 
answer documents and other verbal and written information which is substantially
consistent with the "APPROVED PRESS RELEASE(S)".  Autodesk shall make best
efforts to provide Genius and Dr. Baumann with as much notice as possible of the
intended date of such public disclosure.  Each party shall designate,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, a primary contact person for
resolving issues regarding the party's disclosure or confidentiality obligations
under this Agreement as well as other issues which may arise as a result of the
public disclosure of the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.5.  Until further
notice, Dr. Baumann shall be such 

                                       37
<PAGE>
 
primary contact person for Genius and himself, and Stephen Murphy shall be such
primary contact person for Autodesk. Prior to any public announcement, the
parties shall agree to contact, in strict confidence and in advance, certain
persons or entities, such as Thomas Publishing Company and the employees of
Genius, in a manner that is mutually acceptable to Genius and Autodesk.

5.6  Break-Up Fee.  In the event that this Agreement  is terminated or the
     ------------                                                         
Closing does not occur, for any reason(s) other than for the reasons set forth
below in Sections 5.6(a) through (c), inclusive, and following the public
disclosure of this Agreement or the Acquisition for any reason whatsoever other
than an unauthorized and intentional public disclosure by Genius in violation of
the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof, then Autodesk shall be obligated to pay
Genius on demand a sum, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to
five percent (5%) of what would have been the cash portion of the Consideration
as of May 4, 1998 ("Break-up Fee").  No Break-up Fee shall be due and owing if
this Agreement is terminated, or Closing does not occur, for any of the
following reasons:

     a)  Material Adverse Effect.  The occurrence or existence of a Material
         -----------------------                                            
Adverse Effect under Sections 2.1 2.2, 2.8, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 (except for third
party consents), 2.15 or 2.16; or

     b)  Intervention by a Governmental Entity.  The inability of the parties to
         -------------------------------------                                  
close the Acquisition and the other transactions referenced herein due to actual
or overtly threatened injunction or prohibition by a Governmental Entity; or

     c)  Material Breach of Special Obligations by Genius or Dr. Baumann.  A
         ---------------------------------------------------------------    
material breach by Genius and/or Dr. Baumann of his, its or their obligations
under Section 1.7 which are for the benefit of Autodesk and which is not cured
within twenty (20) Business Days after written notice thereof from Autodesk.

     For the purposes of this Section 5.6 only, the definition of "Material
Adverse Effect" shall not include those factors concerning general economic or
financial conditions or technical, legislative or regulatory changes (other than
as set forth in Section 5.5(b)) which generally impact all business of the type
operated by Genius.

                                       38
<PAGE>
 
     Genius and Autodesk agree that based upon the circumstances now existing,
known and unknown, it would be impractical or extremely difficult to establish
Genius' damage by reason of the termination of this Agreement or the non-
occurrence of the Closing other than for the specially negotiated exceptions
which are set forth above in Sections 5.6(a) through (c), inclusive.
Accordingly, Autodesk and Genius agree that it would be reasonable at such time
to award Genius "liquidated damages" equal to the amount of the Break-up Fee in
lieu of damages and in order to fairly compensate it for the damages that Genius
will likely suffer under such circumstances.

     Autodesk and Genius acknowledge and agree that the amount of the Break-up
Fee is reasonable as liquidated damages and shall be Genius' sole and exclusive
remedy in lieu of any and all other relief, right or remedy, at law or in
equity, to which Genius might otherwise be entitled by reason of the termination
of this Agreement or the non-occurrence of the Closing other than for the
specially negotiated exceptions which are set forth above; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing and consistent with the provisions of Section 10.8
hereof, Genius may seek to cause Autodesk to specifically perform its duties,
obligations, agreements, covenants and other commitments pursuant to the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in lieu of, or as an alternative to, its
seeking any damages from Autodesk under this Section 5.6.

     Upon Genius' receipt of the Break-up Fee from Autodesk, Genius and Dr.
Baumann do forever waive and release Autodesk, its directors, officers,
employees, agents, permitted assigns, successors and affiliates, and Autodesk
does forever waive and release Genius, its directors, officers, employees,
agents, permitted assigns, successors and affiliates and Dr. Baumann, his heirs,
legatees, devises, permitted assigns, successors and agents from any and all
liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the related agreements
(other than the Reciprocal Confidentiality Agreement dated January 12, 1998, as
modified on February 11, 1998) and the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated therein, other than the obligations set forth in Sections 2.4,
2.19, 3.2, 3.5, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 of this Agreement. Genius, Dr. Baumann and
Autodesk each acknowledges that their respective legal counsel has advised him
or it, and that he or it is familiar with, the provisions of Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code which provides as follows:

          A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
          NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
          RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS
          SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

     Being aware of said Code section, Genius expressly waives and relinquishes
any rights or benefit it may have thereunder, as well as under any other state
or federal statutes or common law principle of similar effect.

5.7  Consents.  Genius shall use its best efforts, with the reasonable
     --------                                                         
cooperation and assistance of Autodesk, to obtain all necessary consents,
waivers and approvals under any of the Contracts as may be required in
connection with the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
so as to transfer to Autodesk all rights of Genius thereunder as of the Closing.

5.8  Best Efforts.  Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
     ------------                                                       
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations:  to consummate and make effective the Acquisition and the other

and to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or
otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective the Acquisition and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of securing to
the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
except as contemplated in this Agreement and related documents, neither Genius
nor Autodesk shall be required to agree to any divestiture by it or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, Genius
Assets or Retained Assets, as applicable, or other property of it or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, or the imposition of any material and adverse
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own
or exercise control of such Genius Assets or Retained Assets, as applicable, or
any other properties and stock.

any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any
representation or warranty by such party as set forth in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) any failure of
such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect
any remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

5.10 Additional Documents and Further Assurances.  Each party hereto, at the
     -------------------------------------------

instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably
necessary for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the
Acquisition and the other transactions that are contemplated hereby.

(other than as expressly provided to the contrary in Sections 1.5(c) and Section
1.5(e)).

and fully satisfy and discharge all of its indebtedness and any other

liabilities and obligations as they become due as related to Genius' Assets
which were incurred on or prior to the Closing Date, except for the Assumed
Liabilities, or any liabilities specifically imposed upon by Autodesk by the
provisions of this Agreement or any other related agreement which is referenced
herein, and such liabilities and obligations as Genius shall be contesting in

and discharge all of its indebtedness and any other liabilities and obligations
then due and all such other indebtedness, liabilities and obligations as they
become due which are related in any way to Genius' Assets after the Closing

with applicable legal requirements.  Genius and Autodesk each shall pay, after
the Closing and in a timely manner, all Taxes required to be paid by them after

9.3  Post-Closing Access to the Pre-Closing Books and Records of Genius.  At all
     ------------------------------------------------------------------         
times subsequent to the Closing and for as long as a party hereto specifies a
reasonable basis therefor (as examples only and not in limitation, a tax audit,
the assertion of a claim, or the involvement of such party in relevant
litigation, arbitration or governmental proceedings), each party hereto shall
afford the other parties hereto and their accountants, legal counsel and other
representatives with full, convenient, reasonable and complete access, during
all normal business hours subsequent to the Closing Date, to (and shall thereby
cause such party to provide to such other parties and their representatives) all
of the pre-Closing books and records of Genius held by such party and shall
furnish all information that may be reasonably requested subsequent to the
Closing in relation to this Agreement, the Acquisition, the other transactions
that are contemplated herein or hereby, or the conduct of the Business prior to
the Closing.  Such other parties may, however, seek to impose reasonable
restrictions upon such accessibility by the requesting party to protect its, his
or their legitimate interests in trade secrets or other forms of proprietary and
confidential information. Unless the parties hereto agree otherwise, all books
and records, which are described in this Section 9.3, shall be maintained in a
reasonably accessible manner and in accordance with applicable German and
California laws for a minimum period of ten (10) years following the Closing.

Closing, in a sealed container, and Autodesk shall retain in such unopened and
sealed container for a period of five (5) years following Closing, a duplicate
of the source code for the Genius Products as they existed as of the date of
Closing ("Snap Shot of the Source"). Genius may request that the Snap Shot of
the Source be produced solely for the following purposes:

     a)  to assist Genius in the defense of a claim made against Genius which
concerns or relates to the condition of the Genius Products as they existed on
or before Closing, provided that under no circumstances shall the Snap Shot of
the Source be voluntarily disclosed to any third party, including a judge,
court, arbitrator or any other party, and Genius shall provide Autodesk with as
much notice as is possible in the event of an official or judicial request for
the Snap Shot of the Source, and shall assist Autodesk, in a manner consistent
with Genius' interests, in securing a protective order to prelude or limit the
disclosure of the Snap Shot of the Source; or

     b)  In the event of a dispute arising in this Agreement regarding the
condition of the Genius Products as they existed on or before Closing; provided
that in this case, the parties agree that the Snap Shot of the Source shall not
be disclosed to any third party other than the trier of fact or law, in
accordance with arbitration or judicial proceedings involving Autodesk and one
or more of the parties hereto.

     The Snap Shot of the Source shall be maintained in its original condition
and in strict confidence by Genius at all times and shall not be used for any
purpose whatsoever other than as expressly authorized in this Section 9.4.  The
rights and obligations set forth in this Section 9.5 may not be assigned, sold,
or otherwise conveyed by Genius under any circumstances, without the written
consent of Autodesk, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and shall be
promptly given or refused (the reorganization disclosed in Section 2 expressly
consented to by Autodesk as it relates to this Section 9.4).  Genius shall not
make any copies of the Snap Shot of the Source, and shall promptly return same
immediately after it is no longer needed for the purposes set forth in this
Section 9.4.

     ------------------------------------------                          
warranties of Genius Dr. Baumann, and Autodesk as set forth in Sections 2 and 3

suit in equity in relation to this Agreement (including all post-Closing matters
and/or obligations), the Prevailing Party (as defined below), in addition to all
other relief or sums to which it may be granted or entitled, may call upon the
non-Prevailing Party to pay a reasonable sum for its attorneys' fees and to pay
all other costs and expenses that have been incurred by the Prevailing Party
(including, without limitation, expert witness fees and costs, travel time and
associated costs, copying costs, deposition costs, exhibit costs, fees and costs
on appeal, fees and costs associated with execution on any judgment or order,
special transcript costs, and the appointment of a special master or discovery

referee), either directly or indirectly, in connection with said arbitration,
action or suit, which sum shall be determined by the arbitrators in their
proceedings or by the court in such litigation or in a separate action brought
for that purpose.  "PREVAILING PARTY" shall mean, for purposes of this Section
10.2, the party who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the
case may be, whether by compromise, settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by
the other party of its claim of Loss or Losses (as defined in the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) or other claim or
                                             ---------                   
claims, or its defense as defined by the court arbitrator or equivalent
tribunal.  The award of attorney's fees to a Prevailing Party shall be computed
in accordance with the fee schedule, if any, of any court or the rules of any
provider or sponsor of the forum for an arbitration.  Should either party incur
attorneys' fees in order to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including post-Closing covenants, whether or not a legal action is instituted,
the party not in default shall be similarly entitled to reimbursement of such
attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other remedies either party may
have at law or in equity.  Moreover, such Prevailing Party shall be entitled to
recover any and all post-award or, if applicable, post-judgment costs, expenses,
and attorneys' fees which are incurred in relation to the appeal of, or
enforcing, any award in arbitration or any judgment relating to this Agreement,
and such right of such Prevailing Party shall survive, and is not to be merged
into, any such award or judgment.

10.3 Notices.  All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in

10.4 Interpretation.  When a reference is made in this Agreement to Schedules or
     --------------                                                             
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated.  Each instance in this Agreement of the words
"INCLUDE," "INCLUDES" and "INCLUDING" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "WITHOUT LIMITATION".  The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be construed to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  The words "HEREIN",
"HEREOF" and "HEREUNDER" and other words of similar import refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section, Schedule, Exhibit or
other subdivision.  Similarly, the words "THEREIN", "THEREOF" and "THEREUNDER"
and other words of similar import refer to a particular agreement or other
instrument as a whole and not to any particular segment, part, paragraph,
subparagraph or other subdivision.  Any reference to a statute includes and
refers to the statute itself, as well as to the rules and regulations made and
duly promulgated pursuant thereto, and all amendments made thereto and in force
currently from time to time and any statutes, rules or regulations thereafter
duly made, enacted and/or promulgated, as may be appropriate, and/or any other
governmental actions thereafter duly taken from time to time having the effect
of supplementing or superseding such statutes, rules and/or regulations.  The
language in all parts of this Agreement shall be in all cases construed simply,
fairly, equitably and reasonably, according to its plain meaning and not
strictly for or against one or more of the parties hereto.  When required by the
context, whenever the singular number is used in this Agreement, the same shall
include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders and vice versa; the word
"PERSON" shall include individuals, governmental agencies and entities,
corporations, partnerships (general and limited), limited liability companies,
or other entities or forms of association.

10.5 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
     ------------                                                              
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.  The German translation of this document has been
provided for convenience only, may not be executed and shall not be construed as
an enforceable agreement.  The parties agree that facsimile copies shall be
deemed to be the equivalent of an original of such document.

10.6 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and
     ----------------                                                         
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and all other agreements which are referenced
particularly herein as being in force and effect after the Closing between any
two (2) or more parties hereto:  (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof excluding the Reciprocal Confidentiality
Agreement between Autodesk and Genius dated January 12, 1998 as amended on
February 11, 1998; (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any
rights or remedies hereunder, unless expressly provided otherwise; and (c) shall
not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise except as otherwise
specifically provided.

10.7 Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
     ------------                                                           
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto.  The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of 

                                       52
<PAGE>
 
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

10.8 Equitable or Extraordinary Remedies.  Each party hereto acknowledges that
     -----------------------------------                                      
in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the other party, monetary damages
will be inadequate, in which case the injured party shall be entitled to seek
special, equitable or extraordinary relief, such as injunction or specific
performance.

10.9 Other Remedies.  Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indemnity
     --------------                                                          
Escrow Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any
one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

10.10  Governing Law and Arbitration.  This Agreement shall be governed in all
       -----------------------------                                          
respects by and shall be construed under the laws of the State of California,
United States, as such laws are applied to contracts between California
residents entered into and to be performed entirely within such state and
without any consideration of conflicts of law principles.  The parties hereto
expressly exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods.  All disputes arising in connection with
this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Conciliation and
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris by three (3)
arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules.  Arbitration shall take
place in Frankfurt, Germany, and shall be held in the English language (however
testimony and other evidence in German or other languages will be permitted as
long as the party, who is offering such testimony, provides a qualified English
translator).  The determination of the arbitrators shall be final, binding, non-
appealable and enforceable in any jurisdiction in accordance with its terms.

     In modification and supplementation of such Rules of Conciliation and
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce and to the extent that such
rules do not prohibit any such modification and supplementation by persons who
elect voluntarily to be bound by such rules as so modified and supplemented, the
parties hereto agree that any conciliation or arbitration pursuant to such rules
shall be subject to the following understandings of the parties hereto:

          a)  The Prevailing Party shall be awarded his, her or its attorneys'
fees and all other costs and expenses that have been incurred by such Prevailing
Party in conjunction with any arbitration, and the non-Prevailing Party shall
pay, directly or indirectly as a reimbursement or otherwise, such fees, costs
and expenses of the Prevailing Party.  Unless the non-Prevailing Party can prove
by clear and convincing evidence that any fees, costs and/or expenses were
incurred unreasonably and unnecessarily by a Prevailing Party, all actually paid
or invoiced attorneys' fees, expert and non-expert witness costs and expenses,
and all other actually paid or invoiced out-of-pocket costs and expenses (legal
and non-legal) of the Prevailing Party shall be awarded to such Prevailing Party
and shall be paid, borne by or otherwise become ultimately the exclusive
obligation of the non-Prevailing Party.

          b)  There shall be three (3) arbitrators for each arbitration.  Each
party to an arbitration or, if applicable, each independent group of parties
with substantially similar interests 

                                       53
<PAGE>
 
or acting in concert as contemplated by the provisions of this Agreement, shall
be entitled to select an arbitrator from a list of six (6) candidates, who are
nationals of any country or countries that such party may designate, which is to
be provided by the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce. The third arbitrator shall be a national of a country in which no
party resides and shall be selected by the two (2) arbitrators who have been
designated by such parties. If either or both of such parties do not designate
an arbitrator or arbitrators or if such two (2) arbitrators do not designate a
third arbitrator in a timely manner, the Court of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce shall appoint such arbitrator(s). The third
arbitrator shall act as the chairman of any such arbitration.

          c)  The arbitrators shall not be entitled to appoint their own experts
and shall rely solely upon the expert testimony which is provided by the parties
under circumstances where such experts are subject to cross-examination.

          d)  In any such arbitration involving the establishment of a "MONETARY
AMOUNT" (whether as damages, a value or otherwise), each independent party to
such arbitration, or, if applicable, each independent group of parties with
substantially similar interests or acting in concert as contemplated by the
provisions of this Agreement, who will be affected directly by the decision of
the arbitrators as to such Monetary Amount, shall submit to such arbitrators a
specific and unqualified amount which is deemed by it or them, as appropriate,
to represent such Monetary Amount, and the arbitrators must resolve any and all
disputes regarding such Monetary Amount by selecting, without any deviation or
compromise, one of the amounts so submitted to them as the Monetary Amount.

          e)  The parties in any such arbitration shall be entitled to undertake
expanded discovery, to the maximum extent permissible and possible and in a
manner that is similar to the discovery that is permissible under the provisions
of Title 9 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California,
United States of America, including Section 1283.05 thereof, and that type of
expanded discovery shall be applicable to all matters which are to be or are
arbitrated pursuant to this Agreement.  The arbitrators shall be entitled to
grant any and all extraordinary remedies and equitable relief, such as specific
performance and injunctive relief.  The arbitrators shall determine whether a
dispute is subject to arbitration hereunder and shall resolve any and all
matters relating to discovery.

          f)  No arbitration, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement
shall include, by consolidation or joinder or in any other manner, any
additional person who is not a party to this Agreement except for the Escrow
Agent, who is identified in Exhibit A hereto, and except by a written consent,
                            ---------                                         
containing a specific reference to this Agreement and the signatures of all
affected parties to this Agreement and all parties to the proposed arbitration
proceeding.  Any such written consent to arbitration involving an additional
party or parties shall not constitute consent to the arbitration of any other
dispute not described therein.

          g)  This agreement to arbitrate and any agreement to arbitrate with an
additional party or parties, which is duly consented to by all parties
concerned, shall be specifically enforceable under the prevailing arbitration
law.

                                       54
<PAGE>
 
          h)  In no event shall the demand for arbitration be made after the
date when the institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim,
dispute or other matter in question under the governing law and/or the
provisions of this Agreement, would be barred by the applicable statute of
limitations or the relevant provisions of this Agreement.

10.11  Rules of Construction.  The parties hereto agree that they have been
       ---------------------                                               
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement will be construed
against the party drafting such agreement.

10.12  Accounting Terms.  Unless this Agreement provides to the contrary, all
       ----------------                                                      
accounting terms, which are not otherwise defined herein, shall have the same
meanings assigned to them by, and the amounts attributed to those terms shall be
computed in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles as may be
established and published, from time to time, by the relevant governmental
entity and/or professional association in the country in which the pertinent
financial statements are prepared or in which the other event or occurrence
takes place.

10.13  Disclosure Schedules' and Autodesk's Disclosure Schedules' Updates and
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
the Effect Thereof/Exceptions.  The provisions of this Section 10.13 shall take
- -----------------------------                                                  
precedence over and govern any conflicting provision(s) of Section 8.4.  The
disclosing parties hereto shall promptly disclose to the other parties hereto if
any material information contained in their representations and warranties is
incomplete or is no longer correct as of all times after the date hereof until
the Closing Date; provided however that any such disclosure or correction shall
not affect the rights of the parties hereto as provided hereinafter in this
Section 10.13.  Any update of the Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, by the
disclosing parties hereto after the date hereof, which constitutes a change in
the representations and warranties of such disclosing party(ies), may be (but
need not be) waived for purposes of Section 6.2(a) and/or Section 6.3(a), as
appropriate, and if so waived, shall also constitute a waiver for all purposes
of such section or sections.  The consummation of the Closing shall be deemed to
be, and shall itself constitute, an actual and a deemed waiver of and by all
parties hereto for all purposes of Section 6.2(a) and/or Section 6.3(a), as
appropriate, of the effect of all updates that are made to the Disclosure
Schedules after the date hereof but prior to or on the Closing Date and also
shall constitute an actual and a deemed waiver of and by all parties hereto of
all of its rights under, and for all purposes of, Section 2 and/or Section 3, as
appropriate, in relation to any matters that are so disclosed by the updated
and/or modified Disclosure Schedules on or prior to the Closing Date.  Any such
update of the Disclosure Schedules by the disclosing parties hereto shall not
allow this Agreement to be terminated unless the provisions of Section 8.1
provide to the contrary.

     Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 10.13 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, Autodesk does not waive any claim, cause of action or legal right
arising out of or relating to those items identified below, despite the fact
that such item may be disclosed or partially disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedules.  All claims of the type identified in this Section 10.13 shall be
governed by terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement:

     a)  all claims of damages directly arising out of or relating to the
license, proposed license, or the failure of Genius to procure an appropriate
license with DIN Software GmbH to

                                       55
<PAGE>
 
the extent that such action or inaction precludes Autodesk from continuing to
operate such Business in a manner that is substantially consistent with past
operations of the Business by Genius or requires Autodesk to pay additional
compensation in order for Autodesk to do so;

     b)  all claims arising out of or relating to the European patent claim #
EPO-910-594-B1 of Patrick Megard and Serge Farve;

     c)  all claims arising out of the relationship between Genius and Thomas
Publishing Company;

     d)  all claims directly arising out of or relating to the Confidentiality
and Non-Competition Agreement dated January 21, 1998, between Genius and
Mechanical Dynamics, Inc., to the extent that Autodesk is precluded from
continuing to operate such Business in a manner that is substantially consistent
with past operations of the Business by Genius or to the extent Autodesk is
required to pay compensation in order to so conduct the Business; and

     e)  all claims which relate to or arising out of matters which were
disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules, which disclosures contained material
inaccuracies or omissions of material facts as of the Closing Date.  By way of
example, if Genius has disclosed a distributorship agreement, but has failed to
disclose that such distributorship agreement is exclusive as of the Closing
Date, there would be no waiver of any claim arising out of such distributorship
agreement.

10.14  Successors and Assigns.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
       ----------------------                                                   
in the related agreements specifically to the contrary, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs, legatees, devisees, and legal
or personal representatives.  This Agreement may not be assigned without the
consent of the other party hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
and which shall be granted or refused promptly.

10.15  Delays, Omissions, Waivers.  Other than to the extent that it is provided
       --------------------------                                               
to the contrary by the other provisions of this Agreement, no delay or omission
to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party hereto upon any
breach or default of any other party hereto shall impair any right, power or
remedy of a non-defaulting party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any
such breach or default, or acquiescence therein or thereto, or of or in any
similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any
single breach or default by any party hereto be deemed to be a waiver of any
other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring.  Other than to the
extent that it is provided to the contrary by the other provisions of this
Agreement, no waiver of any breach or of any condition, covenant or agreement
herein shall constitute a continuing waiver or a waiver of any subsequent breach
of the same or any other condition, covenant or agreement.  Other than to the
extent that it is provided to the contrary by the other provisions of this
Agreement, any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on
the part of any party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any
waiver on the part of any party of any terms, provisions or conditions of this
Agreement, must be in writing and signed by the waiving party and shall be
effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.

10.16  Monetary Conversion.  All references in Sections 2 and 4 hereof to
       -------------------                                               
amounts in U.S. Dollars shall be converted into their DM equivalents at the Spot
Exchange Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the effective date
                              -----------------------                      
hereof.

10.17  Apportionment of the Genius Assets between the Autodesk Parties.
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk Development B.V. and Autodesk GmbH agree that the
Genius Assets shall be divided between them in the manner set forth on Exhibit
Q, effective concurrently with Closing.  This Section 10.17 shall not affect the
responsibilities, liabilities and obligations of Autodesk as set forth in this
Agreement and in the related agreements.

                                       57
