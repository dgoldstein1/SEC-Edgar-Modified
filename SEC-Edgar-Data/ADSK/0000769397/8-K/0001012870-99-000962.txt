Item 2.  Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

     On March 16, 1999 (the "Closing Date"), pursuant to the terms of that
certain Second Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Acquisition and
Amalgamation dated as of November 18, 1998, as amended on December 18, 1998
and on January 18, 1999 (the "Acquisition Agreement"), by and among Autodesk,
Inc. ("Autodesk") certain indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Autodesk and
Discreet Logic Inc., a Quebec company ("Discreet"), Autodesk's indirect wholly
owned subsidiary, Autodesk Development B.V., acquired all voting shares of the
successor company to Discreet resulting from the Amalgamation (as defined
below) ("New Discreet") by way of an amalgamation under the Companies Act of
Quebec by and among Discreet and certain indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of
Autodesk (the "Amalgamation") and certain related transactions described below
(together with the Amalgamation, the "Acquisition"). As a result of the
Acquisition, New Discreet became an indirect subsidiary of Autodesk.

     Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, an aggregate of approximately 10
million shares of Autodesk common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Autodesk Common Stock"), and New Discreet shares exchangeable for Autodesk
Common Stock ("New Discreet Exchangeable Shares"), were issued in exchange for
all common shares of Discreet, no par value per share (the "Discreet Common
Shares"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Amalgamation. Each
Discreet Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Amalgamation was
converted, through a series of steps, at the election of its holder, into
either (i) 0.33 shares of Autodesk Common Stock, or (ii) 0.33 New Discreet
Exchangeable Shares. Each New Discreet Exchangeable Share may be exchanged at
the election of the holder for one share of Autodesk Common Stock. In
addition, Autodesk assumed all Discreet stock options outstanding immediately
prior to the Amalgamation granted under Discreet's Amended and Restated 1994
Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan, Non-Employee Director Stock Option
Plan, and 1997 Special Limited Non-Employee Director Stock Plan as well as all
outstanding purchase rights under the Discreet Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
and these options and rights were converted into options and rights to acquire
Autodesk Common Stock with appropriate adjustments to the number of shares and
exercise price thereof based on the 0.33 exchange ratio.

     The Acquisition is valued at approximately $410 million based on the
closing price of the Autodesk Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the
Closing Date and will be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.

     The consideration paid by Autodesk for the Discreet Common Shares and
Discreet options and rights outstanding immediately prior to the Amalgamation
pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement was determined pursuant to arms' length
negotiations and took into account various factors concerning the valuation of
the business of Discreet, including public market valuations of comparable
companies, multiples paid in recent acquisitions of comparable companies,
premiums paid in recent acquisitions of comparable companies, a pro forma
earnings analysis of Autodesk upon its acquisition of Discreet and discounted
cash flows for Discreet on a stand-alone basis. Autodesk received an opinion
from its financial advisor, Piper Jaffray Inc., dated as of January 18, 1999,
to the effect that, as of such date, the 0.33 exchange ratio was fair from a
financial point of view to Autodesk.

                                      -2-

     Autodesk plans to combine the businesses of Discreet and its Kinetix
division.  The new organization, the Discreet business unit of Autodesk,
will be headquartered in Montreal, Quebec.  Autodesk's Discreet business
unit will focus on developing and marketing tools for the creation of digital
content in the entertainment and creative design industries.  The combined
organization will continue to develop and deliver the existing Discreet and
Kinetix product lines to professionals in such industries as entertainment,
design and visualization.

Acquisition and Arrangement dated as of August 20, 1998 (the "Original
Agreement"), which was subsequently amended and restated in its entirety by
the parties in the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Acquisition and
Amalgamation dated as of September 23, 1998 (the "Exisiting Agreement");
 
  Whereas, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Dutchco, Amalgamation Sub,
Giants Quebec, ACI and the Company now desire to amend and restate the
Existing Agreement and have each approved the execution and delivery of this
Agreement in order to provide for a business combination involving the
amalgamation (the "Amalgamation") of Amalgamation Sub, Giants Quebec (to which
ACI will assign, prior to the Amalgamation, substantially all its assets) and
the Company whereupon each outstanding common share in the Company's share
capital (the "Company Common Shares") shall be converted into one Class B
Share of the continuing corporation resulting from the Amalgamation (the
"Continuing Corporation");
 
  Whereas, Articles of Amalgamation (the "Articles") will be filed pursuant to
Section 123.118 of the Companies Act (Quebec) (the "Quebec Act"), pursuant to
the terms hereof and the Amended and Restated Amalgamation Agreement (the
"Amalgamation Agreement") in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A;
 
  Whereas, immediately following the Amalgamation, the Class B Shares of the
Continuing Corporation automatically will be, based on the prior election of
the holder, either (i) redeemed by the Continuing Corporation for 0.48 (the
"Exchange Ratio") exchangeable shares in the share capital of the Continuing
Corporation (the "Exchangeable Shares"), subject to proration in certain
instances, or (ii) converted into units comprised of one Class E Share and one
Class F Share of the Continuing Corporation ("Units"), which units will be
acquired by Dutchco in exchange for 0.48 shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Shares"), in either case without
further action on the part of the holder;
 
  Whereas, the Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable by the holders for Parent
Common Shares on a one-for-one basis at any time on or before a date eleven
(11) years after the Effective Time (as defined herein), and
 
  Whereas, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the Transactions (as
defined in Section 1.1 hereof) shall be accounted for as a taxable pooling of
interests under United States generally accepted accounting principles ("US
GAAP");
 
  Now, Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Dutchco, ACI, Giants Quebec, Amalgamation Sub (collectively, the
"Parent Group") and the Company hereby agree as follows:
 
                                       1

                                   ARTICLE I
 
                               The Transactions
 
  1.1 The Transactions.
 
(a) Effective Time. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of the
Ancillary Documents (as defined in Section 5.17), this Agreement, the Articles
and the Quebec Act, (i) at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2
hereof), Amalgamation Sub and Giants Quebec shall be amalgamated with the
Company (provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to
amalgamate with Amalgamation Sub unless Giants Quebec simultaneously
amalgamates with Amalgamation Sub, and Giants Quebec shall not be required to
amalgamate with Amalgamation Sub unless the Company simultaneously amalgamates
with Amalgamation Sub) and (ii) immediately following the Effective Time, the
Class B Shares of the Continuing Corporation automatically shall, based on the
prior election of the holder, either (x) be redeemed by the Continuing
Corporation for Exchangeable Shares of the Continuing Corporation or (y) be
converted into Units which Units shall be acquired by Dutchco in exchange for
shares of Parent Common Stock, in either case without further action on the
part of the holder (such redemptions, conversions and share acquisitions set
forth in clause (ii), together with the Amalgamation, are collectively
referred to herein as the "Transactions"). Prior to the Effective Time, ACI
will assign and transfer all of its assets and liabilities to Giants Quebec.
 
(b) Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section
7.1 hereof, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI hereof, the consummation of the Transactions will take
place as promptly as practicable after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, unless another
date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. At the
closing, the parties hereto shall deliver the documents contemplated hereby
together with such other customary documents as may be reasonably requested by
the parties.
 
  1.2 Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the parties hereto shall
cause the Amalgamation to be consummated by filing the Articles together with
the documents contemplated by Section 123.14 of the Quebec Act, with the
Inspector General of Financial Institutions of the Province of Quebec (the
"Inspector General"), in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of, the Quebec Act. The Amalgamation will become
effective at such time and on such date shown on the Certificate of
Amalgamation issued by the Inspector General (the "Effective Time").
 
  1.3 Share Conversions, Etc. Immediately following the Class B Conversion
Time (as defined in Appendix A to the Amalgamation Agreement), Dutchco and
Parent shall cause the Continuing Corporation to provide notice of its
intention to exercise its right to redeem the Class E Shares and Class F
Shares of the Continuing Corporation (as specified in Appendix A to the
Amalgamation Agreement). At or prior to the Class E Redemption Time and the
Class F Redemption Time, Dutchco shall, and Parent shall cause Dutchco to,
exercise the Class E Redemption Call Right and the Class F Redemption Call
Right (as each is defined in Appendix A to the Amalgamation Agreement).
 
  1.4 Accounting Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Transactions shall qualify for accounting treatment as a pooling of interests
under US GAAP.
 
  1.5 Material Adverse Effect. When used in connection with the Company, or
Parent, as the case may be, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means any
change or effect that, individually or when taken together with all other such
changes or effects that have occurred prior to the date of determination of
the occurrence of the Material Adverse Effect, is or is reasonably likely to
be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets),
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries or Parent and its subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case
taken as a whole; provided, however, that none of the following
 
                                       2
<PAGE>
 

shall be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to either
party: (a) any change in the market price or trading volume of the Company
Common Shares or Parent Common Shares, as appropriate; (b) any adverse effect
on the bookings, revenues or earnings of such party, or any delay in or
reduction or cancellation of such party's product orders, following the
execution of the Original Agreement, the Existing Agreement or this Agreement
which is reasonably attributable to the announcement of the execution of the
Original Agreement, the Existing Agreement or this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; (c) any change arising out of conditions
affecting the economy or industry of such party in general; (d) the failure,
in and of itself, to meet analysts' expectations (it being understood that the
underlying causes of such failure shall not be excluded from the definition of
Material Adverse Effect except as otherwise provided in this definition); or
(e) employee attrition which is (i) reasonably attributable to the
announcement of the execution of the Original Agreement, the Existing
Agreement or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii)
directly attributable to any action directly required of the Company by Parent
under Section 4.1, or any omission of the Company directly resulting from
Parent's failure to consent to actions requested to be taken by the Company
under Section 4.1.
 
  1.6 Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent
Common Shares or Company Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization or
other like change with respect to Parent Common Shares or Company Common
Shares occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.
 
  1.7 Cancellation. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company
Common Share owned by Parent, Dutchco, Amalgamation Sub or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent shall be purchased
for cancellation by the Company for nominal consideration.
 
  1.8 Share Certificates of Amalgamation Sub and Giants Quebec. Each share
certificate of Amalgamation Sub evidencing ownership of any common shares of
Amalgamation Sub shall continue to evidence ownership of Class A Shares in the
share capital of the Continuing Corporation, and each share certificate of
Giants Quebec evidencing ownership of any common shares of Giants Quebec shall
continue to evidence ownership of Class C Shares in the share capital of the
Continuing Corporation. Any reference herein to classes of shares in the share
capital of the Continuing Corporation shall mean the classes of shares set out
in Appendix A to the Amalgamation Agreement.
 
  1.9 Execution of Amalgamation Agreement. Concurrently herewith, Amalgamation
Sub, Autodesk Quebec and the Company shall execute and deliver the
Amalgamation Agreement.
 
  1.10 Tax Treatment. It is intended that the Transactions shall generally
constitute (i) a taxable exchange for United States federal income tax
purposes (not qualifying under Sections 368 or 351 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) to holders of Company
Common Shares who are otherwise subject to taxation in the United States on
the sale or exchange of Company Common Shares, and (ii) a non-taxable exchange
for Canadian federal income tax purposes for owners of Company Common Shares
who are residents of Canada for Canadian federal income tax purposes who elect
to receive Exchangeable Shares (but only to the extent they actually receive
Exchangeable Shares and only to the extent that they file appropriate
elections with the relevant tax authorities), which election the parties
hereto intend shall be permitted only to the extent that the aggregate
percentage of Company Common Shares exchanged for Exchangeable Shares pursuant
to all such elections shall not exceed 19.99 percent of the Company Common
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
  1.11 Existing Agreement and Original Agreement Terminated. This Agreement
amends and restates in its entirety the Existing Agreement and the Original
Agreement. Accordingly, upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties,
the Existing Agreement and the Original Agreement shall be terminated in all
respects and be of no further force or effect.

                                  ARTICLE II
 
                 Representations And Warranties Of The Company
 
  The term "knowledge" as used in connection with the Company shall mean the
Company's actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of officers, directors and
other employees of the Company charged with senior administrative or
operational responsibility of such matters. The Company hereby represents and
warrants to each member of the Parent Group as of the date of the Original
Agreement (except for the representations and warranties contained in Sections
2.4, 2.5(b), 2.5(c), 2.7(a), 2.7(b) and 2.23, which are made as of the date of
this Agreement), subject to the written disclosure schedule supplied by the
Company to Parent dated as of the date of the Original Agreement and certified
by a duly authorized officer of the Company (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), that:
 
  2.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company and, except as
set forth on Schedule 2.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of its
subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has the requisite corporate power and authority and is in
possession of all material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
(collectively, "Approvals") necessary to own, lease and operate the properties
it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing or to have such power, authority and Approvals would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of all of the Company's subsidiaries,
together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each
subsidiary and the percentage of each subsidiary's outstanding capital stock
owned by the Company or another subsidiary, is set forth in Schedule 2.1 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own
any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity.
 
  2.2 Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Company has heretofore
furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of its Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws, as amended through August 20, 1998, and has made
available to Parent the equivalent organizational documents of each of its
subsidiaries. Such Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and equivalent
organizational documents of each of its subsidiaries are in full force and
effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of
any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or
equivalent organizational documents.
 
  2.3 Capitalization. The authorized share capital of the Company consists of
an unlimited number of Company Common Shares and an unlimited number of
preferred shares, no par value (the "Company Preferred Shares"). As of August
10, 1998, (i) 29,653,313 Company Common Shares were issued and outstanding,
all of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) no Company
Common Shares were held by subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) 5,012,924
Company Common Shares were reserved for future issuance pursuant to option
grants under the Company's Amended and Restated 1994 Restricted Stock and
Stock Option Plan, of which options to purchase 3,505,716 Company Common
Shares are outstanding, (iv) 111,779 Company Common Shares were reserved for
future issuance under the Company's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (v)
200,000 Company Common Shares were reserved for future issuance pursuant to
option grants under the Company's 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option
Plan, of which options to purchase 140,000 Company Common Shares are
outstanding, (vi) 20,000 Company Common Shares were reserved for future
issuance pursuant to option grants under the Company's 1997 Special Limited
Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, of
 
                                       4
<PAGE>
 

which options to purchase 20,000 Company Common Shares are outstanding, and
(vii) no Company Preferred Shares were issued or outstanding. Except as set
forth in Schedule 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no material change
in such capitalization has occurred between August 10, 1998 and August 20,
1998, except for the issuance of shares under the exercise of options,
warrants or other rights outstanding prior to August 10, 1998. Except as set
forth in this Section 2.3 or Section 2.10 hereof or in Schedule 2.3 or
Schedule 2.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
issue or sell any shares of share capital of, or other equity interests in,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All Company Common Shares subject to
issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in
Schedule 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (A) to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the share capital of the
Company or the capital stock of any subsidiary or (B) except for the provision
of operational expenses to subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, to provide funds or to make any investment (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any such subsidiary
or any other entity other than guarantees of bank and capital or other lease
obligations of subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company's
subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and all such shares are owned by the Company or another
subsidiary free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges,
agreements, limitations in the Company's voting rights, charges or other
encumbrances of any nature whatsoever which would have a Material Adverse
Effect.
 
  2.4 Authority. The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Amalgamation Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions, other than the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and confirmation of by-law No. 1998-1 approving the Amalgamation by
the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the
outstanding Company Common Shares who are permitted to, and who, vote at the
Company Shareholders' Meeting (as defined in Section 2.12 hereof) in
accordance with the Quebec Act. The Board of Directors of the Company has
determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company's
shareholders for the Company to enter into a business combination with Parent
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and to
recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve same. This Agreement
and the Amalgamation Agreement have each been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of each such agreement by each member of the Parent Group, as
applicable, each such agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company.

Effect.

subsidiaries, but only to the extent material to the operation of the business

SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with the requirements of the

of such amending or superseding filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the

of the SEC) and each fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the

(c) The unaudited financial statements of the Company for its fiscal year

Company, (ii) any damage to, destruction or loss of any assets of the Company

limitation, writing down the value of capitalized software or inventory or
writing off notes or accounts receivable other than in the ordinary course of
business, (iii) except as disclosed in Schedule 2.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, any other action or event that would have required the consent of
Parent pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof had such action or event occurred after
the date of this Agreement and that would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.
 
  2.9 Absence of Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Company SEC Reports, there are no claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any
properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Company
Intellectual Property Rights (as defined in Section 2.18), before any court,
tribunal, arbitrator or administrative, governmental or regulatory authority
or body, domestic or foreign, that is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

constitute a material default and in respect of which the Company or such
subsidiary has not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default from
occurring) except where the lack of such good standing, validity and
effectiveness or the existence of such default or event of default would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. All the facilities of the Company and its
subsidiaries used in the operation of their businesses, except such as may be
under construction, are in good operating condition and repair, except where
the failure of such plants, structures and equipment to be in such good
operating condition and repair would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean taxes, fees,

Schedule, the Company and its subsidiaries have filed or caused to be filed
all Tax Returns required to be filed by them, except to the extent the failure
to file such Tax Returns would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and the
Company and its subsidiaries have paid and discharged or caused to be paid and
discharged all Taxes due in connection with or with respect to the filing of
all Tax Returns and have paid all other Taxes as are due, and there are no
other Taxes that would be due if asserted by a taxing authority, except such
Taxes as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings (to the

                                      10

Company is maintaining reserves to the extent currently required in all
material respects adequate for their payment except to the extent the failure
to maintain such reserves or pay such Taxes would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.15(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of Revenue Canada, Revenue Quebec, the IRS or any other taxing
authority or agency is now asserting or, to the Company's knowledge,
threatening to assert against the Company or any of its subsidiaries any
deficiency or claim for additional Taxes other than additional Taxes with
respect to which the Company is maintaining reserves in all material respects
adequate for their payment, and, to the Company's knowledge, there are no
requests for information currently outstanding that could affect the Taxes of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Schedule
2.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is currently being audited or examined by any taxing authority,

undergo any audit or examination or that such an audit or examination is
threatened. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.15(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has, except as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect, granted any waiver of any statute of
limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment
of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the Company
Financial Statements are in all material respects adequate to cover all Taxes
accruable through the date thereof (including interest and penalties, if any,
thereon and Taxes being contested) in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. No liability for Taxes has been incurred (or prior to
the Effective Time will be incurred) since such date other than in the
ordinary course of business except (i) as would not have a Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) attributable to the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as
disclosed in Schedule 2.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries is required to include in income (i) items
in respect of any change in accounting principles or (ii) any installment sale
gain, where the inclusion in income would result in a tax liability materially
in excess of the reserves therefor.
 
(c) The Company on behalf of itself and all its subsidiaries hereby represents
that, other than as disclosed on Schedule 2.15(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and other than with respect to items the inaccuracy of which would
not have a Material Adverse Effect: (i) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that may
result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, determined
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code and (ii) neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has participated in or cooperated with a boycott
under Section 999 of the Code.

subsidiaries with respect to any matter relating to Taxes which is currently
in force.

sharing of Taxes.

Schedule, the Company and each of its subsidiaries have reported and withheld
from each payment made to any of their respective past or present employees,
officers, directors or non-residents of Canada the amount of all Taxes and
other material deductions required to be withheld therefrom and have paid the
same to the proper tax or other receiving officers within the time required
under any applicable legislation except where failure to do so would not have
a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(g) Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.15(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has remitted to the appropriate tax authority when
required by law to do so all amounts collected by it on account of all Taxes
under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act and retail sales tax except where failure
to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

Company has not deducted any material amounts in computing its income in a
taxation year which may be included in a subsequent taxation year under
Section 78 of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

Schedule, the Company has not requested or received a ruling from any taxing
authority or signed a closing or other agreement with any taxable authority
which could have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(j) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, to the
Company's knowledge, no circumstances exist which would make the Company or
any subsidiary subject to the application of any of sections 79 to 80.04 of
the Income Tax Act (Canada). Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
have acquired property or services from, or disposed of property or provided
services to, a person with whom it does not deal at arm's length (within the
meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) for an amount that is other than the
fair market value of such property or services, or has been deemed to have
done so for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, to the knowledge
of the Company, the Company and each of its subsidiaries: (i) have obtained

protection of the environment, including laws relating to emissions,

issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder; and (iii) are not aware
of nor have received notice of any event, condition, circumstance, activity,
practice, incident, action or plan which is reasonably likely to interfere
with or prevent continued compliance with or which would give rise to any
common law or statutory liability, or otherwise form the basis of any claim,
action, suit or proceeding, based on or resulting from the Company's or any of
its subsidiary's (or any of their respective agent's) manufacture, processing,
distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling, or the
emission, discharge or release into the environment, of any pollutant,
contaminant or hazardous or toxic material or waste.

Whelan & Company, LLC) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

to the knowledge of the Company, all patents, that are necessary to, required

Company Disclosure Schedule lists all current patents, registered and material
unregistered trademarks and service marks, registered copyrights, material
trade names and any applications therefor owned by the Company, and specifies
the jurisdictions in which each such Company Intellectual Property Right has
been issued or registered or in which an application for such issuance and

Company's products executed in the ordinary course of business that are not

Intellectual Property Right.
 
(b) The Company is not, nor will it be as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the performance of its obligations hereunder, in
violation in any material respect of any license, sublicense or agreement
described in Schedule 2.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor the performance
by the Company of its obligations hereunder will cause the forfeiture or
termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any
Company Intellectual Property Right or Third Party Intellectual Property Right
set forth in Schedule 2.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, nor impair the
ability of the Company, its subsidiaries, the Continuing Corporation or Parent
to use, sell or license any Company Intellectual Property Right or Third Party
Intellectual Property Right set forth in Schedule 2.18 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no claims with respect to the Company Intellectual
Property Rights (or Third Party Intellectual Property Rights to the extent
arising out of any use, reproduction or distribution of such Third Party
Intellectual Property Rights by or through the Company) are currently pending,
or, to the knowledge of the Company, are threatened by any person, nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, are there any valid grounds for any such claims (i)
to the effect that the manufacture, sale, licensing or use of any product as
now used, sold or licensed or proposed for use, sale or license by the Company
infringes on any copyright, patent, trademark, service mark or trade secret;
(ii) against the use by the Company of any trademarks, trade names, trade
secrets, copyrights used in the Company's business as currently conducted by
the Company; (iii) challenging the ownership, validity or effectiveness of any
of the Company Intellectual Property Rights or (iv) challenging the Company's
license or legally enforceable right to use of the Third Party Intellectual
Property Rights. All registered trademarks, maskworks, and copyrights held by
the Company, are valid and subsisting. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.18 of

any of its subsidiaries (i) has been sued or charged in writing as a defendant
in any claim, suit, action or proceeding which involves a claim or
infringement of trade secrets, any patents, trademarks, service marks,
maskworks or copyrights and which has not been finally terminated prior to
August 20, 1998, or been informed or notified by any third party that the
Company may be engaged in such infringement, or (ii) has knowledge of any
infringement liability with respect to, or infringement by, the Company or any

Relationship or Related Transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K

August 20, 1998 under all such policies and bonds have been paid and the
Company and its subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of such policies and bonds (or other policies and
bonds providing substantially similar insurance coverage). The Company has no
knowledge of any threatened termination of, or material premium increase with
respect to, any of such policies.
 
  2.21 Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-

any of its affiliates has, based upon consultation with its independent
auditors, taken or agreed to take any action that (without giving effect to
any action taken or agreed to be taken by Parent or any of its affiliates)
would affect the ability of Parent to account for the business combination to
be effected by the Transactions as a pooling-of-interests.
 
  2.23 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received an oral opinion
from its financial advisor, Volpe Brown Whelan & Company, LLC (subsequently
confirmed in writing), to the effect that, as of November 18, 1998, the

power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents (as defined in Section 5.17) (to the extent they are parties
thereto) and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents by each member of the Parent Group
(to the extent they are parties thereto) and the consummation by each member

Ancillary Documents or to consummate the transactions so contemplated (other
than the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance (as defined in Section 3.9
hereof) by the requisite vote of the stockholders of Parent, to the extent
necessary). The Boards of Directors of Parent and Dutchco have determined that
it is advisable and in the best interest of Parent's stockholders and
Dutchco's stockholder for Parent and Dutchco to enter into a business
combination with the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement and to recommend that the
stockholders of Parent approve the Parent Stock Issuance. This Agreement and
the Amalgamation Agreement have each been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each member of the Parent Group (to the extent they are parties
thereto) and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, each such agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of each member of the Parent Group. Each of the Ancillary Documents not yet
executed and delivered as of the date hereof shall constitute a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each member of the Parent Group (to the extent they
are parties thereto) upon execution and delivery of each such document.
 
  3.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.
 
(a) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents by

not (or in the case of Ancillary Documents not yet executed and delivered,
will not), and the performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
by each member of the Parent Group will not, (i) conflict with or violate the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or similar charter documents, as the
case may be) of any member of the Parent Group, (ii) conflict with or violate
any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent or
any of its subsidiaries or by which its or their respective properties are
bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or impair Parent's or any of its subsidiaries' rights or alter
the rights or obligations of any third party under, or to the knowledge of
Parent, give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, any material contract or result in the creation of a lien or
encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which
Parent or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties
are bound or affected, except in the case of (ii) and (iii) any such case for
any such breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.
 
(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
by each member of the Parent Group (to the extent they are parties thereto)
does not (or in the case of Ancillary Documents not yet executed and
delivered, will not), and the performance of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby will not, require any material consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign, except (i) for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Blue Sky Laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act,
relevant Canadian securities statutes, filing with Industry Canada under the
Investment Canada Act (Canada), filing under the Competition Act (Canada) and
the filing and recordation of appropriate merger or other documents as
required by the Quebec Act and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions, or otherwise prevent or materially delay any member of the
Parent Group from performing its respective obligations under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents, and would not otherwise have a Material Adverse
Effect.

mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a

variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, orders and approvals from
governmental or other regulatory authorities which are material to the
operation of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole
as operated on August 20, 1998 (collectively, the "Parent Permits"). Parent
and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits,
except where the failure to so comply would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.
 
  3.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.
 
(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed
with the SEC since February 1, 1995, and has heretofore delivered to the

with the SEC (collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"). The Parent SEC Reports
(i) were prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were
filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Parent's
subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports has been
prepared in accordance with US GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
each fairly presents the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
material in amount.
 
(c) Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company a complete and correct copy
of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with the SEC
but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other
instruments which previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
 
  3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.8 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and in the Parent SEC Reports, since
January 31, 1998, Parent has conducted its business in the ordinary course and
since such date and through August 20, 1998, there has not occurred any
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent. In addition, since such date
there has not been (i) any damage to, destruction or loss of any assets of
Parent (whether or not covered by insurance) that could have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, (ii) any revaluation by Parent of any
of its assets reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect
to Parent, including, without limitation, writing down the value of
capitalized software or inventory or writing off notes or accounts receivable
other than in the ordinary course of business or (iii) other events outside of
the ordinary course of business and inconsistent with past practices that
would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent.
 
  3.9 Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Parent has, as of November 18,
1998, determined to recommend that the stockholders of Parent approve the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Transactions (including
any subsequent issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the exchange
of Exchangeable Shares) (the "Parent Stock Issuance").
 
  3.10 Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
 
(a) Subject to the accuracy of the representations of the Company in Section
2.12 hereof, (i) the Form S-4 pursuant to which the Parent Common Shares,
Exchangeable Shares, Units and Class B Shares to be issued in connection with
the Transactions will be registered with the SEC, (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement, and (iii) the Other Filings will (A) at the respective times such
documents are filed with the SEC or other regulatory agency, (B) in the case
of the Joint Proxy Statement, at the date it or any amendments or supplements
thereto are mailed to stockholders, at the time of the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting and at the Effective Time and (C) in the case of the Form S-4, if any,

on the date of any post-effective amendment thereto, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law and the Exchange Act as it relates to the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting, and the Form S-4, as it relates the issuance of
the Parent Common Shares, Exchangeable Shares, Units and Class B Shares to be
issued in connection with the Transactions, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act. If at any time
prior to the Effective Date any event relating to Parent, Dutchco,
Amalgamation Sub or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by Parent, Dutchco or Amalgamation Sub which should be
set forth in an amendment to the Form S-4 or a supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement, Parent, Dutchco or Amalgamation Sub will promptly inform the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company which is
contained in, or furnished in connection with the preparation of, any of the
foregoing.
 
(b) As of August 20, 1998 and at the Effective Time, except for obligations or
liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
 
                                      17
<PAGE>
 

Amalgamation Agreement and except for this Agreement and the Amalgamation
Agreement and any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by this
Agreement, Amalgamation Sub has not and will not have incurred, directly or
indirectly, through any subsidiary or affiliate, any obligations or
liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any person.
 
  3.11 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than Piper
Jaffray, Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co.) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's
or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent, Dutchco or Amalgamation Sub. Parent has heretofore
furnished to Company a complete and correct copy of all agreements between any
member of the Parent Group and Piper Jaffray, Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co.
pursuant to which such firms would be entitled to any payment relating to the
transactions contemplated hereunder.
 
  3.12 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Parent has received an oral opinion from
its financial advisor, Piper Jaffray, Inc. (subsequently confirmed in
writing), to the effect that, as of November 18, 1998, the Exchange Ratio is
fair from a financial point of view to Parent.
 
  3.13 Pooling Matters. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has, to its
knowledge and based upon consultation with its independent auditors, taken or
agreed to take any action that (without giving effect to any action taken or
agreed to be taken by the Company or any of its affiliates) would affect the
ability of Parent to account for the business combination to be effected by
the Transactions as a pooling-of-interests.
 
  3.14 Absence of Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.14 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule or the Parent SEC Reports, there are no claims,
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
the Parent, threatened against the Parent or any of its subsidiaries, or any
properties or rights of the Parent or any of its subsidiaries, before any
court, arbitrator or administrative, governmental or regulatory authority or
body, domestic or foreign, that could have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
  3.15 Restrictions on Business Activities. Except for this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents or as otherwise set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent SEC Reports, there is no material agreement, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon the Company or any of its
subsidiaries which has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or impairing any material business practice of Parent or any of
its subsidiaries, the acquisition of property by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or the conduct of business by Parent or any of its subsidiaries
as currently conducted by Parent.
 
  3.16 Taxes.
 
(a) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
Parent and its subsidiaries have filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them, except to the extent that the failure to file
such Tax Returns would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and Parent and its
subsidiaries have paid and discharged or caused or to be paid and discharged
all Taxes due in connection with or with respect to the filing of all Tax
Returns and have paid all other Taxes as are due, and there are no other Taxes
that would be due if asserted by a taxing authority, except such as are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings (to the extent that any
such proceedings are required) and with respect to which Parent is maintaining
reserves to the extent currently required in all material respects adequate
for their payment except to the extent the failure to do so would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.16 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, none of Revenue Canada, Revenue Quebec, the IRS or any
other taxation authority or agency is now asserting or, to the best of
Parent's knowledge, threatening to assert against Parent or any of its
subsidiaries any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes other than
additional Taxes with respect to which Parent is maintaining reserves in all
material respects adequate for their payment, and there are no requests for
information currently outstanding that could affect the Taxes of Parent or any
of its subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.16 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is currently
being audited or examined by any taxation authority, nor has Parent received
any written notice that
 
                                      18
<PAGE>
 

any Tax Return will undergo any audit or examination or that such an audit or
examination is threatened. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.16 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has, except as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect, granted any waiver of any statute of
limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment
of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto)
contained in the Parent SEC Reports are in all material respects adequate to
cover all Taxes accruable through the date thereof (including interest and
penalties, if any, thereon and Taxes being contested) in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. No liability for taxes has been
incurred (or prior to the Effective Time will be incurred) since such date
other than in the ordinary course of business except as (i) would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) is attributable to the transactions
contemplated herein.
 
(b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
Parent and each of its subsidiaries have reported and withheld from each
payment made to any of their respective past or present employees, officers,
directors or non-residents of the United States the amount of all Taxes and
other material deductions required to be withheld therefrom and have paid the
same to the proper tax or other receiving officers within the time required
under any applicable legislation except where failure to do so would not have
a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(c) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
Parent has not requested or received a ruling from any taxation authority or
signed a closing or other agreement with any taxation authority which could
have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
  3.17 Intellectual Property.
 
(a) Parent and its subsidiaries own, or are licensed or otherwise possess
legally enforceable rights to use, sell and license all trademarks,
tradenames, service marks, copyrights and any applications therefor necessary
to, used in or required for their respective businesses as currently conducted
(the "Parent Intellectual Property Rights"), the absence of which would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
 
(b) Parent is not, nor will it be as a result of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or the performance of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder, in violation in any material respect of
any license, sublicense or agreement of which Parent or any of Parent's
subsidiaries is a party. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents or the performance of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder will not cause the forfeiture or termination or give rise to a
right of forfeiture or termination of any material Parent Intellectual
Property Right, or impair the ability of Parent or its subsidiaries to use,
sell or license any Parent Intellectual Property Right or portion thereof.
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.17 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no
claims with respect to Parent Intellectual Property Rights are currently
pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, are threatened by any person, nor, to
the knowledge of the Parent, are there any valid grounds for any such claims
(i) to the effect that the manufacture, sale, licensing or use of any product
as now used, sold or licensed or proposed for use, sale or license by Parent
infringes on any copyright, patent, trademark, service mark or trade secret;
(ii) against the use by Parent of any trademarks, trade names, trade secrets,
copyrights used in Parent's business as currently conducted by Parent; (iii)
challenging the ownership, validity or effectiveness of any of Parent
Intellectual Property Rights or (iv) to the knowledge of Parent, against the
use by Parent of any patents. All registered trademarks, maskworks and
copyrights are valid and subsisting. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.17 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of Parent, all patents held
by Parent are valid and subsisting. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.17 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, to Parent's knowledge, there is no material
unauthorized use, infringement or misappropriation of any of Parent
Intellectual Property Right by any third party, including any employee or
former employee of Parent or any of its subsidiaries. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.17 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries (i) has been sued or charged in writing as a defendant in any
claim, suit, action or proceeding which involves a claim or infringement of
trade secrets, any patents, trademarks, service marks, maskworks or copyrights
and which has not been finally terminated prior to August 20, 1998, or been
informed or notified by any third party that Parent may be engaged in such
infringement, or (ii) has knowledge of any infringement liability with respect
to, or infringement by, Parent or any of its subsidiaries of any trade secret,
patent, trademark, service mark, maskwork or copyright of another.
 
                                      19
<PAGE>
 

(c) Each employee and consultant of Parent has executed a confidentiality and
invention agreement substantially in the respective forms previously delivered
to the Company.
 
(d) Parent has taken reasonable and practicable steps designed to safeguard
and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of, and its proprietary rights
in, all Parent Intellectual Property Rights (other than those which, by
operation of law, have been disclosed or made public).
 
  3.18 Insurance. To Parent's knowledge, except as is set forth in Schedule
3.18 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there is no material claim by Parent
or any of its subsidiaries pending under any of such policies or bonds as to
which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of
such policies or bonds. All premiums payable on or prior to the date hereof
under all such policies and bonds have been paid and Parent and its
subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the
terms of such policies and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing
substantially similar insurance coverage). Parent has no knowledge of any
threatened termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any
of such policies.
 
  3.19 Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares present and entitled to vote at a stockholder meeting duly convened for
the purpose of considering the Parent Stock Issuance is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Parent's capital stock necessary to approve
the Transactions in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Parent and the By-Laws of Parent.
 
                                  ARTICLE IV

conduct its business and cause the businesses of its subsidiaries to be
conducted only in, and the Company and its subsidiaries shall not take any
action except in, the ordinary course of business or in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and in a manner consistent with past practice;

failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 4.1 shall not
prevent the Company from taking action to cause the Exchangeable Shares, the
Class B Shares, Class E Shares and Class F Shares to be listed, posted or
quoted for trading on the Nasdaq National Market and/or a prescribed Canadian
stock exchange. By way of amplification and not limitation, except as

subsidiaries shall, during the period from the date of the Original Agreement

Effective Time, directly or indirectly do, or agree to do, any of the

agree to an extension of a statute of limitations except to the extent the
amount of any such settlement has been reserved for on the Company Balance
Sheet;
 
(k) pay, discharge or satisfy any material claims, liabilities or obligations
(absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise), other
than the payment, discharge or satisfaction of liabilities reflected or

(l) except as may be required by law and except as disclosed on Schedule
4.1(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, take any action to terminate or
amend any of its Employee Plans;
 
(m) modify, amend or terminate any Covered Agreement (as defined in Section
2.5(b)), other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice;
 
(n) take or allow to be taken or fail to take any act or omission which would
jeopardize the treatment of the Transactions as a pooling-of-interests for
accounting purposes under US GAAP; or
 
(o) take, or agree in writing or otherwise to take, any of the actions
described in Sections 4.1(a) through (n) above, or any action which would make
any of the representations or warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect or prevent the Company
from performing or cause the Company not to perform its covenants hereunder or
result in any of the conditions to the Transactions set forth herein not being
satisfied.
 
  4.2 No Solicitation.
 
(a) From and after the date of the Original Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
VII hereof, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any
officer, director, employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, take any action to initiate, solicit or encourage (including
by way of furnishing any person any non-public information, except as
permitted in Section 4.2(e)) or, subject to the terms of the immediately
following sentence, participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
persons who are considering or who have made any inquiries or proposals
regarding any merger, amalgamation, take-over bid, sale of substantial assets,
sale of shares of capital stock (including without limitation by way of a
tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any
subsidiaries of the Company (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being
referred to herein as an "Acquisition Proposal"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 4.2(a) or in any other provision of
this Agreement, the Company may, to the extent the Board of Directors of the
Company determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law require it to
do so, participate in discussions or negotiations with, and, subject to the
requirements of paragraph (d), below, furnish information to any person,
entity or group after such person, entity or group has delivered to the
Company, an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal which the Board of
Directors of the Company in its good faith reasonable judgment determines,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Superior Proposal"). In
addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in connection
with a possible Acquisition Proposal, the Company may refer any third party to
this Section 4.2 or make a copy of this Section 4.2 available to a third
party. In the event the Company receives a Superior Proposal, nothing
contained in this Agreement (but subject to the terms of this Section 4.2)
will prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from accepting, approving
or recommending such Superior Proposal to its shareholders, if the Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
such action is required by its fiduciary duties under applicable law; in such
case, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or refrain
from making its recommendation set forth in Section 5.1(a), and, to the extent
it does so, the Company may refrain from soliciting proxies and taking such
other action necessary to secure the vote of its shareholders as may be
required by Section 5.2; provided, however, that the Company shall not accept,
approve or recommend to its shareholders, or enter into any agreement
concerning, a Superior Proposal for a period of not less than three business
days after Parent's receipt of a copy of the Superior Proposal (or a
reasonably detailed written description of the significant terms and
conditions thereof, if such proposal is not in writing).
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 4.2(a) above, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that, in complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-
2, the Company will not make or authorize any recommendation of any
Acquisition Proposal unless such proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.
 
(c) The Company shall immediately (and no later than 24 hours) notify Parent
and Dutchco after receipt of any written Acquisition Proposal or any request
for non-public information relating to the Company or
 
                                      22
<PAGE>
 

any of its subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for
access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any subsidiary by
any person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of the Company or
such subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice to Parent and Dutchco shall be made orally and in
writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of
such proposal, inquiry or contact.
 
(d) If the Board of Directors of the Company receives a request for material
nonpublic information by a party who makes a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
and the Board of Directors of the Company determines that such proposal is a
Superior Proposal, then, and only in such case, the Company may, subject to
the execution of a confidentiality agreement substantially similar to that
then in effect between the Company and Parent, provide such party with access
to information regarding the Company, which access shall be no more extensive
than that provided to Parent.
 
(e) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any parties (other than Parent,
Dutchco and Amalgamation Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. The Company agrees not to release any third party from any
confidentiality or standstill agreement with respect to any of the foregoing
to which the Company is a party.
 
(f) The Company shall ensure that the officers, directors, employees and
agents of the Company and its subsidiaries and any investment bankers or other
agents, advisors or representatives retained by the Company are aware of the
restrictions described in this Section, and shall be responsible for any
breach of this Section 4.2 by such bankers, officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors or representatives.
 
  4.3 Covenants of Parent. During the period from the date of the Original
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent agrees as to itself and its material
subsidiaries (except to the extent that the Company shall otherwise consent in
writing, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), to carry on its
and such subsidiaries' business in the ordinary course, to pay its debts and
Taxes when due subject to good faith disputes over such debts or Taxes and to
pay or perform other obligations when due, except to the extent failure to do
any of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                             Additional Agreements
 
  5.1 Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement. As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement which shall
constitute the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, together with any other
documents required by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, in connection
with the Transactions. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall constitute
(i) the proxy statement of the Company with respect to the Company
Shareholders' Meeting, (ii) the proxy statement of Parent with respect to the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting and, (iii) the prospectus to be contained in the
Form S-4 with respect to the issuance by (A) Dutchco of the Parent Common
Shares and (B) the Continuing Corporation of the Exchangeable Shares, Units
and Class B Shares in connection with the Transactions. As promptly as
practicable after comments (if any) are received from the SEC thereon and
after the furnishing by Parent and the Company of all information required to
be contained therein, Parent and Company shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to each of the Company's Shareholders and
each of Parent's Stockholders. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall (i)
include the unanimous recommendation of the non-interested Board of Directors
of the Company in favor of the Transactions, except that the Board of
Directors of the Company may withdraw, modify or refrain from making such
recommendation to the extent that the Board determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that compliance with the Board's
fiduciary duties under applicable law would require it to do so, and (ii) the
unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent in favor of the
Parent Stock Issuance, except that the Board of Directors of Parent may
withdraw, modify or refrain from making such recommendation to the extent that
the Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that compliance with the Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
law would require it to do so. Parent shall file a
 
                                      23
<PAGE>
 
registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Form S-3") in order to register the
Parent Common Shares to be issued from time to time after the Effective Time
upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration for such period as
such Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding, and Parent and the Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-3 to become effective prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent
shall be under no obligation to file the Form S-3 if it shall have determined
on the advice of its counsel that the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares after the Effective Time will
be exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities
Act by virtue of Section 3(a)(9) thereof.
 
  5.2 Shareholders' Meetings. The Company shall take all commercially
reasonable action necessary in accordance with applicable law, its Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws to hold the Company Shareholders' Meeting as soon as
practicable (but in no event more than 40 days) after the date on which the
Form S-4 becomes effective. Parent will take all commercially reasonable
action necessary in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law and
its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws to convene the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting to be held as soon as practicable (but in no event more
than 40 days) after the date on which the Form S-4 becomes effective. Parent
will consult with Company and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
hold the Parent Shareholders' Meeting on the same day as the Company
Stockholders' Meeting. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and the approval of the Parent Stock
Issuance, as the case may be, and will take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of their respective stockholders
required by the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
and applicable law to obtain such approvals.
 
  5.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Upon reasonable notice and
subject to restrictions contained in confidentiality agreements to which such
party is subject, the Company, Parent and Dutchco shall each (and shall cause
each of their subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of the other, reasonable access during
normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such
period, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause each of their
subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request,
and each shall make available to the other the appropriate individuals
(including attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for discussion of
the other's business, properties and personnel as either party may reasonably
request. Each party shall keep such information confidential in accordance
with the terms of the existing confidentiality agreement dated July 10, 1998
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Parent and the Company.
 
  5.4 Consents; Approvals. The Company, Parent and Dutchco shall each use best
efforts to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
(including, without limitation, all United States, Canadian federal and
provincial and foreign governmental and regulatory rulings and approvals), and
the Company and Parent shall promptly make all filings (including, without
limitation, all filings with United States, Canadian federal and provincial
and foreign governmental or regulatory agencies) required in connection with
the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents by the Company and each member of the Parent Group (to the extent
they are parties thereto) and the consummation by them of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company and Parent (with respect to
themselves and their respective subsidiaries) shall furnish all information
required to be included in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and
regulations of any United States, Canadian federal or provincial or foreign
governmental body in connection with the Transactions.
 
  5.5 Stock Options; Employee Benefits; Retention of Employees.
 
(a) At the Effective Time, the Company's obligations with respect to each
outstanding option to purchase Company Common Shares (each a "Company Option")
under the Company's Amended and Restated 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock
Option Plan, 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and 1997 Special Limited Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and
outside of any such
 
                                      24
<PAGE>
 

formal plan (individually, a "Company Stock Option Plan," and, collectively,
the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether vested or unvested, will be assumed
by Parent and, on such assumption, the rights to acquire Company Common Shares
under the Company Stock Option Plans shall be exchanged for rights to acquire
Parent Common Shares under such plans. Each Company Option so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option
Plan and agreement pursuant to which such Company Option was issued as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such Company
Option will be deemed to constitute an option to purchase that number of
Parent Common Shares equal to the product of the number of Company Common
Shares that the holder of such option would have been entitled to receive had
such holder exercised such options immediately prior to the Effective Time
(not taking into account whether such option was in fact exercisable)
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
Parent Common Shares, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company
Common Shares at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.
 
(b) It is the intention of the parties that the Company Options assumed by
Parent qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as
defined in the Code ("ISOs"), to the extent the Company Options qualified as
ISOs prior to the Effective Time.
 
(c) The Company shall ensure that any required consents of holders of such
options or rights to such assumptions are obtained prior to the Effective
Time.
 
(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
each holder of an outstanding Company Option, an appropriate notice setting
forth such holder's rights pursuant thereto and such Company Option shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including further anti-
dilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by this Section
5.5 after giving effect to the Transactions). Parent shall comply with the
terms of all such Company Options. Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares
for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 5.5.
 
(e) As of the Effective Time, the employees of the Company (the "Company
Employees") shall be entitled (to the extent permitted by applicable law and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement) to participate in each of
Parent's employee benefit and incentive compensation and perquisite plans and
arrangements (the "Parent Employee Plans") in which similarly situated
employees of Parent participate, to the same extent as similarly situated
employees of Parent. For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in
the Parent Employee Plans, eligibility to participate in the Parent Employee
Plans, eligibility for benefit forms and subsidies and the vesting of benefits
under such plans (including, but not limited to, any severance, 401(k),
vacation and sick pay plan) and for purposes of accrual of benefits under any
severance, sick leave, vacation and other similar Parent Employee Benefit
Plans (except with respect to Parent's sabbatical program), Parent shall give
effect to years of service (and for purposes of qualified and nonqualified
pension plans, prior earnings) with the Company or its subsidiaries, as the
case may be, as if they were employees of the Parent. Such service shall also
be given effect for purposes of satisfying any waiting period, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition
limitation. The Company Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under
a corresponding Company Employee Plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Employee Plan. With regard to any employees who are redeployed as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby, such redeployment shall be
made in accordance with the Redeployment Schedule attached at Schedule 5.6(f)
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, subject to any general changes in the
policies of Parent.
 
(f) Parent shall assume and honor the obligations of the Company and its
subsidiaries under all employment, severance, consulting and other
compensation contracts, commitments or agreements disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each as amended to the date hereof or as contemplated
hereby. Parent hereby acknowledges that the Transactions will constitute a
"Change in Control" for purposes of all of the Company Employee Plans.
 
                                      25

(g) The Company will use its best efforts to assist Parent in identifying and
ensuring the retention by Parent and/or the Continuing Corporation of those
technical and non-technical employees who are necessary to carrying out the
operations of the Company as presently conducted and proposed to be conducted.
The parties acknowledge and agree, consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement, that the failure of Parent and/or the Continuing Corporation to
retain such employees despite the Company's best efforts shall not entitle
Parent to terminate this Agreement.
 
  5.6 Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
 
(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding purchase right (each an "Assumed
Purchase Right" and, collectively, the "Assumed Purchase Rights") under the
Company's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Company Stock Purchase Plan") shall be deemed to constitute a purchase right
to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Company Stock Purchase Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number
of Parent Common Shares determined as provided in the Company Stock Purchase
Plan, except that the per share purchase price of such Parent Common Shares
under each such Assumed Purchase Right will be the lower of (i) the quotient
determined by dividing (x) 85% of the closing price of a Discreet Common Share
as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the first day of the offering
period in effect as of the Effective Time (the "Current Offering Period") by
(y) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) 85% of the closing price of a share of
Autodesk Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the last
day of the Current Offering Period. As soon as practicable after consummation
of the Transactions, Autodesk shall deliver to the participants in the Company
Stock Purchase Plan appropriate notice setting forth such participants' rights
pursuant thereto and that the Assumed Purchase Rights shall continue in effect
on the terms and conditions provided in this Section 5.6.
 
(b) Parent shall file and cause to become effective not later than the
Effective Time a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect
to the assumption by Parent of the Company Options referred to in Section 5.5
and the Assumed Purchase Rights referred to in this Section 5.6 and with
respect to the issuance of Parent Common Shares upon exercise of those Company
Options and Assumed Purchase Rights and to keep such registration statement
effective throughout the term of such Company Options and Assumed Purchase
Rights.
 
(c) Employees of the Company as of the Effective Time shall be permitted to
participate in Parent's Employee Stock Purchase Plan commencing on the first
enrollment date following the Effective Time, subject to compliance with the
eligibility provisions of such plan (with employees receiving credit, for
purposes of such eligibility provisions, for service with the Company).
 
  5.7 Agreements of Affiliates. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a
letter (the "Affiliate Letter") identifying all persons who are, or may be
deemed to be, at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, "affiliates"
of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company
shall use its best efforts to cause each person who is identified as an
"affiliate" in the Affiliate Letter to deliver to Parent, and Parent shall use
its best efforts to receive from its own affiliates, as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than the date on which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is mailed to stockholders, a written agreement (an
"Affiliate Agreement") in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto (in the
case of affiliates of Parent) and Exhibit B-2 hereto (in the case of
affiliates of the Company).
 
  5.8 Voting Agreements. Concurrently with the date upon which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the holders of Company Common Shares and
Parent Common Shares, all executive officers and certain directors of both the
Company and Parent shall each execute and deliver a Voting Agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit C-1 hereto (in the case of officers and
directors of Parent) and Exhibit C-2 hereto (in the case of officers and
directors of the Company), and all such agreements shall be in full force and
effect.
 
  5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.
 
(a) From and after the Effective Time, (i) the Continuing Corporation and
Parent will fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
and its subsidiaries pursuant to the indemnification provisions in the
Company's Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws existing as in effect on the
date hereof with respect to the
 
                                      26
<PAGE>
 

Company's directors and officers (including without limitation advancement of
legal and other expenses to the extent provided for in such Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws), and (ii) in the event any of the Company's
directors or officers is or becomes involved in any capacity in any action,
proceeding or investigation in connection with any matter relating to this
Agreement or the Amalgamation Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Continuing Corporation to, pay as incurred such reasonable
legal and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and
preparation) incurred in connection therewith, subject to an undertaking to
repay such amounts as required by applicable law.
 
(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Continuing Corporation and Parent
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law or under the
Continuing Corporation's and Parent's, as the case may be, By-Laws, indemnify
and hold harmless, each present director, officer, employee, fiduciary and
agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement), and to pay as
incurred such legal and other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith, subject to an
undertaking to repay such amounts as required by applicable law. The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them
with respect to any single action unless there is, under applicable standards
of professional conduct, a conflict of interest between the positions of any
two or more Indemnified Parties. Any counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld).
 
(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives and may not be amended, altered or repealed without the prior
written consent of the affected Indemnified Party.
 
(d) For a period of five years after the Effective Time, Parent and Dutchco
will, or will cause the Continuing Corporation to, provide officers' and
directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the
Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on terms
substantially similar to those of such policy in effect on the date hereof.
 
  5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent and Dutchco, and Parent and Dutchco shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause, or does
cause, any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate or (ii) any failure of the Company, or any member of the Parent
Group as the case may be, materially to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided further that failure
to provide such notice shall not be treated as a breach for purposes of
Section 7.1(g) unless failure to give such notice results in material
prejudice to Parent.
 
  5.11 Further Action. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Amalgamation Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings,
and to otherwise satisfy or cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to
its obligations under this Agreement. Each member of the Parent Group and the
Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Transactions to fail to
qualify, will take any actions (that do not materially adversely affect such
party) to cause the Transactions to fail to qualify, and will not (both before
and after consummation of the Transactions) take any actions which cause such
Transactions to qualify,
 
                                      27
<PAGE>
 

as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Code or a
transaction described in Section 351 of the Code.
 
  5.12 Public Announcements. Parent (on behalf of each member of the Parent
Group) and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
Transactions or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statement as may upon the advice of counsel be required by law,
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or the Nasdaq National
Market or any other regulatory body to which such party is subject if it has
used all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party as to the timing
and content of such release or statement.
 
  5.13 Listing of Parent Common Shares. Parent shall cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Transactions
(including shares of Parent Common Stock delivered by Dutchco as a result of
rights attaching to the Exchangeable Shares) to be approved for listing on the
Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.
 
  5.14 Conveyance Taxes. Parent, Dutchco and the Company shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that
are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.
 
  5.15 Pooling Letters.
 
(a) The Company shall use its best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent

date within two business days prior to the Effective Time, setting forth that
the Company will qualify as a combining company in a pooling-of-interests
transaction under Opinion 16 of the Accounting Principles Board and applicable
SEC rules and regulations (the "Arthur Andersen Pooling Letter").
 
(b) Parent shall use its best efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company
a letter of Ernst & Young LLP, addressed to Parent, dated as of a date within
two business days prior to the Effective Time, setting forth the concurrence
of Ernst & Young LLP with the conclusion of Parent's management that the
Transactions will qualify as a pooling-of-interests transaction under Opinion
16 of the Accounting Principles Board and applicable SEC rules and regulations
if consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents (the "Ernst & Young Pooling Letter").
 
  5.16 Pooling Accounting Treatment. Each of Parent and the Company agrees not
to take any action that would adversely affect the ability of Parent to treat
the Transactions as a pooling of interests under US GAAP.
 
  5.17 Ancillary Documents/Reservation of Shares.
 
(a) Provided all other conditions of this Agreement have been satisfied or
waived, the Company, Giants Quebec and Amalgamation Sub shall, as promptly as
practicable thereafter, jointly file Articles to give effect to the
Amalgamation, such Articles to contain share conditions for the Continuing
Corporation substantially in the form of those contained in Appendix A to the
Amalgamation Agreement.
 
(b) Immediately after the Effective Time:
 
      (i) Parent, Dutchco and the Continuing Corporation shall execute and
    deliver a Support Agreement between Parent, Dutchco and the Continuing
    Corporation containing the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit D
    hereto (the "Support Agreement"), together with such other terms and
    conditions as may be agreed to by the parties hereto acting reasonably;
 
      (ii) Parent, Dutchco, the Continuing Corporation and a Canadian trust
    company to be selected by Parent shall execute and deliver a Voting and
    Exchange Trust Agreement containing the terms and

cause the Class B Shares, Class E Shares and Class F Shares to be approved for

election pursuant to section 85 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (and the
analogous provision of provincial income tax law) with respect to the transfer
of their Class B Shares to the Continuing Corporation by providing two signed
copies of the necessary election forms to the Continuing Corporation within
ninety (90) days following the Effective Time, duly completed with the details

a Canadian resident for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) other than a

Time, and the Company shall have received a certificate to such effect signed
by the President and Chief Executive Officer of Parent and of Dutchco;
 
(b) Agreements and Covenants. Each member of the Parent Group shall have

<PAGE>
 

or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, such that the conditions
set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied (in either case,
a "Terminating Breach"), provided, however, that if such Terminating Breach is
curable prior to the expiration of 30 days from its occurrence (but in no
event later than December 31, 1998) by a Parent Group member or the Company,
as the case may be, through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts and

Proposal.

        (D) The vote of the shareholders of Company approving and adopting

      convened therefor or any adjournment thereof (a "Company Negative
      Vote"), and prior to such Company Negative Vote there shall have
      occurred an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company which

    and at or prior to the time of such Company Negative Vote, there shall
    not have occurred a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent, or
    (B) this Agreement is terminated by Dutchco pursuant to Section 7.1(g),
    then Company shall pay to Dutchco an amount equal to US $5,000,000
    within one business day following the earlier to occur of (A)
    termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), or (B) a

      (ii) If (A) the vote of the stockholders of Parent approving the
    Parent Stock Issuance shall not have been obtained by reason of the
    failure to obtain the required vote upon a vote taken at a meeting of
    stockholders duly convened therefor or any adjournment thereof (a
    "Parent Negative Vote") and at or prior to the time of such Parent
    Negative Vote, there shall not have occurred a Material Adverse Effect

  Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act); and
 
    (e) "subsidiary" or "subsidiaries" of the Company, the Continuing
  Corporation, Parent or any other person means any corporation, partnership,
  joint venture or other legal entity of which the Company, the Continuing
  Corporation, Parent or such other person, as the case may be (either alone
  or through or together with any other subsidiary), owns, directly or
  indirectly, more than 50% of the stock or other equity interests the
  holders of which are generally entitled to vote for the election of the
  board of directors or other governing body of such corporation or other
  legal entity.
 
  8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval of the
Transactions by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment may be made
which by law requires further approval by such shareholders without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.
 
  8.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may
with respect to any other party hereto (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby.
 
  8.6 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.
 
  8.7 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.
 
  8.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Amalgamation
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings (other than the
Amalgamation Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement), both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to
confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.
 
  8.9 Assignment; Amalgamation Sub/Dutchco.
 
(a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise,
except that any member of the Parent Group may assign all or any of its
respective rights hereunder to any subsidiary of Parent provided
 
                                      36
<PAGE>
 

that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder. The Company agrees that prior to the Effective Time, it may amend
the Amalgamation Agreement to provide for the amalgamation of one or more of
Parent's Canadian subsidiaries with the Company; provided, however, that, such
amalgamation does not, in any respect adversely affect the ability of the
parties to complete the transaction contemplated hereby or, affect the
economic terms of the transactions contemplated hereby to the holders of the
Company Common Shares, including, without limitation, the tax treatment to
holders who elect to receive Exchangeable Shares.
 
(b) Parent undertakes to the Company that Parent shall cause Dutchco to
perform in a due and timely manner all of its obligations hereunder and to be
performed by it under the Ancillary Documents and in connection with the
implementation of the Transactions and that Parent shall cause Dutchco to
refrain from taking or omitting to take any action which would have an adverse
economic effect on the implementation of the Transactions as contemplated
herein.
 
  8.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than Section 5.8 (which is intended to be for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties and may be enforced by such Indemnified Parties).
 
  8.11 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.
 
  8.12 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPLICABLE TO
CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND FULLY PERFORMED WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT MANDATORILY GOVERNED BY QUEBEC LAW.
 
  8.13 Choice of Language. The parties hereto confirm that it is their wish
that this Agreement, as well as all other documents related hereto, including
legal notices, have been and shall be drawn up in the English language only.
Les parties si-dessous confirment leur desir que cet accord ainsi que tous les
documents, y compris tous avis qui s'y rattachent, soient rediges en langue
Anglaise.
 
  8.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

obligations hereunder and pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement.

     AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
                         ACQUISITION AND AMALGAMATION
 
  This Amendment No. 2 (the "Second Amendment") to the Second Amended and
Restated Agreement and Plan of Acquisition and Amalgamation by and among
Autodesk, Inc. ("Parent"), Autodesk Development B.V. ("Dutchco"), 9066-9771
Quebec Inc. ("Amalgamation Sub"), Autodesk Canada Inc. ("ACI"), 9066-9854
Quebec Inc ("Giants Quebec") and Discreet Logic Inc (the "Company") dated as
of November 18, 1998 (the "Second Amended and Restated Agreement"), as amended
by the Amendment dated December 18, 1998 (the "First Amendment"), is entered
into by and among each of the parties to the Second Amended and Restated
Agreement effective as of January 18, 1999.
 
                                   RECITALS
 
  Whereas, Parent, Dutchco, Amalgamation Sub, ACI, Giants Quebec and the
Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition and Arrangement
dated as of August 20, 1998, which was subsequently amended and restated in
its entirety by the parties in the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of
Acquisition and Amalgamation dated as of September 23, 1998, and again amended
and restated in its entirety in the Second Amended and Restated Agreement;
 
  Whereas, the Second Amended and Restated Agreement provides, among other
things, that upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, immediately
following the amalgamation (the "Amalgamation") of Amalgamation Sub, Giants
Quebec (to which ACI will assign, prior to the Amalgamation, substantially all
its assets) and the Company, whereupon each outstanding Company Common Share
shall be converted into one Class B Share of the Continuing Corporation
resulting from the Amalgamation, the Class B Shares of the Continuing
Corporation automatically will be, based on the prior election of their
holder, either (i) redeemed by the Continuing Corporation for 0.48
exchangeable shares in the share capital of the Continuing Corporation,
subject to proration in certain instances, or (ii) converted into units
comprised of one Class E Share and one Class F Share of the Continuing
Corporation, which units will be acquired by Dutchco in exchange for 0.48
shares of Parent Common Stock; and
 
  Whereas, the parties now desire to amend the Exchange Ratio set forth in the
Second Amended and Restated Agreement, and to make certain representations and
warranties to each other as of the date hereof;
 
                                   AGREEMENT
 
  Now, Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:
 
  1. Exchange Ratio. The recitals to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement
are hereby amended such that all occurrences in the recitals of the term
"0.48" shall be replaced in each case with "0.33" and the term "Exchange
Ratio" shall be defined as 0.33.
 
  2. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company hereby
represents to each member of the Parent Group as of the date hereof, subject
to the Company Disclosure Schedule dated as of the date of the Original
Agreement:
 
    (a) Authority. The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Second Amendment and to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Second Amendment by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby have been
duly and validly authorized
 
                                      44
 

<PAGE>
 
by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Second Amendment or to
consummate the Transactions, other than the approval and adoption of the
Second Amended and Restated Agreement, as amended, and confirmation of by-law
No. 1998-1 approving the Amalgamation by the holders of at least sixty-six and
two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the outstanding Company Shares who are
permitted to, and who, vote at the Company Shareholders' Meeting in accordance
with the Quebec Act. The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that

shall no later than 4:29 p.m. (Montreal time) on the Effective Date (the
"Election Deadline") present and surrender at the head office of the Company
acting on behalf of the Corporation or the Corporation or at any
 
                                      13

office of the Transfer Agent or such other place as may be specified by the
Corporation by notice to the holders of the Company's Common Shares (on behalf
of the holders of the Class B Shares) the certificate or certificates
representing the Class B Shares which the holder desires to have the
Corporation redeem (evidenced by the certificate or certificates representing
the Company's Common Shares which, as a result of the Amalgamation, represent
such Class B Shares), together with such other documents and instruments as
may be required to effect a transfer of Class B Shares under the Quebec Act
and the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and
instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, and together with a
duly executed statement (the "Class B Retraction Request") in such form as may
be acceptable to the Corporation specifying that the holder desires to have
all or any number specified therein of the Class B Shares represented by such
certificate or certificates (the "Retracted Shares") redeemed by the
Corporation.
 
  4.2 Upon receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner
specified in Section 4.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing
the number of Class B Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation
redeem, together with the documents and instruments contemplated by Section
4.1 (including a Class B Retraction Request), and provided that the Class B
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 4.6 hereof, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares
effective at the Class B Retraction Time and shall cause to be delivered to
such holder the total Retraction Price with respect to such shares. If only a
part of the Class B Shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, the
balance of shares represented by such certificate shall be governed by the
provisions of Section 5.1 of these share provisions relating to the Class B
Shares.
 
  4.3 The Corporation shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to
the relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities
register of the Corporation for the Class B Shares or at the address specified
in the holder's Class B Retraction Request or by holding for pick up by the
holder at the head office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer
Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Class
B Shares, certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares (which shares
shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and
clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) registered in the name of the holder
or in such other name as the holder may request in payment of the total Class
B Retraction Price and such delivery of such certificates on behalf of the
Corporation or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment of and
shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total Class B Retraction
Price to the extent that the same is represented by such share certificates.
All Class B Shares which have been so retracted shall be cancelled.
 
  4.4 As of the Class B Retraction Time, the holder of the Retracted Shares
shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled
to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the
right to receive his proportionate part of the total Class B Retraction Price.
 
  4.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4, the Corporation
shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares (i)
would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable
law or (ii) would cause the aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares issuable
on retraction to exceed the Maximum Number. If the Corporation believes that
at the Class B Retraction Time it would not be permitted by the foregoing to
redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, the
Corporation shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a
holder in a Class B Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number of
shares that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as
would not be contrary to such provisions or the maximum number of Exchangeable
Shares as would not exceed the Maximum Number and shall notify the holder
immediately following the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares
which will not be redeemed by the Corporation. In any case in which the
redemption by the Corporation of Retracted Shares would be contrary to
solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law or would cause the
Exchangeable Shares to be issued to exceed the Maximum Number, the Corporation
shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with Section 4.2 of these share
provisions on a pro rata basis.
 
 
                                      14

  4.6 A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the
holder to the Corporation at the head office of the Company on behalf of the
Corporation or of the Corporation, not less than two Business Days immediately
preceding the Class B Retraction Time, withdraw its Class B Retraction Request
in which event such Class B Retraction Request shall be null and void.
 
  4.7 No certificates or scrip representing fractional Exchangeable Shares
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to
section 4.3 hereof and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital
structure of Parent shall relate to any such fractional security and such
fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
exercise any rights as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional securities, each person entitled to a fractional interest in an
Exchangeable Share will receive from the Corporation an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of
(i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing price for the
Parent Common Shares on Nasdaq as of each of the thirty (30) consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the Effective Date as quoted in The Wall
Street Journal or other reliable financial newspaper or publication. For the
purposes of the preceding sentence, a "trading day" means a day on which
trading generally takes place on Nasdaq and on which trading in Parent Common
Shares has occurred.
 
  4.8 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares in
respect of which a Class B Retraction Request has been duly made prior to the
Class B Retraction Time but which is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company prior to the Effective Date, a certificate representing the proper
number of Exchangeable Shares may be issued to a transferee if the certificate
representing such Company Common Shares is presented to the Transfer Agent,
together with a Class B Retraction Request executed by the transferee
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer.
 
  4.9 In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Date represented outstanding Company Common Shares that were converted
pursuant to the Amalgamation into Class B Shares and subsequently retracted by
the holder pursuant to the Class B Share provisions shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Transfer
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
certificates representing Exchangeable Shares deliverable in respect thereof
as determined in accordance with this Section 4. When authorizing such
issuance in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person
to whom certificates representing Exchangeable Shares are to be issued shall,
at the discretion of the Corporation, as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Corporation in such sum as the
Corporation may direct or otherwise indemnify the Corporation in a manner
satisfactory to the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed.
 
  4.10 A Class B Retraction Request executed by a holder of Company Common
Shares in respect of Class B Shares to be issued upon the Amalgamation shall
be deemed for all purposes to constitute a good and valid Class B Retraction
Request executed by a holder of Class B Shares. Any notice by the Company to a
holder of Company Common Shares in respect of Class B Shares to be issued upon
the Amalgamation shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute good and valid
notice by the Corporation to the holders of Class B Shares. Any notice by a
holder of Company Common Shares to the Company in respect of Class B Shares to
be issued upon the Amalgamation shall be deemed for all purposes of these
share provisions to constitute good and valid notice by a holder of Class B
Shares to the Corporation.
 
  5 Automatic Conversion of Class B Shares
 
  5.1 Immediately following the Class B Retraction Time (the "Class B
Conversion Time") each Class B Share then outstanding shall, automatically and
without any further action required on the part of either the Corporation or
the holder of the Class B Share, be converted into a unit consisting of one
fully paid and non- assessable Class E Share and one fully paid and non-
assessable Class F Share whereupon each such Class B

                                      15
<PAGE>
 
Share will be cancelled, and the name of each holder thereof shall be removed
from the register of holders of Class B Shares and added to the registers of
holders of Class E Shares and Class F Shares accordingly.
 
  5.2 No certificates shall be issued by the Corporation representing the
Class E Shares and the Class F Shares. The certificates representing the Class
B Shares shall continue to represent an equal number of Class E and Class F
Shares. On and after the Class B Conversion Time, the holders of the Class B
Shares so converted shall cease to be holders of such Class B Shares and shall
not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof.

number of issued and outstanding Class D Shares plus (b) an additional amount
equivalent to the full amount on all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon
(herein collectively called the "Class D Redemption Price").
 
  4.2 To effect such redemption the Corporation shall, at least ten days prior
to the date fixed for redemption (the "Class D Redemption Date") send to each
holder of Class D Shares to be redeemed a notice in writing of the redemption
by the Corporation of Class D Shares held by such holder. Such notice shall

D Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be
required to effect a transfer of Class D Shares under the Quebec Act and the

Class D Redemption Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided.
The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the sending of notice
of its intention to redeem Class D Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to
be deposited the total Class D Redemption Price of the Class D Shares so
called for redemption, or of such of the said Class D Shares represented by
certificates that have not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by the
holders thereof in connection with such redemption, in a custodial account
with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada named in such notice. Upon
the later of such deposit being made and the Class D Redemption Date, the
Class D Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be
redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Class D
Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their
proportionate part of the total Class D Redemption Price (less any tax
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Corporation) for such
Class D Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said
certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions.

cancellation all or any part of the outstanding Class D Shares at any price by
tender to all the holders of record of Class D Shares then outstanding or
through the facilities of any stock exchange on which Class D Shares are
listed or quoted at any price per share. If in response to an invitation for
tenders under the provisions hereof, more Class D Shares are tendered at a
price or prices acceptable to the Corporation than the Corporation is prepared
to purchase, Class D Shares to be purchased by the Corporation shall be
purchased as nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of shares
tendered by each holder who submits a tender to the Corporation, provided that
when shares are tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall be effected
(disregarding fractions) only with respect to the shares tendered at the price
at which more shares were tendered than the Corporation is prepared to
purchase after the Corporation has purchased all the shares tendered at lower
prices. If part only of the Class D Shares represented by any certificate
shall be purchased, a new certificate for the balance of such shares shall be
issued at the expense of the Corporation. Subject as aforesaid, the
Corporation may effect such purchase for cancellation without purchasing for
cancellation shares of any other class of shares of the Corporation.

change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition attaching to

given if it shall have been given in accordance with applicable law subject to
a minimum requirement that such approval be evidenced by written resolution
signed by all holders of Class D Shares or by resolution passed by not less
than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at a meeting of holders
of Class D Shares duly called and held at which the holders of at least 50% of

outstanding Class D Shares at that time are not present or represented by
proxy within one-half hour after the time appointed for such meeting then the
meeting shall be adjourned to such date not less than ten days thereafter and
to such time and place as may be designated by the Chairman of such meeting.
At such adjourned meeting the holders of Class D Shares present or represented
by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the meeting was
originally called and a resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of
not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting
shall constitute the approval or consent of the holders of the Class D Shares.

Class E Shares without declaring dividends on any of the Class A Shares, Class
B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares or Class F Shares.
 
  2 Dissolution
 
  2.1 In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of
assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up
its affairs, subject to the prior rights of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares in the share capital of the Corporation, the Class D Shares, the Class
C Shares and to any other shares ranking senior to the Class E Shares with
respect to priority in the distribution of assets upon dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up, the holders of the Class E Shares shall be entitled

of the Corporation are entitled to vote separately as a class or series.
 
  4 Redemption of Class E Shares by the Corporation
 
  4.1 Subject to applicable law, and subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the
Class E Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall be entitled, immediately
following the Class B Conversion Time (the "Class E Redemption Time") without
notice to the holders of the Class E Shares, but with prior notice to Dutchco,
to redeem the whole of the then outstanding Class E Shares for an amount per
share equal to the Current Market Price of 0.165 of one Parent Common Share on
the last Business Day prior to the Class E Redemption Time, which shall be
satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to each holder of
Class E Shares 0.165 of one Parent Common Share for each Class E Share held by
such holder (the "Class E Redemption Price").
 
  4.2 At or after the Class E Redemption Time and subject to the exercise by
Dutchco of the Class E Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to
be delivered to the holders of the Class E Shares to be redeemed the Class E
Redemption Price (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom
by the Corporation) for each such Class E Share upon presentation and
surrender (at the head office of the Corporation or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation) of the certificates
representing such Class E Shares, or such other certificates of securities of
any predecessor of the Corporation acceptable to the Corporation (including
those representing Company Common Shares) together with such other documents
and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Class E Shares
under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require.
Payment of the total Class E Redemption Price for such Class E Shares shall be
made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the
securities register of the Corporation or by holding for pick up by the holder
at the head office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Corporation, on behalf of the Corporation of
certificates representing Parent Common Shares (which shares shall be duly
issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any
lien, claim or encumbrance) (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom by the Corporation). At and after the Class E Redemption Time, the
holders of the Class E Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders
of such Class E Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights
of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their
proportionate part of the total Class E Redemption Price, unless payment of
the total Class E Redemption Price for such Class E Shares shall not be made
upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain
unaffected until the total Class E Redemption Price has been paid in the
manner hereinbefore provided. Subject to the exercise of the Class E
Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall have the right at any time to
deposit or cause to be deposited the total Class E Redemption Price of the
Class E Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the
 
                                      20
<PAGE>
 

said Class E Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of
such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such
redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in
Canada or the United States. Upon the later of such deposit being made and the
Class E Redemption Time, the Class E Shares in respect whereof such deposit
shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof
after such deposit or Class E Redemption Time, as the case may be, shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Class E Redemption
Price (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the
Corporation) for such Class E Shares so deposited, against presentation and
surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance
with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Class
E Redemption Price, the holders of the Class E Shares shall thereafter be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Parent Common
Shares delivered to them.
 
  4.3 Dutchco shall have the overriding right (the "Class E Redemption Call
Right"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of Class E Shares by the
Corporation, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of
Class E Shares to be redeemed at the Class E Redemption Time, all but not less
than all of the Class E Shares held by each such holder on payment by Dutchco
to the holder of an amount per share equal to the Current Market Price of
0.165 of one Parent Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Class E
Redemption Time which shall be satisfied in full by causing to be delivered to
such holder 0.165 of one Parent Common Share (the "Class E Redemption Call
Purchase Price"). In the event of the exercise of the Class E Redemption Call
Right by Dutchco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Class E
Shares held by the holder and otherwise to be redeemed to Dutchco at the Class
E Redemption Time on payment by Dutchco to the holder of the Class E
Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share.
 
  4.4 To exercise the Class E Redemption Call Right, Dutchco must notify the
Corporation of Dutchco's intention to exercise such right prior to the Class E
Redemption Time (which notice may be given to the Company on behalf of the
Corporation). If Dutchco exercises the Class E Redemption Call Right, Dutchco
will, at the Class E Redemption Time, purchase and the holders will sell all
of the Class E Shares to be redeemed for a price per share equal to the Class
E Redemption Call Purchase Price. Any notice by Dutchco to the Company for and
on behalf of the Corporation shall be deemed to constitute good and valid
notice by Dutchco to the Corporation.
 
  4.5 For the purposes of completing the purchase of Class E Shares pursuant
to the Class E Redemption Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, at or before the Class E Redemption Time, certificates representing the
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deliverable by Dutchco in payment of
the total Class E Redemption Call Purchase Price and a cheque or cheques in
the amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Class E Redemption
Call Purchase Price. Provided that the total Class E Redemption Call Purchase
Price has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, at and after the Class E
Redemption Time the rights of each holder of Class E Shares so purchased will
be limited to receiving such holder's proportionate part of the total Class E
Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Dutchco upon presentation and
surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Class E Shares
purchased by Dutchco from such holder and the holder shall at and after the
Class E Redemption Time be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the
holder of the Parent Common Shares delivered to such holder. Upon surrender to
the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Class E
Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required
to effect a transfer of Class E Shares under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of
the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer
Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or
certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the
Transfer Agent on behalf of Dutchco shall deliver to such holder, certificates
representing the Parent Common Shares to which the holder is entitled and a
cheque or cheques of or on behalf of Dutchco payable at par and in Canadian
dollars at any branch of the bankers of Dutchco or of the Corporation in
Canada in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Class E
Redemption Call Purchase Price. If Dutchco does not exercise the Class E
Redemption Call Right in the manner described herein, at the Class E
Redemption Time the holders of the Class E Shares will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the redemption price otherwise payable by the Corporation
in connection with the redemption of Class E Shares.
 
                                      21

  4.6 No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to
sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof and no dividend, stock split or other change in the
capital structure of Parent shall relate to any such fractional security and
such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
exercise any rights as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional securities, each person entitled to a fractional interest in a
Parent Common Share will receive from the Corporation or Dutchco, as the case
may be, an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
average of the closing price for the Parent Common Shares on Nasdaq as of each
of the thirty (30) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Effective Date as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or other reliable
financial newspaper or publication. For the purposes of the preceding
sentence, a "trading day" means a day on which trading generally takes place
on Nasdaq and on which trading in Parent Common Shares has occurred.
 
  4.7 No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Class E
Redemption Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Class E Redemption Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Class E Redemption Time represented
Class E Shares that were redeemed or purchased pursuant to these Class E Share
provisions, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to section 4.6 hereof, unless and until the holder of
record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with
sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof, as the case may be. Subject to applicable law, at
the time of such surrender of any such certificate there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares
without interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
Parent Common Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 4.6
hereof, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Class E Redemption Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
Parent Common Share and (iii) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Class E Redemption Time but prior to surrender
and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
Parent Common Share.
 
  4.8 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company prior to the
Effective Date, a certificate representing the proper number of Parent Common
Shares may be issued to a transferee if the certificate representing such
Company Common Shares is presented to the Transfer Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer.
 
  4.9 In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Date represented outstanding Company Common Shares that were converted to
Class B Shares on the Amalgamation and subsequently converted into Class E
Shares at the Class B Conversion Time shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Transfer Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, certificates
representing Parent Common Shares (and any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and any cash pursuant to section 4.6 hereof) deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof.
When authorizing such issuance and/or payment in exchange for any lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the person to whom certificates representing Parent
Common Shares are to be issued shall, at the discretion of the Corporation or
Dutchco, as the case may be, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
give a bond satisfactory to the Corporation, the Affiliate or Dutchco, as the
case may be, in such sum as the Corporation or Dutchco may direct or otherwise
indemnify the Corporation or Dutchco in a manner satisfactory to the
Corporation, the Affiliate or the Dutchco, as the case may be, against any
claim that may be made against the Corporation, the Affiliate or Dutchco with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
 
  4.10 The Corporation and Dutchco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Class E Redemption Price, the Class E Redemption Call Price payable
pursuant to these Class E Share Provisions to any holder of Class E Shares
such amounts as Parent, the Affiliate, Dutchco or the Transfer Agent determine
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Income
Tax Act (Canada) or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the
shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made,
 
                                      22
<PAGE>
 

provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority. To the extent any amount is required to be deducted or
withheld from any payment to a holder, the Corporation or Dutchco as the case
may be, are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market
value such portion of such consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient
funds to the Corporation or Dutchco, as the case may be, in order to enable it
to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the Corporation
or Dutchco, as the case may be, shall give an accounting to the holder with
respect thereto and any balance of such proceeds of sale.
 
  4.11 The Corporation shall not be entitled to redeem, nor shall Dutchco be
entitled to purchase, any Class E Shares pursuant to this Section 4 unless at
the same time the Corporation redeems or Dutchco, purchases at the same time
and in the same manner all issued and outstanding Class F Shares.
 
  5 Purchase for Cancellation
 
  5.1 Subject to applicable law and to Section 4.1 of the Exchangeable Share
Provisions, the Corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for
cancellation all or any part of the outstanding Class E Shares at any price by
tender to all the holders of record of Class E Shares then outstanding or
through the facilities of any stock exchange on which Class E Shares are
listed or quoted at any price per share. If in response to an invitation for
tenders under the provisions hereof, more Class E Shares are tendered at a
price or prices acceptable to the Corporation than the Corporation is prepared
to purchase, Class E Shares to be purchased by the Corporation shall be
purchased as nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of shares
tendered by each holder who submits a tender to the Corporation, provided that
when shares are tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall be effected
(disregarding fractions) only with respect to the shares tendered at the price
at which more shares were tendered than the Corporation is prepared to
purchase after the Corporation has purchased all the shares tendered at lower
prices. If only part of the Class E Shares represented by any certificate
shall be purchased, a new certificate for the balance of such shares shall be
issued at the expense of the Corporation. Subject as aforesaid, the
Corporation may effect such purchase for cancellation without purchasing for
cancellation shares of any other class of shares of the Corporation.
 
  6 Issued and Paid-Up Capital Account
 
  6.1 Where Class E Shares and Class F Shares are issued on a conversion of
Class B Shares, the amount to be added to the issued and paid-up capital
account of the Class E Shares for purposes of the Quebec Act and the paid-up
capital account of the Class E Shares for purposes of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) shall be equal to the aggregate of the issued and paid-up capital of
such Class B Shares so converted, less $1.
 
  7 Amendment and Approval
 
  7.1 The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the
Class E Shares may be added to, changed or removed but only with the approval
of the holders of the Class E Shares given as hereinafter specified, and any
other approval required by law.
 
  7.2 Any approval given by the holders of the Class E Shares to add to,
change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition attaching to
the Class E Shares or any other matter requiring the approval or consent of
the holders of the Class E Shares shall be deemed to have been sufficiently
given if it shall have been given in accordance with applicable law subject to
a minimum requirement that such approval be evidenced by written resolution
signed by all holders of Class E Shares or by resolution passed by not less
than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at a meeting of holders
of Class E Shares duly called and held at which the holders of at least 50% of
the outstanding Class E Shares at that time are present or represented by
proxy; provided that if at any such meeting the holders of at least 50% of the
outstanding Class E Shares at that time are not present or represented by
proxy within one-half hour after the time appointed for such meeting then the
meeting shall be adjourned to such date not less than ten days thereafter and
to such time and place as may be designated by the Chairman of such meeting.
At such adjourned meeting the holders of Class E Shares present
 
                                      23
<PAGE>
 

or represented by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the
meeting was originally called and a resolution passed thereat by the
affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such
resolution at such meeting shall constitute the approval or consent of the
holders of the Class E Shares.
 
                    PROVISIONS ATTACHING TO CLASS F SHARES
 
  The Class F non-voting common shares in the share capital of the Corporation

Corporation shall pay dividends thereon, as and when declared by the board of
directors of the Corporation out of monies properly applicable to the payment
of dividends, in such amount and in such form as the board of directors may
from time to time determine and all dividends which the directors may declare
on the Class F Shares shall be declared and paid in equal amounts per share on
all Class F Shares at the time outstanding; and, subject as aforesaid, the
board of directors of the Corporation may in their discretion declare

assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up
its affairs, subject to the prior rights of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares, the Class D Shares and the Class C Shares and to any other shares
ranking senior to the Class F Shares with respect to priority in the
distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the
holders of the Class F Shares shall be entitled to receive the remaining
property and assets of the Corporation rateably with the holders of the Class
A Shares, the Class B Shares and the Class E Shares.
 
  3 Voting Rights
 
  3.1 The holders of Class F Shares shall be entitled to vote separately as a
class on any change of the head office of the Corporation. Each Class F Share
shall carry one vote at any meeting called for such purpose. Except as
aforesaid and except where specifically provided by the Quebec Act the holders
of the Class F Shares shall not otherwise be entitled to receive notice of or
to attend meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation and shall not be
entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, but shall
be entitled to notice of meetings of shareholders called for the purpose of
authorizing the dissolution of the Corporation.
 
  4 Redemption of Class F Shares by the Corporation
 
  4.1 Subject to applicable law, and subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the
Class F Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall be entitled, immediately
following the Class B Conversion Time (the "Class F Redemption Time") without
notice to the holders of Class F Shares, but with prior notice to Dutchco, to
redeem the whole of the then outstanding Class F Shares for an amount per
share equal to the Current Market Price of 0.165 of one Parent Common Share on
the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Time, which shall be satisfied
in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to each holder of Class F
Shares 0.165 of one Parent Common Share for each Class F Share held by such
holder (the "Class F Redemption Price").
 
  4.2 At or after the Class F Redemption Time and subject to the exercise by
Dutchco of the Class F Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to
be delivered to the holders of the Class F Shares to be redeemed the Class F
Redemption Price (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom
by the
 
                                      24
<PAGE>
 

Corporation) for each such Class F Share upon presentation and surrender (at
the head office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as
may be specified by the Corporation in such notice) of the certificates
representing such Class F Shares, or such other certificates of securities or
any predecessor of the Corporation acceptable to the Corporation (including
those representing Company Common Shares) together with such other documents
and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Class F Shares
under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require.
Payment of the total Class F Redemption Price for such Class F Shares shall be
made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the
securities register of the Corporation or by holding for pick up by the holder
at the head office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Corporation, on behalf of the Corporation of
certificates representing Parent Common Shares (which shares shall be duly
issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any
lien, claim or encumbrance) (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom by the Corporation). At and after the Class F Redemption Time, the
holders of the Class F Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders
of such Class F Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights
of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their
proportionate part of the total Class F Redemption Price, unless payment of
the total Class F Redemption Price for such Class F Shares shall not be made
upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain
unaffected until the total Class F Redemption Price has been paid in the
manner hereinbefore provided. Subject to the exercise of the Class F
Redemption Call Right by Dutchco, the Corporation shall have the right at any
time to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Class F Redemption Price of
the Class F Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the said Class F
Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of such deposit
been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such redemption, in
a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada or the
United States. Upon the later of such deposit being made and the Class F
Redemption Time, the Class F Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have
been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such
deposit or Class F Redemption Time, as the case may be, shall be limited to
receiving their proportionate part of the total Class F Redemption Price (less
any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Corporation) for
such Class F Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the
said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Class F Redemption
Price, the holders of the Class F Shares shall thereafter be considered and
deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Parent Common Shares delivered to
them.
 
  4.3 Dutchco shall have the overriding right (the "Class F Redemption Call
Right"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of Class F Shares by the
Corporation, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of
Class F Shares to be redeemed at the Class F Redemption Time, all but not less
than all of the Class F Shares held by each such holder on payment by Dutchco
to the holder of an amount per share equal to the Current Market Price of
0.165 of one Parent Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Class F
Redemption Time which shall be satisfied in full by causing to be delivered to
such holder 0.165 of one Parent Common Share (the "Class F Redemption Call
Purchase Price"). In the event of the exercise of the Class F Redemption Call
Right by Dutchco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Class F
Shares held by the holder and otherwise to be redeemed to Dutchco at the Class
F Redemption Time on payment by Dutchco to the holder of the Class F
Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share.
 
  4.4 To exercise the Class F Redemption Call Right, Dutchco must notify the
Corporation of Dutchco's intention to exercise such right prior to the Class F
Redemption Time (which notice may be given to the Company on behalf of the
Corporation). If Dutchco exercises the Class F Redemption Call Right, Dutchco
will, at the Class F Redemption Time, purchase and the holders will sell all
of the Class F Shares to be redeemed for a price per share equal to the Class
F Redemption Call Purchase Price. Any notice by Dutchco to the Company for and
on behalf of the Corporation shall be deemed to constitute good and valid
notice by Dutchco to the Corporation.
 
  4.5 For the purposes of completing the purchase of Class F Shares pursuant
to the Class F Redemption Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, at or before the Class F Redemption Time, certificates
 
                                      25
<PAGE>
 

representing the aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deliverable by
Dutchco in payment of the total Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price and a
cheque or cheques in the amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total
Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price. Provided that the total Class F
Redemption Call Purchase Price has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent,
at and after the Class F Redemption Time the rights of each holder of Class F
Shares so purchased will be limited to receiving such holder's proportionate
part of the total Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Dutchco
upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
Class F Shares purchased by Dutchco from such holder and the holder shall at
and after the Class F Redemption Time be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be the holder of the Parent Common Shares delivered to such
holder. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates
representing Class F Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Class F Shares under
the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the
holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Dutchco
shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the Parent Common
Shares to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of or on behalf
of Dutchco payable at par and in Canadian dollars at any branch of the bankers
of Dutchco or of the Corporation in Canada in payment of the remaining
portion, if any, of the total Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price. If
Dutchco does not exercise the Class F Redemption Call Right in the manner
described herein, at the Class F Redemption Time the holders of the Class F
Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the redemption price
otherwise payable by the Corporation in connection with the redemption of
Class F Shares.
 
  4.6 No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to
sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof and no dividend, stock split or other change in the
capital structure of Parent shall relate to any such fractional security and
such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
exercise any rights as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional securities, each person entitled to a fractional interest in a
Parent Common Share will receive from the Corporation or Dutchco as the case
may be, an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
average of the closing price for the Parent Common Shares on Nasdaq as of each
of the thirty (30) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Effective Date as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or other reliable
financial newspaper or publication. For the purposes of the preceding
sentence, a "trading day" means a day on which trading generally takes place
on Nasdaq and on which trading in Parent Common Shares has occurred.
 
  4.7 No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Class F
Redemption Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Class F Redemption Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Class F Redemption Date represented
Class F Shares that were redeemed or purchased pursuant to these Class F Share
provisions, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to section 4.6 hereof, unless and until the holder of
record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with
sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof, as the case may be. Subject to applicable law, at
the time of such surrender of any such certificate there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares
without interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
Parent Common Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 4.6
hereof, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Class F Redemption Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
Parent Common Share and (iii) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Class F Redemption Time but prior to surrender
and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
Parent Common Share.
 
  4.8 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company prior to the
Effective Date, a certificate representing the proper number of Parent Common
Shares may be issued to a transferee if the certificate representing such
Company Common Shares is presented to the Transfer Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer.
 
 
                                      26
<PAGE>
 

  4.9 In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Date represented outstanding Company Common Shares that were converted to
Class B Shares on the Amalgamation and subsequently converted into Class F
Shares at the Class B Conversion Time shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Transfer Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, certificates
representing Parent Common Shares (and any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto and any cash pursuant to section 4.6 hereof) deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof.
When authorizing such issuance and/or payment in exchange for any lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the person to whom certificates representing Parent
Common Shares are to be issued shall, at the discretion of the Corporation or
Dutchco, as the case may be, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
give a bond satisfactory to the Corporation or Dutchco, as the case may be, in
such sum as the Corporation or Dutchco may direct or otherwise indemnify the
Corporation or Dutchco in a manner satisfactory to the Corporation or the
Dutchco, as the case may be, against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation or Dutchco with respect to the certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.
 
  4.10 The Corporation and Dutchco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Class F Redemption Price or the Class F Redemption Call Price, as the
case may be, payable pursuant to these Class F Share Provisions to any holder
of Class F Shares such amounts as Parent, Dutchco or the Transfer Agent
determine is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any provision of state, local,
provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been
paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent any amount is
required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder, the
Corporation, the Affiliate or Dutchco, as the case may be, are hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market value such portion
of such consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to the
Corporation, the Affiliate or Dutchco, as the case may be, in order to enable
it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the
Corporation, the Affiliate or Dutchco, as the case may be shall give an
accounting to the holder with respect thereto and any balance of such proceeds
of sale.
 
  4.11 The Corporation shall not be entitled to redeem, nor shall Dutchco or
the Affiliate, as the case may be, be entitled to purchase, any Class F Shares
pursuant to this Section 4 unless at the same time the Corporation redeems or
Dutchco or the Affiliate, as the case may be, purchases at the same time and
in the same manner all issued and outstanding Class E Shares.
 
  5 Issued and Paid-Up Capital Account
 
  5.1 Where Class E Shares and Class F Shares are issued on a conversion of
Class B Shares, the amount to be added to the issued and paid-up capital
account of the Class F Shares for purposes of the Quebec Act and the paid-up

other approval required by law.
 
  6.2 Any approval given by the holders of the Class F Shares to add to,

omission to give any such notice of extension or acceleration, as the case may
be, to less than 5% of such holders of Exchangeable Shares shall not affect
the validity of such extension or acceleration.

                        Ranking of Exchangeable Shares
 
  2.1 The Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled to a preference over the Class
A Shares, the Class B Shares, the Class C Shares, the Class D Shares, the
Class E Shares and the Class F Shares and any other shares ranking junior to
the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends and the

distribution of the assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the
purpose of winding up its affairs.
 
                                   ARTICLE 3
 
                                   Dividends
 
  3.1 A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to receive and the
Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, on each Parent Dividend
Declaration Date, declare a dividend on each Exchangeable Share (a) in the
case of a cash dividend declared on the Parent Common Shares, in an amount in
cash for each Exchangeable Share equal to the Canadian Dollar Equivalent on
the Parent Dividend Declaration Date of the cash dividend declared on each
Parent Common Share or (b) in the case of a stock dividend declared on the
Parent Common Shares to be paid in Parent Common Shares, in such number of
Exchangeable Shares for each Exchangeable Share as is equal to the number of
Parent Common Shares to be paid on each Parent Common Share or (c) in the case
of a dividend declared on the Parent Common Shares in property other than cash
or Parent Common Shares, in such type and amount of property for each
Exchangeable Share as is the same as or economically equivalent to (to be
determined by the Board of Directors as contemplated by Section 2.7 of the
Support Agreement) the type and amount of property declared as a dividend on
each Parent Common Share. Such dividends shall be paid out of money, assets or
property of the Corporation properly applicable to the payment of dividends,
or out of authorized but unissued shares of the Corporation. Any dividend
which should have been declared on the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to this
Section 3.1 but was not so declared due to the provisions of applicable law
shall be declared and paid by the Corporation as soon as payment of such
dividend is permitted by such law on a subsequent date or dates determined by
the Board of Directors.
 
  3.2 Cheques of the Corporation or any dividend paying agent appointed by the
Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation
shall be issued in respect of any cash dividends contemplated by Section
3.1(a) hereof and the sending of such a cheque to each holder of an
Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the cash dividend represented thereby unless
the cheque is not paid on presentation. Certificates registered in the name of
the registered holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be issued or transferred in
respect of any stock dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(b) hereof and the
sending of such a certificate to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall
satisfy the stock dividend represented thereby. Such other type and amount of
property in respect of any dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(c) hereof
shall be issued, distributed or transferred by the Corporation in such manner
as it shall determine and the issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by
the Corporation to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the
dividend represented thereby. No holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be
entitled to recover by action or other legal process against the Corporation
any dividend that is represented by a cheque that has not been duly presented
to the Corporation's bankers for payment or that otherwise remains unclaimed
for a period of six years from the date on which such dividend was payable.
 
  3.3 The record date for the determination of the holders of Exchangeable
Shares entitled to receive payment of, and the payment date for, any dividend
declared on the Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 hereof shall be the same

dividend declared on the Parent Common Shares.
 
  3.4 If on any payment date for any dividends declared on the Exchangeable
Shares under Section 3.1 hereof the dividends are not paid in full on all of
the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends
 
                                      31
<PAGE>
 

that remain unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by
the Board of Directors on which the Corporation shall have sufficient moneys,
assets or property properly applicable to the payment of such dividends.

                             Certain Restrictions
 
  4.1 So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not at any time without, but may at any time with, the
approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in
Section 10.2 of these share provisions:
 
    (a) pay any dividends on the Class A Shares, the Class B Shares, the
  Class C Shares, the Class D Shares, the Class E Shares, the Class F Shares
  or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, other than
  stock dividends payable in Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares,
  Class D Shares, Class E Shares, Class F Shares or any such other shares
  ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be;
 
    (b) redeem, retract or purchase or make any capital distribution in
  respect of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, Class D Shares,
  Class E Shares and Class F Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the
  Exchangeable Shares;
 
    (c) redeem or purchase any other shares of the Corporation ranking
  equally with or junior to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the
  payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or
 
    (d) issue any Exchangeable Shares or any other shares of the Corporation
  ranking equally with respect to the payment of dividends or on any
  liquidation distribution, or superior to, the Exchangeable Shares other
  than by way of stock dividends to the holders of such Exchangeable Shares
  or as contemplated by the Support Agreement.
 
  The restrictions in Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b) and 4.1(c) above shall not apply
if all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares corresponding to
dividends declared following the initial date of issue of Exchangeable Shares
on the Parent Common Shares shall have been declared on the Exchangeable
Shares and paid in full.
 
                                   ARTICLE 5
 
                          Distribution on Liquidation
 
  5.1 In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Corporation or any other distribution of the assets of the Corporation among
its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, a holder of
Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive
from the assets of the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable Share held
by such holder on the effective date (the "Liquidation Date") of such
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any distribution of any part of
the assets of the Corporation among the holders of the Class A Shares, the
Class B Shares, the Class C Shares, the Class D Shares, the Class E Shares,
the Class F Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable
Shares, an amount per share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a Parent
Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which
shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to such
holder one Parent Common Share, plus (b) an additional amount equivalent to
the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable
Share and all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares which have not been
declared on such Exchangeable Shares in accordance with Section 3.1 of these
share provisions (collectively the "Liquidation Amount", provided that if the
record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the
Liquidation Date, the Liquidation Amount shall not include such additional
amount equivalent to such dividends).
 
 
                                      32
<PAGE>
 

  5.2 On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the exercise
by Dutchco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount
(less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the
Corporation) for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender
of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares together with such
other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of
Exchangeable Shares under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Corporation
and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may be
specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares
shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder
recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable
Shares or by holding for pick up by the holder at the head office of the
Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the
Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the
Corporation of certificates representing Parent Common Shares (which shares
shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and
clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and a cheque of the Corporation
payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in respect of
the amount equivalent to the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends
and all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares which have not been
declared on such Exchangeable Shares in accordance with Section 3.1 of these
share provisions, comprising part of the total Liquidation Amount (less any
tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Corporation). On and
after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease
to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right
to receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless
payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not
be made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates in accordance
with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall
remain unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount has been paid in the
manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time
after the Liquidation Date to deposit or cause to be deposited the total
Liquidation Amount in respect of the Exchangeable Shares represented by
certificates that have not at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by the
holders thereof in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust
company in Canada. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of the holders of
Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited to receiving their
proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount (less any tax required to
be deducted and withheld therefrom) for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited,
against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them,
respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment
or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount, the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the
holders of the Parent Common Shares delivered to them. To the extent that the
amount of tax required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder
of Exchangeable Shares exceeds the cash portion of such payment, the
Corporation is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair
market value such portion of the property then payable to the holder as is
necessary to provide sufficient funds to the Corporation in order to enable it
to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and the Corporation
shall give an accounting to the holder with respect thereto and any balance of
such proceeds of sale.
 
  5.3 After the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares, the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share
pursuant to Section 5.1 of these share provisions, such holders shall not be
entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the
Corporation.
 
  5.4 Dutchco shall have the overriding right (the "Liquidation Call Right"),
in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Corporation pursuant to Article 5 of these share provisions,
to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable
Shares on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable
Shares held by each such holder on payment by Dutchco of an amount per share
equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a Parent Common Share on the last
Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full
by causing to be delivered to such holder one Parent Common Share, plus (b) an
additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all dividends declared and
unpaid on such Exchangeable Share and all dividends declared on Parent Common
Shares which have not been declared on such Exchangeable Shares in accordance
with Section 3.1 of these share provisions
 
                                      33
<PAGE>
 

(collectively the "Liquidation Call Purchase Price", provided that if the
record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the
Liquidation Date, the Liquidation Call Purchase Price shall not include such
additional amount equivalent to such dividends). In the event of the exercise
of the Liquidation Call Right by Dutchco, each holder shall be obligated to
sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Dutchco on the
Liquidation Date on payment by Dutchco to the holder of the Liquidation Call
Purchase Price for each such share.
 
  5.5 To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Dutchco must notify the Transfer
Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Corporation of
Dutchco's intention to exercise such right at least sixty days before the
Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Corporation and at least five Business Days before the
Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Corporation. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of
Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Dutchco has exercised the Liquidation
Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may
be exercised by Dutchco. If Dutchco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, on
the Liquidation Date, Dutchco will purchase and the holders will sell all of
the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the
Liquidation Call Purchase Price.
 
  5.6 For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares
pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the
Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, certificates representing
the aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deliverable by Dutchco in payment
of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price and a cheque or cheques in the
amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Call
Purchase Price. Provided that the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price has
been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, on and after the Liquidation Date
the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving
such holder's proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price
payable by Dutchco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of
certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the
holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be the holder of the Parent Common Shares delivered to it.
Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates
representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the
holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Dutchco
shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the Parent Common
Shares to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Dutchco
payable at par and in Canadian dollars at any branch of the bankers of Dutchco
or of the Corporation in Canada in payment of the remaining portion, if any,
of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price. If Dutchco does not exercise the
Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the liquidation price otherwise payable by the Corporation in
connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation
pursuant to this Article 5.
 
                                   ARTICLE 6
 
                  Retraction of Exchangeable Shares by Holder
 
  6.1 A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time, subject
to applicable law and the exercise by Dutchco of the Retraction Call Right (as
defined in subsection (c) below) and otherwise upon compliance with the
provisions of this Article 6, to require the Corporation to redeem any or all
of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount
per share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a Parent Common Share on
the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date, which shall be satisfied
in full by the Corporation causing to be delivered to such holder one Parent
Common Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the
holder, plus (b) an additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all
dividends declared and unpaid thereon and all dividends declared on Parent
Common Shares which have not been declared on such Exchangeable Shares in
accordance with Section 3.1 of these share
 
                                      34
<PAGE>
 

provisions (collectively the "Retraction Price", provided that if the record
date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the
Retraction Date the Retraction Price shall not include such additional amount
equivalent to such dividends). To effect such redemption, the holder shall
present and surrender at the head office of the Corporation or at any office
of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the
holders of Exchangeable Shares the certificate or certificates representing
the Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation
redeem, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required
to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Quebec Act and the by-
laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the
Transfer Agent may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed
statement (the "Retraction Request") in such form as may be acceptable to the
Corporation:
 
    (a) specifying that the holder desires to have all or any number
  specified therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such
  certificate or certificates (the "Retracted Shares") redeemed by the
  Corporation;
 
    (b) stating the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the
  Corporation redeem the Retracted Shares (the "Retraction Date"), provided
  that the Retraction Date shall be not less than three Business Days nor
  more than ten Business Days after the date on which the Retraction Request
  is received by the Corporation and further provided that, in the event that
  no such Business Day is specified by the holder in the Retraction Request,
  the Retraction Date shall be deemed to be the tenth Business Day after the
  date on which the Retraction Request is received by the Corporation; and
 
    (c) acknowledging the overriding right (the "Retraction Call Right") of
  Dutchco to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted Shares directly
  from the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be deemed to be a
  revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Dutchco in
  accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the terms and conditions set
  out in Section 6.3 below.
 
  6.2 Subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the Retraction Call Right, upon
receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in
Section 6.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing the number of
Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem,
together with a Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction Request
is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7 hereof,
the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of
business on the Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder
the total Retraction Price with respect to such shares. If only a part of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate are redeemed (or purchased
by Dutchco pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate for the
balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the
expense of the Corporation.
 
  6.3 Upon receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation
shall immediately notify Dutchco and Parent thereof. In order to exercise the
Retraction Call Right, Parent or Dutchco must notify the Corporation in writing
of Dutchco's determination to do so (the "Parent (Dutchco) Call Notice") within
two Business Days of notification to Parent and Dutchco by the Corporation of
the receipt by the Corporation of the Retraction Request. If the Parent or
Dutchco does not so notify the Corporation within such two Business Day period,
the Corporation will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that
Dutchco will not exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Parent or Dutchco
delivers the Parent (Dutchco) Call Notice within such two Business Day time
period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in
the manner specified in Section 6.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be
considered only to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to
Dutchco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such event, the
Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Dutchco shall purchase
from such holder and such holder shall sell to Dutchco on the Retraction Date,
the Retracted Shares for a purchase price (the "Purchase Price") per share equal
to the Retraction Price per share. For the purposes of completing a purchase
pursuant to the Retraction Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, on or before the Retraction Date, certificates representing Parent Common
Shares and a cheque in the amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total
Purchase Price. Provided that the total Purchase Price has been so deposited
with the Transfer Agent, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted
Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as
at the close of business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no
redemption by the Corporation of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the
Retraction Date. In the event that neither Parent nor Dutchco delivers a

                                      35
<PAGE>
 

Parent (Dutchco) Call Notice within such two Business Day period, and provided
that Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified
in Section 6.7, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the
Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Article 6.
 
  6.4 The Corporation or Dutchco, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause
the Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the
holder recorded in the securities register of the Corporation for the
Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the holder's Retraction
Request or by holding for pick up by the holder at the head office of the
Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the
Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, certificates
representing the Parent Common Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as
fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance) registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as
the holder may request in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, and a cheque of the Corporation payable at
par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in payment of the
remaining portion, if any, of the total Retraction Price (less any tax
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Corporation) or a cheque
of Dutchco payable at par and in Canadian dollars at any branch of the bankers
of Dutchco or of the Corporation in Canada in payment of the remaining
portion, if any, of the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, and such
delivery of such certificates and cheque on behalf of the Corporation or by
Dutchco, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be
payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total
Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent
that the same is represented by such share certificates and cheque (less any
tax required and in fact deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the
proper tax authority), unless such cheque is not paid on due presentation. To
the extent that the amount of tax required to be deducted or withheld from any
payment to a holder of Exchangeable Shares exceeds the cash portion of such
payment, the Corporation or Dutchco, as the case may be, is hereby authorized
to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market value such portion of the
property then payable to the holder as is necessary to provide sufficient
funds to the Corporation in order to enable it to comply with such deduction
or withholding requirement and shall give an accounting to the holder with
respect thereto and any balance of such proceeds of sale.
 
  6.5 On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of
the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect
thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total
Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon
presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price,
as the case may be, shall not be made, in which case the rights of such holder
shall remain unaffected until the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase
Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided.
On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that
presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total Retraction
Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so
redeemed by the Corporation or purchased by Dutchco shall thereafter be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the Parent Common
Shares delivered to it.
 
  6.6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6, the Corporation
shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares
would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable
law. If the Corporation believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be
permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered
for redemption on such date, and provided that Dutchco shall not have
exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the
Corporation shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a
holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number that may be
so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be
contrary to such provisions and shall notify the holder at least two Business
Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares which
will not be redeemed by the Corporation. In any case in which the redemption
by the Corporation of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency
requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the 
 
                                      36
<PAGE>
 

Corporation shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with Section 6.2 of
these share provisions on a pro rata basis and shall issue to each holder of
Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the expense of the Corporation,
representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to
Section 6.2 hereof. Provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the
holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7 hereof, the holder of any such
Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6.2 of
these share provisions as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law
shall be deemed by giving the Retraction Request to require Dutchco to purchase
such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter on payment by Dutchco to such holder of the Purchase
Price for each such Retracted Share, all as more specifically provided in the
Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.
 
  6.7 A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the
holder to the Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request in
which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater
certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell
the Retracted Shares to Dutchco shall be deemed to have been revoked.
 
                                   ARTICLE 7
 
             Redemption of Exchangeable Shares by the Corporation
 
  7.1 Subject to applicable law, and subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the
Redemption Call Right, (a) the Corporation shall on the Automatic Redemption
Date redeem (the "Automatic Redemption") the whole of the then outstanding
Exchangeable Shares for an amount per share equal to (i) the Current Market
Price of a Parent Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Automatic
Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation causing
to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one Parent Common Share
for each Exchangeable Share held by such holder, plus (ii) an additional
amount equivalent to the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends
thereon and all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares which have not been
declared on such Exchangeable Shares in accordance with Section 3.1 of these
share provisions (collectively the "Redemption Price", provided that if the
record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the
Redemption Date, the Redemption Price shall not include such additional amount
equivalent to such dividends), and (b) the Corporation may, at any time when
the Corporation reasonably determines that Exchangeable Shares are "held of
record" (as such term is defined in Rule 12g5-1 promulgated under the United
States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) by
500 or more persons ("Record Holders"), redeem (a "Section 12(g) Redemption")
that portion of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares held by that number
of Record Holders equal to the difference of (A) the total number of Record
Holders and (B) 499, or such smaller number that the Corporation reasonably
determines is necessary to take the position that it need not register the
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the identity
of such Record Holders to be determined by the Corporation by lot or other fair
method of random determination, for an amount per share equal to the Redemption
Price.
 
  7.2 In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 7,
the Corporation shall, at least 120 days before the Automatic Redemption Date
(in the case of the Automatic Redemption), or at least 30 days before the date
of a Section 12(g) Redemption (a "Section 12(g) Redemption Date"; the
Automatic Redemption Date or a Section 12(g) Redemption Date, as applicable,
being referred to in this Section 7.2 as a "Redemption Date"), send or cause
to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed a notice in
writing of the redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Dutchco under
the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held
by such holder. Such notice shall set out the formula for determining the
Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be,
the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call
Right. On or after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by Dutchco
of the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered to
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price
(less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the
Corporation) for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender
 
                                      37
<PAGE>
 

at the head office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Corporation and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require.
Payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall be
made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the
securities register of the Corporation or by holding for pick up by the holder
at the head office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice, on behalf of the
Corporation of certificates representing Parent Common Shares (which shares
shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and
clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and a cheque of the Corporation
payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in respect of
the additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all declared and unpaid
dividends and all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares which have not
been declared on such Exchangeable Shares in accordance with Section 3.1 of
these share provisions comprising part of the total Redemption Price (less any
tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Corporation). On and
after the Redemption Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for
redemption shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not
be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other
than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption
Price, unless payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable
Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the
holders shall remain unaffected until the total Redemption Price has been paid
in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at
any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem Exchangeable
Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption
Price of the Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, or of such of the
said Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date
of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with
such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust
company in Canada named in such notice. Upon the later of such deposit being
made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Shares in respect whereof such
deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders
thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price
(less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the
Corporation) for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation
and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in
accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the
total Redemption Price, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall
thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the
Parent Common Shares delivered to them. To the extent that the amount of tax
required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder of
Exchangeable Shares exceeds the cash portion of such payment, the Corporation
is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market value such
portion of the property then payable to the holder as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to the Corporation in order to enable it to comply with such
deduction or withholding requirement and shall give an accounting to the
holder with respect thereto and any balance of such proceeds of sale.

  7.3 Dutchco shall have the overriding right (the "Redemption Call Right"),
notwithstanding the proposed redemption of Exchangeable Shares by the
Corporation pursuant to this Article 7 of these share provisions, to purchase
from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares to be
redeemed on the Redemption Date, all but not less than all of the Exchangeable
Shares held by each such holder on payment by Dutchco to the holder of an
amount per share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a Parent Common
Share on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date which shall be
satisfied in full by causing to be delivered to such holder one Parent Common
Share plus (b) an additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all
dividends declared and unpaid on such Exchangeable Share and all dividends
declared on Parent Common Shares that have not been declared on such
Exchangeable Share in accordance with Section 3.1 of these share provisions
(collectively the "Redemption Call Purchase Price", provided that if the
record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the
Redemption Date, the Redemption Call Purchase Price shall not include such
additional amount equivalent to such dividends). In the event of the exercise
of the Redemption Call Right by Dutchco, each holder shall be obligated to
sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder and otherwise 
 
                                      38
<PAGE>
 

to be redeemed to Dutchco on the Redemption Date on payment by Dutchco to the
holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share.
 
  7.4 To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Dutchco must notify the Transfer
Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Corporation of
Dutchco's intention to exercise such right at least 125 days before the
Automatic Redemption Date (in the case of the Automatic Redemption) or at
least 35 days before the Section 12(g) Redemption Date (in the case of Section
12(g) Redemption). The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Dutchco has exercised the Redemption
Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may
be exercised by Dutchco. If Dutchco exercises the Redemption Call Right, on
the Redemption Date, Dutchco will purchase and the holders will sell all of
the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed for a price per share equal to the
Redemption Call Purchase Price.
 
  7.5 For the purposes of completing the purchase of Exchangeable Shares
pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, certificates representing the
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deliverable by Dutchco in payment of
the total Redemption Call Purchase Price and a cheque or cheques in the amount
of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price.
Provided that the total Redemption Call Purchase Price has been so deposited
with the Transfer Agent, on and after the Redemption Date the rights of each
holder of Exchangeable Shares so purchased will be limited to receiving such
holder's proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price
payable by Dutchco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of
certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares purchased by Dutchco from
such holder and the holder shall on and after the Redemption Date be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Parent Common
Shares delivered to such holder. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a
certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with
such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer
of Exchangeable Shares under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Corporation
and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on
behalf of Dutchco shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the
Parent Common Shares to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques
of Dutchco payable at par and in Canadian dollars at any branch of the bankers
of Dutchco or of the Corporation in Canada in payment of the remaining
portion, if any, of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price. If Dutchco does
not exercise the Redemption Call Right in the manner described above, on the
Redemption Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the redemption price otherwise payable by the
Corporation in connection with the redemption of Exchangeable Shares pursuant
to this Article 7.
 
                                   ARTICLE 8
 
                           Purchase for Cancellation
 
  8.1 Subject to applicable law and the articles of the Corporation, the
Corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation
all or any part of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at any price by tender to
all the holders of record of Exchangeable Shares then outstanding or through the
facilities of any stock exchange on which the Exchangeable Shares are listed or
quoted at any price per share together with an amount equal to all declared and
unpaid dividends thereon. If in response to an invitation for tenders under the
provisions of this Section 8.1, more Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price
or prices acceptable to the Corporation than the Corporation is prepared to
purchase, the Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Corporation shall be
purchased as nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of shares
tendered by each holder who submits a tender to the Corporation, provided that
when shares are tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall be effected
(disregarding fractions) only with respect to the shares tendered at the price
at which more shares were tendered than the Corporation is prepared to purchase
after the Corporation has purchased all the shares tendered at lower prices. If
only part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate shall be
purchased, a new certificate for the balance of such shares shall be issued at
the expense of the Corporation.

  10.2 Any approval given by the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to add to,
change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition attaching to
the Exchangeable Shares or any other matter requiring the approval or consent
of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have been
sufficiently given if it shall have been given in accordance with applicable
law subject to a minimum requirement that such approval be evidenced by
resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such
resolution at a meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares duly called and held
at which the holders of at least 50% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at
that time are present or represented by proxy; provided that if at any such
meeting the holders of at least 50% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares at
that time are not present or represented by proxy within one-half hour after
the time appointed for such meeting then the meeting shall be adjourned to
such date not less than ten days thereafter and to such time and place as may
be designated by the Chairman of such meeting. At such adjourned meeting the
holders of Exchangeable Shares present or represented by proxy thereat may
transact the business for which the meeting was originally called and a
resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds
of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting shall constitute the
approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares.
 
  10.3 Exchangeable Shares held by Parent, Dutchco or their Affiliates shall
not be included for the purposes of determining a quorum, and shall not vote,
in connection with any approval contemplated by Section 10.2 of these share
provisions.

of the Class B Shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, the balance
of shares represented by such certificate shall be governed by the provisions
of Section 5.1 of these share provisions relating to the Class B Shares.

4.3  The Company shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to the
relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities
register of the Company for the Class B Shares or at the address specified in
the holder's Class B Retraction Request or by holding for pick up by the holder
at the head office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may
be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of Class B Shares,

claim or encumbrance) registered in the name of the holder or in such other name
as the holder may request in payment of the total Class B Retraction Price and
such delivery of such certificates on behalf of the Company or by the Transfer
Agent shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all
liability for the total Class B Retraction Price to the extent that the same is
represented by such share certificates. All Class B Shares which have been so
retracted shall be cancelled.

4.4  As of the Class B Retraction Time, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall
cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right
to receive his proportionate part of the total Class B Retraction Price.

4.5  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4, the Company shall
not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares (i)
would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law
or (ii) would cause the aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares issuable on
retraction to exceed the Maximum Number. If the Company believes that at the
Class B Retraction Time it would not be permitted by the foregoing to redeem the
Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, the Company shall only be
obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Class B
Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number of shares that may be so
redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to
such provisions or the maximum number of Exchangeable Shares as would not exceed

case in which the redemption by the Company of Retracted Shares would be
contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law or
would cause the Exchangeable Shares to be issued to exceed the Maximum Number,
the Company shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with Section 4.2 of
these share provisions on a pro rata basis.

4.6  A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder
to the Company at the head office of Discreet on behalf of the Company or of the
Company, not less than two Business Days immediately preceding the Class B
Retraction Time, withdraw its Class B Retraction Request in which event such
Class B Retraction Request shall be null and void.

4.7  No certificates or scrip representing fractional Exchangeable Shares shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to Section
4.3 hereof and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital structure
of Parent shall relate to any such fractional security and such fractional
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to exercise any rights
as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional securities, each
person entitled to a fractional interest in an Exchangeable Share will receive
from the Company an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
average of the closing price for the Parent Common Shares on Nasdaq as of each
of the thirty (30) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective
Date as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or other reliable financial newspaper
or publication. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a "trading day"
means a day on which trading generally takes place on Nasdaq and on which
trading in Parent Common Shares has occurred.

4.8  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Discreet Common Shares in
respect of which a Class B Retraction Request has been duly made prior to the
Class B Retraction Time but which is not registered in the transfer records of
Discreet prior to the Effective Date, a certificate representing the proper
number of Exchangeable Shares may be issued to a transferee if the certificate
representing such Discreet Common Shares is presented to the Transfer Agent,
together with a Class B Retraction Request executed by the transferee
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer.

stolen or destroyed, the Transfer Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, certificates representing Exchangeable Shares
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Section 4.
When authorizing such issuance in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the person to whom certificates representing Exchangeable Shares
are to be issued shall, at the discretion of the Company, as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the Company in
such sum as the Company may direct or otherwise indemnify the Company in a
manner satisfactory to the Company against any claim that may be made against
the Company with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

4.10  A Class B Retraction Request executed by a holder of Discreet Common
Shares in respect of Class B Shares to be issued upon the Amalgamation shall be
deemed for all purposes to constitute a good and valid Class B Retraction
Request executed by a holder of Class B Shares. Any notice by Discreet to a
holder of Discreet Common Shares in respect of Class B Shares to be issued upon
the Amalgamation shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute good and valid
notice by the Company to the holders of Class B Shares. Any notice by a holder
of Discreet Common Shares to Discreet in respect of Class B Shares to be issued
upon the Amalgamation shall be deemed for all purposes of these share provisions
to constitute good and valid notice by a holder of Class B Shares to the
Company.

5.   Automatic Conversion of Class B Shares

5.1  Immediately following the Class B Retraction Time (the "Class B Conversion
Time") each Class B Share then outstanding shall, automatically and without any
further action required on the part of either the Company or the holder of the
Class B Share, be converted into a unit consisting of one fully paid and non-
assessable Class E Share and one fully paid and non-assessable Class F Share
whereupon each such Class B Share will be cancelled, and the name of each holder
thereof shall be removed from the register of holders of Class B Shares and
added to the registers of holders of Class E Shares and Class F Shares
accordingly.

5.2  No certificates shall be issued by the Company representing the Class E
Shares and the Class F Shares. The certificates representing the Class B Shares
shall continue to represent an equal number of Class E and Class F Shares. On
and after the Class B Conversion Time, the holders of the Class B Shares so
converted shall cease to be holders

cancellation all or any part of the outstanding Class D Shares at any price by
tender to all the holders of record of Class D Shares then outstanding or
through the facilities of any stock exchange on which Class D Shares are listed
or quoted at any price per share. If in response to an invitation for tenders
under the provisions hereof, more Class D Shares are tendered at a price or
prices acceptable to the Company than the Company is prepared to purchase, Class
D Shares to be purchased by the Company shall be purchased as nearly as may be
pro rata according to the number of shares tendered by each holder who submits a
tender to the Company, provided that when shares are tendered at different
prices, the pro rating shall be effected (disregarding fractions) only with
respect to the shares tendered at the price at which more shares were tendered
than the Company is prepared to purchase after the Company has purchased all the
shares tendered at lower prices. If part only of the Class D Shares represented
by any certificate shall be purchased, a new certificate for the balance of such

4.1  Subject to applicable law, and subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the

following the Class B Conversion Time (the "Class E Redemption Time") without
notice to the holders of the Class E Shares, but with prior notice to Dutchco,

securities register of the Company or by holding for pick up by the holder at
the head office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may
be specified by the Company, on behalf of the Company of certificates
representing Parent Common Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully
paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or
encumbrance) (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by
the Company). At and after the Class E Redemption Time, the holders of the
Class E Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such Class E
Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in
respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of
the total Class E Redemption Price, unless payment of the total Class E
Redemption Price for such Class E Shares shall not be made upon presentation
and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in
which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total
Class E Redemption Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided.
Subject to the exercise of the Class E Redemption Call Right, the Company
shall have the right at any time to deposit or cause to be deposited the total
Class E Redemption Price of the Class E Shares so called for redemption, or of
such of the said Class E Shares represented by certificates that have not at
the date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection
with such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust
company in Canada or the United States. Upon the later of such deposit being
made and the Class E Redemption Time, the Class E Shares in respect whereof
such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the
holders thereof after such deposit or Class E Redemption Time, as the case may
be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Class
E Redemption Price (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom by the Company) for such Class E Shares so deposited, against
presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them,
respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment
or deposit of the total Class E Redemption Price, the holders of the Class E
Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be
holders of the Parent Common Shares delivered to them.

4.3  Dutchco shall have the overriding right (the "Class E Redemption Call
Right"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of Class E Shares by the
Company, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Class E
Shares to be redeemed at the Class E Redemption Time, all but not less than all
of the Class E Shares held by each such holder on payment by Dutchco to the

delivered to such holder 0.165 of one Parent Common Share (the "Class E
Redemption Call Purchase Price"). In the event of the exercise of the Class E
Redemption Call Right by Dutchco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all
the Class E Shares held by the holder and otherwise to be redeemed to Dutchco
at the Class E Redemption Time on payment by Dutchco to the holder of the
Class E Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share.

4.4  To exercise the Class E Redemption Call Right, Dutchco must notify the
Company of Dutchco's intention to exercise such right prior to the Class E
Redemption Time (which notice may be given to Discreet on behalf of the
Company). If Dutchco exercises the Class E Redemption Call Right, Dutchco will,
at the Class E Redemption Time, purchase and the holders will sell all of the
Class E Shares to be redeemed for a price per share equal to the Class E
Redemption Call Purchase Price. Any notice by Dutchco to Discreet for and on
behalf of the Company shall be deemed to constitute good and valid notice by
Dutchco to the Company.

4.5  For the purposes of completing the purchase of Class E Shares pursuant to
the Class E Redemption Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, at or before the Class E Redemption Time, certificates representing the
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deliverable by Dutchco in payment of
the total Class E Redemption Call Purchase Price and a cheque or cheques in the
amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Class E Redemption Call
Purchase Price. Provided that the total Class E Redemption Call Purchase Price
has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, at and after the Class E
Redemption Time the rights of each holder of Class E Shares so purchased will be
limited to receiving such holder's proportionate part of the total Class E
Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Dutchco upon presentation and
surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Class E Shares
purchased by Dutchco from such holder and the holder shall at and after the
Class E Redemption Time be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the

Redemption Call Right in the manner described herein, at the Class E
Redemption Time the holders of the Class E Shares will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the redemption price otherwise payable by the Company in
connection with the redemption of Class E Shares.

4.6  No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Common Shares shall
be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to Sections
4.2 or 4.5 hereof and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital
structure of Parent shall relate to any such fractional security and such
fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to exercise
any rights as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional
securities, each person entitled to a fractional interest in a Parent Common
Share will receive from the Company or Dutchco, as the case may be, an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product
of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing price for
the Parent Common Shares on Nasdaq as of each of the thirty (30) consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the Effective Date as quoted in The Wall
Street Journal or other reliable financial newspaper or publication. For the
purposes of the preceding sentence, a "trading day" means a day on which trading

Redemption Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Class E Redemption Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Class E Redemption Time represented
Class E Shares that were redeemed or purchased pursuant to these Class E Share
provisions, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof, unless and until the holder of
record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with
Sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof, as the case may be. Subject to applicable law, at
the time of such surrender of any such certificate there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares
without interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
Parent Common Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.6
hereof, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Class E Redemption Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
Parent Common Share and (iii) the amount of dividends or other distributions

4.9  In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Date
represented outstanding Discreet Common Shares that were converted to Class B
Shares on the Amalgamation and subsequently converted into Class E Shares at the
Class B Conversion Time shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Transfer Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, certificates representing Parent Common
Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and any cash
pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof) deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with Sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof. When authorizing such issuance
and/or payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
person to whom certificates representing Parent Common Shares are to be issued
shall, at the discretion of the Company or Dutchco, as the case may be, as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the

Dutchco with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or

Provisions, the Company may at any time and from time to time purchase for
cancellation all or any part of the outstanding Class E Shares at any price by
tender to all the holders of record of Class E Shares then outstanding or
through the facilities of any stock exchange on which Class E Shares are listed
or quoted at any price per share. If in response to an invitation for tenders
under the provisions hereof, more Class E Shares are tendered at a price or
prices acceptable to the Company than the Company is prepared to purchase, Class
E Shares to be purchased by the Company shall be purchased as nearly as may be
pro rata according to the number of shares tendered by each holder who submits a
tender to the Company, provided that when shares are tendered at different
prices, the pro rating shall be effected (disregarding fractions) only with
respect to the shares tendered at the price at which more shares were tendered
than the Company is prepared to purchase after the Company has purchased all the
shares tendered at lower prices. If only part of the Class E Shares represented
by any certificate shall be purchased, a new certificate for the balance of such
shares shall be issued at the expense of the Company. Subject as aforesaid, the
Company may effect such purchase for cancellation without purchasing for
cancellation shares of any other Class of shares of the Company.

Dutchco of the Class F Redemption Call Right, the Company shall cause to be
delivered to the holders of the Class F Shares to be redeemed the Class F
Redemption Price (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by

Class F Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such Class F
Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in
respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the
total Class F Redemption Price, unless payment of the total Class F Redemption
Price for such Class F Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender
of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the
rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Class F Redemption
Price has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. Subject to the exercise
of the Class F Redemption Call Right by Dutchco, the Company shall have the
right at any time to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Class F
Redemption Price of the Class F Shares so called for redemption, or of such of
the said Class F Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of
such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such
redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in
Canada or the United States. Upon the later of such deposit being made and the
Class F Redemption Time, the Class F Shares in respect whereof such deposit
shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof
after such deposit or Class F Redemption Time, as the case may be, shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Class F Redemption
Price (less any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the
Company) for such Class F Shares so deposited, against presentation and
surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance
with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Class F
Redemption Price, the holders of the Class F Shares shall thereafter be
considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Parent Common Shares
delivered to them.

4.3  Dutchco shall have the overriding right (the "Class F Redemption Call
Right"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of Class F Shares by the
Company, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Class F
Shares to be redeemed at the Class F Redemption Time, all but not less than all
of the Class F Shares held by each such holder on payment by Dutchco to the
holder of an amount per share equal to the Current Market Price of 0.165 of one
Parent Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Class F Redemption
Time which shall be satisfied in full by causing to be delivered to such holder
0.165 of one Parent Common Share (the "Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price").
In the event of the exercise of the Class F Redemption Call Right by Dutchco,
each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Class F Shares held by the holder
and otherwise to be redeemed to Dutchco at the Class F Redemption Time on
payment by Dutchco to the holder of the Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price
for each such share.

4.4  To exercise the Class F Redemption Call Right, Dutchco must notify the
Company of Dutchco's intention to exercise such right prior to the Class F
Redemption Time (which notice may be given to Discreet on behalf of the
Company). If Dutchco exercises the Class F Redemption Call Right, Dutchco will,
at the Class F Redemption Time, purchase and the holders will sell all of the
Class F Shares to be redeemed for a price per share equal to the Class F
Redemption Call Purchase Price. Any notice by Dutchco to Discreet for and on
behalf of the Company shall be deemed to constitute good and valid notice by
Dutchco to the Company.

4.5  For the purposes of completing the purchase of Class F Shares pursuant to
the Class F Redemption Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, at or before the Class F Redemption Time, certificates representing the
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deliverable by Dutchco in payment of
the total Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price and a cheque or cheques in the
amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Class F Redemption Call
Purchase Price. Provided that the total Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price
has been so deposited with the Transfer Agent, at and after the Class F
Redemption Time the rights of each holder of Class F Shares so purchased will be
limited to receiving such holder's proportionate part of the total Class F
Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Dutchco upon presentation and
surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Class F Shares
purchased by Dutchco from such holder and the holder shall at and after the
Class F Redemption Time be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the

the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Class F Shares,
together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect
a transfer of Class F Shares under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Company
and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on
behalf of Dutchco shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the
Parent Common Shares to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of
or on behalf of Dutchco payable at par and in Canadian dollars at any branch of
the bankers of Dutchco or of the Company in Canada in payment of the remaining
portion, if any, of the total Class F Redemption Call Purchase Price. If Dutchco
does not exercise the Class F Redemption Call Right in the manner described
herein, at the Class F Redemption Time the holders of the Class F Shares will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the redemption price otherwise payable
by the Company in connection with the redemption of Class F Shares.

be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to Sections
4.2 or 4.5 hereof and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital
structure of Parent shall relate to any such fractional security and such
fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to exercise
any rights as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional
securities, each person entitled to a fractional interest in a Parent Common

of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing price for

purposes of the preceding sentence, a "trading day" means a day on which trading
generally takes place on Nasdaq and on which trading in Parent Common Shares has
occurred.

4.7  No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Class F
Redemption Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Class F Redemption Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which immediately prior to the Class F Redemption Date represented
Class F Shares that were redeemed or purchased pursuant to these Class F Share
provisions, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof, unless and until the holder of
record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with
Sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof, as the case may be. Subject to applicable law, at
the time of such surrender of any such certificate there shall be paid to the
record holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares
without interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
Parent Common Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.6
hereof, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Class F Redemption Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
Parent Common Share and (iii) the amount of dividends or other distributions

Transfer Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect

4.9  In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Date
represented outstanding Discreet Common Shares that were converted to Class B
Shares on the Amalgamation and subsequently converted into Class F Shares at the
Class B Conversion Time shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Transfer Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, certificates representing Parent Common
Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and any cash
pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof) deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with Sections 4.2 or 4.5 hereof. When authorizing such issuance
and/or payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
person to whom certificates representing Parent Common Shares are to be issued
shall, at the discretion of the Company or Dutchco, as the case may be, as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to the
Company or Dutchco, as the case may be, in such sum as the Company or Dutchco
may direct or otherwise indemnify the Company or Dutchco in a manner
satisfactory to the Company or the Dutchco, as the case may be, against any
claim that may be made against the Company or Dutchco with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

4.10  The Company and Dutchco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Class F Redemption Price or the Class F Redemption Call Price, as the case may
be, payable pursuant to these Class F Share Provisions to any holder of Class F
Shares such amounts as Parent, Dutchco or the Transfer Agent determine is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Income Tax Act
(Canada) or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent
any amount is required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder,
the Company, the Affiliate or Dutchco, as the case may be, are hereby authorized
to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market value such portion of such
consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to the Company, the

holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to recover by action or other
legal process against the Company any dividend that is represented by a cheque
that has not been duly presented to the Company's bankers for payment or that
otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six years from the date on which
such dividend was payable.

     (a)  pay any dividends on the Class A Shares, the Class B Shares, the Class

          Shares, Class E Shares and Class F Shares or any other shares ranking

          of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or

          Exchangeable Shares or as contemplated by the Support Agreement.

The restrictions in Sections 4.1(a), 4.1(b) and 4.1(c) above shall not apply if
all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares corresponding to dividends
declared following the initial date of issue of Exchangeable Shares on the
Parent Common Shares shall have been declared on the Exchangeable Shares and
paid in full.

distribution of any part of the assets of the Company among the holders of the

of a Parent Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date,
which shall be satisfied in full by the Company causing to be delivered to such
holder one Parent Common Share, plus (b) an additional amount equivalent to the
full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share
and all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares which have not been declared

provisions (collectively the "Liquidation Amount", provided that if the record
date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the
Liquidation Date, the Liquidation Amount shall not include such additional
amount equivalent to such dividends).

5.2  On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the exercise by
Dutchco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Company shall cause to be delivered
to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount (less any tax
required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Company) for each such

part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless payment of the total Liquidation
Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and
surrender of share certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in
which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total
Liquidation Amount has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The
Company shall have the right at any time after the Liquidation Date to deposit
or cause to be deposited the total Liquidation Amount in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the Liquidation
Date been surrendered by the holders thereof in a custodial account with any
chartered bank or trust company in Canada. Upon such deposit being made, the
rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited
to receiving their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount (less any
tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom) for such Exchangeable Shares
so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held
by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such
payment or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes
to be the holders of the Parent Common Shares delivered to them. To the extent
that the amount of tax required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a
holder of Exchangeable Shares exceeds the cash portion of such payment, the
Company is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market
value such portion of the property then payable to the holder as is necessary to

an additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all dividends declared and
unpaid on such Exchangeable Share and all dividends declared on Parent Common
Shares which have not been declared on such Exchangeable Shares in accordance

Purchase Price", provided that if the record date for any such declared and
unpaid dividends occurs on or after the Liquidation Date, the Liquidation Call
Purchase Price shall not include such additional amount equivalent to such

Dutchco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held
by the holder to Dutchco on the Liquidation Date on payment by Dutchco to the
holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such share.

5.5  To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Dutchco must notify the Transfer
Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Company of
Dutchco's intention to exercise such right at least sixty days before the
Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up of the Company and at least five Business Days before the Liquidation Date in
the case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the
Company. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to
whether or not Dutchco has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after
the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Dutchco. If
Dutchco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, on the Liquidation Date, Dutchco
will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then
outstanding for a price per share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase Price.

pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, certificates representing the
aggregate number of Parent Common Shares deliverable by Dutchco in payment of
the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price and a cheque or cheques in the amount

is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Dutchco payable at par and in Canadian

payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Call Purchase
Price. If Dutchco does not exercise the Liquidation Call Right in the manner
described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares

payable by the Company in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or

6.1  A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time, subject to
applicable law and the exercise by Dutchco of the Retraction Call Right (as
defined in Subsection (c) below) and otherwise upon compliance with the
provisions of this Article 6, to require the Company to redeem any or all of the
Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per
share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a Parent Common Share on the last
Business Day prior to the Retraction Date, which shall be satisfied in full by
the Company causing to be delivered to such holder one Parent Common Share for
each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder, plus (b) an
additional amount equivalent to the full amount of all dividends declared and
unpaid thereon and all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares which have not
been declared on such Exchangeable Shares in accordance with Section 3.1 of
these share provisions (collectively the "Retraction Price", provided that if
the record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after

amount equivalent to such dividends). To effect such redemption, the holder
shall present and surrender at the head office of the Company or at any office

     (b)  the Retraction Date shall be three Business Days after the date of
          receipt by the Company or the Transfer Agent of notice of the Transfer
          Attempt (or such lesser period as the Company may permit);

     (c)  the holder shall be deemed to have acknowledged the overriding
          Redemption Call Right and the Retraction Call Right.

     In accordance with the deemed Retraction Request, no certificates shall be
issued by the Company representing the Transferred Shares in the name of the
transferee, and the sole right of the transferee in respect of the Transferred
Shares shall be to receive the Parent Common Shares to which such person is
entitled as a result of the Retraction Notice.

6.2  Subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the Retraction Call Right, upon
receipt by the Company or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in Section
6.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing the number of
Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Company redeem,
together with a Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction Request is
not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7 hereof, the
Company shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business on
the Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder the total
Retraction Price with respect to such shares. If only a part of the Exchangeable
Shares represented by any certificate are redeemed (or purchased by Dutchco
pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate for the balance of
such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the
Company.

6.3  Upon receipt by the Company of a Retraction Request, the Company shall
immediately notify Dutchco and Parent thereof. In order to exercise the
Retraction Call Right, Parent or Dutchco must notify the Company in writing of
Dutchco's determination to do so (the "Parent (Dutchco) Call Notice") within two
Business Days of notification to Parent and Dutchco by the Company of the
receipt by the Company of the Retraction Request. If the Parent or Dutchco does
not so notify the Company within such two Business Day period, the Company will
notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that Dutchco will not exercise
the Retraction Call Right. If Parent or Dutchco delivers the Parent (Dutchco)
Call Notice within such two Business Day time period, and provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 6.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only to be an
offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Dutchco in accordance with
the Retraction Call Right. In such event, the Company shall not redeem the
Retracted Shares and Dutchco shall purchase

the Retracted Shares for a purchase price (the "Purchase Price") per share equal
to the Retraction Price per share. For the purposes of completing a purchase
pursuant to the Retraction Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer
Agent, on or before the Retraction Date, certificates representing Parent Common
Shares and a cheque in the amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total
Purchase Price. Provided that the total Purchase Price has been so deposited
with the Transfer Agent, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted
Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as
at the close of business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no
redemption by the Company of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the
Retraction Date. In the event that neither Parent nor Dutchco delivers a Parent
(Dutchco) Call Notice within such two Business Day period, and provided that
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 6.7, the Company shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the Retraction
Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Article 6.

Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the holder
recorded in the securities register of the Company for the Exchangeable Shares
or at the address specified in the holder's Retraction Request or by holding for
pick up by the holder at the head office of the Company or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company by notice to the holders of
Exchangeable Shares, certificates representing the Parent Common Shares (which
shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free
and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) registered in the name of the
holder or in such other name as the holder may request in payment of the total
Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, and a cheque
of the Company payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Company in
payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Retraction Price (less
any tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Company) or a
cheque of Dutchco payable at par and in Canadian dollars at any branch of the
bankers of Dutchco or of the Company in Canada in payment of the remaining
portion, if any, of the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, and such
delivery of such certificates and cheque on behalf of the Company or by Dutchco,
as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment of
and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total Retraction Price or
total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent that the same is
represented by such share certificates and cheque (less any tax required and in

authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at fair market value such portion of
the property then payable to the holder as is necessary to provide sufficient
funds to the Company in order to enable it to comply with such deduction or
withholding requirement and shall give an accounting to the holder with respect
thereto and any balance of such proceeds of sale.

6.5  On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of
the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect
thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total
Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon
presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price,
as the case may be, shall not be made, in which case the rights of such holder
shall remain unaffected until the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase
Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On
and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that
presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total Retraction
Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so
redeemed by the Company or purchased by Dutchco shall thereafter be considered

to it.

6.6  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6, the Company shall
not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares would
be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law. If
the Company believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted by
any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on
such date, and provided that Dutchco shall not have exercised the Retraction
Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Company shall only be
obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction
Request to the extent of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded
down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions
and shall notify the holder at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction

is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7 hereof, the
holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.2 of these share provisions as a result of solvency requirements of
applicable law shall be deemed by giving the Retraction Request to require
Dutchco to purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment by Dutchco to such holder
of the Purchase Price for each such Retracted Share, all as more specifically
provided in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.

6.7  A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder
to the Company before the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request in which event
such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater certainty, the
revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell the Retracted
Shares to Dutchco shall be deemed to have been revoked.

7.   Redemption of Exchangeable Shares by the Company

7.1  Subject to applicable law, and subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the
Redemption Call Right, (a) the Company shall on the Automatic Redemption Date
redeem (the "Automatic Redemption") the whole of the then outstanding
Exchangeable Shares for an amount per share equal to (i) the Current Market
Price of a Parent Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Automatic
Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by the Company causing to be
delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one Parent Common Share for each
Exchangeable Share held by such holder, plus (ii) an additional amount
equivalent to the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends thereon and
all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares which have not been declared on
such Exchangeable Shares in accordance with Section 3.1 of these share
provisions (collectively the "Redemption Price", provided that if the record
date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after the
Redemption Date, the Redemption Price shall not include such additional amount
equivalent to such dividends), and (b) the Company may, at any time when the
Company reasonably determines that Exchangeable Shares are "held of record" (as
such term is defined in Rule 12g5-1 promulgated under the United States
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) by 500 or more

of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares held by that number of Record
Holders equal to the difference of (A) the total number of Record Holders and

pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the identity of such Record
Holders to be determined by the Company by lot or other fair method of random
determination, for an amount per share equal to the Redemption Price.

7.2  In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 7,
the Company shall, at least 120 days before the Automatic Redemption Date (in
the case of the Automatic Redemption), or at least 30 days before the date of a
Section 12(g) Redemption (a "Section 12(g) Redemption Date"; the Automatic
Redemption Date or a Section 12(g) Redemption Date, as applicable, being
referred to in this Section 7.2 as a "Redemption Date"), send or cause to be
sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed a notice in writing of
the redemption by the Company or the purchase by Dutchco under the Redemption
Call Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder.
Such notice shall set out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or
the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and,
if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right. On or after the
Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by Dutchco of the Redemption Call
Right, the Company shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price (less any tax required
to be deducted and withheld therefrom by the Company) for each such Exchangeable
Share upon presentation and surrender at the head office of the Company or at
any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Company in such
notice of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with
such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of
Exchangeable Shares under the Quebec Act and the by-laws of the Company and such

in the securities register of the Company or by holding for pick up by the
holder at the head office of the Company or at any office of the Transfer Agent
as may be specified by the Company in such notice, on behalf of the Company of

Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of
holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate
part of the total Redemption Price, unless payment of the total Redemption Price
for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender

Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total
Redemption Price of the Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption, or of such
of the said Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the
date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with
such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust

deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders
thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price

such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the
said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Redemption Price, the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be holders of the Parent Common Shares delivered to them. To the
extent that the amount of tax required to be deducted or withheld from any
payment to a holder of Exchangeable Shares exceeds the cash portion of such
payment, the Company is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of at
fair market value such portion of the property then payable to the holder as is
necessary to provide sufficient funds to the Company in order to enable it to
comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and shall give an
accounting to the holder with respect thereto and any balance of such proceeds
of sale.

Market Price of a Parent Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the

the full amount of all dividends declared and unpaid on such Exchangeable Share
and all dividends declared on Parent Common Shares that have not been declared
on such Exchangeable Share in accordance with Section 3.1 of these share
provisions (collectively the "Redemption Call Purchase Price", provided that if
the record date for any such declared and unpaid dividends occurs on or after
the Redemption Date, the Redemption Call Purchase Price shall not include such
additional amount equivalent to such dividends). In the event of the exercise of
the Redemption Call Right by Dutchco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all
the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder and otherwise to be redeemed to
Dutchco on the Redemption Date on payment by Dutchco to the holder of the
Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share.

7.4  To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Dutchco must notify the Transfer
Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and the Company of
Dutchco's intention to exercise such right at least 125 days before the
Automatic Redemption Date (in the case of the Automatic Redemption) or at least
35 days before the Section 12(g) Redemption Date (in the case of Section 12(g)
Redemption). The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares as to whether or not Dutchco has exercised the Redemption Call Right
forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised
by Dutchco. If Dutchco exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption
Date, Dutchco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable
Shares to be redeemed for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call
Purchase Price.

7.5  For the purposes of completing the purchase of Exchangeable Shares pursuant
to the Redemption Call Right, Dutchco shall deposit with the Transfer Agent, on
or before the Redemption Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of
Parent Common Shares deliverable by Dutchco in payment of the total Redemption
Call Purchase Price and a cheque or cheques in the amount of the remaining
portion, if any, of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price. Provided that the
total Redemption Call Purchase Price has been so deposited with the Transfer

record of Exchangeable Shares then outstanding or through the facilities of any
stock exchange on which the Exchangeable Shares are listed or quoted at any
price per share together with an amount equal to all declared and unpaid
dividends thereon. If in response to an invitation for tenders under the
provisions of this Section 8.1, more Exchangeable Shares are tendered at a price
or prices acceptable to the Company than the Company is prepared to purchase,
the Exchangeable Shares to be purchased by the Company shall be purchased as
nearly as may be pro rata according to the number of shares tendered by each
holder who submits a tender to the Company, provided that when shares are
tendered at different prices, the pro rating shall be effected (disregarding
fractions) only with respect to the shares tendered at the price at which more
shares were tendered than the Company is prepared to purchase after the Company
has purchased all the shares tendered at lower prices. If only part of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate shall be purchased, a new
certificate for the balance of such shares shall be issued at the expense of the
