         NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of 
management, necessary to present a fair statement of the condensed 
consolidated financial position at March 5, 1999, and the condensed 
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods 
ended March 5, 1999 and February 27, 1998.

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, 
therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a 
complete presentation of the results of operations, the financial position, 
and cash flows, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe" or the "Company") filed audited 
consolidated financial statements which included all information and 
footnotes necessary for such a presentation of the results of operations, 
financial position and cash flows for the years ended November 27, 1998, 
November 28, 1997, and November 29, 1996, in the Company's 1998 Annual Report 
on Form 10-K.

     The results of operations for the interim period ended March 5, 1999, 
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full 
year.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

     During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement 
of Position (SOP) 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." The Company modified 
certain aspects of its business model such that the impact of SOP 97-2 was 
not significant.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive 
Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying 
comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. It does 
not, however, require a specific format for the disclosure but requires the 
Company to display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the 
period in its financial statements.

NOTE 4.  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES (CONTINUED)

     Lease termination costs include remaining lease liabilities, brokerage 
fees, and legal fees offset by estimated sublease income related primarily to 
facilities in San Jose, California that were vacated as part of the 
restructuring program. As of March 5, 1999, $2.7 million of lease termination 
costs, net of anticipated sublease income, remains accrued and is expected to 
be utilized by the third quarter of fiscal 1999.

     As of March 5, 1999, the remaining accrual in canceled contracts of $0.9 
million is expected to be fully paid by the first quarter of fiscal 2000 in 
accordance with the settlement agreement.

     Other charges relate to legal fees associated with the divestiture of 
two business units and employee terminations as part of the severance 
program. The remaining $0.3 million accrual as of March 5, 1999 is expected 
to be paid by the third quarter of fiscal 1999.

     As of March 5, 1999, approximately $2.7 million in accrued restructuring 
costs remain related to lease termination costs primarily in Europe resulting 
from the mergers with Aldus and Frame in fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1995, 
respectively.

NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

     In September 1997, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject 
to certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to 15.0 million 
shares of the Company's common stock over a two-year period. This new stock 
repurchase program was in addition to an existing program whereby the Company 
has been authorized to repurchase shares to offset issuances under employee 
stock option and stock purchase plans. The Company repurchased approximately 
1.7 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 and 10.5 million 
shares in fiscal 1998, at a cost of $69.9 million and $379.2 million, 
respectively under its stock repurchase programs. As of March 5, 1999, there 
are no remaining authorized shares to be repurchased under the 15.0 million 
share repurchase program.

     PUT WARRANTS AND CALL OPTIONS

     To facilitate the Company's stock repurchase programs, the Company sold 
put warrants to independent third parties. Each warrant entitles the holder 
to sell one share of Adobe's common stock to the Company at a specified 
price. On March 5, 1999, put warrants to sell approximately 779,500 shares of 
the Company's common stock were outstanding that expire on various dates 
through July 1999 with an average exercise price of $42.41 per share. Under 
these put warrant arrangements, the Company, at its option,

can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference 
between the exercise price and market value at the date of exercise; 
therefore the put warrants do not result in a liability on the balance sheet.

     In addition, the Company purchased call options from independent third 
parties that entitle the Company to buy its common stock on certain dates at 
specified prices. On March 5, 1999, call options to purchase approximately 
239,100 of the Company's common stock were outstanding that expire on various 
dates through July 1999 with an average exercise price of $44.47 per share.

Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average common shares
outstanding for the period plus dilutive common equivalent shares, including
unvested restricted common stock, stock options using the treasury stock method,
and put warrants using the reverse treasury stock method.

NOTE 8. ACQUISITIONS

     On January 4, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the 
assets, consisting of intellectual property and a minimal amount of fixed 
assets, of both GoLive Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and GoLive 
Systems GmbH and Co. KG, a German limited partnership (together "GoLive 
Systems"). GoLive Systems creates Web site development software which enables 
users to effectively use the Internet for professional publishing and 
communication. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of 
accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinions No. 16. 
The purchase price of the acquisition was approximately $31.0 million, plus 
additional contingency payments of $8.0 million based on achieving certain 
technical and employment milestones. The Company determined that certain 
milestones had been reached as of March 5, 1999 and, as such, $4.0 million in 
contingent payments were recorded as purchase price.

</TABLE>

     Total revenue increased $29.1 million, or 14.7%, from the same quarter last
year primarily due to the release of new and enhanced application products.

     During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of
Position (SOP) 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." The Company modified
certain aspects of its business model such that the impact of SOP 97-2 was not
significant.

     First quarter:
         Product revenue--Licensing                             $38.1              $41.8        (9.0)%
         Percentage of total revenue                             16.8%              21.2%
</TABLE>

     Licensing revenue is made up of royalties received from OEM customers 
who ship products containing Adobe's PostScript technology, including Adobe 
PostScript, Adobe PostScript 3, Adobe PrintGear, and PostScript Extreme.

     Licensing revenue decreased $3.8 million, or 9.0%, in the first quarter 
of fiscal 1999 compared to the same period last year primarily due to the 
ongoing weakness in the Japanese personal computer and printer markets, as 
well as the continuing decline in royalty revenue from Hewlett-Packard 
Company's ("HP") desktop monochrome laser printer division which has been 
incorporating a clone version of Adobe PostScript into its products since the 
fall of 1997.

     The Company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue in the 
short term because of Japanese market conditions, the uncertain timing of OEM 
customer introductions of products incorporating Adobe's latest technologies, 
and the remaining impact of the loss of revenue from HP's monochrome laser 
printer products, which is expected to occur in the second half of fiscal 
1999. Exluding any shrinkwrap printing technology products, the Company 
anticipates that its traditional licensing revenue will remain relatively 
flat or decline in fiscal 1999.

     First quarter:
         Product group revenue --
           Application products                             $188.8           $156.0             21.1%
         Percentage of total revenue                          83.2%            78.8%
</TABLE>

     Application products revenue is derived predominantly from shipments of 
application software programs marketed through retail and VAR distribution 
channels, with the exception of Adobe PhotoDeluxe, which is primarily 
distributed through OEM bundling agreements with digital camera, scanner, and 
personal computer manufacturers.

     Application products revenue increased $32.8 million, or 21.1%, in the 
first quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to the same period last year due to a 
number of factors. First, the introduction of GraphicStudio and DynamicStudio 
in North America, Japan and Asia Pacific and Latin America contributed 
significantly to revenue growth. GraphicStudio is a collection of Adobe 
application products, which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, and Pagemaker. 
DynamicStudio is also a suite of products, containing After Effects, 
Premiere, Photoshop, and Illustrator. Second, the first quarter of fiscal 
1999 benefited from revenue related to major upgrades of Photoshop, 
Illustrator, and Premiere, all of which were released in mid-to-late fiscal 
1998. Third, revenue from Acrobat 3.0 increased as demand for the product 
continued to grow. These factors were partially offset by a decline in 
revenue from PageMaker as a result of weakness in the Japanese economy and 
the extended age of the current release. In addition, the increase was offset 
by a decline in revenue from divested businesses of $6.4 million, and a 
decline in PhotoDeluxe Home Edition, which was affected by lower OEM customer 
pricing.

     By comparison, application products revenue for the first quarter of 
fiscal 1998 was adversely affected by weakness in the Japanese economy, the 
absence of major product releases or upgrades, and a resulting decline in 
end-user demand. Further, during the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the 
Company worked proactively with its distributors in Japan to match lower 
sell-through rates, thereby decreasing channel inventory levels in 
anticipation of the new product release cycle.

     Total application products revenue (excluding platform independent and 
UNIX revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 1999 was split 57% on Windows 
and 43% on Macintosh as compared to 59% and 41%, respectively, for the first 
quarter of fiscal 1998.

</TABLE>

     Certain reclassifications that affected both direct costs and operating 
expenses were made to the fiscal 1998 consolidated statements of income to 
conform to the fiscal 1999 presentation. These reclassifications did not 
impact total operating profit for fiscal 1998.

     Direct costs decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to 
the same period last year due to lower material costs as a result of an ongoing
cost improvement program that was implemented in late fiscal 1998, and improved


                                      17

inventory management resulting in lower excess and obsolete inventory expenses.

     The Company anticipates that gross margin throughout fiscal 1999 will be 
between 89%-90%, due to cost reduction efforts in material costs and 
management of excess and obsolete inventory. These reductions may be offset 
by increases in direct costs related to product launches and the amortization 
of capitalized software in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, 
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed," as well as amortization of purchased 
technologies associated with acquired products or technologies.

OPERATING EXPENSES

     Certain reclassifications that affected both direct costs and operating
expenses were made to the fiscal 1998 consolidated statements of income to
conform to the fiscal 1999 presentation. These reclassifications did not impact
total operating profit for fiscal 1998.

     First quarter:

         Percentage of total revenue                          19.8%            21.9%
</TABLE>

     Research and development expenses increased $1.6 million, or 3.6%, 
primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses as the Company's 
financial performance exceeded that of the first quarter of fiscal 1998. In 
addition, the increase was attributable to increased salaries and 
employee-related costs associated with an additional week of operations in 
the first quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to the same period last year.

     The Company believes that investments in research and development, 
including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to 
remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued 
timely development of new and enhanced products. The Company will continue to 
make significant investments in the development of its application software 
products, including those targeted for the growing Internet market. The 
Company expects that research and development expenditures for the remainder 
of fiscal 1999 will increase in absolute dollars. However, such expenditures 
as a percentage of revenue are expected to remain relatively the same as the 
first quarter of fiscal 1999.

</TABLE>

     Sales and marketing expenses increased $7.0 million, or 9.8%, in fiscal 
1999 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased 
salaries and employee-related costs associated with an additional week of 
operations in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, and higher incentive 
compensation expenses as the Company's financial performance exceeded that of 
the first quarter of fiscal 1998. In addition, a portion of the increase was 
attributable to increased advertising and promotional spending for a national 
publishing conference held during the quarter, and the Company's worldwide 
sales meetings also held during the first quarter of fiscal 1999.

         Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute 
dollars to support new products and upgrades scheduled to be released later 
in fiscal 1999. However, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of 
revenue are expected to remain relatively the same as the first quarter of 
fiscal 1998.

</TABLE>

     General and administrative expenses decreased $6.9 million, or 20.7%, in 
fiscal 1999 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower 
facilities costs related to buildings that were vacated in connection with 
the 1998 restructuring program, and a reduction in bad debt expense 
associated with the resolution of disputed items with certain customers and 
an improved economic environment in Asia. Additionally, the decrease was 
attributable to lower amortization of goodwill as the first quarter of fiscal 
1998 included the write-off of goodwill associated with an acquisition that 
took place in fiscal 1997. Further, the Company experienced an overall 
decrease in general and administrative expenses due to cost-cutting measures 
that were implemented as part of the 1998 restructuring program. These 
decreases were partially offset by an increase to salaries and 
employee-related expenses associated with an additional week of operations in 
the first quarter of fiscal 1999, as well as an increase to incentive 
compensation expense as the Company's financial performance exceeded that of 
the first quarter of fiscal 1999.

     The Company expects that general and administrative spending will 
increase in absolute dollars for the remainder of fiscal 1999 to support 
ongoing administrative infrastructure needs. However, as a percentage of 
revenue such expenditures are expected to be lower than the first quarter of 
fiscal 1999.

     During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, gains and losses resulting from
investment activity were minimal. In the first quarter of fiscal 1998, McQueen
International Limited ("McQueen"), a former investee of the Company, was
acquired by Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated ("Sykes"), a publicly traded
company. In connection with the acquisition, the Company exchanged its shares of
McQueen for approximately 487,000 shares of Sykes' restricted common stock and
recorded a gain on the exchange of $6.7 million.

     Also, during the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company liquidated its
investment in Siebel Systems, Incorporated ("Siebel") through the distribution
to its stockholders of approximately 165,000 shares of Siebel as a
dividend-in-kind and the sale of its remaining Siebel shares. A gain was
recognized on the transaction of approximately $5.7 million.

     Interest income decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company believes that in the future its results of operations could be
affected by various factors, such as delays in shipment of the Company's new
products and major new versions of existing products, lack of market acceptance
of new products and upgrades, the introduction of competitive products by third
parties, weakness in demand for Macintosh application software and
Macintosh-related printers, renegotiation of royalty arrangements, growth in
worldwide personal computer and printer sales and sales price adjustments,
consolidation in the OEM printer business, ongoing weakness in the Company's
printing business due to product transitions, industry transitions to new
business and information delivery models, ongoing weakness in the Japanese and
other Asian economies, "Year 2000" issues (as discussed later under "Year 2000
Issues"), and adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the
countries in which the Company does business.

     The Company has stated that in fiscal 1999 its annual revenue growth target
is 15% and its operating margin target is 25% of total revenue. These targets
are used to assist the Company's management in making decisions about the
allocation of resources and investments, not as predictions of future results.
The targets reflect a number of assumptions, including assumptions about the
Company's pricing, manufacturing costs and volumes and the mix of application
products and licensing revenue, full and upgrade products, distribution
channels, and geographic distribution. These and many other factors described
herein affect the Company's financial performance and may cause the Company's
future results, including results for the current quarter, to vary materially
from these targets.

     The Company's ability to develop and market products, including upgrades of
current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs, may also
have an impact on the results of operations. The Company's ability to extend its
core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to
technological changes could affect its ability to develop these products. A
portion of the Company's future revenue will come from these new applications.
Delays in product or upgrade introductions, whether by the Company or its OEM
customers, could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenue, earnings, or
stock price. The Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new
products or upgrades will have on its revenue or results of operations.

     The market for the Company's graphics applications, particularly the
consumer products, is intensely and increasingly competitive and is
significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of
industry competitors. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation has stated its
intention to increase its presence in the digital imaging/graphics market by
mid-1999; the Company believes that, due to Microsoft's market dominance, any
new Microsoft digital imaging products will be highly competitive with the
Company's products. If competing new products achieve widespread acceptance, it
would have a significant adverse impact on the Company's operating results.

     The Company generally offers its application products on Macintosh,
Windows, and UNIX platforms. To the extent that there is a slowdown of customer
purchases of personal computers in general, the Company's operating results
could be materially adversely affected. Also, as the Company seeks to further
broaden its customer base to achieve greater penetration in the corporate
business and consumer markets, the Company may not successfully adapt its
application software distribution channels, which could materially adversely
affect the Company's operating results. The Company could experience decreases
in average selling prices and some transitions in its distribution channels that
could materially adversely affect its operating results.


                                       21

<PAGE>

     The Company's primary distribution channel for its application products 
is currently through retail distributors, and a significant amount of its 
revenue for application products is from a single distributor. In addition, 
the Company continues to expand into third-party distribution channels, 
including value-added resellers and systems integrators, in its effort to 
further broaden its customer base. As a result, the financial health of these 
third parties, and the Company's continuing relationships with them, are 
becoming more important to the Company's success. Some of these companies are 
thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business 
conditions. The Company's financial results could be adversely affected if 
the financial condition of certain of these third parties substantially 
weakens or if the Company's relationships with them deteriorate.

     The Company's printing revenue experienced a 9.0% decline in the first 
quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 1998. If this 
trend continues, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected. 
The weakness in the Japanese market was a factor causing the revenue decline. 
In addition, in the fall of fiscal 1997, HP began to ship a clone version of 
Adobe PostScript in some printers, resulting in lower licensing revenue to 
the Company in fiscal 1998, even though the Company continues to work with HP 
printer operations to incorporate Adobe PostScript and other technologies in 
other HP products. The Company expects continued lower licensing revenue from 
HP in fiscal 1999. Further, OEM customers on occasion seek to renegotiate 
their royalty arrangements. The Company evaluates these requests on a 
case-by-case basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to 
pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for the 
Company.

     Since the end of fiscal 1997, the Company has experienced a decline in both
application and licensing revenue from the Japanese market due to a weak
Japanese computer market and general economic conditions in Japan. In addition,
at the end of fiscal 1997, inventory levels for application products at the
Company's Japanese distributors remained higher than what the Company considers
normal. During fiscal 1998, the Company worked with its major distributors in
Japan to reduce channel inventory to what the Company considers a reasonable
level. The Company expects these adverse economic conditions to continue in the
short term, and they may continue to adversely affect the Company's revenue and
earnings. Although there are also adverse conditions in other Asian and Latin
American economies, the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of
the Company's revenue and thus have less impact on the Company's operational
results.

     The Company has recently implemented a restructuring of its business and
reduced its workforce by more than 10%. However, the Company plans to continue
to invest in certain areas, which will require it to hire additional employees.
Competition for high-quality personnel, especially highly skilled engineers, is
extremely intense. The Company's ability to effectively manage its growth will
require it to continue to improve its operational and financial controls and
information management systems, and to attract, retain, motivate, and manage
employees effectively. The failure of the Company to effectively manage growth
and transition in multiple areas of its business could have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations.

     The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products
addressing authoring and communications over the Internet. As is typical in the
case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently
introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The
software industry addressing authoring and communications over the Internet is
young and has few proven products. Standards defining Web graphics have not yet
been finally adopted. In addition, new models for licensing software will be
needed to accommodate new information delivery practices. 


                                       22

<PAGE>

Moreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet 
(including security, reliability, ease of use and access, cost, and quality 
of service) remain unresolved and may affect the growth of Internet use, 
together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such 
markets.

     The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating
income from its subsidiaries located in Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific and
Latin America. The Company generally experiences lower revenue from its European
operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing
activities in the summer months. Additionally, the Company is uncertain whether
the recent weakness experienced in the Japan and Asia Pacific and Latin America
markets will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency
devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions. While most of the revenue
of the European subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars, the majority of
revenue derived from Japan is denominated in yen and the majority of all
subsidiaries' operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies. As a
result, the Company's operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. To date, the accounting impact of such fluctuations has
been insignificant. The Company's hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of
these risks, based on management's best judgment of the appropriate trade-offs
among risk, opportunity, and expense. The Company has established a hedging
program to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
primarily of the Japanese yen. The Company's hedging program is not
comprehensive, and there can be no assurance that the program will offset more
than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable
movement in foreign currency exchange rates.

     On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European
Union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed
conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro. The
euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions.
Based on its preliminary assessment, the Company does not believe the conversion
will have a material impact on the competitiveness of its products in Europe,
where there already exists substantial price transparency, or increase the
likelihood of contract cancellations. Further, the Company expects that
modifications to comply with euro requirements have been and will continue to be
made to its business operations and systems on a timely basis and does not
believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material adverse impact
on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. There can be no
assurance, however, that the Company will be able to continue to complete such
modifications on a timely basis; any failure to do so could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. In
addition, the Company faces risks to the extent that suppliers, manufacturers,
distributors and other vendors upon whom the Company relies and their suppliers
are unable to make appropriate modifications to support euro transactions. The
inability of such third parties to support euro transactions could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial
condition.

     In connection with the enforcement of its own intellectual property rights
or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement
of third party rights, the Company has been and may in the future be subject to
complex, protracted litigation as part of its policy to vigorously defend its
intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is typically very
costly and can be disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention
and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although the Company has
successfully defended past litigation, there can be no assurance that it will
prevail in any ongoing or future litigation. Adverse decisions in such
litigation could subject the Company to significant liabilities, require the
Company to seek licenses from others, prevent the Company from manufacturing or
selling certain 


                                       23

<PAGE>

of its products, or cause severe disruptions to the Company's operations or 
the markets in which it competes, any one of which could have a material 
adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the 
Company.

     The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). GAAP are subject to interpretation by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the "AICPA"), the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and various bodies formed to
interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies
can have a significant effect on the Company's reported results, and may even
affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced.
Accounting policies affecting many other aspects of the Company's business,
including rules relating to software revenue recognition, purchase and
pooling-of-interests accounting for business combinations, the valuation of
in-process research and development, employee stock purchase plans, and stock
option grants have recently been revised or are under review by one or more
groups. Changes to these rules, or the questioning of current practices, may
have a significant adverse effect on the Company's reported financial results or
in the way in which the Company conducts its business.

     Due to the factors noted above, as well as the Year 2000 issues noted
below, the Company's future earnings and stock price may be subject to
significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Any shortfall in
revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have, and
has had in the past, an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading
price of the Company's common stock in any given period. Additionally, the
Company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter, which
could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price
of the Company's common stock. Finally, the Company participates in a highly
dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to the Company, changes in
analysts' earnings estimates for the Company or its industry, and factors
affecting the corporate environment, the Company's industry or the securities
markets in general will often result in significant volatility of the Company's
common stock price.

"YEAR 2000" ISSUES

     The Company is addressing a broad range of issues associated with the
programming code in existing computer systems as the year 2000 approaches. The
"Year 2000" problem is complex, as many computer systems will be affected in
some way by the rollover of the two-digit year value to 00. Systems that do not
properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a
system to fail. The Year 2000 issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen
problems in its products or its own computer and embedded systems and from third
parties with whom the Company deals on financial and other transactions
worldwide. Failure of the Company's and/or third parties' computer systems or
Year 2000 defects in the Company's products could have a material impact on the
Company's ability to conduct its business.

     The Company has commenced a phased program to inventory, assess, remediate,
test, implement, and develop contingency plans for all mission-critical
applications and products potentially affected by the Year 2000 issue (the "Y2K
Program"). To accelerate overall completion, activities in each phase are often
concurrent rather than serial, but all phases, except developing contingency
plans, are expected to be completed by mid-1999. Additionally, the Company has
opened a dedicated Year 2000 test laboratory for both internal business process
and product testing. All Company business groups are involved in the Y2K Program
efforts.


                                       24

<PAGE>

      The Company has identified three potential areas of impact for review: (1)
the software and systems, including embedded systems, used in the Company's
internal business processes; (2) third-party vendors, manufacturers and
suppliers, and (3) the Company's software products offered to customers. The
Company's current estimate of the aggregate costs to be incurred for the Y2K
Program is approximately $3.0 million, which is expected to be funded from
operating cash flows. If the Company encounters significant unforeseen Year 2000
problems, either in its products or internal business systems or in relation to
third party vendors, manufacturers or suppliers, actual costs could materially
exceed this estimate.

     INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES. The Company has substantially completed its
inventory of Year 2000 impacted software and is assessing its centralized
computer and embedded systems to identify any potential Year 2000 issues. The
Company's financial information systems include an SAP system recently
implemented in the United States, Japan, and Asia Pacific and Latin America, and
an Oracle system in Europe that has recently been upgraded to a recent version.
SAP and Oracle have informed the Company, and the Company believes, that these
systems are Year 2000 compliant. The Company has a number of projects underway
to replace or upgrade hardware and software that are known to be Year 2000
non-compliant. The Company currently expects to substantially complete
remediation, validation and implementation of its internal systems by mid-1999.
In addition, in order to protect against the acquisition of additional products
that may not be Year 2000 ready, the Company has implemented a policy requiring
Year 2000 review of products sold or licensed to the Company prior to their
acquisition. However, if implementation of replacement or upgraded systems or
software is delayed, or if significant new non-compliance issues are identified,
the Company's results of operations or financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

      THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS. The Company is also in
the process of contacting its critical suppliers, manufacturers, distributors
and other vendors to determine that their operations and the products and
services that they provide to the Company are Year 2000 compliant. Where
practicable, the Company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the
failure of third parties to be Year 2000 ready, including developing contingency
plans. However, such failures, including failures of any contingency plan,
remain a possibility and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's
results of operations or financial condition.

     PRODUCTS. In addition, the Year 2000 issue could affect the products that
the Company licenses. The Company is continuing to test its products and gather
information about Company technologies and products affected by the Year 2000
transition. Current information about the Company's products is available on the
Company's Year 2000 Web site (www.adobe.com/newsfeatures/year2000). Information
on the Company's Web site is provided to customers for the sole purpose of
assisting in planning for the transition to the Year 2000. Such information is
the most currently available concerning the Company's products and is provided
"as is" without warranty of any kind. There can be no assurance that the
Company's current products do not contain undetected errors or defects
associated with Year 2000 that may result in material costs to the Company.

     CONTINGENCY PLANS. The Company has not yet developed contingency plans to
address situations that may result if the Company is unable to achieve Year 2000
readiness of its critical operations, including operations under the control of
third parties. Additionally, the most reasonably likely worst-case scenario has
not yet been clearly identified. Development of such contingency plans is in
progress and is expected to be completed by September 1999. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to develop contingency plans that will 


                                       25

adequately address all Year 2000 issues that may arise.

     Some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will
arise out of Year 2000 compliance issues, and the Company is aware of a growing
number of lawsuits against other software vendors. Because of the unprecedented
nature of such litigation, it is uncertain whether or to what extent the Company
may be affected by it. The impact of the Year 2000 on future Company revenue is
difficult to discern but is a risk to be considered in evaluating future growth
of the Company.

</TABLE>

     The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting
principally of municipal bonds, and United States government and government
agency securities, decreased $9.3 million, or 3.4%, during the first quarter of
fiscal 1999 primarily due to the repurchase of Adobe common stock totaling $69.9
million and the purchase of the assets of GoLive Systems, Inc. for $31.0
million. Other uses of cash during the period included additional investments
made in Adobe Ventures in the amount of $6.8 million, capital expenditures of
$7.5 million, and the payment of dividends totaling $3.1 million. These factors
were partially offset by cash generated from operations of $36.5 million and
proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock, primarily related to the exercise
of stock options and sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Program of
$35.9 million.

     All of the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities." The securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized
gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders'
equity.

         In September 1997, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject
to certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to an additional
15 million shares of the Company's common stock over a two-year period. This new
stock repurchase program was in addition to an existing program whereby the
Company has been authorized to repurchase shares to offset issuances under
employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The Company repurchased
approximately 1.7 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 and 10.5
million shares in fiscal 1998, at a cost of $69.9 million and $379.2 million,
respectively, under its stock repurchase programs. As of March 5, 1999, there
are no remaining authorized shares to be repurchased under the 15.0


                                       27

<PAGE>

million share repurchase program. The timing and size of any future stock 
repurchases are subject to market conditions, stock prices, and the Company's 
cash position and other cash requirements going forward.

     To facilitate the Company's stock repurchase programs, the Company sold put
warrants to independent third parties. Each warrant entitles the holder to sell
one share of Adobe's common stock to the Company at a specified price. On March
5, 1999, put warrants to sell approximately 779,500 shares of the Company's
common stock were outstanding that expire on various dates through July 1999
with an average exercise price of $42.41 per share. Under these put warrant
arrangements, the Company, at its option, can settle with physical delivery or
net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and market value
at the date of exercise.

     In addition, the Company purchased call options from independent third
parties that entitle the Company to buy its common stock on certain dates at
specified prices. On March 5, 1999, call options to purchase approximately
239,100 shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding that expire on
various dates through July 1999 with an average exercise price of $44.47 per
share.

     The Board of Directors of the Company declared a cash dividend on the
Company's common stock of $0.05 per common share, for the first quarter of
fiscal 1999. The declaration of future dividends is within the discretion of the
Board of Directors of the Company and will depend upon business conditions,
results of operations, the financial condition of the Company and other factors.

     The Company's principal commitments as of March 5, 1999 consisted of
obligations under operating leases, venture investing activities, real estate
development agreements, and various service agreements. These arrangements are
discussed in more detail in the Company's 1998 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K
for the year ended November 27, 1998.

     The Company believes that existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, together with cash generated from operations, will provide
sufficient funds for the Company to meet its operating cash requirements in the
foreseeable future, including planned capital expenditure programs, working
capital requirements, the potential put warrant obligation, and the dividend
program.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company's market risk disclosures set forth in its 1998 Annual Report
filed on Form 10-K have not changed significantly.

                        PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On April 17, 1997, a derivative action was filed in the Superior Court of
the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against the current members of
Adobe's Board of Directors and Paul Brainerd, a former member of the Board. The
suit was filed by a stockholder purporting to assert on behalf of the Company
claims for alleged breach of the Directors' fiduciary duty and mismanagement
related to the Company's acquisition of Frame in October 1995. The Court granted
Adobe's demurrer to the suit, with leave to amend for the plaintiff. In January
1998, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint making substantially the same
claims but not including Mr. Brainerd. In March 1998, Adobe filed 


                                       28

<PAGE>

a demurrer to the amended complaint, which was overruled by the trial court 
in May 1998. In June 1998, Adobe filed a writ petition with the California 
Court of Appeals for review of the trial court's decision, which was denied. 
In July 1998, Adobe filed a petition for review of the Court of Appeals' 
refusal to grant the writ with the Supreme Court of California, which was 
denied in September 1998. The Company intends to continue vigorously 
defending the action.

     On February 6, 1996, a securities class action complaint was filed against
Adobe, certain of its officers and directors, certain former officers of Adobe
and Frame Technology Corporation ("Frame"), Hambrecht & Quist, LLP ("H&Q"),
investment banker for Frame, and certain H&Q employees, in connection with the
drop in the price of Adobe stock following its announcement of financial results
for the quarter ended December 1, 1995. The complaint was filed in the Superior
Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The complaint alleges
that the defendants misrepresented material adverse information regarding Adobe
and Frame and engaged in a scheme to defraud investors. The complaint seeks
unspecified damages for alleged violations of California law. Adobe believes
that the allegations against it and its officers and directors are without merit
and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. The case is currently in the
discovery phase.

     On October 29, 1998, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG, a German company,
filed a complaint alleging that Adobe is using Heidelberger's US patent number
4,393,399 for the partial electronic retouching of colors. The complaint was
filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and
seeks a permanent injunction and unspecified damages. Adobe believes that the
allegations against it are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the
lawsuit.

     Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

                     CONFIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE RESIGNATION AGREEMENT
                            AND GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS


     1.   Frederick A. Schwedner ("Executive") was employed by Adobe Systems 
Incorporated (the "Company") on or about July 31, 1989.  Executive was placed 
on a medical leave of absence by the Company on or about July 17, 1998, and 
remains on that leave of absence as of the date of this agreement.  Executive 
and the Company have now agreed to terminate his employment relationship with 
the Company.  It is the Company's desire to provide Executive with certain 
benefits that he would not otherwise be entitled to receive upon his 
termination and to resolve any claims that Executive has or may have against 
the Company. Accordingly, Executive and the Company agree as set forth below. 
This Agreement shall become effective on the eighth day after it is signed 
by Executive, but only if Executive has not previously revoked his acceptance 
of this Agreement.

     2.   Executive hereby resigns voluntarily from any positions that he 
holds as an officer of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries (including, 
but not limited to, his position as Senior Vice President and General 
Manager, Printing and Systems Division, with all such resignations effective 
as of Jan. 21, 1999 (the "Resignation Date").  Executive and the Company 
agree that his employment with the Company and any of its subsidiaries will 
terminate effective as of the earlier of (a) July 16, 1999, or (b) the date 
on which Executive's current Medical Leave of Absence ends in accordance with 
the terms of the applicable Company policies governing such leave of absence 
(the "Termination Date"). During the period between the Resignation Date and 
the Termination Date, Executive will be eligible to receive compensation 
and/or benefits in accordance with the Company's applicable leave of absence 
policies and his Retention Agreement of on or about September 12, 1997 
remains in full force and effect.

     3.   The Company will provide Executive with the following payments and 
benefits when this Agreement becomes effective:

          (a)  The Company will provide Executive with a lump sum severance 
payment of $870,000.00, less applicable withholding, to be paid to Executive 
in two installments:  (i) one-half of the amount will be paid to Executive on 
the eighth day following his re-execution of this Agreement as described in 
paragraph 4 below, and (ii) one-half of the amount will be paid to Executive 
on or about the third business day after January 1, 2000.  Executive will be 
paid all wages that he earns through the Termination Date, and he will 
receive all of his vested benefits under the Company's 401(k) and employee 
stock purchase plans in accordance with the terms of those plans.  Executive 
will be reimbursed by the Company for any reasonable business expenses 
incurred by Executive in the course of his employment with the Company, 
pursuant to the Company's applicable business expense reimbursement policies. 

          (b)  All stock option awards with the exception of grants 015446 
and 015447, granted to Executive under the Adobe 1994 Stock Option Plan and 
the Adobe 1984 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Option Plans") will vest 
and become exercisable as of the Termination Date.  All other terms and 
conditions of the relevant stock option agreements and Option Plans 


                                        1

<PAGE>

shall continue to apply.  Executive's rights with respect to any other equity 
awards (such as performance share unit awards and restricted units in Adobe 
Incentive Partners, L.P.)  or long term incentive awards shall be determined 
in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity or long term incentive 
award plans and/or agreements, which are not modified in any way by this 
Agreement.  

          (c)  Executive and his eligible dependents will receive continued 
group health insurance coverage in accordance with federal law (COBRA) 
through payment of premiums at the Company's expense for the period starting 
on the Termination Date and ending on the second anniversary of the 
Termination Date; thereafter, Executive shall be entitled to elect continued 
insurance coverage (COBRA), in accordance with federal law for an additional 
12 (twelve) months.

          (d)  Executive understands and acknowledges that he shall not be 
entitled to any payments or benefits (except a pro rated executive incentive 
plan award for the second half of the Company's 1998 fiscal year) from the 
Company other than those expressly set forth in this paragraph 3.  

     4.   Executive and his successors release the Company, its subsidiaries 
and their respective shareholders, investors, directors, officers, employees, 
agents, attorneys, insurers, legal successors and assigns of and from any and 
all claims, actions and causes of action, whether now known or unknown, which 
Executive now has, or at any other time had, or shall or may have against the 
released parties based upon or arising out of any matter, cause, fact, thing, 
act or omission whatsoever occurring or existing at any time up to and 
including the Termination Date, including, but not limited to, any claims of 
breach of contract, wrongful termination, retaliation, fraud, defamation, 
infliction of emotional distress or national origin, race, age, sex, sexual 
orientation, disability or other discrimination or harassment under the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, the 
Americans With Disabilities Act, the Fair Employment and Housing Act or any 
other applicable law.  As additional consideration for the severance payment 
described in paragraph 3, Executive agrees that he will reaffirm this release 
of claims by re-signing this Agreement in the space provided at the end of 
the Agreement on or after the Termination Date.  The parties agree that the 
releases of claims contained in this Agreement shall not affect Executive's 
right to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with the terms of their 
Indemnity Agreement of on or about May 30, 1997.

     5.   Executive acknowledges that he has read section 1542 of the Civil 
Code of the State of California, which states in full:

          A general release does not extend to claims which the
          creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at
          the time of executing the release, which if known by him
          must have materially affected his settlement with the
          debtor.

Executive waives any rights that he has or may have under section 1542 to the 
full extent that he may lawfully waive such rights pertaining to this general 
release of claims, and affirms that he is releasing all known and unknown 
claims that he has or may have against the parties listed above. 


                                       2

     6.   Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall continue to be 
bound by and comply with the terms of the Employee Inventions and Proprietary 
Rights Assignment Agreement that Executive signed in connection with his 
employment by the Company.  

     7.   Executive agrees that he shall not:

          (a)  for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
directly or indirectly disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone 
other than his immediate family, his counsel, his financial advisors, or the 
Employment Development Department, except as such disclosure may be required 
for accounting or tax reporting purposes or as otherwise may be required by 
law; or

          
          (b)  make any critical or disparaging statements at any time about 
the Company, or any of its products or employees, unless such statements are 
made truthfully in response to a subpoena or other legal process.

     8.   The Company agrees that it will not, through any of its officers or 
directors:  

          (a)  for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone other than the 
Company's legal counsel and accountants, except as such disclosure may be 
required for tax or securities reporting purposes or by law; or

          (b)  make any critical or disparaging statements about Executive at 
any time, unless such statements are made truthfully in response to a 
subpoena or other legal process.

     9.   Following the Termination Date, Executive agrees to provide 
reasonable assistance to the Company in connection with any litigation to 
which the Company is or may become a party and with respect to which 
Executive possesses any relevant knowledge or expertise.  Executive's 
assistance will be provided at mutually convenient times, and the Company 
will reimburse Executive for any reasonable expenses incurred by him in 
providing such assistance.

     10.  In the event of any legal action relating to or arising out of this 
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing 
party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that action.

     11.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the laws of the State of California.  To the extent that any provision 
of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such 
provision shall be deemed stricken from this Agreement, and the remainder of 
this Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect.

     12.  This Agreement, along with any other agreements referenced herein, 
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior negotiations and agreements 
between the parties.  This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by 
a document signed by an authorized officer of the Company and Executive.
