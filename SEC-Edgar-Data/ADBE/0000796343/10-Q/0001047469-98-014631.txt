NOTE 1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
reflect all normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of 
management, necessary to present a fair statement of the condensed 
consolidated financial position at February 27, 1998, and the condensed 
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods 
ended February 27, 1998 and February 28, 1997.

     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, 
therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a 
complete presentation of the results of operations, the financial position, 
and cash flows, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe" or the "Company") filed audited 
consolidated financial statements which included all information and 
footnotes necessary for such a presentation of the results of operations, 
financial position and cash flows for the years ended November 28, 1997, 
November 29, 1996 and December 1, 1995, in the Company's 1997 Annual Report 
on Form 10-K.

     The results of operations for the interim period ended February 27, 
1998, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the 
full year.

NOTE 1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     NET INCOME PER SHARE

     The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 
No. 128, "Earnings per Share," in the quarter ended February 27, 1998. All 
prior period share and per share amounts have been restated to comply with 
SFAS No. 128. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted 
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net 
income per share is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding 
for the period plus dilutive common equivalent shares including unvested 
restricted common stock, stock options using the treasury stock method, and 
put warrants written by the Company using the reverse treasury stock method.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION
     
     In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." 
SOP 97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of 
software revenue. Based on the Company's initial assessment of the impact SOP 
97-2 may have on its consolidated results of operations, the Company intends 
to modify certain aspects of its business model such that any impact will not 
be significant. The Company will adopt SOP 97-2 for its fiscal year 1999.

NOTE 1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
     
     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued 
SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes 
standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its 
components in the financial statements. It does not, however, require a 
specific format for the disclosure but requires the Company to display an 
amount representing total comprehensive income for the period in its 
financial statements. The Company will be required to implement SFAS No. 130 
for its fiscal year 1999.

     SEGMENT REPORTING
     
     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments 
of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes standards 
for the manner in which public companies report information about operating 
segments in annual and interim financial statements. The Company is currently 
evaluating the operating segment information to determine whether this will 
have an impact on its financial statement reporting. The Company will be 
required to implement SFAS No. 131 for its fiscal year 1999.

NOTE 4.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
     
     In September 1997, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject 
to certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to 15.0 million 
shares of the Company's common stock over a two-year period. The Company 
repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of its common stock during the 
first quarter of 1998. 

     PUT WARRANTS AND CALL OPTIONS
     
     To facilitate the Company's stock repurchase programs, the Company sold 
put warrants to independent third parties. Each warrant entitles the holder 
to sell one share of Adobe's common stock to the Company at a specified 
price. On February 27, 1998,  put warrants to sell approximately 4.1 million 
shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding that expire on various 
dates through November 1998 with an average exercise price of $40.10 per 
share. Under these put warrant arrangements, the Company, at its option, can 
settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between 
the exercise price and market value at the date of exercise; therefore the 
put warrants do not result in a liability on the balance sheet.

     In addition, the Company purchased call options from independent third 
parties that entitle the Company to buy its common stock on certain dates at 
specified prices. On February 27, 1998, call options to purchase 
approximately 1.2 million shares of the Company's common stock were 
outstanding that expire on various dates through July 1998 with an average 
exercise price of $41.44 per share.

</TABLE>
     Total revenue decreased from the same quarter last year due primarily to 
continuing weak demand in Asia, deterioration in Macintosh platform revenues, 
and a decline in North American revenues. A decrease in product unit volume 
(as opposed to price) was the principal factor in the Company's revenue 
decline in application products revenue.

</TABLE>


     Licensing revenue is derived from shipments by OEM customers of products 
containing Adobe PostScript and Adobe PrintGear technology. Adobe PostScript 
is a software language for describing to a printer the appearance of a page, 
including text, graphics, and images. Products that contain PostScript 
technology include: (1) black-and-white printers; (2) color printers; 
(3) slide recorders; (4) imagesetters; (5) screen displays; and (6) digital 
copiers. Adobe PostScript technology includes Adobe PostScript, Adobe 
PostScript Level 2, Adobe PostScript 3, all of which serve the enterprise, 
graphic arts, and production printing markets, and Adobe PostScript Extreme, 
a solution for high-volume production printing. Adobe PrintGear is a 
different architecture for printers targeted at the small office/home office 
("SOHO") market.

     Licensing revenue decreased $9.6 million or 18.7% in the first quarter 
of 1998 compared to the same period last year primarily due to three factors: 
(1) ongoing weakness in the color copier business due to product transitions 
and excess copier inventory, (2) ongoing weakness in the Japanese personal 
computer and printer markets, and (3) a decline in royalty revenue from 
Hewlett-Packard Company's ("HP") desktop monochrome laser printer division 
which is now incorporating a non-Adobe clone version of Adobe PostScript into 
its products.

     The Company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue in the 
short term because of Japanese market conditions, the uncertain timing of OEM 
customer introductions of products incorporating Adobe's latest technologies, 
and the anticipated full impact of loss of revenue from HP's monochrome laser 
printer products in the second quarter of fiscal 1998. Based on a strategic 
review of the Company's printing systems division, the Company intends to 
refocus its resources on high growth revenue opportunities in digital color, 
color inkjet, short-run on-demand digital printing, and digital copiers. This 
strategic refocusing is intended to increase licensing revenue growth in the 
long term, although the Company anticipates that its licensing revenue in the 
remainder of fiscal 1998 will be below fiscal 1997 levels.

          Percentage of total revenue               78.8%          77.3%
</TABLE>

     Application products revenue is derived predominantly from shipments of 
application software programs marketed through distribution channels with the 
exception of Adobe FrameMaker and Adobe Acrobat products which are more 
widely distributed through VARs and systems integrators. Adobe PhotoDeluxe is 
primarily distributed through OEM bundling agreements with digital camera, 
scanner, and personal computer manufacturers. 

     Application products revenue decreased $19.0 million or 10.9% in the 
first quarter of 1998 compared to the same period last year due to a number 
of factors. First, the absence of recent major product releases or upgrades 
during the quarter adversely impacted application products revenue in all 
product families with the exception of Adobe FrameMaker, a new version of 
which was released in the fourth quarter of 1997. By comparison, the first 
quarter of 1997 benefited from revenue momentum related to two major product 
releases -- Adobe Photoshop 4.0 which was released just before the quarter 
began, and Adobe PageMaker 6.5 which was released during the quarter.

     Secondly, application products revenue was adversely affected by 
continuing weakness in the Japanese economy and a resulting decline in 
end-user demand. Further, during the first quarter of 1998, the Company 
worked proactively with its distributors in Japan to match lower sell-through 
rates, thereby decreasing channel inventory levels in anticipation of the new 
product release cycle. The Company remains cautious about the economic 
conditions in Japan as well as the fluctuating economic conditions in other 
Asian countries in the short term.

     Additionally, although application products revenue for the Windows 
platform grew 18% as compared to the first quarter of last year, Macintosh 
revenue declined 36%. Total application products revenue (excluding platform 
independent and UNIX revenues) for the first quarter of 1998 was split 59% on 
Windows and 41% on Macintosh as compared to 44% and 56%, respectively, for 
the first quarter of 1997. The Company expects this trend toward the Windows 
platform to continue for the foreseeable future.

     Lastly, application products revenue was adversely affected by a 
quarter-to-quarter revenue decline in North America, not only affected by the 
product cycle and Macintosh platform issues, but also by a reduction in 
channel inventory of approximately $7.5 million and sales management 
challenges from the absence of permanent sales leadership. During the 
quarter, the Company completed searches for a new senior sales management 
team, recruiting three key new executives who have already joined the 
Company.

          Direct costs                           $ 30.0         $ 34.3          (12.5)%

</TABLE>

     Direct costs include direct product, packaging, and shipping costs, as 
well as royalties and amortization of localization costs and acquired 
technologies.

     Gross margin (expressed as a percentage of revenue), in general, is 
affected by the mix of licensing revenue versus application products revenue, 
the product mix within application products, and the mix of full and upgrade 
products sold. The decrease in gross margin versus a year ago is due 
primarily to inventory write-downs for various products as the Company 
approaches a new cycle of product upgrade releases offset by lower royalty 
payments.

     The Company anticipates that gross margin in the latter part of 1998 
will improve slightly due to relative decreases in inventory write-downs 
partially offset by increased localization costs associated with the 
translation of new product user interfaces into local languages.

          Percentage of total revenue              23.5%          16.9%
</TABLE>

     Research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and 
benefits for software developers, contracted development efforts, related 
facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in 
software development.

     Research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars and as a 
percentage of revenue as the Company invested in new technologies, new 
product development, and the infrastructure to support such activities. The 
increase reflects the expansion of the Company's engineering staff and 
related costs required to support these efforts. The Company continues to 
make significant investments in the development of Adobe PostScript and 
application software products, including those targeted for the growing 
Internet market.

     The Company believes that investments in research and development are 
necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related 
to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. Accordingly, 
the Company intends to continue recruiting and hiring experienced software 
developers. While the Company expects that research and development 
expenditures for the remainder of 1998 will increase in absolute dollars 
compared to fiscal 1997 levels, such expenditures are expected to decrease as 
a percentage of revenue compared to the first quarter of 1998.

          Percentage of total revenue              36.3%          31.8%
</TABLE>

     Sales and marketing expenses generally include salaries and benefits, 
sales commissions, travel expenses, and related facility costs for the 
Company's sales, marketing, customer support, and distribution personnel. 
Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at 
increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, and other market 
development programs.

     The slight decrease in absolute dollars for sales and marketing expenses 
for the first quarter of 1998 compared with the same period last year is due 
to decreased sales commissions and bonuses associated with the decline in 
revenue partially offset by increased headcount.

     Sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute 
dollars, but remain flat or slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue 
compared to the first quarter of 1998, as the Company invests in marketing 
programs for new products and upgrades scheduled to be released later in 
fiscal 1998.

</TABLE>

     General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and 
benefits, travel expenses, and related facility costs for the finance, human 
resources, legal, information services, and executive and administrative 
personnel of the Company. General and administrative expenses also include 
outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses 
associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of 
the business.

     General and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars and as 
a percentage of revenue for the first quarter of 1998 compared with the same 
period last year due to increased employee costs primarily associated with 
increased headcount and a more comprehensive administrative infrastructure. 
Additionally, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 
1998 include the write-off of $2.4 million of goodwill associated with an 
acquisition that took place in 1997.

     The Company expects general and administrative spending in 1998 to 
continue to be higher than 1997 levels in absolute dollars as the Company 
continues to invest in an expanded and more comprehensive executive and 
administrative infrastructure. General and administrative expenses are 
expected to decrease as a percentage of revenue as compared to the first 
quarter of 1998.

     During the first quarter of 1998, McQueen International Limited 
("McQueen"), a former investee of the Company, was acquired by Sykes 
Enterprises, Incorporated ("Sykes"), a publicly traded company. In connection 
with the acquisition, the Company exchanged its shares of McQueen for 
approximately 487,000 shares of Sykes' restricted common stock and recorded a 
gain on the exchange of $6.7 million.

     Also, during the first quarter of 1998, the Company liquidated its 
investment in Siebel Systems, Incorporated ("Siebel") through the 
distribution to its stockholders of approximately 165,000 shares of Siebel as 
a dividend-in-kind and the sale of its remaining Siebel shares. A gain was 
recognized on the transaction of approximately $5.7 million.

</TABLE>

     The Company's effective tax rate increased in the first quarter of 1998 
primarily due to the nondeductible write-off of goodwill relating to an 
acquisition which took place in 1997, a decrease in research and 
experimentation tax credits (the federal credit is set to expire on June 30, 
1998), and lower tax-exempt interest income.

     The Company expects that the effective tax rate for the remainder of 
fiscal 1998 will be between 37% and 38% due to lower tax-exempt interest 
income as a result of cash requirements for the Company's stock repurchase 
programs and the expiration of the federal research and experimentation tax 
credit on June 30, 1998.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company believes that in the future its results of operations could 
be affected by various factors, such as delays in shipment of the Company's 
new products and major new versions of existing products, lack of market 
acceptance of new products and upgrades, weakness in demand for Macintosh 
application software and Macintosh-related printers, renegotiation of royalty 
arrangements, growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and 
sales price adjustments, consolidation in the OEM printer business, ongoing 
weakness in the color copier business due to product transitions and excess 
copier inventory, industry transitions to new business and information 
delivery models, ongoing weakness in the Japanese and other Asian economies, 
and adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in 
which the Company does business.

     The Company's ability to develop and market products, including upgrades 
of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs, may 
also have an impact on the results of operations. The Company's ability to 
extend its core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or 
respond to technological changes could affect its ability to develop these 
products. A portion of the Company's future revenue will come from these new 
applications. Delays in product or upgrade introductions could have an 
adverse effect on the Company's revenue, earnings, or stock price. The 
Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or 
upgrades will have on its revenue or results of operations.

     The market for the Company's graphics applications, particularly the 
consumer products, is intensely and increasingly competitive and is 
significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of 
industry participants. Additionally, Microsoft Corp. has stated its intention 
to increase its presence in the digital imaging market in 1998; the Company 
believes that, due to Microsoft's market dominance, any new Microsoft digital 
imaging products will be highly competitive with the Company's products. If 
competing new products achieve widespread acceptance, it would have a 
significant adverse impact on the Company's operating results.

     Although the Company generally offers its application products on 
Macintosh, Windows, and UNIX platforms, a majority of the overall revenue 
from these products prior to 1997 has been for the Macintosh platform, 
particularly for the higher end Macintosh computers. In 1997, Windows-based 
application revenue exceeded that from the Macintosh platform for the first 
time. If there is a continuing slowdown of customer purchases in the higher 
end Macintosh market, or if the Company is unable to increase its revenue 
from Windows customers commensurate with such a slowdown, the Company's 
operating results could be materially adversely affected. Also, as the 
Company seeks to further broaden its customer base to achieve greater 
penetration in the corporate business and consumer markets, the Company will 
need to adapt its application software distribution channels. The Company 
could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in 
its distribution channel which could materially adversely affect its 
operating results. In addition, to the extent that there is a slowdown of 
customer purchases of personal computers in general, the Company's operating 
results could be materially adversely affected.

     The Company's OEM customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their 
royalty arrangements. The Company evaluates these requests on a case-by-case 
basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other 
options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for the Company. In 
the fall of 1997, HP began to ship non-Adobe clone software in some printers, 
resulting in somewhat lower licensing revenue to the Company, although the 
impact to date has been minimal. The Company 


                                      19
<PAGE>

expects a more significant impact on its remaining 1998 licensing revenue, 
although it continues to work with HP printer operations to incorporate Adobe 
PostScript and other technologies in other HP products.

     During late 1997, the Company experienced a decline in both application 
and licensing revenue from the Japanese market, due to a weak Japanese 
computer market and general economic conditions in Japan. In addition, at the 
end of fiscal 1997, inventory levels for application products at the 
Company's Japanese distributors remained  higher than what the Company 
considers normal. During the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company worked 
with its major distributors in Japan to reduce channel inventory by 
approximately $11 million. The Company expects these adverse economic 
conditions to continue in the short term, and they may adversely affect the 
Company's revenue and earnings. Although there are also adverse conditions in 
other Asian economies, the countries affected represent a much smaller 
portion of the Company's revenue and thus have less impact on the Company's 
operational results. 

     The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, 
significant growth. Competition for high quality personnel, especially highly 
skilled engineers, is extremely intense. The Company's ability to effectively 
manage its growth will require it to continue to improve its operational and 
financial controls and information management systems, and to attract, 
retain, motivate, and manage employees effectively. The failure of the 
Company to effectively manage growth and transition in multiple areas of its 
business could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.

     The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an 
increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed 
products addressing authoring and communications over the Internet. As is 
typical in the case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market 
acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a 
high level of uncertainty. The software industry addressing the authoring for 
and communications over the Internet is young and has few proven products. In 
addition, new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new 
information delivery practices. Moreover, critical issues concerning the 
commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, ease of use 
and access, cost, and quality of service) remain unresolved and may affect 
the growth of Internet use, together with the software standards and 
electronic media employed in such markets.

     The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating 
income from its subsidiaries located in Europe, Japan, and Asia, Pacific, and 
Latin America. The Company generally experiences lower revenue from its 
European operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their 
purchasing activities in the summer months. While most of the revenue of the 
European subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars, the majority of revenue 
derived from Japan is denominated in yen and the majority of all 
subsidiaries' operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies. 
As a result, the Company's operating results are subject to fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the accounting impact of such 
fluctuations has been insignificant. The Company's hedging policy attempts to 
mitigate some of these risks, based on management's best judgment of the 
appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. The Company has 
established a hedging program to hedge its exposure to foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations, primarily of the Japanese yen. The Company's 
hedging program is not comprehensive, and there can be no assurance that the 
program will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact 
resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates.

     Due to the factors noted above, the Company's future earnings and stock
price may 


                                      20
<PAGE>

be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Any 
shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts 
could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price 
of the Company's common stock in any given period. Additionally, the Company 
may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter, which 
could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading 
price of the Company's common stock. Finally, the Company participates in a 
highly dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to the Company, 
changes in analysts' earnings estimates for the Company or its industry and 
factors affecting the corporate environment, the Company's industry or the 
securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of 
the Company's common stock price.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive 
Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying 
comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. It does 
not, however, require a specific format for the disclosure, but requires the 
Company to display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the 
period in its financial statements. The Company will be required to implement 
SFAS No. 130 for its fiscal year 1999.

     Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes 
standards for the manner in which public companies report information about 
operating segments in annual and interim financial statements. The Company is 
currently evaluating the operating segment information to determine whether 
this will have an impact on its financial statement reporting. The Company 
will be required to implement SFAS No. 131 for its fiscal year 1999.

     In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." 
SOP 97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of 
software revenue. Based on the Company's initial assessment of the impact SOP 
97-2 may have on its consolidated results of operations, the Company intends 
to modify certain aspects of its business model such that any impact will not 
be significant. The Company intends to adopt SOP 97-2 for its fiscal year 
1999.

"YEAR 2000" ISSUES

     The Company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code 
in existing computer systems as the year 2000 approaches. The "Year 2000" 
problem is pervasive and complex, as many computer systems will be affected 
in some way by the rollover of the two-digit year value to 00. Systems that 
do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or 
cause a system to fail. The "Year 2000" issue creates risk for the Company 
from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from third parties 
with whom the Company deals on financial transactions worldwide. Failures of 
the Company's and/or third parties' computer systems could have a material 
impact on the Company's ability to conduct its business.
 
     The Company's financial information systems include an SAP system 
recently implemented in the United States and Japan and an Oracle system in 
Europe that will be upgraded to the most recent version later in fiscal 1998.

identify any potential "Year 2000" issues and will take appropriate 
corrective action based on the results of such analysis. Management has not 
yet determined the cost related to achieving "Year 2000" compliance.
                                          
     In addition, the "Year 2000" issue could affect the products that the
Company sells. The Company believes that the current versions of its products
are "Year 2000" compliant. The Company's products are subject to ongoing
analysis and review.

</TABLE>

     Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market instruments. All 
of the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting 
principally of municipal bonds, auction rate certificate securities, United 
States government and government agency securities, and asset-backed 
securities, are classified as available-for-sale under the provisions of 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The securities are carried at 
fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a 
separate component of stockholders' equity.

     The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 
decreased $124.8 million or 24.8% primarily due to cash used during the 
quarter to repurchase Adobe common stock partially offset by cash provided by 
operations. The timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject 
to market conditions, stock prices, and Adobe's cash position and other cash 
requirements going forward.

</TABLE>

     Other assets include restricted investments, equity investments, 
licensing agreements, purchased technology, goodwill and capitalized 
localization costs. During the first quarter of 1998, McQueen International 
Limited ("McQueen"), a former investee of the Company, was acquired by Sykes 
Enterprises, Incorporated ("Sykes"), a publicly traded company. In connection 
with the acquisition, the Company exchanged its shares of McQueen for 
approximately 487,000 shares of Sykes' restricted common stock and recorded a 
gain on the exchange of $6.7 million and a corresponding increase to the 
investment. Also contributing to the increase in other assets during the 
quarter were additional investments made in the Company's venture investment 
program and an increase in restricted investments in connection with the 
Company's real estate development agreements.

Stockholders' equity                   $634.0         $715.4          (11.4)%
</TABLE>

     Stockholders' equity decreased $81.5 million during the first quarter of 
1998 as a result of the repurchase of approximately 3.0 million shares of 
Adobe common stock at an aggregate cost of $122.8 million under stock 
repurchase programs previously authorized by the Board of Directors. These 
stock repurchase programs are intended to enhance stockholder value by 
reducing the number of outstanding shares net of offsetting increases due to 
employee stock purchases and stock option exercises. The timing and size of 
any future stock repurchases are subject to market conditions, stock prices 
and Adobe's cash position and other cash requirements going forward.

     The Board of Directors of the Company declared a cash dividend on the 
Company's common stock of $.05 per common share on March 23, 1998, for the 
first quarter of 1998. The dividend will be for stockholders of record as of 
April 3, 1998, and will be paid on April 17, 1998.

     Also, on December 1, 1997, the Company dividended one share of Siebel 
Systems, Incorporated ("Siebel") common stock for each 300 shares of Adobe 
common stock held by stockholders of record on October 31, 1997. An 
equivalent cash dividend was paid for holdings of less than 7,500 Adobe 
shares and for odd-lot and fractional Siebel shares. The declaration of 
future dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors of the 
Company and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, the 
financial condition of the Company and other factors.

</TABLE>

     Net working capital decreased $108.0 million or 23.8% during the first 
quarter of 1998 due primarily to a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and 
short-term investments of $124.8 million. Cash flows provided from operating 
acitivites were $31.3 million for the first quarter of 1998.

     Expenditures for property and equipment totaled $11.9 million in the 
first quarter of 1998. Such expenditures are expected to continue, including 
computer systems for development, sales and marketing, product support, and 
administrative staff. In the future, additional cash may be used to acquire 
software products or technologies complementary to the Company's business. 
Net cash used by financing activities during the first quarter of 1998 was 
$111.8 million primarily resulting from the repurchase of stock and payment 
of dividends,  partially offset by the issuance of common stock under 
employee stock plans.

     The Company's principal commitments as of February 27, 1998 consisted of 
obligations under operating leases, venture investing activities, real estate 
development agreements, and various service and lease guarantee agreements 
with a related party.  These arrangements are discussed in more detail in the 
Company's 1997 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K.

                           PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On April 17, 1997, a derivative action was filed in the Superior Court 
of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against the current 
members of Adobe's Board of Directors and Paul Brainerd, a former member of 
the Board. The suit was filed by a stockholder purporting to assert on behalf 
of the Company claims for alleged breach of the Directors' fiduciary duty and 
mismanagement related to the Company's acquisition of Frame in October 1995. 
The Court granted Adobe's demurrer to the suit, with leave to amend for the 
plaintiff. In January 1998, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint making 
substantially the same claims. In March 1998, Adobe filed a demurrer to the 
amended complaint.

     Management believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter and 
other matters discussed in the Company's 1997 Annual Report on Form 10-K will 
not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of 
operations.
