FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ADOBE COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF FRAME
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Mountain View, Calif., (October 30, 1995) (Nasdaq:ADBE)--Adobe Systems
Incorporated today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Frame
Technology Corporation following approval by Frame shareholders at a meeting
held Thursday, October 26 in San Jose.  The acquisition effective at 12:01 a.m.
California time on Saturday, October 28.  The acquisition, which was announced
on June 22, 1995 adds to Adobe's leadership as a provider of technologies and
software for the creation, delivery and access of graphically rich information.


Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Adobe exchanged 52 shares of its
common stock for each share of Frame common stock.  Based on approximately 16.3
million shares of outstanding Frame common stock and Adobe's closing stock price
for October 27, the transaction is valued at approximately $460 million.  The
acquisition is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and a "pooling
of interests" for accounting and financial purposes.


"More than any other company in the software business, Adobe is now poised to
unleash the power of the computer as a communications tool," said John Warnock,
chairman and CEO.  "We are integrating our industry-leading products and
building upon our PostScript-TM- language and Portable Document Format
standards to form the world's most productive digital tools for the creation,
exchange, delivery and use of information."


STAFF CUTBACKS ANNOUNCED

In connection with the acquisition, Adobe announced plans to reduce its
worldwide staff by approximately 150 employees, or approximately 7 percent of
the combined Adobe/Frame workforce.  Reductions in staff will come from both the
Adobe and Frame organizations, primarily in the administrative and sales
functions.  Employees affected by the reduction will receive severance packages
and outplacement assistance.

"Staff cutbacks are the most difficult reality of a transaction like this, even
when you know they are inevitable," said Chuck Geschke, president of Adobe.
"However, we believe our cost reduction measures are necessary to ensure that
Adobe begins this new phase of its evolution on a solid financial base."


CORPORATE IDENTITY AND ORGANIZATION

Although Adobe Systems will supersede Frame Technology Corporation as the
corporate identity for the new company, specific product name changes are yet to
be determined and will be announced when they are introduced to the marketplace.


The company also confirmed its corporate officers. Adobe corporate officers
are John E. Warnock, chairman of the board and chief executive officer;
Charles M. Geschke, president; Derek S. Gray, senior vice president and
general manager, Adobe Europe; Stephen A. MacDonald, senior vice president
and chief operating officer; M. Bruce Nakao, senior vice president and chief
operating officer; M. Bruce Nakao, senior vice president and chief financial
officer;  Colleen M. Pouliot, vice president, general counsel and secretary;
and David B. Pratt, senior vice president and chief operating officer.
