     This  Amendment No. 1  to the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K dated
October  28, 1995 (the "REPORT"),  relates to the Registrant's completion of the
acquisition  of  Frame  Technology  Corporation,  a  corporation  organized  and
existing  under  the  laws of the  State of California  ("FRAME"), by means of a
merger (the "MERGER") of J Acquisition Corporation, a  corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the State of California and a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Registrant ("MERGER SUB"), with and into Frame, pursuant to the Agreement
and  Plan of  Merger and Reorganization,  dated as of June 22, 1995 (the "MERGER
AGREEMENT"),  among the  Registrant, Merger  Sub and Frame.  The purpose of this
Amendment  is to  amend Item 7(b)  to provide  the required  pro forma financial
information  relating  to the  business combination  between the  Registrant and
Frame on October 28, 1995  which  was  impracticable to provide at the time  the
Registrant filed this Report.

Item 7.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS.

          (b)  PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

               PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
                                  (UNAUDITED)

    The   following   unaudited   pro forma   combined   condensed   financial
statements assume a business combination between  Adobe   and  Frame accounted
for  on  a  pooling  of  interests  basis. The  pro forma  combined  condensed
financial statements  are based  on the  historical financial  statements  and
the notes  thereto of  Adobe  and   the  supplemental  consolidated  financial
statements  and  the  notes  thereto  of  Frame,  included  or incorporated by
reference  in  the  Registrant's  Registration   Statement  on  Form  S-4,  as
amended  (Registration  No.  033-62167), declared  effective by the Securities
and  Exchange  Commission  on September 21, 1995  under  the Securities Act of
1933,   as   amended   (the  "REGISTRATION   STATEMENT")  and  the   condensed
consolidated  balance   sheet  of  Frame  as  of  September 30,  1995  and the
condensed consolidated statements of income of Frame for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994 and 1995.  The  Adobe  historical  financial statement data
as  of September 1, 1995  and for the  nine  months  ended August 26, 1994 and
September  1, 1995  and  the  Frame historical  financial statement data as of
September 30, 1995 and  for  the nine  months  ended September  30,  1994  and
1995  have  been  prepared  on  the same basis  as the historical  information
derived from audited financial statements and,  in the  opinion of management,
contain  all  adjustments,  consisting  only   of  normal recurring  accruals,
necessary for the fair  presentation  of the  results of operations for  such
periods.   The  pro   forma  combined  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet
combines Adobe's  September 1, 1995 condensed consolidated balance sheet  with
Frame's  September  30,  1995   condensed  consolidated  balance sheet, giving
effect to  the  Merger as  if it  had occurred on September 1, 1995.  The  pro
forma  combined  condensed  statements  of income  combine  Adobe's historical
condensed consolidated statements of income for the three  fiscal years  ended
November 27, 1992,  November 26,  1993  and  November 25,  1994, respectively,
and  the  unaudited  nine  months  ended  August  26,  1994  and  September 1,
1995  with  the  corresponding  Frame   condensed  consolidated  statements of
operations  for each  of the three fiscal years ended  December 31, 1992, 1993
and 1994 and the  unaudited  nine  months  ended  September 30, 1994 and 1995,
respectively giving effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on November 30,
1991.

    On July 28, 1995, Frame acquired Mastersoft, a developer of file conversion,
viewing and document  comparison software for  original equipment  manufacturers
and  end users through a pooling of interests. Accordingly, Frame's historical
consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the results  of
operations,  financial position  and cash  flows of  Mastersoft for  all periods
presented.

    The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is
not necessarily indicative of the  operating results or financial position  that
would  have occurred if the Merger had  been consummated at the beginning of the
periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating  results
or  financial  position. The  unaudited pro  forma combined  condensed financial
statements do not  incorporate any benefits  from cost savings  or synergies  of
operations of the combined company.

    Adobe  and Frame estimate  that they will incur  direct transaction costs of
approximately $11.5 million associated with the Merger which will be charged  to
operations  during  the quarter  ending  December 1,  1995.  In addition,  it is
expected that following the Merger, Adobe  will incur a restructuring charge  to
operations, currently estimated to be between $15.0 million and $25.0 million in
the  quarter ending December 1, 1995  to reflect costs associated with combining
the two companies. This amount is  a preliminary estimate only and is  therefore
subject  to  change.  There  can  be no  assurance  that  Adobe  will  not incur
additional charges in subsequent quarters  to reflect costs associated with  the
Merger  or that management will be successful  in their efforts to integrate the
operations of the  two companies. The  costs in connection  with the  Mastersoft
Acquisition are not anticipated to be significant.

    These  pro forma combined  condensed financial statements  should be read in
conjunction  with  the  historical  consolidated  financial  statements and the
related  notes  thereto of Adobe  and the consolidated financial statements and
the  notes  thereto  of  Frame  included  or  incorporated  by reference in the
Registration Statement.

           NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  PERIODS COMBINED
    The  Adobe statements  of income  for each  of the  years in  the three-year
period ended November 25, 1994  and  the  nine months  ended August 26, 1994 and
September 1, 1995 have been combined with the Frame statements of operations for
each of the  years  in  the  three-year  period ended December 31,  1994 and the
nine months ended September 30, 1994 and September 30, 1995.

    The  Adobe  balance sheet as of September 1, 1995 has been combined with the
Frame balance sheet as of September 30, 1995.

    On July 28, 1995, Frame acquired Mastersoft, a developer of file conversion,
viewing  and document  comparison software for  original equipment manufacturers
and end users through a pooling of interests. Accordingly, Frame's  historical
consolidated  financial statements have been restated  to include the results of
operations, financial position and cash flows of Mastersoft.

NOTE 2.  PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER SHARE
    The pro forma combined  condensed statements of income  for Adobe and  Frame
have  been  prepared as  if the  Merger was  completed at  the beginning  of the
periods presented. The pro forma combined net  income per share is based on  the
combined weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares of Adobe
Common Stock and Frame Common Stock for each period, based on the exchange ratio
of 0.52 shares of Adobe Common Stock for each share of Frame Common Stock.

NOTE 3.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    PRO FORMA BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The  pro forma combined condensed  financial statements reflect the issuance
of 8,489,087  shares of  Adobe Common  Stock  in exchange  for an  aggregate  of
16,325,167  shares of Frame Common  Stock (outstanding as of September 30, 1995)
in  connection with  the Merger  based on  the  exchange ratio of 0.52 shares of
Adobe Common Stock for every share of Frame Common Stock.

    The  following table  provides the pro  forma share  issuances in connection
with the merger:

Frame Common Stock outstanding at September 30, 1995...........  16,325,167

Number of shares of Adobe Common Stock exchanged...............   8,489,087
Number of shares of Adobe Common Stock outstanding at
September 1, 1995..............................................  63,819,199
                                                                 ----------
Number of shares of Adobe Common Stock outstanding after
 completion of the Merger......................................  72,308,286
                                                                 ----------
                                                                 ----------
</TABLE>

    The actual number of shares of  Adobe  Common Stock  issued at the
Effective Time,  October 28, 1995,  was 8,499,506, based on  the  number of
shares of Frame Common Stock outstanding at such time.

    MERGER TRANSACTION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS

    Adobe and  Frame  estimate  they  will incur  direct  transaction  costs  of
approximately   $11.5  million   associated  with  the   Merger,  consisting  of
transaction fees  for  investment  bankers,  attorneys,  accountants,  financial
printing  and other related charges. These nonrecurring costs will be charged to
operations in the fiscal quarter in which the Merger is consummated.

    In addition, it is  expected that as  a result of  the Merger, the  combined
company  will incur restructuring costs currently  estimated to be between $15.0
million and $25.0 million.  The restructuring costs  will include severance  and
outplacement, and elimination of duplicate facilities, including cancellation of
leases.

     NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 3.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)
    The pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to such expenses
as  if they had been incurred as of September 1, 1995, but the effects of  these
costs have not  been reflected  in  the pro  forma combined condensed statements
of income.

    The  income tax effect of the merger transaction and restructuring costs has
also been reflected as a pro forma adjustment.

NOTE 4.  CONFORMING ADJUSTMENTS
    There have been no adjustments  required to conform the accounting  policies
of  the combined  company. Certain amounts  for Frame have  been reclassified to
conform with  Adobe's  financial  statement presentation.  There  have  been  no
significant intercompany transactions.

NOTE 5.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
    Since  Adobe  plans  to file  consolidated  tax returns  which  will include
Frame's operations subsequent to the Effective Time, pro forma adjustments  were
made  to  reduce  the  valuation  allowances  previously  provided  by  Frame in
connection  with  Frame's  loss  carryforward  generated  in  1993.  Adobe   has
determined  that  estimated  combined  future taxable  income  is  sufficient to
conclude that  it is  more likely  than not  that the  tax benefit  of the  loss
carryforwards will be realized.

    Mastersoft  was subject  to Subchapter S  of the Internal  Revenue Code and,
accordingly, was not subject to income tax. Any additional pro forma income  tax
provisions  assuming that  Mastersoft was not  subject to Subchapter  S would be
insignificant to the pro forma combined condensed statements of income.
