</P>
<P>
"The Web is creating explosive demand for content, and our Q3 results showed that Adobe is in an exceptionally strong position to capitalize on this trend," said John E. Warnock, chairman and chief executive officer of Adobe. "I am also pleased to
announce that the Adobe Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split," added Warnock.
</P>
<P>
Net income, which includes non-operating gains and losses, was $78.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2000, compared to $57.2 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal 1999, and $65.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2000. This
represents 37 percent year over year earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2000 were $0.61 based on 127.9 million weighted average shares. This compares with diluted earnings per share of $0.44 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 1999, based on 129.7 million
weighted average shares, and diluted earnings per share of $0.52 reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2000, based on 127.7 million weighted average shares.

percent in the third quarter of fiscal 1999, and 32.3 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Adobe&#146;s future growth targets, Warnock added, "We are nearing completion of our three year strategic planning process, and we are targeting annual revenue growth of at least 25 percent in fiscal 2001. At our analyst meeting in
November, we look forward to sharing our vision for how we will leverage our substantial human, technical, and financial resources to extend our leadership position."
</P>
<P>
Adobe also announced that it is increasing its operating model targets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, and in fiscal year 2001, the Company is targeting gross margin of 93 percent and an operating margin of 31 percent. In addition, Adobe expects
its tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 to be 35.5 percent, and decline to 34 percent in fiscal 2001.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: lack of market
acceptance of new products and upgrades; delays in shipment of the Company&#146;s new products and major new versions of existing products; introduction of new products by major competitors; declines in the average selling price of the Company&#146;s
products; industry transitions to new distribution, business and information delivery models; ongoing weakness in the Company&#146;s printing business due to product transitions; and adverse economic conditions in any of the major countries in which the
Company does business. For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties, readers should refer to the Company&#146;s SEC filings including the 1999 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed by the Company in 2000.
