ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

     Effective May 30, 1997, the Registrant has changed its state of 
incorporation from California to Delaware. This change in its state of 
incorporation was approved by the holders of a majority of Registrant's 
outstanding shares of Common Stock at the Registrant's annual meeting of 
shareholders on April 9, 1997.

     Upon reincorporation in the State of Delaware, the Registrant merged 
into and is continuing its business as a Delaware corporation. The 
Reincorporation will not result in any change in the Registrant's business, 
assets or liabilities, will not cause Registrant's corporate headquarters to 
be moved and will not result in any relocation of management or other 
employees.

     Shareholders will not be required to undertake a mandatory exchange of 
the Registrant's shares. Certificates for Registrant's shares will 
automatically represent an equal number of shares in the Delaware company 
upon completion of the merger.

                                  SIGNATURES:


     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the 
registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the 
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

                                       Adobe Systems Incorporated
                                            (Registrant)
