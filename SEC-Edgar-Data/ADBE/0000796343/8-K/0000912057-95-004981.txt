ITEM 5.   OTHER EVENTS.

     On June 22, 1995, Adobe Systems Incorporated (the "Company") entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger
Agreement") by and among the Company, J Acquisition Corporation, a California
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), and
Frame Technology Corporation, a California corporation ("Frame"), pursuant to
which Merger Agreement the Merger Sub will be merged (the "Merger") with and
into Frame.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (including,
without limitation, approval by the shareholders of Frame) upon the effective
time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Frame (other
than shares held in the treasury of Frame, owned by the Registrant or Merger
Sub or held by persons who exercise their dissenters' rights under California
Law) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted automatically into
the right to receive 0.52 shares of common stock of the Registrant.  As a
result of the Merger, Frame will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Registrant.

     The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit

                AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

    AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION,  dated as of June 22, 1995
(this "AGREEMENT"), among ADOBE  SYSTEMS INCORPORATED, a California  corporation
("PARENT"),  J ACQUISITION  CORPORATION, a  California corporation  and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER  SUB"), and FRAME TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION,  a
California corporation (the "COMPANY"),

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

    WHEREAS,  the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each determined  that  it  is advisable  and  in  the best  interests  of  their
respective  shareholders for  Parent to acquire  the Company upon  the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

    WHEREAS, in  furtherance of  such acquisition,  the Boards  of Directors  of
Parent,  Merger Sub and the Company have each approved the merger (the "MERGER")
of Merger  Sub with  and into  the  Company in  accordance with  the  California
Corporations  Code  ("CALIFORNIA LAW")  and upon  the terms  and subject  to the
conditions set forth herein;

    WHEREAS, Parent,  Merger  Sub and  the  Company intend,  by  executing  this
Agreement,  to adopt a plan of reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368
of the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986, as  amended  (the  "CODE"),  and  the
regulations  thereunder, and  to cause  the Merger  and the  Upstream Merger (as
defined in Section 1.01(b)) to qualify as a reorganization under the  provisions
of Section 368(a) of the Code;

    WHEREAS,  for  accounting  purposes,  it is  intended  that  the transaction
contemplated hereby  shall be  accounted for  as a  pooling of  interests  under
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP");

    WHEREAS,  pursuant to the Merger, each  outstanding share (a "SHARE") of the
Company's common stock,  no par  value (the  "COMPANY COMMON  STOCK"), shall  be
converted  into the  right to  receive the  Merger Consideration  (as defined in
Section 1.07(b)), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
and

    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of  the foregoing and the mutual  covenants
and  agreements  herein contained,  and intending  to  be legally  bound hereby,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                  THE MERGERS

    SECTION 1.01.   THE  MERGERS.   (a) At  the Effective  Time (as  defined  in
Section  1.02 hereof), and subject to and  upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and  California Law,  Merger Sub  shall be  merged with  and into  the
Company,  the separate  corporate existence of  Merger Sub shall  cease, and the
Company shall  continue  as  the  surviving  corporation.  The  Company  as  the
surviving  corporation after the Merger is  hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"; provided that, in  the event of an Upstream  Merger
(as such term is defined in Section 1.01(b) hereof) or in the event of a Forward
Merger  (as defined in  Section 8.04 hereof),  Parent shall be  deemed to be the
"Surviving Corporation".

    (b)  UPSTREAM MERGER.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.02), Parent shall cause the Surviving  Corporation
to  be merged  with and  into Parent (the  "Upstream Merger"),  and Parent shall
continue as the surviving corporation after the Upstream Merger.

    SECTION 1.02.    EFFECTIVE TIME.    As  promptly as  practicable  after  the
satisfaction  or waiver of the  conditions set forth in  Article VI, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be  consummated by filing this Agreement, or  a
merger  agreement  as  contemplated  by  Section  1101  of  the  California  Law
<PAGE>
(the  "MERGER  AGREEMENT"),  with  the  Secretary  of  State  of  the  State  of
California,  in such form  as required by,  and executed in  accordance with the
relevant provisions  of, California  Law  (the time  of  such filing  being  the
"EFFECTIVE TIME").

    SECTION  1.03.  EFFECT OF THE MERGER.   At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and  the
applicable  provisions of California Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,  rights,
privileges,  powers and franchises of  the Company and Merger  Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the  Company
and  Merger Sub shall become the debts,  liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

    SECTION 1.04.    ARTICLES OF  INCORPORATION;  BY-LAWS.   (a)    ARTICLES  OF
INCORPORATION.   Unless  otherwise determined by  Parent prior  to the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time the Articles  of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as  in
effect  immediately  prior  to the  Effective  Time,  shall be  the  Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as  provided
by  law and such Articles of Incorporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Article I of
the Articles of Incorporation of the  Surviving Corporation shall be amended  to
read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Frame Technology Corporation".

    (b)   BY-LAWS.  The By-Laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time,  shall be  the By-Laws  of the  Surviving Corporation  until
thereafter  amended as provided by California Law, the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation and such By-Laws.

    SECTION 1.05.    DIRECTORS  AND  OFFICERS.   The  directors  of  Merger  Sub
immediately  prior to the Effective  Time shall be the  initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to  hold office in accordance  with the Articles  of
Incorporation  and By-Laws  of the  Surviving Corporation,  and the  officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified.

    SECTION 1.06.  EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

    (a)    CONVERSION  OF  SECURITIES.    Each  Share  issued  and   outstanding
immediately  prior  to the  Effective  Time (excluding  any  Shares held  in the
treasury of  the  Company  or owned  by  Parent,  Merger Sub  or  any  of  their
subsidiaries  and any Dissenting Shares (as  defined in Section 1.08)) shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any  action on the part of the holder  thereof,
be  converted into the  right to receive  0.52 shares (the  "EXCHANGE RATIO") of
validly issued, fully  paid and  nonassessable common  stock, no  par value,  of
Parent ("PARENT COMMON SHARES").

    (b)   CANCELLATION.   All Shares to  be converted into  Parent Common Shares
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section  1.06 shall, by virtue of the  Merger
and  without  any  action  on the  part  of  the holders  thereof,  cease  to be
outstanding, be canceled and retired  and cease to exist,  and each holder of  a
certificate  (a  "CERTIFICATE") representing  any  such Shares  shall thereafter
cease to  have any  rights with  respect to  such Shares,  except the  right  to
receive  for  each of  the Shares,  upon  the surrender  of such  Certificate in
accordance with  Section 1.07,  the Merger  Consideration and  cash in  lieu  of
fractional Parent Common Shares as contemplated by Section 1.06(g).

    (c)   SHARES OWNED  BY PARENT, ETC.   Each Share  issued and outstanding and
owned by Parent, Merger  Sub or any of  their subsidiaries immediately prior  to
the  Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the  holder thereof, cease  to be outstanding,  be canceled and  retired
without payment of any consideration therefor and cease to exist.

    (d)   ASSUMPTION OF STOCK  OPTIONS.  All options  to purchase Company Common
Stock then  outstanding  under  the  Company's  Dual  Stock  Option  Plan,  1991
Directors'  Stock  Option Plan  and 1994  Directors Stock  Option Plan  shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Sections 5.05.

                                       2
<PAGE>
    (e)  CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB.  Each share of common stock, no par value,
of Merger Sub  issued and outstanding  immediately prior to  the Effective  Time
shall  be converted into  and exchanged for  one validly issued,  fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.
Each stock certificate  of Merger Sub  evidencing ownership of  any such  shares
shall  continue to  evidence ownership  of such shares  of capital  stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

    (f)  ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO.  The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect fully  the effect  of any  stock split,  reverse split,  stock  dividend
(including  any dividend or  distribution of securities  convertible into Parent
Common Shares  or Company  Common  Stock), reorganization,  recapitalization  or
other  like change with respect to Parent  Common Shares or Company Common Stock
occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

    (g)  FRACTIONAL SHARES.  No fraction of a share of Parent Common Shares will
be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled  to a fraction  of a share  of Parent Common  Shares
(after  aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Shares to be received
by such holder)  shall receive from  Parent an  amount of cash  (rounded to  the
nearest  whole cent) equal  to the product  of (i) such  fraction, multiplied by
(ii) the average of  the last reported  sale price for  trades of Parent  Common
Shares  on the Nasdaq National Market (the "NNM")  as of each of the thirty (30)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding  the Effective Time as quoted  in
the  Wall Street Journal  or other reliable  financial newspaper or publication.
For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a "TRADING DAY" means a day on which
trading generally takes place on the NNM  and on which trading in Parent  Common
Shares has occurred.

    SECTION 1.07.  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.  (a)  EXCHANGE AGENT.  Parent shall
supply,  or shall cause to be supplied, to or for the account of a bank or trust
company designated by Parent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), in trust for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares), for exchange
in accordance with this Section  1.07, through the Exchange Agent,  certificates
evidencing  the  Parent  Common  Shares issuable  pursuant  to  Section  1.06 in
exchange for outstanding Shares.

    (b)   EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.   As  soon as  reasonably practicable  after  the
Effective  Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange  Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a  Certificate or Certificates (i)  a letter of transmittal  (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates  shall pass, only  upon proper delivery of  the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and  shall be  in such  form and  have such  other provisions  as
Parent  may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange  for the certificates  evidencing shares of  Parent
Common  Shares  and,  in  lieu  of any  fractional  shares  thereof,  cash. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together  with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as
may  be required pursuant  to such instructions, the  holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to  receive in exchange  therefor (A) certificates  evidencing
that  number of whole  Parent Common Shares  which such holder  has the right to
receive in accordance with the Exchange Ratio in respect of the Shares  formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any dividends or other distributions to which
such  holder is entitled  pursuant to Section  1.07(c), and (C)  cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common  Shares to which  such holder is  entitled pursuant  to
Section  1.06(g) (the  Parent Common  Shares, dividends,  distributions and cash
described in this clause (C)  being, collectively, the "MERGER  CONSIDERATION"),
and  the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer  of ownership  of Shares  which  is not  registered in  the  transfer
records  of the Company as of the  Effective Time, Parent Common Shares and cash
may be issued and paid in accordance with this Article I to a transferee if  the
Certificate   evidencing  such  Shares  is  presented  to  the  Exchange  Agent,
accompanied by  all documents  required  to evidence  and effect  such  transfer
pursuant  to  this Section  1.07(b) and  by evidence  that any  applicable stock
transfer  taxes  have  been  paid.   Until  so  surrendered,  each   outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of the Company
Common Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes,  other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the
number of

                                       3
<PAGE>
full shares of Parent Common Shares into which such shares of the Company Common
Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in
lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.06.

    (c)  DISTRIBUTIONS  WITH RESPECT  TO UNEXCHANGED  SHARES.   No dividends  or
other  distributions declared or  made after the Effective  Time with respect to
Parent Common Shares with a record date  after the Effective Time shall be  paid
to  the  holder  of  any  unsurrendered Certificate  until  the  holder  of such
Certificate  shall  surrender  such  Certificate.  Subject  to  applicable  law,
following  surrender of any such Certificate, there  shall be paid to the record
holder of the  certificates representing  whole shares of  Parent Common  Shares
issued  in exchange therefor,  without interest, at the  time of such surrender,
the amount of  dividends or  other distributions with  a record  date after  the
Effective  Time theretofore  paid with  respect to  such whole  shares of Parent
Common Shares.

    (d)  TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP.  If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Shares is  to be  issued in  a name  other than  that in  which the  Certificate
surrendered  in exchange therefor is  registered, it will be  a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate  so surrendered will be properly  endorsed
and  otherwise in proper form  for transfer and that  the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any person designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required by reason  of the issuance of  a certificate for shares  of
Parent Common Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate  surrendered, or  established to the  satisfaction of  Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

    (e)  NO  LIABILITY.  Neither  Parent, Merger  Sub nor the  Company shall  be
liable  to any holder of  Company Common Stock for  any Merger Consideration (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public  official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

    (f)  WITHHOLDING RIGHTS.  Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent  shall be  entitled to deduct  and withhold from  the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant  to this Agreement  to any holder  of Company  Common
Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the
extent  that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having  been paid to the holder of the  Shares
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

    SECTION 1.08.  DISSENTING SHARES.  (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement  to the contrary, any shares of capital stock of the Company held by a
holder who has exercised dissenters' rights  for such shares in accordance  with
California  Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn
or lost such dissenters'  rights ("DISSENTING SHARES"),  shall not be  converted
into  or represent a right  to receive Parent Common  Shares pursuant to Section
1.06, but  the holder  thereof shall  only be  entitled to  such rights  as  are
granted by California Law.

    (b)  Notwithstanding  the provisions  of subsection  (a),  if any  holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) his dissenters' rights, then, as of the later of Effective Time or
the occurrence  of  such event,  such  holder's shares  shall  automatically  be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without  interest  thereon, upon  surrender of  the certificate  or certificates
representing such Dissenting Shares.

    (c) The Company shall give Parent  (i) prompt notice of any written  demands
received  by the Company  to require the  Company to purchase  shares of capital
stock of the  Company, withdrawals of  such demands, and  any other  instruments
served  pursuant  to California  Law and  received  by the  Company and  (b) the
opportunity to participate in all  negotiations and proceedings with respect  to
such  demands. The Company shall  not, except with the  prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with  respect to any such demands or  offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

                                       4
<PAGE>
    (d)  Prior to  the consummation  of the  Upstream Merger,  the Company shall
establish an escrow account with a financial institution selected by the  Parent
and  the Company shall fund such escrow account with cash or cash equivalents in
an amount sufficient to make all payments to holders of Dissenting Shares.  Such
escrow  account shall  survive the Merger  and Upstream Merger.  All payments to
holders of Dissenting Shares shall  be made out of  such escrow account, and  no
such payments shall be made or otherwise funded by Parent.

    SECTION  1.09.  NO  FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS  IN COMPANY COMMON  STOCK.  The
Merger Consideration  delivered upon  the surrender  for exchange  of Shares  in
accordance  with  the terms  hereof (including  any cash  in lieu  of fractional
shares paid in  respect thereof) shall  be deemed  to have been  issued in  full
satisfaction  of all  rights pertaining  to such Shares,  and there  shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation  for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

    SECTION  1.10.  LOST,  STOLEN OR DESTROYED  CERTIFICATES.  In  the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange  for such  lost, stolen  or destroyed  Certificates, upon  the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent
Common  Shares  and cash  for  fractional shares,  if  any, as  may  be required
pursuant to Section 1.06; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent may, in its  discretion
and  as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver  a bond in such sum as it  may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent
or  the Exchange  Agent with  respect to the  Certificates alleged  to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

    SECTION 1.11.   TAX  AND ACCOUNTING  CONSEQUENCES.   It is  intended by  the
parties  hereto that the Merger  and the Upstream Merger  shall (a) constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code and (b) qualify for
accounting treatment as a  pooling of interests under  GAAP. The parties  hereto
hereby  adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

    SECTION 1.12.  TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION.  Each of  Parent,
Merger  Sub and the Company  will take all such  reasonable and lawful action as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in  accordance
with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective
Time,  any  such further  action  is necessary  or  desirable to  carry  out the
purposes of  this Agreement  and to  vest the  Surviving Corporation  with  full
right,  title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of  the
Company  and Merger  Sub are  fully authorized in  the name  of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and  necessary
action.

                                   ARTICLE II

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

    The  Company hereby represents  and warrants to Parent  and Merger Sub that,
except as set forth in the  written disclosure schedule previously delivered  by
the Company to Parent (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"):

    SECTION  2.01.  ORGANIZATION  AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) Each of
the Company  and  its subsidiaries  is  a corporation  duly  organized,  validly
existing  and  in  good standing  under  the  laws of  the  jurisdiction  of its
incorporation and has  the requisite  corporate power  and authority  and is  in
possession   of  all  franchises,  grants,  authorizations,  licenses,  permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("APPROVALS")  necessary
to  own, lease and operate  the properties it purports  to own, operate or lease
and to carry  on its business  as it is  now being conducted,  except where  the
failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power,
authority  and Approvals  would not,  individually or  in the  aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined

                                       5
<PAGE>
below). Each of the Company and  its subsidiaries is duly qualified or  licensed
as  a  foreign corporation  to do  business, and  is in  good standing,  in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated  by
it  or  the  nature of  its  activities  makes such  qualification  or licensing
necessary, except for such failures to be  so duly qualified or licensed and  in
good  standing that would not,  either individually or in  the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. When used in connection with the Company or any of  its
subsidiaries,  the term  "MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT" means  any change  or effect
that, individually or when taken together with all other such changes or effects
that have occurred prior to the date  of determination of the occurrence of  the
Material  Adverse Effect, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to
the business,  assets  (including  intangible assets),  financial  condition  or
results  of operations of the Company and  its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. A
true and complete list of all  of the Company's subsidiaries, together with  the
jurisdiction  of incorporation  of each  subsidiary and  the percentage  of each
subsidiary's  outstanding  capital  stock  owned  by  the  Company  or   another
subsidiary,  is set  forth in Section  2.01 of the  Company Disclosure Schedule.
Except as set  forth in  Section 2.01 of  the Company  Disclosure Schedule,  the
Company  does not directly or indirectly own  any equity or similar interest in,
or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any  equity
or  similar interest  in, any corporation,  partnership, joint  venture or other
business association or entity.

    SECTION 2.02.   ARTICLES  OF INCORPORATION  AND BY-LAWS.   The  Company  has
heretofore  furnished to Parent a  complete and correct copy  of its Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws,  as amended  to date,  and equivalent  organizational
documents  of each of its subsidiaries.  Such Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws
and equivalent organizational documents of each of its subsidiaries are in  full
force  and  effect.  Neither the  Company  nor  any of  its  subsidiaries  is in
violation of any of the provisions  of its Articles of Incorporation or  By-Laws
or equivalent organizational documents.

    SECTION  2.03.  CAPITALIZATION.  The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 20,000,000 shares  of Company Common Stock  and 2,000,000 shares  of
undesignated  preferred  stock,  no  par value,  of  the  Company  (the "COMPANY
PREFERRED STOCK"). As of June 21, 1995, (i) 15,031,549 shares of Company  Common
Stock  were issued and outstanding, all of  which are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable,  (ii)  no  shares  of  Company  Common  Stock  were  held  by
subsidiaries  of the Company, (iii) 564,258  shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved for future issuance pursuant  to outstanding employee stock options  or
stock  purchase  rights  granted pursuant  to  the Company's  Dual  Stock Option

pursuant  to the Company's 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (vi) 41,049 shares
of Company Common  Stock were reserved  for issuance pursuant  to the  Company's
1994  Directors Stock Option Plan and (vii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock
were issued  or  outstanding. No  material  change in  such  capitalization  has
occurred  between May 10, 1995 and the date  hereof. As of the date hereof, none
of the shares of  Company Preferred Stock is  issued and outstanding. Except  as
set  forth in this  Section 2.03 or Section  2.11 or in  Section 2.03 or Section
2.11 of  the Company  Disclosure Schedule,  or  pursuant to  the terms  of  that
certain  Agreement and  Plan Reorganization,  dated as of  May 24,  1995, by and
among the  Company, VI  Acq. Corp.,  a California  corporation, and  Mastersoft,
Inc.,  an Arizona corporation ("MASTERSOFT") (the "MASTERSOFT AGREEMENT"), there
are  no  options,  warrants  or   other  rights,  agreements,  arrangements   or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of
the  Company or any of its subsidiaries or  obligating the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to issue, register or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests  in, the  Company or  any of  its subsidiaries.  All shares  of
Company  Common Stock  subject to  issuance as  aforesaid, upon  issuance on the
terms and conditions  specified in the  instruments pursuant to  which they  are
issuable,   shall   be  duly   authorized,  validly   issued,  fully   paid  and

of Company Common Stock  or the capital  stock of any  subsidiary or to  provide
funds  to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in any such subsidiary or  any other entity other than guarantees  of
bank  obligations  of  subsidiaries  entered  into  in  the  ordinary  course of
business. All

                                       6
<PAGE>
of the outstanding  shares of  capital stock (other  than directors'  qualifying
shares)  of  each  of the  Company's  subsidiaries is  duly  authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares (other than  directors'
qualifying shares) are owned by the Company or another subsidiary free and clear
of  all security interests,  liens, claims, pledges,  agreements, limitations in
the Company's  voting  rights,  charges  or other  encumbrances  of  any  nature
whatsoever.

    SECTION  2.04.  AUTHORITY RELATIVE  TO THIS AGREEMENT.   The Company has all
necessary corporate power and  authority to execute  and deliver this  Agreement
and  to perform  its obligations  hereunder and  to consummate  the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no  other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement  or to  consummate the  transactions so  contemplated (other  than the
approval and  adoption  of the  Merger  by the  holders  of a  majority  of  the
outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock  entitled to vote in accordance with
California Law and the  Company's Articles of  Incorporation and By-Laws).  This
Agreement  has been duly and validly executed  and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company.

    SECTION 2.05.   NO CONFLICT;  REQUIRED FILINGS  AND CONSENTS.   (a)  Section
2.05(a)  of the  Company Disclosure Schedule  includes a list  of all agreements
heretofore filed with the SEC as a "material contract" and all agreements which,
as of the date hereof, will be required to be filed with the SEC as a  "material
contract" (the "MATERIAL CONTRACTS") of the Company and its subsidiaries.

    (b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company shall not, (i) conflict with or
violate the Articles  of Incorporation or  By-Laws or equivalent  organizational
documents  of the  Company or  any of  its subsidiaries,  (ii) conflict  with or
violate any law, rule, regulation, order,  judgment or decree applicable to  the
Company  or any of its  subsidiaries or by which its  or any of their respective
properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or  constitute
a  default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default), or impair the Company's rights  or alter the rights or obligations  of
any  third party under, or give to  others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or  cancellation  of,  any  Material Contract,  or  result  in  the
creation  of a  lien or encumbrance  on any of  the properties or  assets of the
Company or  any of  its  subsidiaries pursuant  to,  any note,  bond,  mortgage,
indenture,  contract,  agreement,  lease, license,  permit,  franchise  or other
instrument or obligation to which  the Company or any  of its subsidiaries is  a
party  or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their
respective properties  is  bound or  affected,  except for  any  such  breaches,
defaults  or other occurrences that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect.

    (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,  and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company shall not, require any consent,
approval,  authorization or  permit of, or  filing with or  notification to, any
governmental or  regulatory  authority,  domestic or  foreign,  except  (i)  for
applicable  requirements, if any, of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"SECURITIES ACT"),  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the
"EXCHANGE  ACT"),  state  securities  laws  ("BLUE  SKY  LAWS"),  the pre-merger
notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT"), and the filing and recordation of  appropriate
merger  or other  documents as  required by  California Law  and (ii)  where the
failure to obtain  such consents,  approvals, authorizations or  permits, or  to
make  such filings or notifications, would  not prevent or delay consummation of
the Merger, or  otherwise prevent  the Company from  performing its  obligations
under this Agreement, and would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

    SECTION  2.06.  COMPLIANCE; PERMITS.  (a) Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is in conflict with,  or in default or  violation of, (i) any  law,
rule,  regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of

or  affected, or (ii) any note,  bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement,
lease,

Company  or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries  or its  or any  of  their respective  properties is  bound  or
affected, except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

    (b)  The Company and its subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, easements,
variances,  exemptions,  consents,  certificates,  orders  and  approvals   from
governmental  authorities which are material to the operation of the business of
the Company and its subsidiaries taken as  a whole as it is now being  conducted
(collectively,  the "COMPANY PERMITS"). The Company  and its subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except where the failure to so
comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

    SECTION 2.07.  SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  (a) The Company has filed
all forms, reports and  documents required to be  filed with the Securities  and
Exchange  Commission ("SEC") since February 12,  1992, and has made available to

Exchange Act, as the case may be, and  (ii) did not at the time they were  filed
(or  if amended or superseded  by a filing prior to  the date of this Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary  in
order  to make the statements  therein, in the light  of the circumstances under
which they were  made, not  misleading. None  of the  Company's subsidiaries  is
required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

    (b)  Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports was prepared  in
accordance  with  GAAP  applied on  a  consistent basis  throughout  the periods
involved (except  as may  be indicated  in the  notes thereto)  and each  fairly
presented   the  consolidated  financial   position  of  the   Company  and  its
subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results  of
its  operations  and  cash flows  for  the  periods indicated,  except  that the
unaudited interim  financial  statements  were  or are  subject  to  normal  and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material
in  amount and  did or do  not contain all  footnotes that would  be required by
GAAP.

    (c) The Company has  heretofore furnished to Parent  a complete and  correct
copy  of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with the
SEC but  which are  required to  be  filed, to  agreements, documents  or  other
instruments which previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

destruction or  loss of  any assets  (tangible or  intangible) of  the  Company,
(whether or not covered by insurance) that could have a Material Adverse Effect;
or  (iv)  any  sale  of  a  material  amount  of  property  (including,  without
limitation, intellectual property) of the Company, except in the ordinary course
of business.

Section  2.09 of  the Company Disclosure  Schedule and the  Company SEC Reports,
neither the Company nor any of  its subsidiaries has any liabilities  (absolute,
accrued,  contingent or otherwise) which are,  in the aggregate, material to the
business, operations or financial condition of the Company and its  subsidiaries

<PAGE>

consider the Merger (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING") (such proxy statement/

STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS"),  shall not,  on the date  the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(or  any  amendment  thereof   or  supplement  thereto)   is  first  mailed   to
shareholders,  at  the time  of  the Company  Shareholders'  Meeting, or  at the
Effective Time, contain any statement  which, at such time  and in light of  the

Agreement, there is no material agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree
binding upon  the  Company  or  any  of its  subsidiaries  which  has  or  could
reasonably  be  expected  to  have  the  effect  of  prohibiting  or  materially

                                       10
<PAGE>
impairing any business practice of the  Company or any of its subsidiaries,  any

of  business by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as currently conducted or

    SECTION 2.15.   TITLE  TO PROPERTY.    The Company  owns no  real  property.
Section  2.15 of the Company Disclosure Statement sets forth a true and complete
list of all  real property  leased by  the Company  or any  of its  subsidiaries
requiring annual lease payments of more than $100,000, and the aggregate monthly
rental  or  other fee  payable under  such lease.  The Company  and each  of its
subsidiaries have  good and  defensible title  to all  of their  properties  and
assets,  free and clear of all liens,  charges and encumbrances except liens for
taxes not yet due and payable and such liens or other imperfections of title, if
any, as  do not  materially detract  from the  value of  or interfere  with  the
present  use of the property  affected thereby or which,  individually or in the
aggregate, would not have  a Material Adverse Effect;  and, to the knowledge  of
the Company, all leases pursuant to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
lease  from others material  amounts of real  or personal property,  are in good
standing, valid and  effective in  accordance with their  respective terms,  and
there  is not, under any of such  leases, any existing material default or event
of default  (or  event which  with  notice or  lapse  of time,  or  both,  would
constitute  a  material default  and in  respect  of which  the Company  or such
subsidiary has  not  taken  adequate  steps  to  prevent  such  a  default  from
occurring)   except  where  the  lack  of   such  good  standing,  validity  and
effectiveness or the  existence of such  default or event  of default would  not
have  a  Material Adverse  Effect. All  the  facilities of  the Company  and its
subsidiaries, except such as  may be under construction,  are in good  operating
condition  and repair, except  where the failure of  such plants, structures and
equipment to  be  in  such  good  operating  condition  and  repair  would  not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

    SECTION  2.16.  TAXES.  (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "TAX" or "TAXES"
shall mean  taxes,  fees, levies,  duties,  tariffs, imposts,  and  governmental
impositions  or charges  of any  kind in  the nature  of (or  similar to) taxes,
payable to  any federal,  state, local  or foreign  taxing authority,  including
(without limitation) (i) income, franchise, profits, gross receipts, AD VALOREM,
net  worth, value added, sales, use, service, real or personal property, capital
stock, license,  payroll,  withholding, employment,  social  security,  workers'
compensation, unemployment compensation, utility, severance, production, excise,
stamp, occupation, premiums, windfall profits, transfer and gains taxes and (ii)
interest,  penalties and additions to tax imposed with respect thereto; and "TAX
RETURNS" shall mean returns, reports, and information statements with respect to
Taxes required to be filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority,  domestic
or  foreign, including,  without limitation, consolidated,  combined and unitary
tax returns.

    (b) The Company on behalf of itself and all its affiliates hereby represents
that, other  than as  disclosed on  Section 2.16(b)  of the  Company  Disclosure
Schedule:  the Company and its "affiliates"  (excluding for the purposes of this
Section 2.16 only  officers, directors and  10% or greater  shareholders of  the
Company)  have filed all United States federal income tax and all other material
tax returns required to  be filed by  them, and the  Company and its  affiliates
have paid and discharged all Taxes due in connection with or with respect to the
filing  of all Tax Returns and have paid all other Taxes as are due, except such
as are being contested in good  faith by appropriate proceedings (to the  extent
any  such proceedings  are required)  and with respect  to which  the Company is
maintaining reserves to the extent  currently required in all material  respects
adequate  for their payment except to the extent  the failure to do so would not
have a Material  Adverse Effect.  The Company and  each of  its affiliates  have
disclosed  to the relevant taxing authority any position it has taken where such
disclosure would enable  such person  to avoid  penalties or  additions to  tax.
Neither the IRS nor any other taxing authority or agency is now asserting or, to
the  best of the Company's knowledge,  threatening to assert against the Company
or any of its affiliates any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes other than
additional Taxes with respect  to which the Company  is maintaining reserves  in
all  material respects adequate for their payment, and there are no requests for
information currently outstanding that could affect the Taxes of the Company  or
any affiliates. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates is currently being
audited  by any taxing  authority. There are no  tax liens on  any assets of the
Company

                                       11
<PAGE>
or any affiliate. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has granted  any
waiver  of any  statute of limitations  with respect  to, or any  extension of a
period for  the assessment  of, any  Tax. The  accruals and  reserves for  taxes
reflected  in the 1994  Balance Sheet are  in all material  respects adequate to
cover all  Taxes accruable  through  the date  thereof (including  interest  and
penalties,  if  any,  thereon  and Taxes  being  contested)  in  accordance with
generally accepted accounting  principles. Neither  the Company nor  any of  its
affiliates  is required to  include in income  (i) any amount  in respect of any
adjustment under  Section  481  of  the Code,  (ii)  any  deferred  intercompany
transaction  or (iii) any  installment sale gain, where  the inclusion in income
would result in a tax liability  materially in excess of the reserves  therefor.
Neither  the Company nor any of its affiliates has given a consent under Section
341(f) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates is a party  to
a  tax  sharing or  allocation  agreement nor  does the  Company  or any  of its
affiliates owe any amount under any such agreement. Neither the Company nor  any
of  its affiliates is, or  has been at any time,  a "United States real property
holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

    (c) The Company on behalf of itself and all its affiliates hereby represents
that, other  than as  disclosed on  Section 2.16(c)  of the  Company  Disclosure
Schedule, and other than with respect to items the inaccuracy of which would not
have a Material Adverse Effect: Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates is
a party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that may result, separately or
in  the aggregate, in the  payment of any "excess  parachute payment" within the
meaning of  Section 280G  of  the Code,  determined  without regard  to  Section
280G(b)(4)  of the Code. Except  as disclosed on Section  2.16(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no acceleration  of the vesting  schedule for any  property
that  is  substantially unvested  within the  meaning  of the  regulations under
Section  83  of  the  Code  will  occur  in  connection  with  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates is
or  has been subject to any accumulated earnings tax or personal holding company
tax. Neither the  Company nor  any of  its affiliates  owns stock  in a  passive
foreign  investment  company within  the meaning  of Section  1296 of  the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of  its affiliates is obligated under any  agreement
with  respect to industrial development bonds  or other obligations with respect
to which the excludibility  from gross income of  the holder for federal  income
tax  purposes  could be  affected  by the  transactions  contemplated hereunder.
Neither the  Company nor  any  of its  affiliates  has an  unrecaptured  overall
foreign  loss  within  the  meaning  of  Section  904(f)  of  the  Code  or  has
participated in or cooperated with  an international boycott within the  meaning
of  Section 999 of the Code. Neither the  Company nor any of its affiliates owns
any property of  a character, the  transfer of which  would give rise  to (x)  a
revaluation  of such property for purposes of  any AD VALOREM or similar tax, or
(y) any documentary, stamp or other transfer tax. Neither the Company nor any of
its affiliates  has  an "excess  loss  account"  for purposes  of  the  treasury
regulations promulgated under Section 1502 of the Code.

    (d)  Within ten days after the date  hereof, the Company will make available
to Parent or its legal counsel for inspection copies of all income and sales and
use tax returns for all periods since the date of the Company's incorporation.

    SECTION 2.17.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   Except as set forth in Section  2.17
of  the  Company  Disclosure  Schedule,  and except  in  all  cases  as,  in the
aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a  Material

knowledge  (i)  have  obtained  all  applicable  permits,  licenses  and   other
authorization  which are required under Federal, state or local laws relating to

approved thereunder; (iii)  as of the  date hereof,  are not aware  of nor  have
received  notice  of  any event,  condition,  circumstance,  activity, practice,
incident, action or plan which is reasonably likely to interfere with or prevent
continued compliance or  which would give  rise to any  common law or  statutory
liability, or otherwise form the basis of any claim, action, suit or proceeding,
based  on or resulting from the Company's or  any of its subsidiary's (or any of
their respective agent's) manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment,
storage, disposal,  transport,  or  handling, or  the  emission,  discharge,  or
release  into the  environment, of any  pollutant, contaminant,  or hazardous or
toxic material  or  waste; and  (iv)  have  taken all  actions  necessary  under
applicable requirements of Federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations to

based  upon arrangements made  by or on  behalf of the  Company. The Company has

shall  omit  to  state  any  material  fact  necessary,  in  the  light  of  the
circumstances under which it was made, in order to make the statements herein or

    SECTION  2.20.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  (a) The Company owns, or is licensed
or  otherwise  possesses  legally  enforceable   rights  to  use  all   patents,

                                  ARTICLE III

            REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

    Parent  and Merger Sub hereby, jointly  and severally, represent and warrant
to the Company  that, except  as set forth  in the  written disclosure  schedule
previously   delivered  by  Parent  to   the  Company  (the  "PARENT  DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE"):

    SECTION 3.01.  ORGANIZATION  AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) Each  of
Parent  and each  of its subsidiaries  is a corporation  duly organized, validly
existing and  in  good  standing under  the  laws  of the  jurisdiction  of  its
incorporation  and has  the requisite  corporate power  and authority  and is in
possession of all Approvals necessary to  own, lease and operate the  properties
it  purports to own, operate or lease and to  carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where  the failure to be  so organized, existing and  in
good  standing  or  to  have  such power,  authority  and  Approvals  would not,
individually or in  the aggregate, have  a Material Adverse  Effect (as  defined
below).  Each  of Parent  and  each of  its  subsidiaries is  duly  qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation  to do business, and  is in good standing,  in
each  jurisdiction  where  the  character of  its  properties  owned,  leased or
operated by  it or  the nature  of its  activities makes  such qualification  or
licensing  necessary,  except  for such  failures  to  be so  duly  qualified or
licensed and in  good standing  that would not,  either individually  or in  the
aggregate,  have a Material Adverse Effect.  When used in connection with Parent
or any of its subsidiaries, the term "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any  change
or  effect that, individually or when taken together with all such other changes
or effects  that  have  occurred prior  to  the  date of  determination  of  the
occurrence  of the  Material Adverse  Effect, is or  is reasonably  likely to be
materially adverse  to  the  business,  assets  (including  intangible  assets),
financial  condition or  results of operations  of Parent  and its subsidiaries,
taken as a  whole. A true  and complete  list of all  of Parent's  subsidiaries,
together  with  the jurisdiction  of incorporation  of  each subsidiary  and the
percentage of each  subsidiary's outstanding  capital stock owned  by Parent  or
another  subsidiary,  is set  forth  in Section  3.01  of the  Parent Disclosure
Schedule.

    SECTION 3.02.  ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS.  Parent has heretofore
furnished to  the  Company  a complete  and  correct  copy of  its  Articles  of
Incorporation   and  the  By-Laws,   as  amended  to   date.  Such  Articles  of
Incorporation, By-Laws and  equivalent organizational documents  of each of  its
subsidiaries  are  in full  force  and effect.  Neither  Parent nor  any  of its
subsidiaries is  in  violation of  any  of the  provisions  of its  Articles  of
Incorporation or By-Laws or equivalent organizational documents.

    SECTION  3.03.   CAPITALIZATION.  (a)   As  of June 2,  1995, the authorized
capital stock of  Parent consisted of  (i) 200,000,000 shares  of Parent  Common

                                       15
<PAGE>
and outstanding, no shares were held in treasury, 7,507,825 shares were reserved
for  issuance pursuant to  outstanding options under  Parent stock option plans,
6,000,000 shares were  reserved for  issuance under  Parent's Employee  Purchase
Plan,  its 1994 Performance  and Restricted Stock Plan  and its Restricted Stock
Option Plan and (ii) 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, no par value, none  of
which were issued and outstanding. No material change in such capitalization has
occurred  between June 2, 1995 and the date hereof. The authorized capital stock
of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, no par value, 100 shares
of which,  as  of the  date  hereof, are  issued  and outstanding.  All  of  the
outstanding  shares of Parent's  and Merger Sub's  respective capital stock have
been duly authorized and  validly issued and are  fully paid and  nonassessable.
Except  as set  forth in  this Section 3.03  of the  Parent Disclosure Schedule,
there are  no options,  warrants or  other rights,  agreements, arrangements  or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of
Parent  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  or  obligating  Parent  or  any  of  its
subsidiaries to issue or sell  any shares of capital  stock of, or other  equity
interests in, Parent or any of its subsidiaries.

    (b)  The shares of Parent  Common Stock to be  issued pursuant to the Merger
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and  shall

    SECTION  3.04.  AUTHORITY  RELATIVE TO THIS  AGREEMENT.  Each  of Parent and
Merger Sub  has all  necessary  corporate power  and  authority to  execute  and
deliver  this  Agreement  and  to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  and  to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.  The execution and delivery  of
this  Agreement by  Parent and  Merger Sub  and the  consummation by  Parent and
Merger Sub of the  transactions contemplated hereby have  been duly and  validly
authorized  by all necessary corporate  action on the part  of Parent and Merger
Sub and no other corporate proceedings on  the part of Parent or Merger Sub  are
necessary  to  authorize this  Agreement or  to  consummate the  transactions so
contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Parent and  Merger  Sub  and,  assuming the  due  authorization,  execution  and
delivery  by the Company,  constitutes a legal, valid  and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub.

    SECTION 3.05.  NO  CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND  CONSENTS.  (a) Parent  is
not,  as of the  date hereof, a  party to any  agreement that is  required to be
filed with the  SEC as  a "material  contract" which has  not been  so filed  or
provided to the Company.

    (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not,  and the performance of this Agreement  by Parent and Merger Sub shall not,
(i)  conflict  with  or  violate  the  Articles  of  Incorporation,  By-Laws  or
equivalent  organizational documents of Parent or  any of its subsidiaries, (ii)
conflict with or violate  any law, rule, regulation,  order, judgment or  decree
applicable  to  Parent  or any  of  it subsidiaries  or  by which  its  or their
respective properties are bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or  an event which  with notice or lapse  of time or  both
would  become a default) under, or impair Parent's rights or alter the rights or
obligations of  any  third  party  under,  or  give  to  others  any  rights  of
termination,  amendment,  acceleration  or  cancellation of,  or  result  in the
creation of a lien or encumbrance on  any of the properties or assets of  Parent
or  any  of it  subsidiaries  pursuant to,  any  material note,  bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract,  agreement,  lease,  license, permit,  franchise  or  other
instrument  or obligation to which Parent or  any of its subsidiaries is a party
or by which Parent or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of their  respective
properties  are bound  or affected,  except for  any such  breaches, defaults or
other occurrences  that would  not, individually  or in  the aggregate,  have  a
Material Adverse Effect.

    (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not,  and the performance of this Agreement  by Parent and Merger Sub shall not,
require any consent,  approval, authorization or  permit of, or  filing with  or
notification  to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign,
except (i)  for applicable  requirements, if  any, of  the Securities  Act,  the
Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR
Act  and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger or other documents as

                                       16
<PAGE>
required by California Law and (ii)  where the failure to obtain such  consents,
approvals,  authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
would not prevent  or delay  consummation of  the Merger,  or otherwise  prevent
Parent  or Merger  Sub from performing  their respective  obligations under this
Agreement, and would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

    SECTION 3.06.  SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  (a) Parent has filed  all
forms,  reports and documents  required to be  filed with the  SEC since June 1,
1994, and has heretofore delivered  to the Company, in  the form filed with  the

accordance  with the requirements of the Securities  Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended  or
superseded  by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state  a
material  fact required to be  stated therein or necessary  in order to make the
statements therein, in  the light  of the  circumstances under  which they  were
made,  not misleading.  None of  Parent's subsidiaries  is required  to file any
forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

    (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each  case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports has been prepared
in  accordance with  GAAP applied on  a consistent basis  throughout the periods
involved (except  as may  be indicated  in the  notes thereto)  and each  fairly
presents  the consolidated financial position of  Parent and its subsidiaries as
at the respective dates thereof and  the consolidated results of its  operations
and  cash flows  for the  periods indicated,  except that  the unaudited interim
financial statements  were  or are  subject  to normal  and  recurring  year-end
adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material in amount.

    (c)  Parent has heretofore  furnished to the Company  a complete and correct
copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed with  the
SEC  but  which are  required to  be  filed, to  agreements, documents  or other
instruments which previously had been filed  by Parent with the SEC pursuant  to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

    SECTION  3.07.  ABSENCE  OF CERTAIN CHANGES  OR EVENTS.   Since November 25,

or  loss of any assets of the Parent, (whether or not covered by insurance) that

assets of Parent, except in the ordinary course of business.

    SECTION  3.08.  REGISTRATION STATEMENT; PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.  Subject

Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger will be registered with the  SEC
shall  not, at the time the  Registration Statement (including any amendments or
supplements thereto)  is  declared effective  by  the SEC,  contain  any  untrue
statement  of a material  fact or omit  to state any  material fact necessary in
order to make  the statements included  therein, in light  of the  circumstances
under  which they were made, not  misleading. The information supplied by Parent
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not, on the date the Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus  is first  mailed  to shareholders,  at  the time  of  the
Company  Shareholders' Meeting and at the  Effective Time, contain any statement
which, at such time and  in light of the circumstances  under which it shall  be
made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or shall omit to
state  any material fact necessary  in order to make  the statements therein not
false or misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect

                                       17
<PAGE>
to the solicitation of proxies for  the Company Shareholders' Meeting which  has
become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
relating  to Parent, Merger Sub or  any of their respective affiliates, officers
or directors should be discovered  by Parent or Merger  Sub which should be  set
forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus,  Parent or  Merger Sub  will promptly  inform the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and  Merger Sub make no representation  or
warranty  with  respect to  any  information supplied  by  the Company  which is

    SECTION 3.11.  FULL DISCLOSURE.   No statement contained in any  certificate
or  schedule furnished or to be furnished by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company
in, or pursuant to the provisions  of, this Agreement contains or shall  contain
any  untrue statement  of a material  fact or omits  or shall omit  to state any
material fact necessary, in  the light of the  circumstances under which it  was
made, in order to make the statements herein or therein not misleading.

    SECTION 3.12.  OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR.  Parent has been advised by its
financial advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, that in its opinion, as of
the  date hereof, the Exchange  Ratio is fair from a  financial point of view to
Parent and has delivered a written copy of such opinion to the Company.

    SECTION 3.13.  TAXES.  Parent, on  behalf of itself and all its  affiliates,
hereby  represents that each of them have filed all United States federal income
tax and all other material  tax returns required to be  filed by them, and  have
paid  and discharged  all Taxes due  in connection  with or with  respect to the
filing of all Tax Returns and have paid all other Taxes as are due, except  such
as  are being contested in good faith  by appropriate proceedings (to the extent
any such  proceedings  are  required)  and  with  respect  to  which  Parent  is
maintaining  reserves to the extent currently  required in all material respects
adequate for their payment except to the  extent the failure to do so would  not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

    SECTION  3.14.  NO UNDISCLOSED  LIABILITIES.  Except as  is disclosed in the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and the Parent SEC Reports, neither Parent nor any of
its subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise
including, without  limitation, liabilities  arising under  or with  respect  to
ERISA, environmental or labor laws) which are, in the aggregate, material to the
business, operations or financial condition of Parent and its subsidiaries taken
as  a  whole, except  liabilities (a)  adequately provided  for in  the Parent's
audited balance sheet (including any related  notes thereto) as of November  25,

property  affected thereby or which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

    SECTION 3.17.   INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY.   Parent  owns,  or is  licensed  or
otherwise  possesses legally enforceable rights  to use all patents, trademarks,
trade  names,  service  marks,   copyrights,  and  any  applications   therefor,

tangible  or intangible  proprietary information  or material  that are  used or
proposed to be used in the business  of the Parent as currently conducted or  as
proposed  to be conducted by Parent, except where the failure to so own, license

and the Upstream Merger, or (c) the Forward Merger, as a pooling of interests.

        (p)  take, or agree in writing or  otherwise to take, any of the actions

    this Agreement untrue or incorrect or prevent the Company from performing or
    cause the Company not to perform its covenants hereunder.

    SECTION 4.02.  NO  SOLICITATION.  (a)   The Company  shall not, directly  or
indirectly,  through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of
the Company or any of its  subsidiaries, solicit or encourage (including by  way
of  furnishing  nonpublic  information)  the  initiation  of  any  inquiries  or
proposals regarding any merger,  sale of substantial assets,  sale of shares  of
capital stock

                                       21
<PAGE>
(including  without limitation by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions
involving the Company or any subsidiaries  of the Company (any of the  foregoing
inquiries  or proposals being referred to  herein as an "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL");
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing  contained in this  Agreement shall prevent  (i)
the  Board of Directors of  the Company in the  exercise of its fiduciary duties
and after receiving  the advice  of outside  counsel, from  referring any  third
party  to this Section 4.02 or from making a copy of this Section 4.02 available
to any third party or (ii) after receiving the advice of outside counsel to  the
effect  that the Board of  Directors is required to do  so in order to discharge
properly its fiduciary duties, from  considering, negotiating and approving  and
recommending  to the shareholders  of the Company  another unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal which the Board of  Directors of the Company determines  in
good  faith, after consultation  with its financial advisors,  would result in a
transaction more favorable  to the Company's  shareholders than the  transaction
contemplated  by this Agreement (any such Acquisition Proposal being referred to
herein as a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL").

    (b) The  Company  shall  immediately  notify Parent  after  receipt  of  any
Acquisition  Proposal or any  request for nonpublic  information relating to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any  subsidiary
by  any person or entity  that informs the Board of  Directors of the Company or
such subsidiary  that it  is considering  making, or  has made,  an  Acquisition
Proposal.  Such notice to Parent  shall be made orally  and in writing and shall
indicate in reasonable  detail the  identity of the  offeror and  the terms  and
conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact.

    (c) If the Board of Directors of the Company receives a request for material
nonpublic  information by a party who makes a bona fide Acquisition Proposal and
the Board  of  Directors of  the  Company determines  that  such proposal  is  a
Superior  Proposal and,  after receiving  the advice  of outside  counsel to the
effect that the Board  of Directors has a  fiduciary obligation to provide  such
information to such party, then, and only in such case, the Company may, subject
to  the execution  of a  confidentiality and  standstill agreement substantially
similar to that  then in  effect between the  Company and  Parent, provide  such
party with access to information regarding the Company.

    (d)  The  Company shall  immediately cease  and cause  to be  terminated any
existing discussions or  negotiations with  any parties (other  than Parent  and
Merger  Sub)  conducted heretofore  with respect  to any  of the  foregoing. The
Company agrees  not to  release  any third  party  from any  confidentiality  or
standstill agreement to which the Company is a party.

    (e)  The Company agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that the officers,
directors and employees of the Company  and its subsidiaries and any  investment
banker  or other advisor or representative retained  by the Company are aware of
the restrictions described in this Section.

    SECTION 4.03.  CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY PARENT PENDING THE MERGER.  During the
period from the date of this Agreement  and continuing until the earlier of  the
termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent covenants and agrees
that,  unless the Company shall otherwise agree in writing, Parent shall conduct
its business, and cause the businesses  of its subsidiaries to be conducted,  in
the  ordinary course  of business,  other than  actions taken  by Parent  or its
subsidiaries  in  contemplation  of  the  Merger,  and  shall  not  directly  or
indirectly  do, or propose to do, any of the following without the prior written
consent of the Company:

        (a) amend or otherwise change Parent's Articles of Incorporation;

        (b) acquire or agree  to acquire, by merging  or consolidating with,  by
    purchasing  an equity interest in  or a portion of the  assets of, or by any
    other manner, any business or  any corporation, partnership, association  or
    other  business organization  or division  thereof, or  otherwise acquire or
    agree to acquire any assets  of any other person, or  agree to dispose of  a
    material  portion of its assets, which, in each case, would materially delay
    or prevent  the  consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
    Agreement;

                                       22
<PAGE>
        (c) take any action other than in the ordinary course of business and in
    a  manner consistent with past practice  with respect to accounting policies
    or procedures  (including, without  limitation, procedures  with respect  to
    revenue  recognition,  the  capitalization  of  software  development costs,
    payments of accounts payable and collection of accounts receivable);

        (d) declare, set aside, make or  pay any dividend or other  distribution
    (whether  in cash, stock or property  or any combination thereof) in respect
    of any of its capital stock, except that a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
    may declare and  pay a dividend  to its  parent and except  that Parent  may
    declare  and pay  cash dividends of  $0.05 per quarter  consistent with past
    practice; or

        (e) take or agree in writing or otherwise to take any action which would
    make any of the  representations or warranties of  Parent contained in  this
    Agreement  untrue or  incorrect or prevent  Parent from  performing or cause
    Parent not to perform its covenants hereunder.

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

    SECTION 5.01.    PROXY  STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS; REGISTRATION  STATEMENT.    As
promptly  as practicable after the execution  of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall prepare  and file with  the SEC preliminary  proxy materials  which
shall  constitute the Proxy Statement of the Company (the "PROXY STATEMENT") and
the Registration  Statement of  the Parent  with respect  to the  Parent  Common
Shares  to be issued in  connection with the Merger.  As promptly as practicable
after comments are received from the SEC thereon and after the furnishing by the
Company and Parent  of all  information required  to be  contained therein,  the
Company  and Parent shall  file with the  SEC a combined  proxy and registration
statement on Form  S-4 (or  on such  other form  as shall  be appropriate)  (the
"REGISTRATION  STATEMENT")  relating  to  the approval  of  the  Merger  and the
transactions contemplated hereby by  the shareholders of  the Company and  shall
use  all  reasonable  efforts  to cause  the  Registration  Statement  to become
effective as soon thereafter as  practicable. The Proxy Statement shall  include
the  recommendation of  the Board of  Directors of  the Company in  favor of the
Merger, subject to the proviso in Section 4.02(a).

    SECTION 5.02.  COMPANY  SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING.   The Company shall  promptly
after  the date hereof  take all action necessary  in accordance with California
Law and  its  Articles  of  Incorporation and  Bylaws  to  convene  the  Company
Shareholders'  Meeting. The Company shall consult with  Parent as to the date of
the Company Shareholders' Meeting and shall not postpone or adjourn (other  than
for the absence of a quorum or, after consulting with Parent, to comply with the
disclosure  requirements  of the  1934  Act) the  Company  Shareholders' Meeting
without the consent  of Parent. Subject  to the proviso  in Section 4.02(a)  and
5.01(a),  the Company shall use its best efforts to solicit from shareholders of
the Company proxies  in favor  of the  Merger and  shall take  all other  action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of shareholders required by
California law to effect the Merger.

    SECTION 5.03.  ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.  (a)  Upon reasonable
notice  and subject to  restrictions contained in  confidentiality agreements to
which such party is subject (from which such party shall use reasonable  efforts
to  be released),  the Company and  Parent each  shall (and shall  cause each of
their subsidiaries to) afford to  the officers, employees, accountants,  counsel
and  other representatives  of the other,  reasonable access,  during the period
prior  to  the  Effective  Time,  to  all  its  properties,  books,   contracts,
commitments  and records  and, during such  period, the Company  and Parent each
shall (and shall cause  each of their subsidiaries  to) furnish promptly to  the
other  all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request, and  each party shall make available to  the
other  party the  appropriate individuals (including  attorneys, accountants and
other professionals) for  discussion of such  party's business, properties,  tax
situation and personnel as the other party may reasonably request.

                                       23
<PAGE>
    (b)  Each party shall keep such  information confidential in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,  dated June 7, 1995, between  Parent
and the Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

    SECTION  5.04.  CONSENTS; APPROVALS.  The  Company and Parent shall each use
their best efforts to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders  (including,   without  limitation,   all  United   States  and   foreign
governmental  and regulatory rulings and approvals),  and the Company and Parent
shall make all filings (including,  without limitation, all filings with  United
States  and foreign governmental or  regulatory agencies) required in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the  Company
and Parent and the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each  party's use  of best  efforts shall not  include any  obligation to divest
assets or enter into  consent or similar decrees.  The Company and Parent  shall
furnish  all information required to be included  in the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement,  or for  any  application or  other  filing to  be  made
pursuant  to  the  rules  and  regulations  of  any  United  States  or  foreign
governmental body  in  connection with  the  transactions contemplated  by  this
Agreement.

    SECTION  5.05.   STOCK OPTIONS;  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (a)   At the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a
"COMPANY OPTION") under the  Company's Dual Stock  Option Plan, 1991  Directors'
Stock  Option  Plan and  1994 Directors  Stock Option  Plan (the  "COMPANY STOCK
OPTION PLANS"), whether  vested or  unvested, will  be assumed  by Parent.  Each
Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have,
and  be subject to,  the same terms  and conditions set  forth in the applicable
Company Stock Option Plan immediately prior  to the Effective Time, except  that
(i)  such Company Option will be exercisable  for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Shares equal  to the product  of the number  of shares of  Company
Common  Stock that were purchasable under  such Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective  Time multiplied  by the Exchange  Ratio, rounded  down to  the
nearest  whole number of shares of Parent  Common Shares, and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of  Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise  of
such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the  exercise price  per share  of Company  Common Stock  at which  such Company
Option was exercisable immediately prior to  the Effective Time by the  Exchange
Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

    (b)  It is the intention of the  parties that the Company Options assumed by
Parent qualify following the  Effective Time as ISOs  to the extent the  Company
Options  qualified as ISOs  prior to the  Effective Time. Parent  shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent
Common Shares for delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 5.05.

    (c) Parent  shall file  and cause  to become  effective not  later than  the
Effective  Time a registration  statement under the Securities  Act of 1933 with
respect to  the assumption  by Parent  of  the Company  Options referred  to  in
Section  5.05 and  with respect  to the  issuance of  Parent Common  Shares upon
exercise of  those options  and to  keep such  registration statement  effective
throughout the term of such options.

    (d)  Parent shall  take such  reasonable actions  as are  necessary to allow
eligible employees of  the Company  to participate  in the  benefit programs  of
Parent,  or  alternative  benefit  programs  substantially  comparable  to those
applicable to employees of Parent on similar terms, as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time (with  credit, where appropriate for  prior service with  the
Company).

    (e)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will adopt  and implement  the  arrangements listed  on  Exhibit A  hereto  with
respect to the individuals listed on Exhibit A hereto.

    SECTION 5.06.  COMPANY EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  (a)  The Company shall
take  such actions as are necessary to cause  the Exercise Date (as such term is
used in the  Company's 1991  Employee Stock  Purchase Plan  (the "COMPANY  STOCK
PURCHASE PLAN"), applicable to the then current

                                       24
<PAGE>
Offering Period (as such term is used in the Company Stock Purchase Plan), to be
the  last trading day  on which the Parent  Common Shares are  traded on the NNM
immediately prior to  the Effective  Time (the "FINAL  COMPANY PURCHASE  DATE");
PROVIDED,  THAT, such change in the Exercise  Date shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the  Merger. On  the Final  Company Purchase  Date, the  Company
shall  apply the funds credited as of such date under the Company Stock Purchase
Plan within each participant's payroll  withholdings account to the purchase  of
whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company
Stock  Purchase Plan. The cost to each participant in the Company Stock Purchase
Plan for shares of Company Common Stock shall be 85% of the lower of the closing
sale price of Company Common Stock on the  NNM on (i) the first day of the  then
current  Offering Period or (ii)  the last trading day on  or prior to the Final
Company Purchase Date.

    (b) Employees of the Company as of the Effective Time shall be permitted  to
participate  in Parent's  Employee Stock Purchase  Plan commencing  on the first
enrollment date following  the Effective  Time, subject to  compliance with  the
eligibility  provisions  of  such  plan (with  employees  receiving  credit, for
purposes of such eligibility provisions, for service with the Company).

    SECTION 5.07.   AGREEMENTS  OF AFFILIATES.   The  Company shall  deliver  to
Parent, prior to the date the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities  Act, a letter  (the "AFFILIATE LETTER")  identifying all persons who
are, or may  deemed to be,  at the  time of the  Company Shareholders'  Meeting,
"affiliates"  of the Company for purposes of  Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
The Company shall use its best efforts to cause each person who is identified as
an "affiliate"  in the  Affiliate Letter  to  deliver to  Parent, prior  to  the
Effective  Time, a written agreement (an "AFFILIATE AGREEMENT") in substantially
the form of Exhibit B hereto.

    SECTION 5.08.  INDEMNIFICATION.  (a)   The Articles of Incorporation of  the
Surviving   Corporation   shall   contain  the   provisions   with   respect  to
indemnification set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period  of
six  years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder  of individuals  who  at the  Effective Time  were  directors,
officers,  employees  or  agents of  the  Company, unless  such  modification is
required by law.

    (b) The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable  law
or  under the Company's  Articles of Incorporation or  By-Laws and regardless of
whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and after the
Effective Time,  Parent and  the  Surviving Corporation  shall, to  the  fullest
extent  permitted under  applicable law or  under the Parent's  or the Surviving
Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, indemnify and hold harmless,
each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent of  the
Company  or any  of its  subsidiaries (collectively,  the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
against any costs  or expenses  (including attorneys'  fees), judgments,  fines,
losses,   claims,  damages,  liabilities  and  amounts  paid  in  settlement  in
connection with any  claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation,  whether
civil,  criminal, administrative or investigative, to  the extent arising out of
or pertaining  to  any action  or  omission in  their  capacity as  a  director,
officer,  employee, fiduciary  or agent  of the  Company occurring  prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated  by
this Agreement) for a period of six years after the date hereof. In the event of
any  such  claim, action,  suit,  proceeding or  investigation  (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties for any period after the Effective Time shall be reasonably satisfactory
to the Surviving  Corporation and  Parent, (ii)  after the  Effective Time,  the
Surviving  Corporation and Parent shall pay  the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel,  promptly after  statements therefor  are received  and (iii)  the
Surviving  Corporation  and Parent  will cooperate  in the  defense of  any such
matter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,  that neither  the Surviving  Corporation nor  Parent
shall  be liable for any settlement  effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and PROVIDED FURTHER, that, in  the
event  that any claim or claims for  indemnification are asserted or made within
such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim
or claims shall continue until the disposition  of any and all such claims.  The
Indemnified    Parties   as   a   group   may   retain   only   one   law   firm

                                       25
<PAGE>
to represent  them with  respect to  any single  action unless  there is,  under
applicable  standards  of professional  conduct, a  conflict on  any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

    (c) The Surviving  Corporation and  Parent shall  honor and  fulfill in  all
respects  the obligations of the  Company pursuant to indemnification agreements
with the  Company's directors  and officers  set forth  on Section  5.08 of  the
Company  Disclosure Schedule and existing at or before, and as in effect on, the
Effective Time.

    (d) For a period of three years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation  to use  its best efforts  to maintain  in effect,  if
available,  directors' and officers' liability  insurance covering those persons
who are currently covered  by the Company's  directors' and officers'  liability
insurance  policy (a copy of  which has been heretofore  delivered to Parent) on
terms comparable to those applicable to the then current directors and  officers
of  Parent,  or (ii)  those  now applicable  to  directors and  officers  of the
Company, whichever is more favorable  to such directors and officers;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by the  Company
for  such coverage, and provided further, that  if the premium for such coverage
exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase a policy
with the greatest coverage available for such 150% of the annual premium.

    (e) This Section  shall survive any  termination of this  Agreement and  the
consummation  of the Merger  at the Effective  Time, is intended  to benefit the
Company, the Surviving  Corporation and  the Indemnified Parties,  and shall  be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation.

    SECTION  5.09.   NOTIFICATION OF  CERTAIN MATTERS.   The  Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,  of
(i)  the  occurrence,  or  non-occurrence,  of  any  event  the  occurrence,  or
non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue  or inaccurate and (ii) any failure  of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy
any  covenant, condition  or agreement  to be complied  with or  satisfied by it
hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery  of any notice pursuant to  this
Section  shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.

    SECTION 5.10.    FURTHER ACTION/TAX  TREATMENT.   Subject  to  Section  5.04
hereof, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto  shall use  all reasonable  efforts to  take, or  cause to  be taken, all
actions and to do, or  cause to be done, all  other things necessary, proper  or
advisable  to  consummate  and make  effective  as promptly  as  practicable the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, to obtain in  a timely manner  all
necessary   waivers,  consents  and  approvals   and  to  effect  all  necessary
registrations and filings, and to otherwise satisfy or cause to be satisfied all
conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that  the  withdrawal  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  of   its
recommendation  of the Merger  after receiving the advice  of outside counsel to
the effect  that the  Board  of Directors  is  required to  do  so in  order  to
discharge  properly its fiduciary duties, shall  not constitute a breach of this
covenant by the Company. Each  of Parent, Merger Sub  and the Company shall  use
its best efforts to cause (a) the Merger, (b) the Merger and the Upstream Merger
and  (c) the  Forward Merger  to qualify,  and will  not (both  before and after
consummation of such  merger or mergers)  take any actions  which could  prevent
such merger or mergers from qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions
of  Section 368 of  the Code. Each of  Parent, Merger Sub  and the Company shall
report the Merger, the Merger and the Upstream Merger, or the Forward Merger, as
applicable, as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the  Code
and,  to the extent permitted,  on all state and  local Tax returns, filed after
the Effective Time. In  the event that the  Company has not acquired  Mastersoft
prior  to  the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall  execute  the  amendment  to the
Mastersoft Agreement referred to in Section 6.02(f) upon execution and  delivery
thereof by the Company and Mastersoft.

    SECTION  5.11.  PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.   Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any  public
statements with respect to the

                                       26
<PAGE>
Merger  or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which  shall
not  be unreasonably withheld; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,  that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, issue  such press release or make such  public
statement  as may upon the advice of counsel  be required by law or the National
Association of Securities Dealers,  Inc., if it has  used reasonable efforts  to
consult with the other party.

    SECTION 5.12.  POOLING ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.  Each of Parent and the Company
agrees  not to take any action that would adversely affect the ability of Parent
to treat the Merger, the Merger and the Upstream Merger, or the Forward  Merger,

                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

    SECTION  6.01.    CONDITIONS  TO  OBLIGATION OF  EACH  PARTY  TO  EFFECT THE
MERGER.  The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall  be
subject  to the satisfaction at or prior  to the Effective Time of the following
conditions:

        (a) EFFECTIVENESS  OF  THE  REGISTRATION STATEMENT.    The  Registration
    Statement shall have been declared effective by the SEC under the Securities
    Act.  No  stop  order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of  the  Registration
    Statement shall have  been issued  by the SEC  and no  proceedings for  that
    purpose  and no similar  proceeding in respect of  the Proxy Statement shall
    have been initiated or threatened by the SEC;

        (b) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  This Agreement and the Merger shall have been
    approved and  adopted by  the  requisite vote  of  the shareholders  of  the
    Company;

        (c)   HSR  ACT.    The  applicable  waiting  period  applicable  to  the
    consummation of the  Merger under  the HSR Act  shall have  expired or  been
    terminated;

        (d)  NO INJUNCTIONS OR RESTRAINTS; ILLEGALITY.  No temporary restraining
    order, preliminary  or permanent  injunction or  other order  issued by  any
    court  of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition (an
    "Injunction") preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in  effect,
    nor  shall any proceeding brought by any administrative agency or commission
    or other  governmental authority  or instrumentality,  domestic or  foreign,
    seeking  any of the foregoing be pending;  and there shall not be any action
    taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered,  enforced
    or  deemed applicable  to the  Merger, which  makes the  consummation of the
    Merger illegal;

        (e) ACCOUNTANTS' POOLING LETTERS.  Each of the Company and Parent  shall
    have  received letters dated as of the Effective Date from Ernst & Young LLP
    and KPMG Peat Marwick to the effect that whichever is effectuated of (i) the
    Merger, (ii) the Merger and the Upstream Merger and (iii) the Forward Merger
    qualifies for pooling  of interests accounting  treatment if consummated  in
    accordance with the Agreement; and

        (f)  TAX OPINIONS.   Parent and the Company  shall have received written
    opinions of  Shearman &  Sterling and  Wilson, Sonsini,  Goodrich &  Rosati,
    Professional  Corporation,  respectively, in  form and  substance reasonably
    satisfactory to them to the effect that whichever is effectuated of (i)  the
    Merger, (ii) the Merger and the Upstream Merger and (iii) the Forward Merger
    will  constitute a reorganization  within the meaning of  Section 368 of the
    Code. In rendering such opinions, counsel may rely upon representations  and
    certificates of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

    respectively, equal to the product of  (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii)  that
    number  of Shares or options to purchase  that number of Shares, as the case

I.   COVERED EMPLOYEES: (a) The term  "Covered Employees" means L. George Klaus,
    William R. Pieser,  Thomas F. Kelly,  Harold E. Julsen,  Robert F.  Donohue,
    Steven J. Sherman, Charles N. Corfield and Noreen G. Bergen.

        The  term "performance  options" means  the non-qualified  stock options
    granted to  Messrs. Klaus,  Pieser, Kelly,  Julsen, Donohue  and Sherman  on
    6/8/93  (1660), 10/11/93  (2347), 9/9/93 (001742),  9/10/93 (1744), 12/31/93
    (2375) and 7/1/94 (2476), respectively.

        (b) CONSULTING/EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENTS.   On or  prior to  the  Effective
    Time,  Parent and the  Surviving Corporation shall offer  to enter into with
    each Covered Employee  a consulting  (employment, for  Mr. Klaus)  agreement
    which  shall (i) provide that such  Covered Employee will provide consulting
    and transition services to Parent  and/or the Surviving Corporation  through
    March  31,  1997  or such  earlier  time as  all  but 25%  of  the remaining
    performance options of such Covered Employee  shall have vested (or, in  the
    case  of Mr.  Klaus and  Mr. Kelly,  until June  30 and  September 30, 1997,
    respectively), (ii) be in consideration  of the payments referred to  below,
    (iii)    contain   a   non-compete   provision   for   the   term   of   the
    consulting/employment agreement and other mutually acceptable provisions and
    provide that vesting of  such covered Employee's  stock options (other  than
    performance  options and the options held by  Mr. Klaus and Mr. Kelly) shall
    cease twelve  months  after  the  termination  of  such  Covered  Employee's
    full-time  employment with the  Company subject to Section  IV hereof in the
    case  of   Mr.   Klaus   and   Mr.   Kelly.   During   the   term   of   the
    consulting/employment  agreement,  each  Covered Employee  will  be  free to
    render services to third parties so  long as the rendering thereof does  not
    violate  the non-competition clause of such  agreement or interfere with the
    level of service agreed to by such Covered Employee. If a Covered Employee's
    full-time employment with the Surviving Corporation and/or Parent terminates
    within the twelve-month period following the Effective Time (or at any  time
    in  the case of Mr. Klaus, Mr. Kelly or Mr. Donohue) (other than, except for
    Mr. Klaus, Mr. Kelly or Mr. Donohue, (i) voluntary termination (which  shall
    exclude  termination by  the Covered  Employee as a  result of  (A) a salary
    reduction, (B) a significant diminution  in such Covered Employee's  status,
    responsibilities  or  duties  and  (C)  constructive  termination)  or  (ii)
    termination as a result  of death or disability  of such Covered  Employee),
    THEN  such Covered Employee shall be entitled to receive consulting payments
    equal  to  twelve  (12)  months  base  salary,  calculated  at  the  Covered
    Employee's  monthly rate of compensation in  effect immediately prior to the
    Effective Time and one year's targeted bonus in effect immediately prior  to
    the  Effective Time (not  pro-rated for prior  partial periods). The payment
    referred to  in this  subsection shall  be in  lieu of  any other  severance
    benefits  (excluding  COBRA) of  Parent,  the Surviving  Corporation  or the
    Company and,  in the  case of  Mr. Kelly  or Mr.  Klaus, severance  benefits
    contained  in  existing  agreements  (other  than  the  medical continuation
    provided for  in  Section 1(d)  of  Mr. Klaus'  employment  agreement).  The
    payment  shall  be, at  Parent's option,  in  a lump  sum or  twelve monthly
    installments (except that such  payment shall be made  to Messrs. Klaus  and
    Kelly  in twelve  monthly installments) and  shall be net  of all applicable
    withholding and similar taxes.

II. SEPTEMBER 9, 1993 EMPLOYMENT LETTER WITH  MR. THOMAS KELLY.  On or prior  to
    the  Effective  Time, Parent  will  consent to  an  amendment to  Mr. Thomas
    Kelly's September 9, 1993 employment  agreement with the Company to  provide
    for  the consulting payments referred to in I above, which shall replace the
    severance payments set forth in paragraph (a) of such agreement.

III. PERFORMANCE SHARES:   All unvested performance shares  shall be assumed  by
    Parent  as provided in Section 5.05 of the Merger Agreement; PROVIDED, THAT,
    on or  prior  to the  Effective  Time  mutually acceptable  changes  to  the
    performance  criteria (designed to take into  account the Merger) shall have
    been agreed to by Parent and each respective optionholder.

IV. KLAUS AND KELLY  OPTIONS:  Pursuant  to Section 2(e) of  Mr. Klaus' June  8,
    1993  Employment  Agreement,  as amended,  and  Section (e)  of  Mr. Kelly's
    September 9, 1993 Employment Agreement, as

                                      A-1
<PAGE>
    amended, each with the Company, and each of which will be assumed by  Parent
    or  the Surviving Corporation  (other than certain  provisions thereof which
    are superseded by the provisions hereof),  each of Mr. Klaus and Mr.  Kelly,
    respectively,  agrees  to defer  acceleration of  a  portion of  his Company
    Options that would otherwise  be accelerated upon a  "change of control"  so
    that  such  options continue  to vest  during the  term of  their respective
    employment and consulting agreements in accordance with their terms.

V.  1995 BONUS:   Parent agrees that, immediately  prior to the Effective  Time,
    the  Company shall be entitled to pay 75%  of the amounts which have (if the
    Effective Time is after September 30, 1995) or would have (if the  Effective
    Time is before September 30, 1995) been earned under any bonus plans for the
    Covered  Employees, including any applicable accelerators as applied to such
    nine month period PROVIDED, THAT, the Company will give Parent prior  notice
    of the amount thereof.

VI.  GENERAL:   Parent and  the Company  agree that  (i) they  shall, subject to
    Section 2(e)  of Mr.  Klaus' employment  agreement and  Section (e)  of  Mr.
    Kelly's employment agreement, modify the arrangements specified in I through
    V above to the extent that the implementation of any such arrangements would
    cause  the  breach of  Section 5.12  of  the Merger  Agreement or  impose an
    unanticipated cost or tax on Parent, the Company or the relevant individuals
    and (ii) any such  modification shall as closely  as possible replicate  the
    economic  effects  of  I through  V  above consistent  with  compliance with
    Section 5.12 of the Merger Agreement and amelioration of such costs.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Pursuant   to  the   terms  of  the   Agreement  and  Plan   of  Merger  and
Reorganization, dated as of June  22, 1995 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT";  capitalized
terms  used herein and not  otherwise defined are used  herein as defined in the
Merger Agreement), among  Adobe Systems Incorporated,  a California  corporation
("CHIP"),   J Acquisition Corporation, a California corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent  ("SUB"), and  Frame Technology  Corporation, a  California
corporation (the "COMPANY"), Parent will acquire the Company through a merger of
Sub  with  and  into  the  Company (the  "MERGER").  Subject  to  the  terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding shares of
the common stock, no par value (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), of the Company will
be converted into the right to receive shares of the common stock, no par  value
(the  "PARENT COMMON STOCK"),  of Parent, on  the basis described  in the Merger
Agreement.

    The undersigned has been advised that as of the date hereof it may be deemed
to be an "affiliate" of the Company, as the term "affiliate" is (i) defined  for
the  purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations
(the "RULES AND  REGULATIONS") of  the Securities and  Exchange Commission  (the
"COMMISSION")  under the Securities Act of  1933, as amended (the "ACT"), and/or
(ii) used in  and for purposes  of Accounting  Series Releases 130  and 135,  as
amended, and Staff Accounting Bulletins 65 and 76, of the Commission.

    The   undersigned  understands  that  the  representations,  warranties  and
covenants set  forth herein  will  be relied  upon  by Parent,  shareholders  of
Parent,  the Company,  other shareholders  of the  Company and  their respective
counsel and accounting firms.

    The undersigned represents and warrants to and agrees with Parent that:

        1.  The undersigned has full power to execute and deliver this Agreement
    and to make  the representations and  warranties herein and  to perform  its
    obligations hereunder.

        2.   The  undersigned has carefully  read this Agreement  and the Merger
    Agreement and, to the extent  the undersigned felt necessary, discussed  its
    requirements  and  other applicable  limitations upon  its ability  to sell,
    transfer or otherwise  dispose of Parent  Common Stock with  its counsel  or
    counsel for the Company.

        3.    The  undersigned  shall  not  make  any  sale,  transfer  or other
    disposition of Parent Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules  and
    Regulations.

        4.   The  undersigned has  been advised that  the issuance  of shares of
    Parent Common Stock  to the undersigned  in connection with  the Merger  has
    been  or  will  be  registered  with  the  Commission  under  the  Act  on a
    Registration Statement on Form S-4.  However, the undersigned has also  been
    advised  that, since, at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the
    shareholders of the Company  the undersigned may be  deemed to have been  an
    affiliate  of the  Company and  the distribution  by the  undersigned of any
    Parent Common Stock has not been  registered under the Act, the  undersigned
    may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to
    the  undersigned  in the  Merger  unless (i)  such  sale, transfer  or other
    disposition has been registered under the  Act, (ii) such sale, transfer  or
    other  disposition is made  in conformity with the  requirements of Rule 145
    promulgated by the  Commission under  the Act, or  (iii) in  the opinion  of
    counsel  reasonably  acceptable  to  Parent, such  sale,  transfer  or other
    disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

                                      B-1
<PAGE>
        5.  Parent  is under  no obligation to  register the  sale, transfer  or
    other disposition of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned or on its behalf
    under  the  Act or  to  take any  other action  necessary  in order  to make
    compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

        6.  Stop transfer instructions will be given to Parent's transfer agents
    with respect to the Parent Common Stock and that there will be placed on the
    certificates for the Parent Common Stock  issued to the undersigned, or  any
    substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

           "THE  SHARES  REPRESENTED  BY  THIS  CERTIFICATE  WERE  ISSUED  IN  A
       TRANSACTION TO WHICH  RULE 145  PROMULGATED UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT  OF
       1933  APPLIES. THE  SHARES REPRESENTED  BY THIS  CERTIFICATE MAY  ONLY BE
       TRANSFERRED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE   TERMS  OF  AN  AGREEMENT   DATED
       [                ], 1995, BETWEEN  THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND ADOBE
       SYSTEMS INCORPORATED,  A  COPY OF  WHICH  AGREEMENT  IS ON  FILE  AT  THE
       PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED."

        7.   Unless the transfer  of the undersigned of  its Parent Common Stock
    has been registered under the Act or  is a sale made in conformity with  the
    provisions  of Rule  145, Parent reserves  the right to  place the following
    legend on the certificates issued any transferee of the undersigned:

           "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED
       UNDER  THE SECURITIES  ACT OF  1933 AND WERE  ACQUIRED FROM  A PERSON WHO
       RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER
       THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY  THE
       HOLDER  NOT  WITH  A VIEW  TO,  OR  FOR RESALE  IN  CONNECTION  WITH, ANY
       DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND
       MAY NOT BE SOLD,  PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE  TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN  ACCORDANCE
       WITH  AN EXEMPTION FROM  THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS  OF THE SECURITIES
       ACT OF 1933."

        8.  The legends set forth in  paragraphs 6 and 7 above shall be  removed
    by   delivery  of  substitute  certificates   without  such  legend  if  the
    undersigned shall have delivered to Parent a copy of a letter from the staff
    of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
    satisfactory to Parent, to the effect  that such legend is not required  for
    purposes of the Act.

        9.  The undersigned is the beneficial owner of (I.E., has sole or shared
    voting or investment power with respect to) all the shares of Company Common
    Stock  and options to  purchase shares of Company  Common Stock indicated on

    investment in, any of the following:

       thereto   or   issued   or   delivered   in   exchange   or  substitution
