ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

     In connection with the Company's recent reincorporation in the State of
Delaware, on May 30, 1997, the Company amended its Rights Agreement, dated
as of July 11, 1990, as amended by the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement
(the "First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement") dated as of April 10, 1996,
by entering into the Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of
August 14, 1997, with Harris Trust Company of California (the "Second Amended
and Restated Rights Agreement").  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Second Amended and
Restated Rights Agreement which is attached to this Current Report as an
exhibit.  The Company also amended its Bylaws (i) to change an advance notice
requirement for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of
stockholders and (ii) to provide for the ability to delegate certain functions
of the Chief Financial Officer to a Vice President Finance.

     In general, the First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement has been
amended as follows:

     1.  The exercise threshold of the Rights under the Second Amended and
Restated Rights Agreement has been lowered to 15% from 20%.  The Rights are now
exercisable if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (a "Flip-In Event").

     2.  The Rights now entitle the holder, subject to the terms of the Second
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-
thousandth of a share (a "Unit") of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $.0001
per share (the "Preferred Stock"), at a Purchase Price of $115 per Unit, subject
to adjustment.

     3.  The exchange provisions of Section 24 have been amended to provide that
the Board of Directors, at its option and under certain circumstances, may
exchange each Right for (i) one Unit of Preferred Stock or (ii) such number of
Units of Preferred Stock as will equal (x) the difference between the aggregate
market price of the number of Units of Preferred Stock to be received upon a
Flip-In Event and the Purchase Price divided by (y) the current market price per
Unit of Preferred Stock upon the Flip-In Event.

     4.  The concurrence of a majority of the Continuing Directors then in
office is required under the Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement to
give effect to any action, calculation, interpretation or determination made by
the Board of Directors of the Company in the administration of the Second
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement and the exercise of the rights or powers
granted to the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to the Second Amended
and Restated Rights Agreement and no effect shall be given

                                       3

to any such action, calculation, interpretation, determination or exercise of 
rights or powers unless at least two Continuing Directors are then in office.

       In general, the advance notice requirement of the Bylaws has been amended
to require that a notice of any stockholder proposals to be brought before an
annual meeting of stockholders must be given to the Company not later than 120
days prior to the date that the Company's proxy statement was released to
stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting.  In
addition, the Bylaws have been amended to provide for the ability to delegate
certain functions of the Chief Financial Officer to a Vice President Finance.

     A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company is attached hereto
as Exhibit 3.2 and is incorporated herein by reference, and a copy of the Second
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4 and is
incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing description of the changes to
Bylaws and the First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement does not purport to
be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and
Restated Bylaws and the Second Amended Restated Rights Agreement, respectively.

<PAGE>

     (b)  At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall 
be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.  To be 
properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be:  (A) specified 
in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the 
direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before 
the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C) 
otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.  For business 
to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the 
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary 
of the corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered 
to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the 
corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance 
of the date that the corporation's (or the corporation's predecessor's) proxy 
statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's 
annual meeting of stockholders, except that if no annual meeting was held in 
the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more 
than thirty (30) calendar days from the date contemplated at the time of the 
previous year's proxy statement, or in the event of a special meeting, notice 
by the stockholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of 
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which a notice of the 
date of the meeting was mailed or a public announcement thereof was made.  A 
stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the 
stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:  (i) a brief 
description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting 
and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the 
name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the 
stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of 
the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any 
material interest of the stockholder in such business and (v) any other 
information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to 
Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
"1934 Act"), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect 
to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a 
stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the 
regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act.  Notwithstanding anything in 
these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual 
meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph 
(b).  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, 
determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought 
before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 
(b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that 
any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be 
transacted.

     (c)  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. 
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the 
corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction 
of the Board of Directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled 
to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the 
notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c).  Such nominations, other 
than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be 
made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the corporation 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 5.  Such 


                                       2

<PAGE>

stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the 
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director:  
(A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) 
the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and 
number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such 
person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the 
stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such 
person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the 
stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is 
required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of 
directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A 
under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person's written 
consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to 
serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving 
notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this Section 5. At the request of the Board of Directors, any person 
nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the 
Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the 
stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee.  No person 
shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless 
nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c).  
The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and 
declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the 
procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he 
shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be 
disregarded.

     (d)  For purposes of this Section 5, "public announcement" shall mean 
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, 
Associated Press, Business Wire or comparable national news service or in a 
document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

     SECTION 6.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.

     (a)  Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be 
called, for any purpose or purposes, by (i) the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors, (ii) the President, (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to a 
resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors 
(whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized 
directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of 
Directors for adoption) or (iv) by the holders of shares entitled to cast not 
less than ten percent (10%) of the votes at the meeting, and shall be held at 
such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors, shall 
fix.

     (b)  If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than 
the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the 
general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be 
delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other 
facsimile transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief 
Executive Officer, or the Secretary of the corporation.  No business may be 
transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice.  
The Board of Directors shall determine the time and place of such special 
meeting, which shall be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor 


                                       3

<PAGE>

more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of the receipt of the 
request.  Upon determination of the time and place of the meeting, the 
officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given to the 
stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 
of these Bylaws.  If the notice is not given within sixty (60) days after the 
receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may set 
the time and place of the meeting and give the notice.  Nothing contained in 
this paragraph (b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the 
time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of 
Directors may be held.

     SECTION 7.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Except as otherwise provided by law or 
the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of 
stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty 
(60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote 
at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, date and hour and purpose 
or purposes of the meeting.  Notice of the time, place and purpose of any 
meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing, signed by the person 
entitled to notice thereof, either before or after such meeting, and will be 
waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person or by proxy, 
except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of 
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any 
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Any 
stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the 
proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had 
been given.

     SECTION 8.  QUORUM.  At all meetings of stockholders, except where 
otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by 
these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the 
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote 
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  In the absence of 
a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, 
either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority 
of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted 
at such meeting.  The stockholders present at a duly called or convened 
meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business 
until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to 
leave less than a quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders 
of a majority of the vote cast, excluding abstentions, at any meeting at 
which a quorum is present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the 
votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting 
and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  Where a separate vote by 
a class or classes or series is required, except where otherwise provided by 
the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a 
majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes or series, 
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled 
to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and, except where 
otherwise provided by the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or 
these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of 
the election of directors) of the votes cast, including abstentions, by the 
holders of shares of such class or classes or series shall be the act of such 
class or classes or series.

<PAGE>

     SECTION 9.  ADJOURNMENT AND NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETINGS.  Any meeting 
of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to 
time either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of 
the shares casting votes, excluding abstentions.  When a meeting is adjourned 
to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting 
if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the 
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact 
any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If 
the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment 
a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the 
adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to 
vote at the meeting.

     SECTION 10.  VOTING RIGHTS.  For the purpose of determining those 
stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as 
otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the 
stock records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 
12 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders. 
 Every person entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person 
or by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with 
Delaware law. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder.  No proxy 
shall be voted after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the 
proxy provides for a longer period.

     SECTION 11.  JOINT OWNERS OF STOCK.  If shares or other securities 
having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, 
whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in 
common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons 
have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the 
Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a 
copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship 
wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the 
following effect:  (a) if only one (1) votes, his or her act binds all; (b) 
if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) 
if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular 
matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or 
may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the 
General Corporation Law of Delaware, Section 217(b).  If the instrument filed 
with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, 
a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a 
majority or even-split in interest.

     SECTION 12.  LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS.  The Secretary shall prepare and 
make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete 
list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in 
alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of 
shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open 
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the 
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) 
days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the 
meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the 
meeting, or, if not specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.  
The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of meeting during 
the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

     SECTION 13.  ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.  No action shall be taken by the 
stockholders except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in 
accordance with these Bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the 
stockholders by written consent.

     SECTION 14.  ORGANIZATION.

     (a)  At every meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors, or, if a Chairman has not been appointed or is absent, the Chief 
Executive Officer, or if the Chief Executive has not been appointed or is 
absent, the President, or, if the President is absent, a chairman of the 
meeting chosen by a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to 
vote, present in person or by proxy, shall act as chairman.  The Secretary, 
or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary directed to do so by the 
President, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

     (b)  The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to make 
such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it 
shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.  Subject to such rules and 
regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting 
shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and 
procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are 
necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, 
including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or order of business 
for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting 
and the safety of those present, limitations on participation in such meeting 
to stockholders of record of the corporation and their duly authorized and 
constituted proxies and such other persons as the chairman shall permit, 
restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the 
commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or 
comments by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the 
polls for balloting on matters which are to be voted on by ballot.  Unless 
and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the 
meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in 
accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    DIRECTORS

     SECTION 15.  NUMBER AND TERM OF OFFICE.  The authorized number of 
directors of the corporation shall be fixed in accordance with the 
Certificate of Incorporation.  Directors need not be stockholders unless so 
required by the Certificate of Incorporation.  If for any cause, the 
directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be 
elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the 
stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.

     SECTION 16.  POWERS.  The powers of the corporation shall be exercised, 
its business conducted and its property controlled by the Board of Directors, 
except as may be otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of 
Incorporation.

     SECTION 17.  CLASSES OF DIRECTORS.  Subject to the rights of the holders 
of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under 
specified circumstances, the directors shall be divided into two classes 
designated as Class I and Class II, respectively.  Directors shall be 
assigned to each class in accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted 
by the Board of Directors.  At the first annual meeting of stockholders 
following November 30, 1997, the term of office of the Class I directors 
shall expire and Class I directors shall be elected for a full term of two 
years.  At the second annual meeting of stockholders following November 30, 
1997, the term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II 
directors shall be elected for a full term of two years.  At each succeeding 
annual meeting of stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of 
two years to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such 
annual meeting.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, each director 
shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his 
death, resignation or removal.  No decrease in the number of directors 
constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent 
director.

     SECTION 18.  VACANCIES.  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of 
Incorporation, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, 
resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created 
directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall 
unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such 
vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by stockholders, be 
filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in 
office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors.  Any 
director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office 
for the remainder of the full term of the director for which the vacancy was 
created or occurred and until such director's successor shall have been 
elected and qualified.  A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed 
to exist under this Bylaw in the case of the death, removal or resignation of 
any director.

     SECTION 19.  RESIGNATION.  Any director may resign at any time by 
delivering his written resignation to the Secretary, such resignation to 
specify whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by 
the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  If no such 
specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of the 
Board of Directors.  When one or more directors shall resign from the Board 
of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in 
office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such 
vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation 
or resignations shall become effective, and each Director so chosen shall 
hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of the Director whose place 
shall be vacated and until his successor shall have been duly elected and 
qualified.

     SECTION 20.  REMOVAL.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any 
series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors or any individual director 
may be removed from office at any time with or without cause by the 
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power 


                                       7

<PAGE>

of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation, 
entitled to vote at an election of directors (the "Voting Stock").

     SECTION 21.  MEETINGS.

     (a)  ANNUAL MEETINGS.  The annual meeting of the Board of Directors 
shall be held immediately before or after the annual meeting of stockholders 
and may be at the place where such meeting is held.  No notice of an annual 
meeting of the Board of Directors shall be necessary and such meeting shall 
be held for the purpose of electing officers and transacting such other 
business as may lawfully come before it.

     (b)  REGULAR MEETINGS.  Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, 
regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held in the office of the

     (d)  TELEPHONE MEETINGS.  Any member of the Board of Directors, or of 
any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting by means of conference 
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons 
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a 
meeting by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

     (e)  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Notice of the time and place of all special 
meetings of the Board of Directors shall be orally or in writing, by 
telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, telegraph or telex, during normal 
business hours, at least twenty-four (24) hours before the date and time of 
the meeting, or sent in writing to each director by first class mail, charges 
prepaid, at least three (3) days before the date of the meeting.  Notice of 
any meeting may be waived in writing at any time before or after the meeting 
and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat, except when the 
director attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the 
beginning of the meetings to the transaction of any business because the 
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

     (f)  WAIVER OF NOTICE.  The transaction of all business at any meeting 
of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, however called or 
noticed, or wherever held, shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly 
held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present and if, either 
before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present shall sign a 


                                       8

<PAGE>

written waiver of notice.  All such waivers shall be filed with the corporate 
records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

     SECTION 22.  QUORUM AND VOTING.

     (a)  Unless the Certificate of Incorporation requires a greater number 
and except with respect to indemnification questions arising under Section 43 
hereof, for which a quorum shall be one-third of the exact number of 
directors fixed from time to time in accordance with the Certificate of 
Incorporation, a quorum of the Board of Directors shall consist of a majority 
of the exact number of directors fixed from time to time by the Board of 
Directors in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation; PROVIDED, 
HOWEVER, at any meeting whether a quorum be present or otherwise, a majority 
of the directors present may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed 
for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors, without notice other 
than by announcement at the meeting.

     (b)  At each meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is 
present, all questions and business shall be determined by the affirmative 
vote of a majority of the directors present, unless a different vote be 
required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

     SECTION 23.  ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.  Unless otherwise restricted by the 
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or 
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any 
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board 
of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, 
and such writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the 
Board of Directors or committee.

     SECTION 24.  FEES AND COMPENSATION.  Directors shall be entitled to such 
compensation for their services as may be approved by the Board of Directors, 
including, if so approved, by resolution of the Board of Directors, a fixed 
sum and expenses of attendance, if any, for attendance at each regular or 
special meeting of the Board of Directors and at any meeting of a committee 
of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to 
preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity as 
an officer, agent, employee, or otherwise and receiving compensation therefor.

     SECTION 25.  COMMITTEES.

     (a)  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  The Board of Directors may by resolution 
passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors appoint an Executive 
Committee to consist of one (1) or more members of the Board of Directors.  
The Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law and provided in the 
resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the

<PAGE>


authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may 
require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in 
reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation (except that a 
committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions 
providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the Board of 
Directors fix the designations and any of the preferences or rights of such 
shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of 
assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such 
shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the 
same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation or fix the

of the shares of any series), adopting an agreement of merger or 
consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange 
of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, 
recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a

other committees as may be permitted by law. Such other committees appointed 
by the Board of Directors shall consist of one (1) or more members of the 
Board of Directors and shall have such powers and perform such duties as may 
be prescribed by the resolution or resolutions creating such committees, but 
in no event shall such committee have the powers denied to the Executive 
Committee in these Bylaws.

serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors and until his or her 
successors shall have been duly elected, unless sooner removed.  The Board of 
Directors, subject to the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this Bylaw 
may at any time increase or decrease the number of members of a committee or 
terminate the existence of a committee.  The membership of a committee member 
shall terminate on the date of his death or voluntary resignation from the 
committee or from the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors may at any 
time for any reason remove any individual committee member and the Board of 
Directors may fill any committee vacancy created by death, resignation, 
removal or increase in the number of members of the committee.  The Board of 
Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any

of the committee, and, in addition, in the absence or disqualification of any 
member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting

quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to 
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

     (d)  MEETINGS.  Unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise provide, 
regular meetings of the Executive Committee or any other committee appointed

notice thereof has been given to each member of such committee, no further 
notice of such regular meetings need be given thereafter.  Special meetings 
of any such committee may be held at any place which has been determined from 
time to time by such 


                                       10

committee, upon written notice to the members of such committee of the time

of written notice to members of the Board of Directors of the time and place 
of special meetings of the Board of Directors.  Notice of any special meeting 
of any committee may be waived in writing at any time before or after the 
meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat, except when 
the director attends such special meeting for the express purpose of 
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any 
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  A majority 
of the authorized number of members of any such committee shall constitute a 
quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of those 
present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of such 
committee.

     SECTION 26.  ORGANIZATION.  At every meeting of the directors, the

President, or, in the absence of any such officer, a chairman of the meeting 
chosen by a majority of the directors present, shall preside over the 
meeting. The Secretary, or in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary 
directed to do so by the President, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

may, in its discretion, determine the method and designate the signatory 
officer or officers, or other person or persons, to execute on behalf of the 
corporation any corporate instrument or document, or to sign on behalf of the 
corporation the corporate name without limitation, or to enter into contracts 
on behalf of the corporation, except where otherwise provided by law or these 
Bylaws, and such execution or signature shall be binding upon the corporation.

     Unless otherwise specifically determined by the Board of Directors or

other evidences of indebtedness of the corporation, and other corporate 
instruments or documents requiring the corporate seal, and certificates of 
shares of stock owned by the corporation, shall be executed, signed or

                                 SHARES OF STOCK

     SECTION 34.  FORM AND EXECUTION OF CERTIFICATES.  Certificates for the 
shares of stock of the corporation shall be in such form as is consistent 
with the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.  Every holder of 
stock in the corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or 
in the name of the corporation by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the 
Chief Executive Officer, or the President or any Vice President and by the 
Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, 
certifying the number of shares owned by him in the corporation. Any or all 
of the signatures on the certificate may be facsimiles.  In case any officer, 
transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has 
been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer 
agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued with 
the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar at 
the date of issue.  Each certificate shall state upon the face or back 
thereof, in full or in summary, all of the powers, designations, preferences, 
and rights, and the limitations or restrictions of the shares authorized to 
be issued or shall, except as otherwise required by law, set forth on the 
face or back a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to 
each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and 
relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of 
stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions 
of such preferences and/or rights.  Within a reasonable time after the 
issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the corporation shall send to 
the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information 
required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this section 
or otherwise required by law or with respect to this section a statement that 
the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so 
requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, 
optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and 
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or 
rights.  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and 
obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same 
class and series shall be identical.

     SECTION 35.  LOST CERTIFICATES.  A new certificate or certificates shall 
be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by 
the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the 
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of 
stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed.  The corporation may require, as a 
condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the 
owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his 
legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall 
require or to give the corporation a surety bond in such form and amount as 
it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the 
corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, 
stolen, or destroyed.

made only upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by attorney 
duly authorized, and upon the surrender of a properly endorsed certificate or 
certificates for a like number of shares.

     (b)  The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any 
agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock 
of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the 
corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any 
manner not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

     SECTION 37.  FIXING RECORD DATES.

     (a)  In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders 
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any 
adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record 
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution 
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record 
date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the 
date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, 
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote 
at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day 
next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at 
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting 
is held.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or 
to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the 
meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record 
date for the adjourned meeting.

     SECTION 38.  REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS.  The corporation shall be entitled 
to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the 
owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and shall 
not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such 
share or shares on the part of any other person whether or not it shall have 
express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of 
Delaware.

such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, and the
corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon
and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the
Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that where any such bond, debenture 


                                       16

<PAGE>

or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the manual signature, 
or where permissible facsimile signature, of a trustee under an indenture 
pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be 
issued, the signatures of the persons signing and attesting the corporate 
seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate securities may be the 
imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons.  Interest coupons 
appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, 
authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Chief 
Financial Officer, Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or 
such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear 
imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person.  In case any 
officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other 
corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on 
any such interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the 
bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have 
been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless 
may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the 
person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used 
thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.

Certificate of Incorporation.

     SECTION 41.  DIVIDEND RESERVE.  Before payment of any dividend, there 
may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends 
such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in their 
absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet 
contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining 
any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of 
Directors shall think conducive to the interests of the corporation, and the

                                INDEMNIFICATION

     SECTION 43.  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, OTHER 
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS.

     (a)  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  The corporation shall indemnify its
directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article XI,
"executive officers shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated
under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General
Corporation Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the corporation may modify the extent
of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and executive
officers; and, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the corporation shall not be required to
indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is
expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the
Board of Directors of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by
the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the
corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) such
indemnification is required to be made under subsection (d).

     (b)  OTHER OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS.  The corporation shall 
have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set 
forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     (c)  EXPENSES.  The corporation shall advance to any person who was or 
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or 
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative 
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or 
executive officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of 
the corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final 
disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all 
expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with 
such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person 
to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person 
is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation to 
an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that 
such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event 
this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether 
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is 
reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote 
of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, 
or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of 
disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel 


                                       18

<PAGE>

in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at 
the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that 
such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not 
believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

     (d)  ENFORCEMENT.  Without the necessity of entering into an express 
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and 
executive officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights 
and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract 
between the corporation and the director or executive officer.  Any right to 
indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or executive 
officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right 
in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification 
or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such 
claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor.  The claimant in 
such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled 
to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim.  In connection with any 
claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a 
defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of 
conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law 
for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In 
connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except 
in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or 
investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a 
director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled 
to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that 
such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not 
believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or 
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted 
without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the 
failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent 
legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the 
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in 
the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set 
forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by 
the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel 
or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard 
of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that 
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.  In any suit brought 
by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or 
to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the 
director or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such 
advancement of expenses, under this Article XI or otherwise shall be on the 
corporation.

     (e)  NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS.  The rights conferred on any person by 
this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may 
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of 
Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested 
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to 
action in another capacity while holding office.  The corporation is 
specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of 
its directors, officers, employees or agents 


                                       19

<PAGE>

respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited 
by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     (f)  SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS.  The rights conferred on any person by this

executors and administrators of such a person.

     (g)  INSURANCE.  To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General 
Corporation Law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, 
may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be

     (j)  CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following

     resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any
     constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which,
     if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
     to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any
     person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
     constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
     constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
     another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

     involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with
     respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries;
     and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed

                                     NOTICES

     SECTION 44.  NOTICES.

     (a)  NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS.  Whenever, under any provisions of these 
Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, it shall be given 
in writing, timely and duly deposited in the United States mail, postage 
prepaid, and addressed to his last known post office address as shown by the 
stock record of the corporation or its transfer agent.

     (b)  NOTICE TO DIRECTORS.  Any notice required to be given to any 
director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by 
facsimile, telex or telegram, except that such notice other than one which is 
delivered personally shall be sent to such address as such director shall 
have filed in writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, 
to the last known post office address of such director.

     (c)  AFFIDAVIT OF MAILING.  An affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly 
authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent 
appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name 
and address or the names and addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, or 
director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, 
and the time and method of giving the same, shall, in the absence of fraud, 
be prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained.


                                       21

<PAGE>

     (d)  TIME NOTICES DEEMED GIVEN.  All notices given by mail, as above 
provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing, and 
all notices given by facsimile, telex or telegram shall be deemed to have 
been given as of the sending time recorded at time of transmission.

     (e)  METHODS OF NOTICE.  It shall not be necessary that the same method 
of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one permissible 
method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other 
permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or 
others.

     (f)  FAILURE TO RECEIVE NOTICE.  The period or limitation of time within 
which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any 
privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may 
exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice 
sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in 
any manner by the failure of such stockholder or such director to receive 
such notice.

     (g)  NOTICE TO PERSON WITH WHOM COMMUNICATION IS UNLAWFUL.  Whenever 
notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the 
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with 
whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person 
shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental 
authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such 
person.  Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to 
any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force 
and effect as if such notice had been duly given.  In the event that the 
action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a 
certificate under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the 
certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that 
notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such 
persons with whom communication is unlawful.

     (h)  NOTICE TO PERSON WITH UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS.  Whenever notice is 
required to be given, under any provision of law or the Certificate of 
Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any stockholder to whom (i) 
notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of 
the taking of action by written consent without a meeting to such person 
during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or (ii) all, 
and at least two, payments (if sent by first class mail) of dividends or 
interest on securities during a twelve-month period, have been mailed 
addressed to such person at his address as shown on the records of the 
corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice 
to such person shall not be required.  Any action or meeting which shall be 
taken or held without notice to such person shall have the same force and 
effect as if such notice had been duly given.  If any such person shall 
deliver to the corporation a written notice setting forth his then current 
address, the requirement that notice be given to such person shall be 
reinstated.  In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as 
to require the filing of a certificate under any provision of the Delaware 
General Corporation Law, the certificate need not state that notice was not 
given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to this 
paragraph.

employee of the corporation or of its subsidiaries, including any officer or 
employee who is a Director of the corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, 
in the judgment of the Board of Directors, such loan, guarantee or assistance 
may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guarantee or 
other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or 
secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, 
without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing 
in these Bylaws shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of 
guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 47.  ANNUAL REPORT.

     (a)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Bylaw, the Board 
of Directors shall cause an annual report to be sent to each stockholder of 
the corporation not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the close 
of the corporation's fiscal year.  Such report shall include a balance sheet 
as of the end of such fiscal year and an income statement and statement of 
changes in financial position for such fiscal year, accompanied by any report 
thereon of independent accountants, or if there is no such report, the 
certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements 
were prepared without audit from the books and records of the corporation.

corporation's shares, as determined by Section 605 of the California 
Corporations Code, additional information 


                                       23

<PAGE>

as required by Section 1501(b) of the California Corporations Code shall also 
be contained in such report, provided that if the corporation has a class of 
securities registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, that Act shall take 
precedence.  Such report shall be sent to stockholders at least fifteen (15) 
days prior to the next annual meeting of stockholders after the end of the 
fiscal year to which it relates.

     (b)  If and so long as there are fewer than 100 holders of record of the 
corporation's shares, the requirement of sending of an annual report to the 
stockholders of the corporation is hereby expressly waived.

                  SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED RIGHTS AGREEMENT

          This agreement (this "Agreement" or the "Rights Agreement"), dated as
of July 11, 1990, and amended and restated as of April 10, 1996 and further
amended and restated as of August 14, 1997, between Adobe Systems Incorporated,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Harris Trust Company of California
(the "Rights Agent").


                               W I T N E S S E T H

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company on July 11, 1990 (i)
announced that it authorized the issuance and declared a dividend of one right
("Right") (as such number may be adjusted pursuant hereto) for each share of the
common stock of the Company ("Common Stock") outstanding as of the Close of
Business (as defined herein) on July 24, 1990 (the "RECORD DATE"), each Right
initially representing the right to purchase one share of Common Stock of the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, and
(ii) further authorized the issuance of one Right (as such number may be
adjusted pursuant hereto) with respect to each share of Common Stock of the
Company that shall become outstanding between July 24, 1990 and, except as
provided in Section 22, the Distribution Date (as defined herein); and

          WHEREAS, pursuant to authorization of the Board of Directors at a
meeting properly noticed and convened on April 10, 1996, this Agreement has been
amended and restated, and at a meeting properly noticed and convened on July 30,
1997, this Agreement has been further amended and restated, each as of the
respective date set forth above, in accordance with the provisions of Section 27
hereof to provide, among other things, that each Right outstanding as of and to
be issued after the date of this Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement
shall be exercisable into one Unit (as defined herein) of Preferred Stock (as
defined herein).

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

          SECTION 1.  CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Agreement the
following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

          (a)  "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (as defined herein) who
or which, alone or together with all Affiliates (as defined herein) and
Associates (as defined herein) of such Person, without the prior approval of the
Board of Directors, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as defined herein) of 15% or
more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company but shall not include (x) an
Exempt Person (as defined herein) or (y) any such Person who has become and is
such a Beneficial Owner solely because (A) of a change in the aggregate number
of shares of the Common Stock since the last date on which such Person acquired
Beneficial Ownership (as defined herein) of any shares of the Common Stock (as



<PAGE>

                                       2


defined herein) or (B) it acquired such Beneficial Ownership in the good faith
belief that such acquisition would not (1) cause such Beneficial Ownership to
equal or exceed 15% of the shares of the Common Stock then outstanding and such
Person relied in good faith in computing the percentage of its Beneficial
Ownership on publicly filed reports or documents of the Company which are
inaccurate or out-of-date or (2) otherwise cause a Distribution Date or the
adjustment provided for in Section 11(a)(ii) to occur.  Notwithstanding clause
(B) of the prior sentence, if any Person that is not an Acquiring Person due to
such clause (B) does not reduce its percentage of Beneficial Ownership of the
Common Stock to less than 15% by the Close of Business (as defined herein) on
the fifth Business Day (as defined herein) after notice from the Company (the
date of notice being the first day) that such person's Beneficial Ownership of
the Common Stock so equals or exceeds 15%, such Person shall at the end of such
five Business Day period, become an Acquiring Person (and such clause (B) shall
no longer apply to such Person).  For purposes of this definition, the
determination whether any Person acted in "good faith" shall be conclusively
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, acting by a vote of those
directors of the Company whose approval would be required to redeem the rights
under Section 23.

          (b)  "Adjustment Shares" shall have the meaning set forth in Section
11(a)(ii)(C) hereof.

          (c)  "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings

          exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to
          any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of
          conversion rights, exchange rights, rights (other than the Rights),
          warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a Person
          shall not be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of, or to "beneficially
          own", or to have "Beneficial Ownership" of, securities tendered
          pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such Person or any of
          such Person's Affiliates or Associates until such tendered securities
          are accepted for purchase or exchange; or (B) the right to vote
          pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding 


<PAGE>

          not be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of, or to "beneficially own", 
          or to have "Beneficial Ownership" of, any securities if the 
          agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such security (1) 
          arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in response 
          to a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in 
          accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations of the 
          Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable by such Person on

          report); or

               (iii)     which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly,
          by any other Person with which such Person or any of such Person's

          acquiring, holding, voting (except as described in clause (B) of

to any Person other than the Company which shall not be organized in corporate

Business Day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Company's
Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person,
provided that no such action may be taken by the Board of Directors to determine
a later date unless, at the time of such action, there are then in office not
less than two Continuing Directors and such action is approved by a majority of
the Continuing Directors then in office and of which the Company will give the
Rights Agent prompt written notice) after the date that a tender or exchange
offer by any Person (other than an Exempt Person) is first published or sent or
given within the meaning of Rule 14d-4(a) of the Exchange Act Regulations or any
successor rule, if upon 


<PAGE>

                                       7


consummation thereof such Person would be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more 
of the shares of the outstanding Common Stock (irrespective of whether any 
shares are actually purchased pursuant to any such offer) (the earlier of (i) 
and (ii) above being the "DISTRIBUTION DATE"), (x) the Rights will be 
evidenced (subject to the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof) by the 
certificates for Common Stock registered in the names of the holders of the 
Common Stock as of and subsequent to the Record Date (which certificates for 
shares of Common Stock shall be deemed also to be certificates for Rights) 
and not by separate Right certificates, and (y) each Right will be 
transferable only in connection with the transfer of a share (subject to 
adjustments as hereinafter provided) of Common Stock (including a transfer to 
the Company).  As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Rights 
Agent will mail, by first-class, postage prepaid mail, to each record holder 
of the Common Stock as of the Close of Business on the Distribution Date, as 
shown by the records of the Company, to the address of such holder shown on 
such records, one or more Right certificates, in substantially the form of 
EXHIBIT A hereto (each, a "RIGHT CERTIFICATE"), evidencing one Right for each 
share of Common Stock so held, subject to adjustment as provided herein.  In 
the event that an adjustment in the number of Rights per share of Common 
Stock of the Company has been made pursuant to Section 11(p), at the time of 
distribution of the Rights Certificates, the Company may make the necessary 
and appropriate rounding adjustments (in accordance with Section 14(a)) so 
that Rights Certificates representing only whole numbers of Rights are 
distributed and cash is paid in lieu of any fractional Rights.  As of and 
after the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such 
Right Certificates.

          (b)  On July 24, 1990 or as soon as practicable thereafter, the
Company sent a copy of a Summary of Terms of Rights Agreement, substantially in
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B ("Summary of Rights") (Exhibit B having
been amended, however, to summarize the terms of the Rights as amended as of
April 10, 1996 and further amended as of August 14, 1997), by first-class,
postage prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Stock as of the Close of
Business on July 24, 1990, at the address of such holder shown on the records of
the Company.

          (c)  With respect to certificates for Common Stock outstanding as of
July 24, 1990, until the Distribution Date (or, if earlier, the Redemption Date
or the Final Expiration Date), the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates
for Common Stock registered in the names of the holders thereof together with a
copy of the Summary of Rights.  Until the Distribution Date (or, if earlier, the
Redemption Date or Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any
certificate for Common Stock outstanding on July 24, 1990, with or without a
copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also constitute the
surrender for transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock
represented thereby.

          (d)  Certificates issued for Common Stock (including, without
limitation, certificates issued upon transfer or exchange of Common Stock) after
July 24, 1990, but 


<PAGE>

                                       8


prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the 
Final Expiration Date, shall have impressed on, printed on, written on, or 
otherwise affixed to them, the following legend:

     This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain
     Rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement between Adobe Systems
     Incorporated and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, as Rights Agent,
     dated as of July 11, 1990 (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are
     incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the
     principal executive office of Adobe Systems Incorporated.  Under certain
     circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be
     evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this
     certificate.  Adobe Systems Incorporated will mail to the holder of this
     certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge within five (5)
     days after receipt by it of a written request therefor.  Under certain
     circumstances as provided in the Rights Agreement, Rights issued to or
     beneficially owned by Acquiring Persons or their Associates or Affiliates
     (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or any subsequent holder of such
     Rights may be limited as provided in Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 24 of
     the Rights Agreement.

provided, however, that with respect to certificates issued for Common Stock
(including, without limitation, certificates issued upon transfer or exchange of
Common Stock) after August 14, 1997, but prior to the earlier of the
Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, the first
sentence of such legend shall be replaced with the following:

     This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain
     Rights as set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement
     between Adobe Systems Incorporated and Harris Trust Company of California,
     as Rights Agent, dated as of August 14, 1997 (the "Rights Agreement"), the
     terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is
     on file at the principal executive office of Adobe Systems Incorporated. 

and the last sentence of such legend shall be replaced with the following:

     Under certain circumstances as provided in the Rights Agreement, Rights
     issued to or beneficially owned by Acquiring Persons or their Associates or
     Affiliates (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or any subsequent holder of
     such Rights may become null and void in the circumstances specified in
     Section 7(f) of the Rights Agreement and may be limited as provided in
     Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 24 of the Rights Agreement.

                                       9


With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, the Rights
associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificates shall, until
the Distribution Date, be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the
surrender for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute the
surrender for transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock
represented thereby.

          SECTION 4.  FORM OF RIGHT CERTIFICATES.

          (a)  The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase and
of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof), when, as and if issued,
shall be substantially in the form set forth in EXHIBIT A hereto and may have
such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or
endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Rights Agreement, or as may be required
to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto, or
with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Rights may from
time to time be listed, or to conform to usage.  Subject to the provisions of
Sections 11 and 22 hereof, the Right Certificates evidencing the Rights issued
on July 24, 1990, whenever such certificates are issued, shall be dated as of
July 24, 1990, and the Right Certificates evidencing Rights to holders of record
of Common Stock issued after July 24, 1990, shall be dated as of July 24, 1990,
but shall also be dated to reflect the date of issuance of such Right
Certificate.  On their face, Right Certificates shall entitle the holders
thereof to purchase, for each Right, one Unit of Preferred Stock, or other
securities or property as provided herein, as the same may from time to time be
adjusted after the date hereof as provided herein, at the price per Unit of
$115.00, as the same may from time to time be adjusted as provided herein (the
"Purchase Price").

          (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Rights Agreement, any
Right Certificate that represents Rights that are or were at any time on or
after the earlier of the Stock Acquisition Date or the Distribution Date
beneficially owned by:  (i) an Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate
thereof, (ii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or
Affiliate) which becomes a transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such,
or (iii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or
Affiliate) which becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the
Acquiring Person becoming such and which receives such Rights pursuant to either
(A) a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person (or
any such Associate or Affiliate) to holders of equity interests in such
Acquiring Person (or such Associate or Affiliate) or to any Person with whom
such Acquiring Person (or such Associate or Affiliate) has any continuing
agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding either the transferred Rights,
shares of Common Stock or the Company or (B) a transfer which a majority of the
Continuing Directors has determined to be part of a plan, arrangement or
understanding which has as a primary purpose or effect the avoidance of
Section 7(f), shall have (to the extent feasible) impressed on, printed on,
written on or otherwise affixed to it (if the Company or the Rights 


<PAGE>

                                       10


Agent has knowledge that such Person is an Acquiring Person or an Associate 
or Affiliate thereof or transferee of such Persons or a nominee of any of the 
foregoing) the following legend:

     The beneficial owner of the Rights represented by this Right Certificate is
     an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate (as defined in the Rights
     Agreement) of an Acquiring Person or a subsequent holder of such Right
     Certificates beneficially owned by such Persons.  Accordingly, this Right
     Certificate and the Rights represented hereby may become null and void in
     the circumstances specified in Section 7(f) of the Rights Agreement and may
     be limited as provided in Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 24 of the Rights
     Agreement.
 
          SECTION 5.  COUNTERSIGNATURE AND REGISTRATION.

          (a)  The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company
by its President or any Vice President, either manually or by facsimile
signature, and have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof
which shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Company, either manually or by facsimile signature.  The Right Certificates
shall be manually countersigned by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for
any purpose unless so countersigned.  In case any officer of the Company who
shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer
of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and
delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be
countersigned by the Rights Agent, issued and delivered with the same force and
effect as though the person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to
be such officer of the Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on
behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of
such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such
Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Rights
Agreement any such person was not such an officer.

          (b)  Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or
cause to be kept, at one of its offices designated for such purposes, books for
registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder.  Such
books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right
Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right
Certificates, the date of each of the Right Certificates and the certificate
numbers for each of the Right Certificates.

                                       11


          SECTION 6.  TRANSFER, SPLIT UP, COMBINATION AND EXCHANGE OF RIGHT
CERTIFICATES; MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN RIGHT CERTIFICATES.

          (a)  Subject to the provisions of Sections 4(b), 7(f) and 14(b)
hereof, at any time after the Close of Business on the Distribution Date and at
or prior to the Close of Business on the earlier of the Redemption Date or the
Final Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Certificates may be (i)
transferred or (ii) split up, combined or exchanged for another Right
Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a
like number of Units of Preferred Stock as the Right Certificate or Right
Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase.  Any registered
holder desiring to transfer any Right Certificate shall surrender the Right
Certificate at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purposes with
the form of assignment on the reverse side thereof duly endorsed (or enclose
with such Right Certificate a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Rights Agent), duly executed by the
registered holder thereof or his attorney, duly authorized in writing, and with
such signature duly guaranteed.  Any registered holder desiring to split up,
combine or exchange any Right Certificate shall make such request in writing
delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or
Right Certificates to be split up, combined or exchanged at the Corporate Agency
Service Center of the Rights Agent.  Thereupon the Rights Agent shall
countersign (by manual signature) and deliver to the person entitled thereto a
Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. 
The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split
up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.

          (b)  Upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or
security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, if requested by the Company,
reimbursement to the Company of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and
upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if
mutilated, the Company will execute and deliver a new Right Certificate of like
tenor and representing the equivalent number of Rights to the Rights Agent for
delivery to the registered owner in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated.

          SECTION 7.  EXERCISE OF RIGHTS PURCHASE PRICE; EXPIRATION DATE OF
RIGHTS.

          (a)  The Rights shall become exercisable, and may be exercised to
purchase Units of Preferred Stock, except as otherwise provided herein, in whole
or in part at any time after the Distribution Date upon surrender of the Right
Certificate, with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side thereof
duly executed (with such signature duly 


<PAGE>

                                       12


guaranteed), to the Rights Agent at 111 West Monroe Street, 14th Floor, 
Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attention:  Charles Zade, together with payment of 
the Purchase Price with respect to each Right exercised, subject to 
adjustment as hereinafter provided, at or prior to the Close of Business on 
the earlier of (i) July 23, 2000 (the "Final Expiration Date"), (ii) the time 
at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (such date 
being herein referred to as the "Redemption Date") or (iii) the time at which 
all such Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24 hereof.

          (b)  The Purchase Price and the number of Units of Preferred Stock or
other securities or consideration to be acquired upon exercise of a Right shall
be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13
hereof.  The Purchase Price shall be payable in lawful money of the United
States of America, in accordance with Section 7(c) hereof.

          (c)  As promptly as practicable following the occurrence of the
Distribution Date, the Company shall deposit with a corporation in good standing
organized under the laws of the United States or any State of the United States,
which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock
transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
authority (such institution being the "DEPOSITARY AGENT"), certificates
representing the shares of Preferred Stock that may be acquired upon exercise of
the Rights and shall cause such Depositary Agent to enter into an agreement
pursuant to which the Depositary Agent shall issue receipts representing
interests in the shares of Preferred Stock so deposited.  Upon receipt of a
Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to
purchase and the certificate duly executed, accompanied by payment, with respect
to each Right so exercised, of the Purchase Price for the Units of Preferred
Stock (or, following a Triggering Event, other securities, cash or other assets,
as the case may be) to be purchased thereby as set forth below and an amount
equal to any applicable transfer tax or evidence satisfactory to the Company of
payment of such tax, the Rights Agent shall, subject to Section 20(k), thereupon
promptly (i) requisition from the Depositary Agent depositary receipts
representing such number of Units of Preferred Stock as are to be purchased and
the Company will direct, and hereby authorizes and directs, the Depositary Agent
to comply with such request, (ii) requisition from the Company the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
14, (iii) after receipt of such depositary receipts, promptly cause the same to
be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right
Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such
holder, and (iv) after receipt thereof, promptly deliver such cash, if any, to
or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate; provided,
however, that in the case of a purchase of securities pursuant to Section 13
hereof, the Rights Agent shall promptly take the appropriate actions
corresponding to the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv).  In the event that the
Company is obligated to issue Common Stock, other securities of the Company, pay
cash and/or distribute other property pursuant to Section 11(a), the Company
will make all arrangements necessary so that such Common 


<PAGE>

                                       13


Stock, other securities, cash and/or other property are available for 
distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.  The payment of 
the Purchase Price (as such amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 
11(a)(iii)) may be made in cash or by certified or bank check payable to the 
order of the Company, or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to 
the account of the Company (provided that notice of such wire transfer shall 
be given by the holder of the related Right to the Rights Agent).

          (d)  In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall
exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate
evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued
by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his
duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.

          (e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any
action with respect to a registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported
exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have
(i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of election to
purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for
such exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the
Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates
thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.

          (f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from
and after the first occurrence of any Flip-In Event or Flip-Over Event, any
Rights beneficially owned by (i) an Acquiring Person or an Associate or
Affiliate of an Acquiring Person, (ii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or
of any such Associate or Affiliate) which becomes a transferee after the
Acquiring Person becomes such, or (iii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or
of any such Associate or Affiliate) which becomes a transferee prior to or
concurrently with the Acquiring Person becoming such and which receives such
Rights pursuant to either (A) a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from
the Acquiring Person (or any such Associate or Affiliate) to holders of equity
interests in such Acquiring Person (or such Associate or Affiliate) or to any
Person with whom such Acquiring Person (or such Associate or Affiliate) has any
continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred
Rights, shares of Common Stock or the Company or (B) a transfer which a majority
of the Continuing Directors has determined to be part of a plan, arrangement or
understanding which has as a primary purpose or effect the avoidance of this
Section 7(f), shall be null and void without any further action, and no holder
of such Rights shall have any rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights,
whether under any provision of this Agreement or otherwise.  The Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 7(f)
and Section 4(b) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of
Rights or any other Person as a result of its failure to make any 


<PAGE>

                                       14


determination under this Section 7(f) or Section 4(b) with respect to an 
Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees.

          SECTION 8.  CANCELLATION AND DESTRUCTION OF RIGHT CERTIFICATES.  All
Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up,
combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its
agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form,
or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by it, and no Right
Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by
any of the Provisions of this Rights Agreement.  The Company shall deliver to
the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Right Agent shall so
cancel and retire, any Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company
otherwise than upon the exercise thereof.  The Rights Agent shall deliver all
cancelled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of
the Company, destroy such cancelled Right Certificates, and in such case shall
deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company.

          SECTION 9.  RESERVATION AND AVAILABILITY OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

          (a)  The Company covenants and agrees that at all times it will cause
to be reserved and kept available, out of, and to the extent of, its authorized
and unissued shares of Preferred Stock not reserved for another purpose (and,
following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) or held in its
treasury, the number of shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the occurrence
of a Triggering Event, other securities) that, as provided in this Agreement,
including Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, will be sufficient to permit the exercise
in full of all outstanding Rights, provided, however, that the Company shall not
be required to reserve and keep available shares of Preferred Stock or other
securities sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights
pursuant to the adjustments set forth Section 11(a)(ii), Section 11(a)(iii) or
Section 13 hereof unless, and only to the extent that, the Rights become
exercisable pursuant to such adjustments.

          (b)  The Company shall (i) use its best efforts to cause, from and
after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Rights and all shares of
Preferred Stock (and following the occurrence by a Triggering Event, other
securities) issued or reserved for issuance upon exercise thereof to be reported
by The Nasdaq Stock Market Consolidated Quotations Service ("Nasdaq") or such
other system then in use, and if the Preferred Stock shall become listed on any
national securities exchange, to cause, from and after such time as the Rights
become exercisable, the Rights and all shares of Preferred Stock (and, following
the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) issued or reserved for
issuance upon exercise thereof to be listed on such exchange upon official
notice of issuance upon such exercise and (ii) if then necessary, to permit the
offer and issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock (and, following occurrence
of a Triggering Event, other securities), register 


<PAGE>

                                       15


and qualify such shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the occurrence of 
a Triggering Event, other securities) under the Securities Act and any 
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws (to the extent exemptions 
therefrom are not available), cause such registration, statement and 
qualifications to become effective as soon as possible after such filing and 
keep such registration and qualifications effective until the earlier of the 
Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date of the Rights.  The Company may 
temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days, the 
exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file a registration 
statement under the Securities Act and permit it to become effective.  Upon 
any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating 
that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well 
as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is not longer in 
effect.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the 
Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite 
qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained and until a 
registration statement under the Securities Act (if required) shall have been 
declared effective.

          (c)  The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such
action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock (and
following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, other securities) delivered upon
exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such
shares (subject to payment of the Purchase Price in respect thereof), be duly
and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares in
accordance with applicable law.

          (d)  The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when
due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes which may be
payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of
any Units of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case may be) upon the
exercise of Rights.  The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any
transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of
Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of
certificates or depository receipts for Units of Preferred Stock (or other
securities, as the case may be) upon exercise of Rights in a name other than
that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate, and the Company shall
not be required to issue or deliver a Right Certificate or certificate or
depository receipt for Units of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the
case may be) to a person other than such registered holder until any such tax
shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of such Right
Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the
Company's satisfaction that no such tax is due.

          SECTION 10.  PREFERRED STOCK RECORD DATE.  Each Person in whose name
any certificate for Units of Preferred Stock (or other securities, as the case
may be) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed
to have become the holder of record of the Units of Preferred Stock (or other
securities, as the case may be) 


<PAGE>

                                       16


represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon 
which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and 
payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made.

          SECTION 11.  ADJUSTMENTS TO NUMBER AND KIND OF SECURITIES, NUMBER OF
RIGHTS OR PURCHASE PRICE.  The number and kind of securities subject to purchase
upon the exercise of each Right, the number of Rights outstanding and the
Purchase Price are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this
Section 11.

          (a)  (i)  In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of
this Rights Agreement (A) declare or pay any dividend on Preferred Stock payable
in shares of Preferred Stock, (B) subdivide or split the outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock into a greater number of shares, (C) combine or consolidate the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into a smaller number of shares or effect
a reverse split of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, or (D) issue any
shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Stock
(including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or
merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except
as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the
time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such
subdivision, combination or reclassification, and the number and kind of shares
of Preferred Stock or capital stock, as the case may be, issuable on such date,
shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised
after such time shall be entitled to receive, upon payment of the Purchase Price
then in effect, the aggregate number and kind of shares of Preferred Stock or
capital stock, as the case may be, which, if such Right had been exercised
immediately prior to such date, the holder thereof would have owned upon such
exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision,
combination or reclassification.  If an event occurs which would require an
adjustment under both this Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(i)(ii) hereof, the
adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and
shall be made prior to any adjustment required pursuant to, Section 11(a)(ii).

          (ii) Subject to Section 24, in the event

          (A)  any Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate of any
     Acquiring Person, at any time after the date of this Agreement, directly or
     indirectly, (1) shall consolidate with or merge with and into the Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise combine with the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries, and the Company or such Subsidiary shall be the
     continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation, merger or
     combination and the Common Stock of the Company shall remain outstanding
     and no shares thereof shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other
     securities of the Company or any other property, or (2) shall, in one or
     more transactions, other than in connection with the exercise of a Right or
     Rights and other

     than in connection with the exercise or conversion of securities 
     exercisable for or convertible into securities of the Company or of any 
     Subsidiary of the Company, transfer any assets or property to the 
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries in exchange (in whole or in part) for 
     any shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its 
     Subsidiaries or any securities exercisable for or convertible into 
     shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its 
     Subsidiaries, or otherwise obtain from the Company or any of its 
     Subsidiaries, with or without consideration, any additional shares of 
     any class of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or 
     any securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of any class 
     of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than 
     as part of a pro rata offer or distribution by the Company or such 
     Subsidiary to all holders of such shares), or (3) shall sell, purchase, 
     lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or otherwise acquire (other 
     than as a pro rata dividend) or dispose, to, from or with, as the case 
     may be, in one transaction or a series of transactions, the Company or 
     any of its Subsidiaries, assets (including securities) on terms and 
     conditions less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than the 
     Company or such Subsidiary would be able to obtain in arm's-length 
     negotiation with an unaffiliated third party, or (4) shall receive any 
     compensation from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for services 
     other than compensation for employment as a regular or part-time 
     employee, or fees for serving as a director, at rates in accordance with 
     the Company's (or its Subsidiary's) past practices, or (5) shall receive 
     the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a 
     shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other 
     financial assistance or any tax credits or tax advantage provided by the 
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (6) shall engage in any 
     transaction with the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) involving the 
     sale, license, transfer or grant of any right in, or disclosure of, any 
     patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other 
     intellectual or industrial property rights recognized under any 
     country's intellectual property laws which the Company (including its 
     Subsidiaries) owns or has the right to use on terms and conditions not 
     approved by the Board; or

          (B)  any Person, alone or together with its Affiliates and Associates,
     shall become an Acquiring Person other than pursuant to any transaction set
     forth in Section 13(a) hereof; or

          (C)  during such time as there is an Acquiring Person, there shall be
     any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split), or
     any recapitalization of the Company, or any merger or consolidation of the
     Company with any of its Subsidiaries or any other transaction or series of
     transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or
     not with or into or otherwise involving an Acquiring Person or any
     Affiliate or Associate of such Acquiring Person) which has the effect,
     directly or indirectly, of increasing by more than 1% the proportionate
     share of the outstanding share of any class of equity securities of the
     Company or any 


<PAGE>

                                       18


     of its Subsidiaries, or securities exercisable for or convertible into 
     equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which is 
     directly or indirectly beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person or any 
     Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person, 

then, subject to the last sentence of Section 23(a)(i) and except as otherwise
provided in this Section 11, each holder of a Right shall thereafter have a
right to receive for each Right, upon payment of an amount equal to the product
of the then current Purchase Price and the then number of Units of Preferred
Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the first
occurrence of a Flip-In Event (the "Flip-In Exercise Payment") and exercise of a
Right in accordance with the terms of this Rights Agreement, such number of
Units of Preferred Stock as shall equal the result obtained by dividing the
Flip-In Exercise Payment by 50% of the Current Market Price per Unit of
Preferred Stock on the date of the first occurrence of a Flip-In Event (such
number of Units of Preferred Stock is herein called the "Adjustment Shares");
provided that the Purchase Price per Unit and the number of Adjustment Shares
shall be further adjusted as provided in this Agreement to reflect any events
occurring after the date of such first occurrence; and provided further that if
the transaction that would otherwise give rise to the foregoing adjustment is
also subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then only the provisions of
Section 13 hereof shall apply and no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this
Section 11(a)(ii).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment pursuant to
this Section 11(a)(ii) shall not occur with respect to any Rights that are or
were at any time on or after the earlier of the Stock Acquisition Date or the
Distribution Date beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person or any Associate or
Affiliate of the Acquiring Person which is or was involved in or which caused or
facilitated, directly or indirectly, the event or transaction or transactions
listed above in this Section 11(a)(ii) in respect of which such adjustment
occurs (or any subsequent transferee of such Rights).

          (iii)     To the extent permitted by applicable law and any agreements
in effect on the date hereof to which the Company is a party, the Company may: 
(A) determine the value of the Adjustment Shares issuable upon the exercise of a
Right (the "Current Value") and (B) with respect to each Right, upon exercise of
such Right, make adequate provision to substitute for the Adjustment Shares not
received upon exercise of such Right (1) cash, (2) Common Stock or other equity
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares, or units of
shares, of preferred stock which, by virtue of having dividend, voting and
liquidation rights substantially comparable to those of Units of Preferred
Stock, are deemed in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company to have
substantially the same value as Units of Preferred Stock (such shares or units
of shares of preferred stock are herein called "Preferred Stock Equivalents"),
(3) debt securities of the Company, (4) other assets, or (5) any combination of
the foregoing, having a value which, when added to the value of the Units of
Preferred Stock actually issued upon exercise of such Right, shall have an
aggregate value equal to the Current Value, where such aggregate value has been
determined 


<PAGE>

                                       19


in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company based upon the advice 
of a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm selected in 
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if 
the Company shall not have made adequate provision to deliver value pursuant 
to clause (B) above within thirty days following the later of (x) first 
occurrence of a Flip-In Event and (y) the date of which the Company's right 
of redemption pursuant to Section 23(a) expires (the later of (x) and (y) 
being referred to herein as the "Flip-In Trigger Date") (such thirty day 
period is herein called the "Substitution Period"), then the Company shall be 
obligated to deliver, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without 
requiring payment of the Purchase Price, Units of Preferred Stock (to the 
extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which Units and/or cash have 
an aggregate value equal to the excess of the Current Value over the Purchase 
Price.  To the extent that the Company determines to take action pursuant to 
the first sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, 
subject to the first sentence of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, that such action 
shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights, and (y) may suspend the 
exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period 
in order to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant 
to such first sentence and to determine the value thereof.  In the event of 
any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating 
that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well 
as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in 
effect.  For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of a Unit of 
Preferred Stock shall be the Current Market Price per Unit on the Flip-In 
Trigger Date and the per share or per unit value of any Preferred Stock 
Equivalent shall be deemed to equal the Current Market Price per share or 
unit on such date.  The Board of Directors may, but shall not be required to, 
establish procedures to allocate the right to receive Preferred Stock upon 
the exercise of the Rights among holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 
11(a)(iii).

          (b)  In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of
rights (other than the Rights), options or warrants to all holders of Preferred
Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase (for a period expiring within
forty-five calendar days after such record date) Preferred Stock, shares having
the same rights, privileges and preferences as the Preferred Stock ("Equivalent
Preferred Stock") or securities convertible into Preferred Stock or Equivalent
Preferred Stock at a price per share of Preferred Stock or Equivalent Preferred
Stock (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into
Preferred Stock or Equivalent Preferred Stock) less than the Current Market
Price per share of Preferred Stock on such record date, the Purchase Price to be
in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase
Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding
on such record date, plus the number of shares of Preferred Stock which the
aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock and/or
Equivalent Preferred Stock (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the
convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such Current Market
Price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred
Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the 


<PAGE>

                                       20


number of additional shares of Preferred Stock and/or Equivalent Preferred 
Stock to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the 
convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible).  In case 
such subscription price may be paid by delivery of consideration part or all 
of which may be in a form other than cash, the value of such non-cash 
consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors 
of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed 
with the Rights Agent.  Shares of Preferred Stock owned, by or held for the 
account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any 
such computation.  Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a 
record date is fixed, and in the event that such rights or warrants are not 
so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price 
which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

          (c)  In case the Company shall fix a record date for a distribution to
all holders of Preferred Stock (including any such distribution made in
connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing
corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, cash, assets (other than a dividend
payable in Preferred Stock, but including any dividend payable in stock other
than Preferred Stock) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those
referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after
such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect
immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the Current Market Price per share of Preferred Stock on such record
date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement
filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the cash, assets or evidences of
indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants
applicable to a share of Preferred Stock and the denominator of which shall be
such Current Market Price per share of Preferred Stock.  Such adjustments shall
be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that
such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the
Purchase Price which would have been in effect if such record date had not been
fixed.

          (d)  (i)  For the purpose of any computation hereunder, other than
computations made pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, the "Current Market
Price" per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average
of the daily closing prices per share of the Common Stock for the thirty
consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior
to such date, and for purpose of computations made pursuant to Section
11(a)(iii) hereof, the "Current Market Price" per share of the Common Stock on
any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing Prices per share
of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days immediately following
such date; provided, however, that in the event that the Current Market Price
per share of the Common Stock is determined during a period following the
announcement by the issuer of the Common Stock of (i) any dividend or
distribution on the Common Stock (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend
and other than the Rights), (ii) any subdivision, combination 


<PAGE>

                                       21


or reclassification of the Common Stock, and prior to the expiration of the 
requisite thirty Trading Day or ten Trading Day period, as set forth above, 
the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date 
for such subdivision, combination or reclassification occurs, then, and in 
each such case, the Current Market Price shall be properly adjusted to take 
into account ex-dividend trading.  The closing price for each day shall be 
the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on 
such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in 
either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting 
system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange or, if the shares of Common Stock are not listed or 
admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the 
principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to 
securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the 
shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if the shares of 
Common Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities 
exchange, the last quoted sale price or, if not so quoted, the average of the 
high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by 
Nasdaq or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the shares 
of Common Stock are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the 
closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker 
making a market in the Common Stock selected by the Board of Directors of the 
Company.  If on any such date no market maker is making a market in the 
Common Stock, the fair value of such shares on such date as determined in 
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be used.  The term 
"Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities 
exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted to 
trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the shares of Common 
Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities 
exchange, a Business Day.  If the Common Stock is not publicly held or not so 
listed or traded, "Current Market Price" per share shall mean the fair value 
per share as determined in good faith by a majority of the Continuing 
Directors, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with 
the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive of all purposes.

          (ii) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current market
price" per share of Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner as
set forth above for Common Stock in clause (i) of this Section 11(d) (other than
the third sentence thereof).  If the current market price per share of Preferred
Stock cannot be determined in the manner provided above or if the Preferred
Stock is not publicly held or listed or traded in a manner described in
clause (i) of this Section 11(d), the "current market price" per share of
Preferred Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to 1,000 (as
such amount may be appropriately adjusted for such events as stock splits, stock
dividends and recapitalizations with respect to Common Stock occurring after the
date of this Agreement) multiplied by the current market price per share of
Common Stock.  If neither Common Stock nor Preferred Stock is publicly held or
so listed or traded, "current market price" per share of the Preferred Stock
shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith 


<PAGE>

                                       22


by a majority of the Continuing Directors, whose determination shall be 
described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on 
the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights.  For all purposes of this 
Agreement, the "current market price" of a Unit of Preferred Stock shall be 
equal to the "current market price" of one share of Preferred Stock divided 
by 1,000.

          (e)  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in
the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an
increase or decrease of at least one percent in the Purchase Price; provided,
however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not
required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to
the nearest cent or to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment
required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three
years from the date of the transaction which mandates such adjustment, or (ii)
the Redemption Date.

          (f)  If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section
11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised
shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock other than
Preferred Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon
exercise of any Right and the Purchase Price thereof shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as
practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Stock contained in
Section 11(a), (b), (c), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (m) hereof, and the
provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 hereof with respect to the Preferred
Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.

          (g)  All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any
adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to
purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of Units of Preferred Stock
purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject
to further adjustment as provided herein.

          (h)  Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided
in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the
calculations made in Section 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately
prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to
purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of Units of Preferred
Stock (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by (i) multiplying (x)
the number of Units covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment, by
(y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the
Purchase Price, and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price
in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.


<PAGE>

                                       23


          (i)  The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of
the Purchase Price or any adjustment to the number of Units of Preferred Stock
for which a Right may be exercised, to adjust the number of Rights, in lieu of
any adjustment in the number of Units of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the
exercise of a Right.  Each of the Rights outstanding after the adjustment in the
number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of Units of Preferred Stock
for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment.  Each
Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall
become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained
by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the
Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of
the Purchase Price.  The Company shall make a public announcement of its
election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the
adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. 
This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any
day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at
least ten days later than the date of the public announcement.  If Right
Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights
pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable,
cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such
record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the
additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such
adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to
such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right
Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon
surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing
all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. 
Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and
countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of
the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be registered in the names
of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in
the public announcement.

          (j)  Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or
the number of Units of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Rights,
the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express
the Purchase Price per Unit and the number of Units of Preferred Stock which
were expressed in the initial Right Certificate issued hereunder.

          (k)  Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing
the Purchase Price below the then par value of the number of Units of Preferred
Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate
action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Company may validly and legally issue such fully paid and nonassessable number
of Units of Preferred Stock at such adjusted Purchase Price.


<PAGE>

                                       24


          (l)  In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an
adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a
specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such
event the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date
the Units of Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the
Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Units of
Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any,
issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior
to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such
holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right
to receive such additional shares (fractional or otherwise) and other capital
stock or securities upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustments.

          (m)  Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in
addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to
the extent that in their good faith judgment the Board of Directors of the
Company shall determine to be advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or
subdivision of the Preferred Stock, (ii) issuance for cash of any shares of
Preferred Stock at less than the current market price, (iii) issuance for cash
of shares of Preferred Stock or securities which by their terms are convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of Preferred Stock, (iv) stock dividends or (v)
issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 11,
hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock shall not be
taxable to such shareholders.

          (n)  The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time
after the Distribution Date, (i) consolidate with any other Person (other than a
Subsidiary of the Company), (ii) merge with or into any other Person (other than
a Subsidiary of the Company), or (iii) sell or transfer (or permit any
Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or
earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any
other Person or Persons (other than the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries),
if (x) at the time of, or immediately after, such consolidation, merger or sale
there are any rights, warrants or other instruments securities outstanding or
agreements in effect which substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the
benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights or (y) prior to, simultaneously
with, or immediately after, such consolidation, merger or sale, the shareholders
of the Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the "Principal Party" for
purposes of Section 13(a) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights
previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates and Associates.

          (o)  The Company covenants and agrees that, after the Distribution
Date, it will not, except as permitted by Section 23, Section 24 or Section 27
hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such
action is taken it is reasonably 


<PAGE>

                                       25


foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or eliminate the 
benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.

          (p)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in
the event that the Company shall at any time prior to the Distribution Date
(i) declare a dividend on the outstanding shares of Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
(iii) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, or (iv) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of
Common Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a
consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving
corporation), the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock
then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter but prior to the
Distribution Date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number of
Rights thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock following any such
event shall equal the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights
associated with each share of Common Stock immediately prior to such event by a
fraction the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event.

          SECTION 12.  CERTIFICATION OF ADJUSTMENTS.  Whenever an adjustment is
made as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the Company shall (a) promptly
prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the
facts giving rise to such adjustment, (b) promptly file with the Rights Agent
and with each transfer agent for the Preferred Stock a copy of such certificate
and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate (or,
if prior to the Distribution Date, to each holder of a certificate representing
shares of Common Stock) in accordance with Section 26 hereof.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, the failure of the company to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of, or the force or effect of, or the requirement for, such
adjustment. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any
certificate prepared by the Company pursuant to Sections 11 and 13 and on any
adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any
such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.  Any
adjustment to be made pursuant to Sections 11 and 13 of this Rights Agreement
shall be effective as of the date of the event giving rise to such adjustment.

          SECTION 13.  CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR SALE OR TRANSFER OF ASSETS OR
EARNING POWER.

          (a)  In the event that, at any time on or after the Distribution Date,
directly or directly, (x) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge with and
into, any other Person or Persons and the Company shall not be the surviving or
continuing corporation of such consolidation or merger, or (y) any Person or
Persons shall consolidate with, or merge 


<PAGE>

                                       26


with and into, the Company, and the Company shall be the continuing or 
surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger and, in connection with 
such consolidation or merger, all or part of the outstanding shares of Common 
Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any 
other Person or of the Company or each or any other property (other than, in 
the case of the transactions described in subparagraphs (x) or (y), a merger 
or consolidation which would result in all of the Voting Power represented by 
the securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto 
continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being 
converted into securities of the surviving entity) all of the Voting Power 
represented by the securities of the Company or such surviving entity 
outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and the holders of 
such securities not having changed as a result of such transactions), or (z) 
the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell, mortgage or 
otherwise transfer to any other Person or any Affiliate or Associate of such 
Person, in one transaction, or a series of related transactions, assets or 
earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the 
Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), then, on the first 
occurrence of any such event, proper provision shall be made so that (i) each 
holder of record of a Right shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon 
payment of an amount equal to the product of the then current Purchase Price 
per Unit and the then number of Units of Preferred Stock for which a Right 
was exercisable immediately prior to the first occurrence of a Flip-Over 
Event (or, if a Flip-In Event hereof has occurred prior to the first 
occurrence of a Flip-Over Event, multiplying the Purchase Price per Unit in 
effect immediately prior to the first occurrence of a Flip-In Event by the 
number of Units of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable 
immediately prior to such first occurrence of a Flip-In Event (the "Flip-Over 
Exercise Payment") and the exercise of a Right in accordance with the terms 
of this Rights Agreement, such number of shares of validly issued, fully paid 
and nonassessable and freely tradeable Common Stock of the Principal Party 
(as defined herein) not subject to any liens, encumbrances, rights of first 
refusal or other adverse claims, as shall be equal to the result obtained by 
dividing the Flip-Over Exercise Payment by 50% of the Current Market Price 
(determined as provided in Section 11(d) hereof with respect to the Common 
Stock) per share of the Common Stock of such Principal Party on the date of 
consummation of such Flip-Over Event (or the fair market value on such date 
of other securities or property of the Principal Party, as provided for 
herein); PROVIDED that the Purchase Price per share and the number of shares 
of Common Stock of such Principal Party issuable upon exercise of each Right 
shall be further adjusted as provided in this Agreement to reflect any events 
occurring after the date of the first occurrence of a Flip-Over Event; (ii) 
such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by 
virtue of such Flip-Over Event, all the obligations and duties of the Company 
pursuant to this Rights Agreement; (iii) the term "Company" for all purposes 
of this Rights Agreement shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such 
Principal Party, it being specifically intended that the provisions of 
Section 11 hereof shall only apply to such Principal Party following the 
first occurrence of a Flip-Over Event; and (iv) such Principal Party shall 
take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a 
sufficient number of shares of its Common Stock in accordance with Section 


<PAGE>

                                       27


9 hereof) in connection with the consummation of any such transaction as may 
be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be 
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to its shares of 
Common Stock thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; 
provided, however, that, upon the subsequent occurrence of any merger, 
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, recapitalization, 
reclassification of shares, reorganization or other extraordinary transaction 
in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a Right shall thereupon be 
entitled to receive, upon exercise of a Right, such cash, shares, warrants 
and other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive had 
he, at the time of such transaction, owned the shares of Common Stock of the 
Principal Party purchasable upon the exercise of a Right, and such Principal 
Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, reservation of 
shares of stock) as may be necessary to permit the subsequent exercise of the 
right in accordance with the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, 
warrants and other property.

          (b)  "Principal Party" shall mean

               (i)  in the case of any transaction described in (x) or (y) of
     the first sentence of Section 13(a) hereof; (A) the Person that is the
     issuer of the securities into which shares of Common Stock of the Company
     are converted in such merger or consolidation, or, if there is more than
     one such issuer, the issuer the Common Stock of which has the greatest
     market value or (B) if no securities are so issued, (x) the Person that is
     the other party to the merger or consolidation and that survives said
     merger or consolidation, or, if there is more than one such Person, the
     Person the Common Stock of which has the greatest market value or (y) if
     the Person that is the other Party to the merger or consolidation does not
     survive the merger or consolidation, the Person that does survive the
     merger or consolidation (including the Company if it survives); and

               (ii) in the case of any transaction described in (z) of the first
     sentence in Section 13(a) hereof, the Person that is the party receiving
     the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to
     such transaction or transactions, or, if each Person that is a party to
     such transaction or transactions receives the same portion of the assets or
     earning power so transferred or if the Person receiving the greatest
     portion of the assets or earning power cannot be determined, whichever of
     such Persons as is the issuer of Common Stock having the greatest market
     value of shares outstanding; provided, however, that in any such case
     described in the foregoing (b)(i) or (b)(ii), if the Common Stock of such
     Person is not at such time and has not been continuously over the preceding
     12-month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and such
     Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person the Common
     Stock of which is and has been so registered, the term "Principal Party"
     shall refer to such other Person, or if such Person is a Subsidiary,
     directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, the Common 


<PAGE>

                                       28


     Stocks of all of which are and have been so registered, the term 
     "Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer 
     of the Common Stock having the greatest market value of shares 
     outstanding.

          (c)  The Company shall not consummate any consolidation, merger, sale
or transfer referred to in Section 13(a) unless the Principal Party shall have a
sufficient number of authorized shares of its Common Stock which have not been
issued or reserved for issuance to permit the exercise of the Rights in
accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior thereto the Company and the
Principal Party involved therein shall have executed and delivered to the Rights
Agent an agreement confirming that the requirements of Sections 13(a) and (b)
hereof shall promptly be performed in accordance with their terms and that such
consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets shall not result in a default
by the Principal Party under this Rights Agreement as the same shall have been
assumed by the Principal Party pursuant to Section 13(a) and (b) hereof and
further providing that, as soon as practicable after executing such agreement
pursuant to this Section 13, the Principal Party at its own expense shall:

               (i)  prepare and file a registration statement under the
     Securities Act, if necessary, with respect to the Rights and the securities
     purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, use its
     best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as
     soon as practicable after such filing and use its best efforts to cause
     such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all
     times meeting the requirements of the Act) until the date of expiration of
     the rights, and similarly comply with applicable state securities laws;

               (ii) use its best efforts, if the Common Stock of the Principal
     Party shall become listed on a national securities exchange, to list (or
     continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon
     exercise of the Rights on such securities exchange and, if the Common Stock
     of the Principal Party shall not be listed on a national securities
     exchange, to cause the Rights and the securities purchased upon exercise of
     the Rights to be reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use;

               (iii) deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial
     statements for the Principal Party which comply in all respects with the
     requirements for registration on Form 10 (or any successor form) under the
     Exchange Act; and

               (iv) obtain waivers of any rights of first refusal or preemptive
     rights in respect of the shares of Common Stock of the Principal Party
     subject to purchase upon exercise of outstanding Rights.


<PAGE>

                                       29


In the event that any of the transactions described in Section 13(a) hereof
shall occur at any time after the occurrence of a transaction described in
Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the Rights which have not theretofore been exercised
shall thereafter be exercisable in the manner described in Section 13(a).  The
provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to all successive Flip-Over
Events.

          (d)  Furthermore, in case the Principal Party which is to be a party
to a transaction referred to in this Section 13 has a provision in any of its
authorized securities or in its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or other
instrument governing its corporate affairs, which provision would have the
effect of (i) causing such Principal Party to issue, in connection with, or as a
consequence of, the consummation of a transaction referred to in this Section
13, shares of Common Stock of such Principal Party at less than the then Current
Market Price per share (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) or
securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common Stock of such Principal
Party at less than such then current market price (other than to holders of
Rights pursuant to this Section 13) or (ii) providing for any special payment,
tax or similar provisions in connection with the issuance of the Common Stock of
such Principal Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 13; then, in such
event, the Company hereby agrees with each holder of Rights that it shall not
consummate any such transaction unless prior thereto the Company and such
Principal Party shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a
supplemental agreement providing that the provision in question of such
Principal Party shall have been cancelled, waived or amended, or that the
authorized securities shall be redeemed, so that the applicable provision will
have no effect in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of
the proposed transaction.

          SECTION 14.  FRACTIONAL RIGHTS AND FRACTIONAL SHARES.

          (a)  The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or
to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights.  In lieu of
such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the holders of record of the
Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise
be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the then current
market value of a whole Right.  For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the then
current market value of a Right shall be determined in the same manner as the
Current Market Price of a share of Common Stock shall be determined pursuant to
Section 11(d) hereof.

          (b)  The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of
Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-
thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) upon exercise of the Rights or to
distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock
(other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a
share of Preferred Stock).  In lieu of issuing fractions of shares of Preferred
Stock that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share, 


<PAGE>

                                       30


there shall be paid to the holder of record of Right Certificates at the time 
such Right Certificates are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash 
equal to the same fraction of the then current market value of a share of 
Preferred Stock.  For purposes of this Section 14(b), the then current market 
value of a share of Preferred Stock shall be the Current Market Price thereof 
as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof.

          (c)  The holder of a Right by the acceptance of a Right expressly
waives his right to receive any fractional Right or any fractional shares upon
exercise of a Right.

          SECTION 15.  RIGHTS OF ACTION.  All rights of action in respect of
this Agreement, other than any rights of action vested in the Rights Agent
pursuant to Sections 18 and 20 below, are vested in the respective holders of
record of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the
holders of record of the Common Stock); and any holder of record of any Right
Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock), without
the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate
(or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock), may, in his own
behalf and for his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any
suit, action or proceeding against the Company or any other Person to enforce,
or otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by
such Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in
this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the
holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights
would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and,
accordingly, that they will be entitled to specific performance of the
obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations
of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement. Holders of Rights
shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorneys' fees, incurred by them in any action to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement.

          SECTION 16.  AGREEMENT OF RIGHT HOLDERS.  Every holder of a Right by
accepting the same consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and
with every other holder of a Right that:

          (a)  prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be evidenced
by a Right Certificate and will be transferable only in connection with the
transfer of Common Stock;

          (b)  after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates will be
transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at
the principal offices of the Rights Agent, duly endorsed or accompanied by a
proper instrument of transfer;

          (c)  the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in
whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the
associated Common Stock certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof
and of the Rights evidenced 


<PAGE>

                                       31


thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right 
Certificate or the associated Common Stock certificate made by anyone other 
than the Company or the Rights Agent or the transfer agent of the Common 
Stock) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights 
Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary; and

          (d)  notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company nor the Rights Agent, subject to the last sentence of
Section 7(f), shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other Person
as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute,
rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental
authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation;
PROVIDED, however, the Company must use its best efforts to have any such order,
decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.

          SECTION 17.  RIGHT CERTIFICATE HOLDER NOT DEEMED A SHAREHOLDER.  No
holder of a Right, as such, shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends in
respect of or be deemed for any purpose to be the holder of Preferred Stock or
any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable upon the
exercise of the Rights, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right
Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as
such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote in
the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any
meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to
receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting shareholders (except as
provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights
in respect of any such stock or securities, or otherwise, until the Right or
Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

          SECTION 18.  CONCERNING THE RIGHTS AGENT.

          (a)  The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable
compensation for all service rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on
demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other
disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Rights
Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder.  The Company
also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against,
any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent for anything done or omitted
to be done by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and
administration of the Rights Agreement, including the cost and expenses of
defending against any claim of liability in the premises.  The indemnity
provided herein shall survive the expiration of the Rights and the termination
of this Rights Agreement.


<PAGE>

                                       32


          (b)  The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability
for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection
with its administration of this Rights Agreement in reliance upon any Right
Certificate, certificate for Preferred Stock or other securities of the Company,
instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit,
letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement or other paper or
document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where
necessary, guaranteed, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or
Persons.

          SECTION 19.  MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OR CHANGED NAME OF RIGHTS AGENT.

          (a)  Any corporation into which the Rights Agent or any successor
Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent
or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to
the corporate trust or stock transfer business of the Rights Agent or any
successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent, under this
Rights Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act
on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such corporation would
be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of
Section 21 hereof.  In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall
succeed to the agency created by this Rights Agreement, any of the Right
Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor
Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and
deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and, in case at that time any
of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor
Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the
predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in
all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the
Right Certificates and in this Rights Agreement.

          (b)  In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed
and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but
not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior
name and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that
time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights
Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its
changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certificate shall have the full
force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Rights Agreement.

          SECTION 20.  DUTIES OF RIGHTS AGENT.  The Rights Agent undertakes the
duties and obligations imposed by this Rights Agreement upon the following terms
and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holder of Right
Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:


<PAGE>

                                       33


          (a)  The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal
counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and
complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

          (b)  Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Rights
Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or
matter (including, without limitation, the identity of any Acquiring Person) be
proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action
hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be
herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and
established by certificate signed by the President or any Vice President and by
the Chief Financial Officer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the
Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full
authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith
by it under the provisions of this Rights Agreement in reliance upon such
certificate.

          (c)  The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its own gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

          (d)  The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of
the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Rights Agreement or in the
Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to
verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to
have been made by the Company only.

          (e)  The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect
of the validity of this Right Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof
(except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the
validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature
thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any
covenant or condition contained in this Rights Agreement or in any Right
Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any adjustment required under the
provisions of Sections 11, 13, 23 or 24 hereof or responsible for the manner,
method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of
facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the
exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a
certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12 describing any such adjustment);
nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or
warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Preferred Stock
to be issued pursuant to this Rights Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to
whether any shares of Preferred Stock will, when issued, be validly authorized
and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

          (f)  The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and
deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such
further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required
by the Rights Agent for 


<PAGE>

                                       34


the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this 
Rights Agreement.

          (g)  The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept
instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from the
Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or
any Assistant Secretary or the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and to
apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties,
and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered to be taken by it in
good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer.  Any application
by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option
of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or
omitted by the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement and the date on and/or
after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective
subject to Section 20(c) hereof, the Rights Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal
included in any such application on or after the date specified in such
application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date
any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such
officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to
taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the
Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such
application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.

          (h)  The Rights Agent and any shareholder, director, officer or
employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other
securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in
which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the
Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not the Rights
Agent under this Rights Agreement.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights
Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other entity.

          (i)   The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or
powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or
through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or
accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or
agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default,
neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection
and continued employment thereof.

          (j)  No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if
there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it.


<PAGE>

                                       35


          (k)   If, with respect to any Right Certificate surrendered to the 
Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in the form 
of assignment or the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse 
thereof, as the case may be, has either not been completed or indicates an 
affirmative response to clause 1 and/or 2 thereof, the Rights Agent shall not 
take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer 
without first consulting with the Company.

          SECTION 21.  CHANGE OF RIGHTS AGENT.  The Rights Agent or any 
successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under 
this Rights Agreement upon 30 days notice in writing, or such earlier period 
as shall be agreed to in writing, mailed to the Company and to each transfer 
agent of the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock by registered or certified 
mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail.  The 
Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent (with or 
without cause) upon 30 days notice in writing, or such earlier period as 
shall be agreed to in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights 
Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Preferred Stock 
and the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of 
the Right Certificates by first-class mail.  If the Rights Agent shall resign 
or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company 
shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions of this Section 21, in no event shall the registration or removal 
of a Rights Agent be effective until a successor Rights Agent shall have been 
appointed and have accepted such appointment.  If the Company shall fail to 
make such appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal or after 
it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the 
resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right 
Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for 
inspection by the Company), then the incumbent Rights Agent or the holder of 
record of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent 
jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights 
Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (a) a 
corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States 
or any State thereof, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws 
to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to 
supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the 
time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at 
least $50,000,000 or (b) an Affiliate controlled by a corporation described 
in clause (a) of this sentence.  After appointment, the successor Rights 
Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and 
responsibilities as if it had been originally named Rights Agent without 
further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and 
transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it 
hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or 
deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later than the effective date of any 
such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the 
predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Preferred Stock and 
the Common Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered 
holders of the Right Certificates.  Failure to give any notice provided for 
in this Section 21,

                                       36


however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of 
the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the 
successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.

          SECTION 22.  ISSUANCE OF NEW RIGHT CERTIFICATES.   Notwithstanding 
any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement or of the Rights to the 
contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates 
evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors 
to reflect any adjustment or change in the purchase price per share and the 
number or kind or class of shares of stock or other securities or property 
purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the 
provisions of this Rights Agreement. In addition, in connection with the 
issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date 
and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights, the Company (a) 
shall, with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to 
the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, or 
upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities hereinafter issued by 
the Company, and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or 
appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, issue Right 
Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with 
such issuance or sale; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) no such Right Certificate 
shall be issued if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by 
counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material 
adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Person to whom such Right 
Certificate would be issued, and (ii) no such Right Certificate shall be 
issued, if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise 
have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.

          SECTION 23.  REDEMPTION.  

          (a)  (i) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, 
at any time prior to the earlier of (x) the Close of Business on the tenth 
day following a Stock Acquisition Date, subject to extension by the Board of 
Directors as provided in Section 27 hereof or (y) the Close of Business on 
the Final Expiration Date, redeem all but not less than all the then 
outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $.01 per Right, as such amount 
may be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or 
similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price 
being hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption Price"), and the Company 
may, at its option, by action of a majority of the Company's Board of 
Directors, pay the Redemption Price either in shares of Common Stock (based 
on the current market price, determined in accordance with Section 11(d), of 
the shares of Common Stock at the time of redemption) or cash; PROVIDED that, 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 23(a), the 
Company may not take any action pursuant to this Section 23(a) unless (x) at 
the time of the action of the Board of Directors of the Company approving 
such redemption and the form of payment of the Redemption Price, there are 
then in office not less than two Continuing Directors and (y) such action is 
approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office.  Subject 


<PAGE>

                                       37


to the foregoing, the redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such 
time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its 
sole discretion may establish.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this 
Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable after the 
first occurrence of a Flip-In Event until such time as the Board of 
Directors' right of redemption under this Section 23(a)(i) has expired.

          (ii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the 
contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem all but not less 
than all of the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price following the 
occurrence of a Stock Acquisition Date but prior to any Flip-Over Event in 
connection with a Flip-Over Event in which all holders of Common Stock are 
treated like and not involving (other than as a holder of Common Stock being 
treated like all other such holders) an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or 
Associate of an Acquiring Person or any other Person in which such Acquiring 
Person, Affiliate or Associate has an interest, or any other Person or 
Persons acting directly or indirectly on behalf of or in association with any 
such Acquiring Person, Affiliate or Associate.

          (b)   Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the 
Company ordering the redemption of the Rights (the date of such action being 
the "Redemption Date"), and without any further action and without any 
notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right 
thereafter or the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price, 
without any interest thereon.  Within 10 days after the Redemption Date, the 
Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and the 
holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such 
holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the 
Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the 
transfer agent of the Common Stock.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner 
herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the 
notice.  Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the 
payment of the Redemption Price will be made.  The failure to give notice 
required by this Section 23(b) or any defect therein shall not affect the 
legality or validity of the action taken by the Company.

          (c)  In the case of a redemption permitted under Section 23(a), the 
Company may, at its option, discharge all of its obligations with respect to 
the Rights by (i) issuing a press release announcing the manner of redemption 
of the Rights and (ii) mailing payment of the Redemption Price to the 
registered holders of the Rights at their last addresses as they appear on 
the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on 
the registry books of the transfer agent of the Common Stock, and upon such 
action, all outstanding Right Certificates shall be null and void without any 
further action by the Company.

                                       38


          SECTION 24.  EXCHANGE.

          (a)  (i)  The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, 
at any time after any person becomes an Acquiring Person, upon resolution 
adopted by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors, exchange all or 
part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include 
Rights that have become null and void pursuant Section 7(f)) for Units of 
Preferred Stock at an exchange ratio of one Unit of Preferred Stock per 
Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or 
similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such exchange ratio 
being hereinafter referred to as the "SECTION 24(A)(I) EXCHANGE RATIO").  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not effect such exchange at 
any time after any Person (other than an Exempt Person), together with all 
Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% 
or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding.

          (ii)   The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at 
any time after any person becomes an Acquiring Person, upon resolution 
adopted by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors, exchange all or 
part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include 
Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 7(f)) for Units of 
Preferred Stock at an exchange ratio specified in the following sentence, as 
appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar 
transaction occurring after the date hereof.  Subject to such adjustment, 
each Right may be exchanged for that number of Units of Preferred Stock 
obtained by dividing the Adjustment Spread (as defined below) by the then 
Current Market Price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) per Unit of 
Preferred Stock on the earlier of (i) the date on which any Person becomes an 
Acquiring Person and (ii) the date on which a tender or exchange offer by any 
Person (other than an Exempt Person) is first published or sent or given 
within the meaning of Rule 14d-4(a) of the Exchange Act Regulations or any 
successor rule, if upon consummation thereof such Person would be the 
Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then 
outstanding (such exchange ratio being the "SECTION 24(A)(II) EXCHANGE 
RATIO").  The "ADJUSTMENT SPREAD" shall equal (x) the aggregate market price 
on the date of such event of the number of Adjustment Shares determined 
pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii), minus (y) the Purchase Price.  Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, the Company may not effect such exchange at any time after any 
Person (other than an Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and 
Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the 
shares of the Common Stock then outstanding.

          Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 24(a) to the 
contrary, the Company may not exchange any Rights pursuant to this Section 
24(a) unless (x) at the time of the action of the Board of Directors of the 
Company approving such exchange, there are then in office not less than two 
Continuing Directors and (y) such exchange is approved by a majority of the 
Continuing Directors then in office.


<PAGE>

                                       39


          (b)  Immediately upon the action of a majority of the Continuing 
Directors ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to Section 24(a) and 
without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such 
Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such 
Rights shall be to receive that number of Units of Preferred Stock equal to 
the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Section 
24(a)(i) Exchange Ratio or Section 24(a)(ii) Exchange Ratio, as the case may 
be.  The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice 
shall not affect the validity of such exchange.  The Company promptly shall 
mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at 
their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights 
Agent.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be 
deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.  Each such 
notice of exchange shall state the method by which the exchange of Units of 
Preferred Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial 
exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange 
shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights 
which have become void pursuant to Section 7(f)) held by each holder of 
Rights.

          (c)  In the event that the number of shares of Preferred Stock 
which are authorized by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation but not 
outstanding or reserved for issuance for purposes other than upon exercise of 
the Rights are not sufficient to permit any exchange of Rights as 
contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all 
such action as may be necessary to authorize additional shares of Preferred 
Stock for issuance upon exchange of the Rights or make adequate provision to 
substitute (1) cash, (2) Common Stock or other equity securities of the 
Company, (3) debt securities of the Company, (4) other assets or (5) any 
combination of the foregoing, having an aggregate value equal to the 
Adjustment Spread, where such aggregate value has been determined by a 
majority of the Continuing Directors.

          (d)  The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Units 
of Preferred Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional 
Units. In lieu of fractional Units, the Company may pay to the registered 
holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exchanged as herein 
provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the Current Market 
Price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) of one Unit of Preferred Stock.

          SECTION 25.  NOTICE OF PROPOSED ACTIONS.  

          (a)  In case the Company, after the Distribution Date, shall 
propose (i) to effect any of the transactions referred to in Section 11(a)(i) 
or to pay any dividend to the holders of record of its Common Stock payable 
in stock of any class or to make any other distribution to the holders of 
record of its Common Stock (other than a regular periodic cash 


<PAGE>

                                       40


dividend), or (ii) to offer to the holders of record of its Common Stock or 
options, warrants, or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase shares of 
Common Stock (including any security convertible into or exchangeable for 
Common Stock) or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, 
options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities or other rights, or 
(iii) to effect any reclassification of its Common Stock or any 
recapitalization or reorganization of the Company, or (iv) to effect any 
consolidation or merger with or into, or to effect any sale or other transfer 
(or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other 
transfer), in one or more transactions, of more than 50% of the assets or 
earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any 
other Person or Persons, or (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or 
winding up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give to 
each holder of record of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 
hereof, notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date 
for the purposes of such transaction referred to in Section 11(a)(i), or such 
dividend or distribution, or the date on which such reclassification, 
recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of 
assets, liquidation, dissolution or winding up is to take place and the 
record date for determining participation therein by the holders of record of 
Common Stock, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so 
given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least 
10 days prior to the record date for determining holders of record of the 
Common Stock for purposes of such action, and in the case of such other 
action, at least 10 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed 
action or the date of participation therein by the holders of record of 
Common Stock, whichever shall be the earlier.

          (b)  In case any of the transactions referred to in Section 
11(a)(ii) or Section 13 of this Rights Agreement are proposed, then, in any 
such case, the Company shall give to each holder of Rights, in accordance 
with Section 26 hereof, notice of the proposal of such transaction at least 
10 days prior to consummating such transaction, which notice shall specify 
the proposed event and the consequences of the event to the holders of Rights 
under Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13 hereof, as the case may be, and, upon 
consummating such transaction, shall similarly give notice thereof to each 
holder of Rights.

          (c)   The failure to give notice required by this Section 25 or any 
defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the action taken 
by the Company or the vote upon any such action.

          SECTION 26.  NOTICES.  Notices or demands authorized by the Rights 
Agreement to be given or made by the Rights Agent or by the holder of record 
of any Right Certificate or Right to or on behalf of the Company shall be 
sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, 
addressed (until another address is filed in writing with the Rights Agent)

          SECTION 27.  SUPPLEMENTS AND AMENDMENTS.  The Company and the 
Rights Agent may from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without 
approval of any holders of Right Certificates in order (i) to cure any

Rights Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company or the Rights Agent shall
bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns
hereunder.

          SECTION 29.  DETERMINATIONS AND ACTIONS BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
ETC.

accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Exchange Act
Regulations as in effect on the date hereof.  Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, and subject to paragraph (b) of this Section 29, the Board of

granted to the Board of Directors of the Company or to the Company, or as may be
necessary or advisable in the administration of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the right and power (i) to interpret the provisions of this
Agreement and (ii) to make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for
the administration of this Agreement.  All such actions, calculations,
interpretations and determinations (including, for purposes of clause (y) below,
all omissions with respect to the foregoing) which are done or made by the Board
or by a majority of the Continuing Directors in good faith shall (x) be final,
conclusive and binding on the Company, the Rights Agent, the holders of the
Rights and all other parties, and (y) not subject the Board of Directors of the
Company or any member thereof to any liability to the holders of the Rights.

          (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

          SECTION 30.  BENEFITS OF THIS RIGHTS AGREEMENT.  Nothing in this
Rights Agreement shall be construed to give to any person or corporation other
than the Company, the Rights Agent and the registered holders of the Right
Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the Common Stock) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Rights Agreement; but this Rights
Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company, the Rights
Agent and the holders of record of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the
Distribution Date, the Common Stock).

          SECTION 31.  GOVERNING LAW.  This Rights Agreement and each Right 
Certificate issued hereunder shall be deemed to be a contract made under the 
laws of the State of Delaware (or the laws of the state of incorporation of 
any successor of the Company) and for all purposes shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of such state applicable to contracts 
to be made solely by residents of such state and performed entirely within 
such state.

          SECTION 32.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Rights Agreement may be executed 
in any number of counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for all 
purposes be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall 
together constitute but one and the same Instrument.

          SECTION 33.  DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS.  Descriptive headings of the 
several sections of this Rights Agreement are inserted for convenience only 
and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the 
provisions hereof.

          SECTION 34.  SEVERABILITY.  If any term, provision, covenant or 
restriction of this Rights Agreement is held by a court of competent 
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the 
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Rights 
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be 
affected, impaired or invalidated; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that notwithstanding 
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any such term, provision, 
covenant or restriction is held by such court or authority to be invalid, 
void or unenforceable and a majority of the Continuing Directors determines 
in its good faith judgment that severing the invalid language from this 
Agreement would adversely affect the purpose or effect of this Agreement and 
the Rights shall not then be redeemable, the right of redemption set forth in 
Section 23 shall be reinstated and shall not expire until the Close of 
Business on the tenth Business Day following the date of such determination 
by a majority of the Continuing Directors.

                            ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED

This certifies that _________________________, or registered assigns, is the
registered owner of the number of Rights set forth above, each of which entitles
the owner thereof, subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Second
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of August __, 1997 ("Rights

Right Certificate shall have been exercised or exchanged as provided in the
Rights Agreement.

Directors does hereby create, authorize and provide for the issuance of the

participating, optional and other special rights, preferences, and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof that are set forth as
follows:

          Section 2.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.  (A)  Subject to the prior 
and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any other series of 
Preferred Stock or any other shares of preferred stock of the Corporation 
ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with 
respect to dividends, each holder of one one-thousandth (1/1,000) of a share 
(a "UNIT") of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as 
and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for 
that purpose, (i) quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of 
March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being a 
"QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on the first Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of such Unit of Series A 
Preferred Stock, in an amount per Unit (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to 
the greater of (a) $.01 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment 
hereinafter set forth, the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends 
declared on shares of the Common Stock since the immediately preceding 
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of a Unit of Series A 
Preferred Stock, and (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter 
set forth, quarterly distributions (payable in kind) on each Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date in an amount per Unit equal to the aggregate per share 
amount of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than a 
dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the 
outstanding shares of Common Stock, by reclassification or otherwise) 
declared on shares of Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date, or with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend 
Payment Date, since the first issuance of a Unit of Series A Preferred Stock. 
In the event that the Corporation shall at any time after July 11, 1990 (the 
"RIGHTS DECLARATION DATE") (i) declare any dividend on outstanding shares of 
Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding 
shares of Common Stock or (iii) combine outstanding shares of Common Stock 
into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which 
the holder of a Unit of Series A Preferred Stock was entitled immediately 
prior to such event pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by 
multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the 
number of shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately after such 
event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common 
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

          (B)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above 
immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the shares of 
Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have 
been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment 
Date, a dividend of $.01 per Unit on the Series A Preferred Stock shall 
nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.


                                      C-2

<PAGE>


          (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and shall be cumulative on 
each outstanding Unit of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend 
Payment Date next preceding the date of issuance of such Unit of Series A 
Preferred Stock, unless the date of issuance of such Unit is prior to the 
record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case, 
dividends on such Unit shall begin to accrue from the date of issuance of 
such Unit, or unless the date of issuance is a Quarterly Dividend Payment 
Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend 
and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events 
such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. 
Dividends paid on Units of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than 
the aggregate amount of all such dividends at the time accrued and payable on 
such Units shall be allocated pro rata on a unit-by-unit basis among all 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding.  The Board of 
Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or 
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 
days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

          Section 3.  VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of Units of Series A 
Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

     (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each 
Unit of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote 
on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.  
In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration 
Date (i) declare any dividend on outstanding shares of Common Stock payable 
in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding shares of Common Stock 
or (iii) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number 
of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per Unit to which 
holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior 
to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the 
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding 
immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number 
of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such 
event.

     (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of Units 
of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall 
vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
of the Corporation.

     (C)  (i)  If at any time dividends on any Units of Series A Preferred 
Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends 
thereon, then during the period (a "DEFAULT PERIOD") from the occurrence of 
such event until such time as all accrued and unpaid dividends for all 
previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend 


                                      C-3

<PAGE>

period on all Units of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have 
been declared and paid or set apart for payment, all holders of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, shall have the right 
to elect two Directors.

     (ii)  During any default period, such voting rights of the holders of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special 
meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any 
annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of 
stockholders, provided that neither such voting rights nor any right of the 
holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock to increase, in certain cases, 
the authorized number of Directors may be exercised at any meeting unless 
one-third of the outstanding Units of Preferred Stock shall be present at 
such meeting in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of 
Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Units of Series 
A Preferred Stock of such rights.  At any meeting at which the holders of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting rights initially 
during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting 
separately as a class, to elect Directors to fill up to two vacancies in the 
Board of Directors, if any such vacancies may then exist, or, if such right 
is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two Directors.  If the number 
which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the 
required number, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the 
right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary 
to permit the election by them of the required number.  After the holders of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect 
Directors during any default period, the number of Directors shall not be 
increased or decreased except as approved by a vote of the holders of Units 
of Series A Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of 
any equity securities ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock.

     (iii)  Unless the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall, during an 
existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect 
Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or 
stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 25% of the total number of 
the Units of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding may request, the calling of 
a special meeting of the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock, which 
meeting shall thereupon be called by the Secretary of the Corporation.  
Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph 
(C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Units of Series A 
Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address 
as the same appears on the books of the Corporation.  Such meeting shall be 
called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later then 60 days after 
such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 
days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar 
notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less 
than 25% of the total number of outstanding Units of Series A Preferred 
Stock.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (C)(iii), no such 
special meeting shall be called during the 60 days immediately preceding the 
date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

     (iv)  During any default period, the holders of shares of Common Stock 
and Units of Series A Preferred Stock, and other classes or series of stock 
of the Corporation, if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect all 
the Directors until holders of the Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall 
have exercised their right to elect two Directors voting as a separate class, 
after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders 
of Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their 
successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of 
the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except 
as provided in paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a 
majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the 
class of capital stock which elected the Director whose office shall have 
become vacant. References in this paragraph (C) to Directors elected by the 
holders of a particular class of capital stock shall include Directors 
elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the 
foregoing sentence.

     (v)  Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right 
of the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class to 
elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the 
holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class shall 
terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be 
provided for in the Certificate or by-laws irrespective of any increase made 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such 
number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by 
law or in the Certificate or by-laws).  Any vacancies in the Board of 
Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding 
sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.

     (vi)  The provisions of this paragraph (C) shall govern the election of 
Directors by holders of Units of Preferred Stock during any default period 
notwithstanding any provisions of the Certificate to the contrary, including, 
without limitation, the provisions of Article V of the Certificate.

          (D)  Except as set forth herein, holders of Units of Series A 
Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consents shall 
not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders 
of shares of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate 
action.

          Section 4.  CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.  (A)  Whenever quarterly 
dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on Units of Series A 
Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until 
all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, 
on outstanding Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid in 
full, the Corporation shall not

          (i)  declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or
     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of
     junior stock;


                                      C-5

<PAGE>

          (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on
     any shares of parity stock, except dividends paid ratably on Units of
     Series A Preferred Stock and shares of all such parity stock on which
     dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to
     which the holders of such Units and all such shares are then entitled;

          (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
     shares of any parity stock, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Corporation may at
     any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity
     stock in exchange for shares of any junior stock;

          (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any Units of
     Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made
     in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to
     all holders of such Units.

          (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the 
Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of 
stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of 
this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in 
such manner.

          Section 5.  REACQUIRED SHARES.  Any Units of Series A Preferred 
Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner 
whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition 
thereof.  All such Units shall, upon their cancellation, become authorized 
but unissued Units of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new 
series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the 
Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance 
set forth herein.

          Section 6.  LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.  (A)  Upon any 
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the 
Corporation, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of 
junior stock unless the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall 
have received, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided in paragraph 
(B), the greater of either (a) $.01 per Unit plus an amount equal to accrued 
and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or 
declared, to the date of such payment, or (b) the amount equal to the 
aggregate per share amount to be distributed to holders of shares of Common 
Stock, or (ii) to the holders of shares of parity stock, unless 
simultaneously therewith distributions are made ratably on Units of Series A 
Preferred Stock and all other shares of such parity stock in proportion to 
the total amounts to which the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock 
are entitled under clause (i)(a) of this sentence and to which the holders of 
shares of such parity stock are entitled, in each case upon such liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up.


                                      C-6

<PAGE>

          (B)  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights
Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on outstanding shares of Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding shares of Common
Stock, or (iii) combine outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of Units
of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event
pursuant to clause (i)(b) of paragraph (A) of this Section 6 shall be adjusted
by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately after such
event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

          Section 7.  CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.  In case the Corporation 
shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction 
in which the shares of common stock are exchanged for or converted into other 
stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly 
exchanged for or converted into an amount per Unit (subject to the provision 
for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to the aggregate amount of stock, 
securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may 
be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is converted or 
exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights 
Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on outstanding shares of Common 
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding shares of 
Common Stock, or (iii) combine outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number 
of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the immediately 
preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or conversion of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a 
fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock 
that are outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of 
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding 
immediately prior to such event.

          Section 8.  REDEMPTION.  The Units of Series A Preferred Stock 
shall not be redeemable.

          Section 9.  RANKING.  The Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall 
rank junior to all other series of the Preferred Stock and to any other class 
of preferred stock that hereafter may be issued by the Corporation as to the 
payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any 
such series or class shall provide otherwise.

          Section 10.  AMENDMENT.  The Certificate, including, without 
limitation, this resolution, shall not hereafter be amended, either directly 
or indirectly, or through merger or consolidation with another corporations 
in any manner that would alter or change the powers, preferences or special 
rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely 


                                      C-7

<PAGE>

without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the 
outstanding Units of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.

          Section 11.  FRACTIONAL SHARES.  The Series A Preferred Stock may be
issued in Units or other fractions of a share, which Units or fractions shall
entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to
exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to
have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

          Section 12.  CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  As used herein with respect to the
Series A Preferred Stock, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

          (A)  The term "COMMON STOCK" shall mean the class of stock designated
