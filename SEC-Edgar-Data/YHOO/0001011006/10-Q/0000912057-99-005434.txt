<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Note&nbsp;4&#151;Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common equivalent shares, outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of the incremental common shares
issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock (using the if-converted method) and shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock
method). For the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 and the three month period ended September&nbsp;30, 1998, common equivalent shares were approximately
36.8&nbsp;million, 41.0&nbsp;million and 47.4&nbsp;million shares, respectively, representing shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
1998, options to purchase approximately 57.6&nbsp;million shares were outstanding but were not included in the computation because they were antidilutive. Net income (loss) was adjusted for the
three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 1998 to reflect accretion related to the Mandatory Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock in the amount of $199,000 and $1.4&nbsp;million,
respectively, in computing basic and diluted net income (loss) per share.

amortized as compensation expense over the one-year period. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with the provisions of APB 16, "Business Combinations". Under the
purchase method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Results of operations
for Log-Me-On for periods prior to the
acquisition were not material to the Company. Results of operations for Log-Me-On have been included with those of the company for periods subsequent to the acquisition date.</FONT></P>

founded in 1998, was a development stage entity with limited operations, no revenues, and employed four developers. As of the acquisition date, the
Company's efforts were focused solely on developing a browser technology that was approximately 30% complete and there was no other technology developed or in process at such date. Approximately
$9.8&nbsp;million was allocated to in-process research and development. This in-process research and development had not reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Additional development subsequent to the acquisition date principally relates to development of browser and toolbar technology that would allow users into Yahoo! sites without
typing URLs or retrieving bookmarks, creation of the user interface, development of customization screens and procedures, and establishment of data links. The Company expects the development of this
technology to be completed in the third quarter of 2000. Future research and development costs are not expected to be material to Yahoo!'s financial position or results of operations. In addition, if
this technology is not successfully developed, Yahoo!'s revenues and profitability would not be materially adversely affected. The remaining purchase price of approximately $100,000 was allocated to
the work force in place and is being amortized over the employment contract

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Net Revenues</B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net revenues were $155.1&nbsp;million and $387.5&nbsp;million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, respectively, which represent
increases of 134% and 152% when compared with the corresponding periods in 1998. The increases were due primarily to the increasing number of advertisers purchasing space on the Company's online media
properties as well as larger and longer-term purchases by certain advertisers. Approximately 3,200 customers advertised on the Company's online media properties during the quarter ended
September&nbsp;30, 1999 as compared to approximately 2,100 during the third quarter of 1998. No one customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during the three and nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 1999 and 1998. Advertising purchases by SOFTBANK and its related companies (such as E*Trade Group,&nbsp;Inc. and E-Loan,&nbsp;Inc.), a 24% stockholder of the
Company at September&nbsp;30, 1999, accounted for approximately 3% and 5% of net revenues during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, respectively, as compared to 7% and 3% in
the corresponding periods in fiscal 1998. Contracted prices on these orders are comparable to those given to other similarly situated customers of the Company. International revenues have accounted
for less than 10% of net revenues during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 and 1998. Barter revenues also represented less than 10% of net revenues during those periods. There
can be no assurance that customers will continue to purchase advertising on the Company's Web pages, that advertisers will not make smaller and shorter-term purchases, or that market
prices for Web-based advertising will not decrease due to competitive or other factors. Additionally, while the Company has experienced strong revenue growth since its inception,
management does not believe that this level of revenue growth will be sustained in future periods.</FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Cost of Revenues</B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of revenues consists of the expenses associated with the production and usage of Yahoo! and the Company's other online media properties. These costs
primarily consist of fees paid to third parties for content included on the Company's online media properties, Internet connection charges, amortization of purchased technology, equipment
depreciation, and compensation. Cost of revenues were $26.2&nbsp;million, or 17% of net revenues for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 compared to $14.1 million, or 21% of net
revenues for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, cost of revenues were $72.3&nbsp;million, or 19% of net revenues compared to
$34.7&nbsp;million, or 23% of net revenues for the corresponding period in fiscal 1998. The absolute dollar increase in cost of revenues from the year ago periods is primarily attributable to an
increase in the quantity of content available on the Company's online media properties, the increased usage of these properties, and the amortization of purchased technology. The Company anticipates
that its content and Internet connection expenses will continue to increase with the quantity and quality of content available on Yahoo! online media properties, and increased usage of these
properties. As measured in page&nbsp;views (defined as electronic page&nbsp;displays), the Company delivered an average of approximately 385&nbsp;million page&nbsp;views per day in
September&nbsp;1999 compared with an average of
approximately 191&nbsp;million page&nbsp;views per day in September&nbsp;1998. Yahoo! Japan, an unconsolidated joint venture of the Company, is included in these page views figures and accounted
for an average of more than 33&nbsp;million per day in September&nbsp;1999 and an average of approximately 11&nbsp;million per day in September&nbsp;1998. The Company anticipates that its
content and Internet connection expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales and marketing expenses were $53.3&nbsp;million for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, or 34% of net revenues as compared to

<!-- ZEQ.=3,SEQ=13,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=13,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FK2490A.;5',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
were $144.2&nbsp;million, or 37% of net revenues as compared to $82.1&nbsp;million, or 53% of net revenues for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. Sales and marketing expenses consist
primarily of advertising and other marketing related expenses (which include distribution costs), compensation and employee-related expenses, sales commissions, and travel costs. The increase in
absolute dollars from the year ago periods is primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and distribution costs associated with the Company's aggressive brand-building strategy, increases in
compensation expense associated with growth in its direct sales force and marketing personnel, expansion in the international subsidiaries with the addition of subsidiaries in Brazil, Canada, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Spain, and Taiwan subsequent to September&nbsp;1998, and an increase in sales commissions associated with the increase in revenues. The Company anticipates that sales and marketing
expenses in absolute dollars will increase in future periods as it continues to pursue an aggressive brand-building strategy through advertising and distribution, continues to expand its international
operations, and continues to build its global direct sales organization.</FONT></P>

$8.6&nbsp;million, or 13% of net revenues for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, product development expenses were
$44.8&nbsp;million, or 12% of net revenues as compared to $23.1&nbsp;million, or 15% of net revenues for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. Product development expenses consist
primarily of employee compensation relating to developing and enhancing the features and functionality of Yahoo! online media properties. The increase in absolute dollars from the year ago periods is
primarily attributable to increases in the number of engineers that develop and enhance Yahoo! online media properties. The Company believes that significant investments in product development are
required to remain competitive. Consequently, the Company expects to incur increased product development expenditures in absolute dollars in future periods.</FONT></P>

$25.2&nbsp;million, or 6% of net revenues as compared to $15.7&nbsp;million, or 10% of net revenues for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of compensation and fees for professional services, and the increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to increases in these areas. The Company believes that the absolute dollar
level of general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods, as a result of an increase in personnel and increased fees for professional services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amortization expense was $3.5&nbsp;million for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 and $0.9&nbsp;million for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30,
1998. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 amortization expense was $10.1&nbsp;million as compared to $1.2&nbsp;million for the same period ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. The
increase is principally attributable to goodwill amortization from the June&nbsp;1998 Viaweb acquisition, the December&nbsp;1998 HyperParallel acquisition, the December&nbsp;1998 Starseed
acquisition, and the January&nbsp;1999 Yahoo! Canada acquisition. These acquisitions resulted in $71.1&nbsp;million in additional goodwill and other intangible assets.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, the Company recorded a nonrecurring cost of $22.1 million which was attributable to the acquisition
related costs from the broadcast.com acquisition. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, the Company recorded nonrecurring costs of $88.5&nbsp;million. These costs were primarily
attributable to acquisition related costs resulting from the acquisitions of GeoCities, broadcast.com, Encompass, Online Anywhere, and Net Roadshow and totaled $78.7&nbsp;million for the nine months
ended September&nbsp;30, 1999. The Company also recorded a nonrecurring charge of $9.8&nbsp;million in connection with the Log-Me-On acquisition for in-process
research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998, the Company recorded nonrecurring costs of $15.3&nbsp;million. These costs were due primarily to in-process research

September&nbsp;30, 1998. The increase from the year ago periods is primarily attributable to a higher average investment balance, principally due to proceeds of $250&nbsp;million received by the
Company on July&nbsp;14, 1998 from a private placement of shares to SOFTBANK, $43.2&nbsp;million from the July&nbsp;1998 broadcast.com initial public offering, $84.3&nbsp;million from the
August&nbsp;1998 GeoCities initial public offering, and cash provided by operations. Investment income in future periods may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in average cash balances maintained
by the Company and changes in the market rates of its investments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Minority Interests in Operations of Consolidated Subsidiaries</B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minority interests in income from operations of consolidated subsidiaries were $569,000 and $1,733,000 for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
1999 as compared to minority interests in losses from operations of consolidated subsidiaries of $10,000 and $365,000 for the same periods in fiscal 1998. The decrease is attributable to the
profitable results recorded in the European and Korean joint ventures in the aggregate during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 as compared to losses in the year ago periods.
The Company expects that minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries in the aggregate will continue to fluctuate in future periods as a function of the results from consolidated

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Income Taxes</B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's effective income tax rate was 58% for the third quarter of 1999 as compared to 57% in the year ago period. The tax rates in both periods exceed
the U.S. statutory tax rate principally due to nondeductible acquisition related costs in 1999 and, in 1998, due to limitations on the utilization of losses of certain acquired subsidiaries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
projected 1999 effective income tax rate is 40%. The tax effect of certain nondeductible one-time costs related to the acquisition of broadcast.com, Net Roadshow,
GeoCities, Encompass, and Online Anywhere were offset by the recognition of certain acquired loss carryforward benefits resulting from a change in income tax regulations in the second quarter of 1999.
This rate may change during the remainder of 1999 if operating results differ significantly from current projections.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded net income of $14.9&nbsp;million or $0.05 per share for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 compared to $4.2&nbsp;million or
$0.01 per share for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. The results for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 include a nonrecurring charge of $22.1&nbsp;million incurred in
connection with a July&nbsp;1999 acquisition and amortization of $6.0&nbsp;million from the purchased technology and intangible assets acquired in various purchase transactions. The results for
the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 1998 include amortization of $2.3&nbsp;million from the purchased technology and intangible assets acquired in various transactions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company recorded net income of $16.4&nbsp;million or $0.06 per share for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 compared to a net loss of $16.5&nbsp;million or $0.08
per share for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. The results for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 include: nonrecurring charges of $78.7&nbsp;million incurred in
connection with various 1999 acquisitions; in-process research and development of $9.8&nbsp;million incurred in connection with a January&nbsp;1999 acquisition; and amortization of
$17.3&nbsp;million from the purchased technology and intangible assets acquired in various purchase transactions. The results for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998 include a
nonrecurring charge for in-process research and development of $15.0&nbsp;million in connection with the acquisition of Viaweb and amortization of $3.0&nbsp;million from the purchased
technology and intangible assets acquired in various transactions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo! invests excess cash predominantly in debt instruments that are highly liquid, of high-quality investment grade, and predominantly have
maturities of less than one year with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes. At September&nbsp;30, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and investments in
marketable debt securities totaling $790.5&nbsp;million compared to $626.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 1998.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, cash provided by operating activities of $122.9&nbsp;million was primarily due to net income before non-cash charges
related to depreciation and amortization, purchased in-process research and development, and tax benefits from stock option plans, and increases in deferred revenue of $32.6&nbsp;million
and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $31.3&nbsp;million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $9.8&nbsp;million. The increase in deferred revenue relates
principally to overall significant growth in revenue and increases in advanced payments on several new and relatively longer sponsorship agreements. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
1998, cash provided by operating activities of $48.5&nbsp;million was primarily due to net income before non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization, purchased
in-process research and development, and tax benefits from stock options, and to increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by an
increase in accounts receivable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash
used in investing activities was $336.1&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999. Purchases (net of sales and maturities) of investments in marketable
securities and other assets during the period were $287.3&nbsp;million, $18.2&nbsp;million was paid to acquire Yahoo! Canada, and capital
expenditures totaled $30.6&nbsp;million. Capital expenditures have generally been comprised of purchases of computer hardware and software as well as leasehold improvements related to leased
facilities, and are expected to increase in future periods. Cash used by investing activities was $260.2&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998. Purchases (net of sales and
maturities) of investments in marketable securities and other assets during the period were $247.8&nbsp;million and capital expenditures totaled $12.4&nbsp;million.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1999, cash provided by financing activities of $124.1 million was primarily due to the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise
of stock options. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 1998, cash provided by financing activities of $428.4&nbsp;million
<!-- ZEQ.=2,SEQ=16,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=16,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FM2490A.;6',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
was primarily due to the receipt of $25.0&nbsp;million in connection with the sale of Mandatory Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, $250&nbsp;million from the issuance of Common Stock to
SOFTBANK, $43.2&nbsp;million from the July&nbsp;1998 broadcast.com initial public offering, $84.3&nbsp;million from the August&nbsp;1998 GeoCities initial public offering, and the issuance of
Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company currently has no material commitments other than those under operating lease agreements. The Company has experienced a substantial increase in its capital expenditures and
operating lease arrangements since its inception, which is consistent with increased staffing, and anticipates that this will continue in the future. Additionally, the Company will continue to
evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, and technologies that are complementary to those of the Company, which may require the use of cash. Management believes
existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet the Company's operating requirements for at least the next twelve months; however, the Company may sell additional equity or debt securities or
obtain credit facilities to further enhance its liquidity position. The sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to the Company's stockholders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Year 2000 Implications</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two-digit entries in the date code field and cannot
distinguish twenty-first century dates from twentieth century dates. To function properly, these date-code fields must distinguish twenty-first century dates from twentieth century dates
and, as a result, many companies' software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such "Year 2000" requirements.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo!
is dependent on the operation of numerous systems that may be adversely affected by the Year 2000 problem, including:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Yahoo!'s
internal systems; and
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>equipment,

Web-hosting services.</FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, Yahoo!'s future business depends on the successful operation of the Internet following the commencement of the Year 2000. If the Internet is inaccessible for an
appreciable period of time, or if customers and users are unable to access Yahoo!'s site, Yahoo!'s business and revenues could be materially adversely affected. Yahoo! is also subject to external
forces that might generally affect industry and commerce, such as telecommunications, utility or transportation company Year 2000 compliance failures, related service interruptions and the economic
impact that such failures have on Yahoo! customers and advertisers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year 2000 Compliance Assessment Plans.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike some other businesses, Yahoo! does not have an installed base of legacy
systems dating back many years. Nonetheless, in order to reduce the risks of the Year 2000 compliance problem, this spring, Yahoo! undertook a formal assessment of the impact of the Year 2000 problem.
The formal process involves assessment of the following Yahoo! systems:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>hardware
systems, including servers and systems used for date storage;

</FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo!
is conducting its formal assessment of Year 2000 compliance by gathering information on each aspect of Yahoo!'s systems, reviewing each component or application for date usage,
and examining date representations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to vendor-supplied items and services, Yahoo! is conducting an extensive review of product compliance information on such items and services available online, in vendor
literature and through trade group information resources, contacting its vendors for compliance information, and maintaining documentation of assessments that have been performed by such vendors or
outside sources.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on this assessment, Yahoo! currently believes that its systems are Year 2000 compliant in all material respects or can readily be brought into compliance with the application of
corrective software modifications. In many cases, we expect these modifications to be provided by the vendors of the computer and software products we have installed. Yahoo! also believes that its
major vendors have or are now addressing the Year 2000 compliance problem in a responsible manner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo!
does not anticipate, however, undertaking a formal assessment of the Year 2000 compliance of the Internet or its underlying telecommunications infrastructure, and will
therefore be unable to predict the impact of Year 2000 issues that might affect the broader Internet business community, including Yahoo!.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo!
has not incurred material costs to date in this formal assessment process, and currently does not believe that the cost of additional actions will have a material effect on its
results of operations or financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks Relating to Compliance Efforts.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the completed formal assessment, Yahoo! currently believes that its
internal systems are or can readily be made Year 2000 compliant in all material respects. However, it is possible that these current internal systems contain undetected errors or defects with Year
2000 date functions. In addition, although the Company does not anticipate problems, vendor-supplied items and services could contain undetected errors or defects which, if not corrected, could result
in serious unanticipated negative consequences, including significant downtime for one or more Yahoo! media properties.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs of Year 2000 Compliance Could Be Significant.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Yahoo! is not aware of any material operational issues or
costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the Year 2000, and
although Yahoo! has not incurred material costs to date with respect to the Year 2000 compliance of these internal systems, the occurrence of any of the following events could materially and adversely
affect Yahoo!'s business, results of operations and financial condition:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>RISK FACTORS</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly review our risk factors and other disclosures to ensure their relevancy to our current business. Although the following disclosure is different
from the disclosure included in our 10-Q for the period ended June&nbsp;30, 1999, it is not intended to indicate any significant shift in our business or any risks associated with it.
Instead, this disclosure was revised solely to provide greater focus and a shift in emphasis to more clearly identify the risks and trends which have evolved in our business over the recent past.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We are in a highly competitive industry and some of our competitors may be more successful in attracting and retaining customers.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for Internet products and services is highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to intensify. Negative competitive
developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our stock.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
compete with many other providers of online navigation, information, entertainment, business, community, electronic commerce and broadcast services. As we expand the scope of our
Internet offerings, we will compete directly with a greater number of Internet sites, media companies, and companies providing business services across a wide range of different online services,
including:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>vertical

<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>companies

<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>online
broadcasting of business events.</FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we are facing increasing competition from other companies that have combined a variety of services under one brand in a manner similar to Yahoo! including America Online,
Microsoft (MSN), CMGI (Alta Vista), the Walt Disney Company (The GO Network), Excite, Lycos and CNET. In many of these cases, our competition has a direct billing relationship with the user, which we
generally lack. This relationship permits our competitors to have several potential benefits including the potential to be more effective than us in targeting services and advertisements to the
specific taste of their users.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
large number of these websites and online services as well as high-traffic e-commerce merchants such as Amazon.com,&nbsp;Inc. also offer or are expected to
offer informational and community features that may be competitive with the services that we offer. In order to effectively compete, we may need to expend significant internal engineering resources or
acquire other technologies and companies to provide or enhance such capabilities. Any of these efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition
and be dilutive to our stockholders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Market change may impact our ability to sustain growth levels.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the uncertain nature of the rapidly changing market we serve, period-to-period comparisons of operating results are not
likely to be meaningful. In addition, you should not rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance. In particular, although we experienced strong revenue growth during each
of the first three quarters of 1999, we do not believe that this level of revenue growth on a percentage basis will be sustained in future periods. In addition, we currently expect that our operating
expenses will continue to increase significantly as we expand our sales and marketing operations, continue to develop and extend the Yahoo! brand, fund greater levels of product development, develop
and commercialize additional media properties, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. If revenue growth levels do not meet our expectations, our financial results
will be adversely affected.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We rely heavily on revenues derived from Internet advertising, which may prove to be an ineffective means of advertising for our current and potential
clients.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the majority of our revenues come from advertisements displayed on our online properties. Our ability to continue to achieve substantial advertising
revenue depends upon:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>growth
of our user base;

<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>our
ability to transition and expand into other forms of advertising.</FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we are unsuccessful in adapting to the needs of our advertisers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of advertisements under short-term contracts, which are difficult to forecast
accurately.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our revenues are currently derived from agreements with advertisers or sponsorship arrangements. These agreements generally have terms no longer than
three (3)&nbsp;years and, in many cases, the terms are much shorter. In cases where the advertiser is providing services, the agreements often have payments contingent on usage levels. Accordingly,
it is difficult to accurately forecast these revenues. However, our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues and, to a large extent, are fixed. We may be unable to adjust
spending quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, the cancellation or deferral of advertising or sponsorship contracts could have a material adverse effect on
our financial results. Because our operating expenses are likely to increase significantly over the near term, to the extent that our expenses increase but our revenues do not, our business, operating
results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>The rate structure of some of our sponsorship arrangements subjects us to financial risk.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key element of our strategy is to generate advertising revenues through sponsored services and placements by third parties in our online media properties in
addition to banner advertising. We typically receive sponsorship fees or a portion of transaction revenues in return for minimum levels of user impressions to be provided by us. These arrangements
expose us to potentially significant financial risks in the event our usage levels decrease, including the following:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>the
fees we are entitled to receive may be adjusted downwards;
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>we
may be required to "make good" on our obligations by providing alternative services;
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>the
sponsors may not renew the agreements or may renew at lower rates; and
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>the
arrangements may not generate anticipated levels of shared transaction revenues, or sponsors may default on the payment commitments in such agreements
as has occurred in the past.</FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
any leveling off or decrease of our user base or the failure to generate anticipated levels of shared transaction revenues could result in a significant decrease in our
revenue levels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We have spent considerable amounts of money and resources to provide a variety of communications services, but such services may not prove to be
successful.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a substantial portion of the traffic on our online properties is directed at our communications services, such as e-mail, instant
messaging, calendaring and chat rooms, and we expect
<!-- ZEQ.=1,SEQ=20,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=20,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FO2490A.;4',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. We provide these and other basic communications services free of charge to our users, as is the case with most of our competitors, and have not yet
determined an effective means of generating revenues from the provision of such services. In addition, alternate revenue models for our communications and electronic commerce services, such as
subscription fees and commissions, are relatively unproven and may not generate sufficient revenues to be meaningful to us. As communications services become an increasingly important part of our
total offering, we must continue to provide new communications applications and utilize more sophisticated communications technologies, while developing an effective method for generating revenues for
such services. If we are unable to develop such applications or use such technologies, the size and rate of growth in our user base would be adversely affected. If we cannot develop a means by which
we generate revenues from our communications services that are more than sufficient to offset the costs of providing such services, our business, operating results and financial condition would be
materially adversely affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We may have difficulty retaining users of our electronic commerce services and our ability to effectively provide these services is limited because we
do not have a direct billing relationship with our customers.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our electronic commerce properties, such as Yahoo! Shopping, link users with a network of retailers with which we have relationships. However, we merely
provide a means through which our users can access the sellers of the products such users may wish to purchase and do not establish a direct billing relationship with our users as a result of any such
purchase. The revenue that we derive from our electronic commerce services is typically in the form of a bounty or a commission paid by the retailer from whom our user purchased a product. If the user
had a favorable buying experience with a particular retailer, the user may subsequently contact that retailer directly rather than through our service. If our users bypass our electronic commerce
properties, such as Yahoo! Shopping, and contact retailers directly, we will not receive any revenue for purchases made through such direct contact. In addition, competing providers of online
shopping, including merchants with which we have relationships, may be able to provide a more convenient and comprehensive online shopping experience due to their singular focus on electronic
commerce. As a result, we may have difficulty competing with those merchants for users of electronic commerce services. We have focused, and intend to continue to focus, significant resources on the
development and enhancement of these electronic commerce properties. The inability of our electronic commerce properties to generate revenues sufficient to offset these development costs for any of
these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We will continue to expand into international markets in which we have limited experience.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key part of our strategy is to develop Yahoo!-branded online properties in international markets and we have, through joint ventures, subsidiaries and branch
offices, developed Yahoo! properties localized for over 15 other countries. To date, we have only limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and operating our
products and services internationally and we rely on the efforts and abilities of our foreign business partners in such activities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that in light of substantial anticipated competition, we need to move quickly into international markets in order to effectively obtain market share. However, in a number
of international markets, especially those in Europe, we face substantial competition from ISPs that offer or may offer their own navigational services. Many of these ISPs have a dominant market share
in their territories. Further, foreign providers of competing online services may have a substantial advantage over us in attracting users in their country due to more established branding in that
country, greater knowledge with respect to the tastes and preferences of users residing in that country and/or their focus on a single market. We expect to continue to experience higher costs as a
percentage of revenues in connection with the development and maintenance of international online properties. International markets we have selected may not develop at a rate that supports our level
of investment. In particular,
<!-- ZEQ.=2,SEQ=21,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=21,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FO2490A.;4',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
international markets typically have been slower in adoption of the Internet generally and as an advertising and commerce medium in particular.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

doing business on an international level, including:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo! is one of the most highly trafficked websites on the Internet and is regularly exceeding previous standards for numbers of simultaneous users, unique
users and daily page&nbsp;views delivered. In addition, the services offered by Yahoo! and popular with users have changed significantly in the past and are expected to change rapidly in the future.
Much of the architecture that we employ was not originally designed to accommodate levels or types of use that we currently experience on our online properties and it is unclear whether current or
future anticipated levels of traffic will result in delays or interruptions in our service. In particular, the architecture utilized for our email and certain other communication services was not
primarily designed for this purpose and may not provide satisfactory service in the future, especially as it becomes an increasingly important service offering. In the future, we may be required to
make significant changes to our architecture, including moving to a completely new architecture. If we are required to switch architectures, we may incur substantial costs and experience delays or
interruptions in our service. If we experience delays or interruptions in our service
due to inadequacies in our current architecture or as a result of a change in architectures, users may become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers of online services. Further,
to the extent that demand for our broadcast services content increases, we will need to expand our infrastructure, including the capacity of our hardware servers and the sophistication of our
software. This expansion is likely to be expensive and complex and require additional technical expertise. Also, as we acquire users who rely upon us for a wide variety of services, it becomes more
technologically complex and costly to retrieve, store and integrate data that will enable us to track each users' preferences. Any loss of traffic, increased costs, inefficiencies or failures to adapt
to new technologies and the associated adjustments to our architecture would have a material adverse effect on our business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Our competitors often provide Internet access or computer hardware to our customers and they could make it difficult for our customers to access our
services.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our users must access our services through an Internet access provider, or ISP, with which the user establishes a direct billing relationship using a personal
computer or other access device. To the extent
<!-- ZEQ.=3,SEQ=22,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=22,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FO2490A.;4',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
that an access provider, such as America Online, or a computer or computing device manufacturer offers online services or properties that are competitive with those of Yahoo!, the user may find it
more convenient to use the services or properties of that access provider or manufacturer. In addition, the access provider or manufacturer may make it difficult to access our services by not listing
them in the access provider's or manufacturer's own directory. Also, because an access provider gathers information from the user in connection with the establishment of the billing relationship, an
access provider may be more effective than Yahoo! in tailoring services and advertisements to the specific tastes of the user. To the extent that a user opts to use the services offered by his or her
access provider or those offered by computer or computing device manufacturers rather than the services provided by Yahoo!, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially
adversely affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Our business services, while costly to develop, may fail to gain market acceptance.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have invested a significant amount of money and resources in the creation of our business services, such as the creation and hosting of streaming content of
third-parties, but such services are unproven and may fail to gain market acceptance. Because the market for these business services is new and evolving, it is difficult to predict the size of this
market and its rate of growth, if any. In addition, it is uncertain whether businesses and other organizations will utilize the Internet to any significant degree as a means of broadcasting business
conferences and other events. Potential business services customers must accept audio and video broadcast services over the Internet as a viable alternative to face-to-face
meetings, television or audio, audio teleconferences and video conferencing. We cannot assure you that the market for business services will continue to develop or be sustainable. If the market fails
to develop, develops more slowly than expected or becomes more competitive than is currently expected, our operating results could be adversely affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>More individuals are utilizing non-PC devices to access the Internet and we may not be successful in developing a version of our service
that will gain widespread adoption by users of such devices.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming years, the number of individuals who access the Internet through devices other than a personal computer such as personal digital assistants,
cellular telephones and television set top devices is expected to increase dramatically. Our services are designed for rich, graphical environments such as those available on personal and laptop
computers. The lower resolution, functionality and memory associated with alternative devices may make the use of our services through such devices difficult and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts
to modify our online properties to provide a compelling service
for users of alternative devices. As we have limited experience to date in operating versions of our service developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, it is difficult to predict the
problems we may encounter in doing so and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such versions. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial
number of alternative device users to our online services, we will fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services. Further, as the majority
of our revenues are derived through the sale of banner and other advertising optimized for a personal computer screen, we may not be successful at developing a viable strategy for deriving substantial
revenues from online properties that are directed at the users of alternative devices. Any failure to develop revenue-generating online properties that are adopted by a significant number of handheld
device users could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We rely on the value of the Yahoo! brand and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.</I></B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that maintaining and expanding the Yahoo! brand is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and expand our user and advertiser base. We also
believe that the importance of brand
<!-- ZEQ.=4,SEQ=23,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=23,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FO2490A.;4',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
recognition will increase due to the growing number of Internet sites and the relatively low barriers to entry. We have spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and
maintenance of the Yahoo! brand. However, because the number of Internet navigation, commerce, community and service companies continues to grow dramatically, it has become increasingly difficult and,
due to increased competition, expensive, to obtain quality television, radio, magazine, Internet and other advertising space. Further, the proliferation of Internet-based companies has resulted and
will continue to result in increased consumer confusion. Consequently, we must spend increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing and other brand-building
efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the Yahoo! brand. We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand and, even if we are successful in our
branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the Yahoo! brand in a cost-effective manner, our
business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>The successful operation of our business depends upon the supply of critical elements from other companies.</I></B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will depend to a substantial extent upon third parties for several critical elements of our business including various technology, infrastructure, content
development, software and distribution components.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology and Infrastructure.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on a private third-party provider, Frontier GlobalCenter,&nbsp;Inc., for our
principal Internet connections. Email and other service Internet connections are provided to us by GTE. We rely on Network Appliances for key components of our e-mail service. We also rely
on Exodus Communications for the hosting of our users' homepages&nbsp;and Level 3 Communications for hosting and access to our broadcast services. Any disruption in the Internet access provided by
these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and
financial condition. We license technology and related databases from third parties for certain elements of our properties, including, among others, technology underlying the delivery of news, stock
quotes and current financial information, chat services, street mapping and telephone listings, streaming capabilities and similar services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience
interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Furthermore, we are dependent on hardware suppliers for prompt
delivery, installation, and service of servers and other equipment to deliver our products and services. Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party
technologies and information services could negatively impact our relationship with users and adversely affect our brand and our business, and could expose us to liabilities to third parties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution Relationships.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase traffic for our online properties and make them more available and attractive
to advertisers and consumers, we have certain distribution agreements and informal relationships with leading Web browser providers such as Microsoft, operators of online networks and leading
websites, software developers and computer manufacturers, such as Toshiba, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway, and telecommunications companies, such as Sprint PCS. These distribution arrangements typically
are not exclusive and do not extend over a significant amount of time. Further, some of distributors are our competitors or potential competitors who may not be inclined to renew their distribution
contracts with us. In addition, as new methods for accessing the Web become available, we may be required to enter into additional distribution relationships. Any failure to obtain distribution or to
obtain distribution on terms that are reasonable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming media software.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on the two leading providers of streaming media products, RealNetworks and Microsoft,
to license the software necessary to broadcast streaming audio and video
<!-- ZEQ.=5,SEQ=24,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=24,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FO2490B.;5',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
content to our users. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license these products to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Our users are currently able to electronically
download copies of the software to play streaming media free of charge, but providers of streaming media products may begin charging users for copies of their player software or otherwise change their
business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of these products. In order for our broadcast services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of these streaming media
products. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of streaming media software, and to the extent that any of these circumstances occur, the broadcast services portion of our
business will be materially adversely affected.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Our dependence on third party content providers subjects us to risks.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's future success depends upon its ability to aggregate compelling content and deliver that content through its online properties. Much of the
content that attracts users to the Yahoo! online properties, such as news items, stock quotes, weather reports, maps and audio and video content, is licensed from third parties such as Reuters and
TIBCO. In particular, Yahoo! Broadcast relies on major sports organizations, radio and television stations, record labels, cable networks, businesses, colleges and universities, film producers and
distributors, and other organizations for a large portion of the content available on the site. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with third-party content providers will be critical to
our success. We may be unable to enter into or preserve relationships with the third parties whose content we seek to obtain. Many of our current licenses for third-party content extend for a period
of less than two years and there can be no guarantee that they will be renewed upon their expiration. In addition, as competition for compelling content increases, Yahoo!'s content providers may
increase the prices at which they offer their content to Yahoo! An increase in the prices charged to us by third-party content providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition. Further, many of our content licenses with third parties are non-exclusive. Accordingly, other Webcasters may be able to offer similar or identical
content. Likewise, most sports and entertainment content available on our online properties are also available on other media like radio or television. These media are currently, and for the
foreseeable future will be, much more widely adopted for listening or viewing such content than the Web. If we are unable to license or acquire compelling content for our online properties from third
parties, either through the termination of existing relationships or the inability to continue to establish relationships with third party content providers, or if other companies are able to
broadcast content that is similar to or the same as that provided by Yahoo!, the number of users on our online properties may not grow at all or at a slower rate than anticipated, which would decrease
our advertising revenue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>As we provide more audio and video content, particularly music, we may be required to spend significant amounts of money on content acquisition and
content broadcasts.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, the majority of the content that we provided to our users was in print, picture or graphical format and was either created internally or
licensed to us by third parties for little or no charge. However, we recently have been providing and intend to continue to provide increasing amounts of audio and video content to our users, such as
the broadcast of music, film content, speeches, news footage, concerts and other special events, through our broadcast services division and otherwise, and such content may require us to make
substantial payments to third parties from whom we will license or acquire such content. For example, in order to broadcast music through our online properties, we are currently required to pay
royalties both on the copyright in the musical compositions and the copyright in the actual sound recordings of the music to be broadcast. Through our broadcast services division, we currently have
license agreements in place with ASCAP and BMI, and are in negotiations for a license agreement with SESAC, that permit us to license the copyright for the public performance of musical compositions
for which they control the rights. With respect to the copyrights in the specific sound recordings that we desire to broadcast, we must either secure a license directly
<!-- ZEQ.=6,SEQ=25,EFW="9927564",CP="YAHOO! INC.",DN="1",FOLIO=25,FILE='DISK037:[99PAL0.99PAL2490]FO2490B.;5',USER='DLAQUIA',CD='12-NOV-1999;15:37' -->
from the record labels that own the rights to such recordings, or pay a statutory license fee. The statutory license fee and other terms for these licenses have not yet been determined and, therefore,
the costs of broadcasting music through our online properties remains unclear. If these royalty rates are above our expectations, if the royalty rates charged by the various performance rights
societies increase or if any of these or other parties with music licensing rights impose terms that make it difficult or impossible to broadcast music, we may be unable to provide music content to
our users in a cost-effective manner. We believe that users of Internet services such as the Yahoo! online properties will increasingly demand high-quality audio and video
content. The revenue that we receive as a result of our audio and video broadcasts may not justify the costs of providing such broadcasts. Our inability to cost-effectively provide
high-quality audio and/or video content to our users could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>To successfully improve our rich media offerings, we must rely on the deployment of a true multicasting network.</I></B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streaming services that we acquired upon our acquisition of broadcast.com originally deployed unicasting (one user per company originated stream)
technology to broadcast audio and video programming to users over the Internet. Recently, it began to deploy another broadcast technology, multicasting (multiple users per company originated stream).
We believe that demand for multicasting will continue to expand and, as a result, we must continue to enhance this capability in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
will be required to test, deploy and successfully scale a multicast network infrastructure to serve mass audiences. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing
so, that multicasting will be able to support a substantial audience or that an alternative technology will not emerge that offers superior broadcasting technology as compared to multicasting. In the
event that multicasting technology is not successfully deployed in a timely manner or such an alternative technology emerges, we may be required to expend significant resources to deploy a technology
other than multicasting, which could adversely affect our results of operations. If Yahoo! Broadcast Services fails to scale its broadcasts to large audiences of simultaneous users, such failure could
adversely affect that portion of our business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We must manage our growth, including the integration of recently-acquired companies, successfully in order to achieve our desired results.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have experienced dramatic growth in personnel in recent years and expect to continue to hire large numbers of additional personnel. As the number of Yahoo!
employees grows, it will become increasingly difficult and more costly to manage our personnel. Further, as a result of recent acquisitions and international expansion, almost one-half of
our employees are based outside of our Santa Clara headquarters. If we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees, our business will be adversely
affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of our business strategy, we have completed several acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions of GeoCities and broadcast.com, and expect to enter into additional
business combinations and acquisitions. We expect to enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions. Acquisition transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Our intellectual property rights are costly and difficult to protect.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regard our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, and similar intellectual property, including our rights to certain domain names, as critical
to our success. We rely upon trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our
proprietary rights. For example, we have obtained the registration for certain of our trademarks, including "Yahoo!" and "Yahooligans!" Effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may
not be available in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed or made available through the Internet, and while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is
maintained by our licensees, our licensees may take actions that
could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or the reputation of our products and media properties. We are aware that third parties have, from time to time, copied
significant portions of Yahoo! directory listings for use in competitive Internet navigational tools and services. Protection of the distinctive elements of Yahoo! may not be available under copyright
law. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in
the future.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parties are actively developing search, indexing, e-commerce and other Web-related technologies. We believe that these parties
will continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including seeking patent protection. As a result, we believe that disputes regarding the ownership of these technologies are likely to arise
in the future. We anticipate that additional third-party patents related to our services will be issued in the future. From time to time, parties assert patent infringement claims against us in the
form of letters, lawsuits and other forms of communications.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to patent claims, third parties have asserted and most likely will continue to assert claims against us alleging infringement of copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret
rights or other proprietary rights or alleging unfair competition. In the event that we determine that licensing patents or other proprietary rights is appropriate, we cannot guarantee that we will be
able to license such proprietary rights on reasonable terms or at all. We may incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims regardless of the merit of such claims. In
the event that there is a determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are aware of lawsuits filed against two of our competitors regarding the presentment of advertisements in response to search requests on "keywords" that may be trademarks of third
parties. Initial rulings in these lawsuits were in favor of our competitors, but the plaintiffs in these lawsuits have appealed these initial rulings. In addition, lawsuits have been filed against
broadcast.com, a company we acquired in July&nbsp;1999, alleging patent infringement relating to broadcast.com's use of streaming

media products. It is not clear what, if any, impact an adverse ruling in these recently filed lawsuits would have on us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We depend on key personnel who may not continue to work for us.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are substantially dependent on the continued services of our key personnel, including our two founders, our chief executive officer, president, chief
financial officer, chief technical officer, and vice presidents. Each of these individuals has acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Yahoo! and its operations. As a result, if any
of these individuals were to leave Yahoo!, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the
necessary training and experience. Many of our management personnel have reached or will soon reach the four-year anniversary of their Yahoo! hiring date and, as a result, will have become
or will shortly become fully vested in their initial stock option grants. While management personnel are typically granted additional stock options, which will usually vest over a period of four
years, subsequent to their hire date in order to provide additional incentive to remain at Yahoo!, the initial option grant is typically the largest and an employee may be more likely to leave our
employ upon completion of the vesting period for the initial option grant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect that we will need to hire additional personnel in all areas. The competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our
corporate headquarters are
located. At times, we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the right training or experience, particularly in technical areas. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of
our personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business will be adversely affected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We are subject to U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet, the impact of which is difficult to predict.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to the Internet. The application of existing laws and regulations to Yahoo! relating to issues
such as user privacy, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and
infringement can be unclear. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to
substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and dampen the growth in use of the Web.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several
recently passed federal laws could have an impact on our business. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for
listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. The Children's Online Protection Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from
minors. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain
circumstances. Such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
post privacy policies concerning the use and disclosure of user data. In addition, we are required to comply with a consent order issued by the FTC to GeoCities, a company that we
recently acquired, which imposes certain obligations and restrictions with respect to information collected from users. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or the consent
order could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due
to the global nature of the Web, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for
violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results, and financial condition.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>We may be subject to legal liability for our online services.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We host a wide variety of services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, conduct business and engage in various online activities,
including public message posting and services relating to online auctions and homesteading. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is
currently unsettled. Claims have been threatened and could be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury,
fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we provide links to or that may be posted online or generated by our users or with respect to auctioned materials. In
addition, we are aware that governmental agencies are currently investigating the conduct of online auctions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also periodically enter into arrangements to offer third-party products, services, or content under the Yahoo! brand or via distribution on various Yahoo! properties, including
stock quotes and trading information. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting or providing access
to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services or content. While our agreements with these parties often provide that we will be indemnified
against such liabilities, such indemnification may not be adequate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is also possible that, if any information provided directly by us contains errors or is otherwise negligently provided to users, third parties could make claims against us. For
example, we offer Web-based email services, which expose us to potential risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email, lost or misdirected messages, illegal or
fraudulent use of email, or interruptions or delays in email service. Investigating and defending any of these types of claims is expensive, even to the extent that the claims do not result in
liability.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Our stock price has historically been volatile, which may make it more difficult for you to resell shares when you want at prices you find attractive.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. During the past four fiscal quarters, the closing sale
prices of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from $52.41 to $219.13, and the sale price of our common stock closed at $197.19 on November&nbsp;8, 1999. Our stock price may fluctuate
in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our
competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable, and news
reports relating to trends in our markets. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often
has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance.

stock held by them could have a negative effect on Yahoo!'s stock price.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo!'s directors and executive officers and SOFTBANK beneficially own approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock as of October&nbsp;31, 1999. Eric
Hippeau is a member of our Board of Directors and is also the Chairman and CEO of Ziff-Davis, a subsidiary of SOFTBANK. As a result of their ownership and positions, our directors and
executive officers and SOFTBANK collectively are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
transactions. Such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Yahoo!. In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by Yahoo!'s
directors and executive officers and SOFTBANK, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of Yahoo! common stock.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations are susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. In addition,
the majority of our network infrastructure is located in Northern California, an area susceptible to earthquakes. We do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services in the event of any such
occurrence. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our
computer systems. We do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events. Any such event could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.</I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely
affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
control of Yahoo! without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. We have no present plans to issue shares of preferred
stock. Further, certain provisions of our charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to
raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of Yahoo!, which could have an adverse effect
on the market price of our stock. In addition, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and change in the market values of its investments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest Rate Risk.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the
Company's investment portfolio. The Company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. The Company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the
U.S.&nbsp;Government and its agencies, and in high-quality corporate issuers and, by policy, limits the amount
of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default, market and reinvestment risk.

</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investments
in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely
impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, the Company's future investment
income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the Company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in
interest rates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Currency Risk.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;International revenues from the Company's foreign subsidiaries were less than 10% of total
revenues. International sales are made mostly from the Company's foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country. These
subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency. Accordingly, all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to differing economic conditions, changes in political
climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly, the Company's future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes
in these or other factors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the United States are charged to the Company's
foreign sales subsidiaries. These intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent
company in the United States. The Company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in consolidation. As
exchange rates vary, these results, when translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company in
the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 1999 were not material.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment Risk.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company invests in equity instruments of privately-held, information technology
companies for business and strategic purposes. These investments are included in other long-term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than 20%. For
these non-quoted investments, the Company's policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values. The
Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. To date, no such impairment has been
recorded. During 1999 and 1998, certain of these investments in privately-held companies became marketable equity securities when the investees completed initial public offerings. Such
investments, which are in the Internet industry, are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market, and are recorded as long-term
investments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of
trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and a variety of claims arising in connection with the Company's email, message boards, and other communications and community features,
such as claims alleging defamation and invasion of privacy. The Company is not currently aware of any legal proceedings or claims that the Company believes will have, individually or in the aggregate,
