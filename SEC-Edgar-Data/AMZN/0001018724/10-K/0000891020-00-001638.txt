EXPLANATORY NOTE:



     THIS AMENDMENT TO OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1999 REFLECTS CERTAIN CHANGES PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN OUR QUARTERLY
REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2000. IN THAT FORM 10-Q, WE
MODIFIED OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY RELATING TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF CASH
EQUIVALENTS, AND ACCORDINGLY WE HAVE REVISED ITEMS 6, 7, 7A AND 8 AND THE
FINANCIAL DATA SCHEDULE IN THIS REPORT. THE AGGREGATE TOTAL OF CASH EQUIVALENTS
AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAS NOT CHANGED FROM AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.



     THIS AMENDMENT ALSO CORRECTS TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN NOTE 9 TO THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS FOOTNOTE WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE
CORRECT AMOUNT REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. IN NOTE 9
THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE OPTIONS CANCELLED AND THE WEIGHTED
AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE OF OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1999 WERE INADVERTENTLY TRANSPOSED, AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE OF
OPTIONS EXERCISED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 WAS INCORRECT.



     WE HAVE MADE NO FURTHER CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUSLY FILED FORM 10-K. ALL
INFORMATION IN THIS FORM 10-K/A IS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND DOES NOT REFLECT
ANY SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION OR EVENTS OTHER THAN THE AFOREMENTIONED CHANGE IN
ACCOUNTING POLICY.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Act
provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies
to provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify
these statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the
projected results. All statements other than statements of historical fact,
including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of
operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
forward looking. We use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects,"
"future" and "intends" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations
and are inherently uncertain. The Company's actual results may differ
significantly from management's expectations. This following discussion includes
forward-looking statements regarding expectations of future profitability of the
US books business, gross margin, improvement in operating loss and sales, all of
which are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ
significantly for a variety of reasons, including the rate of growth of the
Internet and online commerce, the amount that the Company invests in new
business opportunities and the timing of those investments, customer spending
patterns, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of revenues derived
from product sales as compared to services, risks of inventory management, and
risks of distribution and fulfillment throughput and productivity. These risks
and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause the
Company's actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations,
are described in greater detail in the section entitled "Business -- Additional
Factors That May Affect Future Results," which, along with the following
discussion, describes some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual
results to differ significantly from management's expectations.

</TABLE>

     Net sales include the selling price of products sold by us, net of returns
and gift certificate discounts, and also include outbound shipping charges.
Shipping revenue was $239 million, $94.1 million and $24.8 million in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively. Net sales also include commissions from auctions and
zShops transactions, which include sales commissions, placement fees and fees
from payment service transactions.

     Growth in net sales in 1999 and 1998 reflects a significant increase in
units sold due to the growth of our customer base, repeat purchases from
existing customers, increased international sales, and the introduction of new
product offerings. These new product offerings include music and DVD/video in
June and November of 1998, respectively, toys and electronics in July 1999 and
home improvement, software and video games in November 1999. We increased our
issuance of promotional gift certificates to customers in 1999 to promote new
product lines, however, which partially offset such growth in net sales. The
Company had approximately 16.9 million, 6.2 million and 1.5 million cumulative
customer accounts as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The
percentage of orders by repeat customers increased from 64% in the fourth
quarter of 1998 to 73% in the fourth quarter of 1999. The increase in net sales
in 1998 was also partially due to the launch of the UK and German focused Web
sites in October 1998.

     Sales to customers outside of the US represented approximately 22%, 20% and
25% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

Gross margin..................      17.7%                   21.9%                  19.5%
</TABLE>

     Gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales, which consists
of the cost of merchandise sold to customers, as well as inbound and outbound
shipping costs and the cost of tangible supplies used to package product for
shipment to customers. Gross profit increased in 1999 and 1998 in absolute
dollars, reflecting the Company's increased sales volume. Gross margin decreased
in 1999 due to the introduction of new product lines, particularly toys and
electronics, and inventory-related charges of approximately $39 million incurred
in the fourth quarter of 1999. We also increased our issuance of promotional
gift certificates to customers in 1999 to promote these new product lines, which
decreased net sales and, therefore, gross margin. Additionally, we realized
lower shipping margins in 1999 due to an increase in partial shipments to
satisfy holiday demand and because of split shipments from one or more
locations, which was caused by our failure to optimize inventory at our
distribution centers. Gross margin increased in 1998 as compared to 1997 as a
result of improvements in product costs through improved supply chain
management, including increased direct purchasing from publishers, as well as
higher overall shipping margins. These two factors more than offset the impact
of aggressive product pricing and lower music and video margins.

     As noted above, outbound shipping costs are included in cost of sales.
Gross profit from shipping, which represents shipping revenues less outbound
shipping costs, was $11.7 million, $18.2 million and $4.4 million in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively.

     We expect our overall gross margin to approach 20% for the first quarter of
2000 and for the year.

     We believe that offering our customers attractive prices is an essential
component of our business strategy. For example, we offer everyday discounts of
50% on every book on the New York Times bestseller list, up to 40% on hundreds
of thousands of titles and up to 85% on certain "special value" editions. We may
in the future expand or increase the discounts we offer to our customers and may
otherwise alter our pricing structure and policies in a manner that may
adversely impact gross profit and gross margin.

     We intend to continue to expand our operations by promoting new or
complementary products or sales formats and by expanding the breadth and depth
of our product and service offerings. Gross margins attributable to new business
areas may be different from those associated with our existing business
activities. To the extent such product lines become larger components of our
sales, we would expect a corresponding impact on overall product gross margin.

     We believe that the Amazon.com Commerce Network will tend to increase gross
margins in the future because the revenue associated with the activities
conducted by Amazon.com Commerce Network generates substantially higher gross
profit than the Company's sale of products. See "Business -- Additional Factors
That May Affect Future Results -- Our business could suffer if we are
unsuccessful in making and integrating business combinations and strategic
alliances."

     Organizations responsible for promulgating accounting standards are
currently reviewing the financial statement classification of, and accounting
for, fulfillment and order processing costs and other items by a number of
e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com. The review by these accounting
organizations may lead to new accounting standards that could require that some
or all of our fulfillment and order processing costs be classified as costs of
sales. We currently include these costs in Marketing and Sales. These new
standards could also require us to capitalize certain of our fulfillment and
order processing costs in inventory. We currently expense these costs as
incurred. We will adjust our accounting and classification of fulfillment and
order processing costs if required by accounting organizations or by the SEC.

</TABLE>

     Marketing and sales expenses consist of advertising, promotional and public
relations expenditures, credit card fees and payroll and related expenses for
personnel engaged in marketing, selling and fulfillment activities. Fulfillment
costs included in marketing and sales expenses represent those costs incurred in
operating and staffing distribution and customer service centers, including
costs attributable to receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories;
picking, packaging and preparing customers' orders for shipment; and responding
to inquiries from customers. Fulfillment costs amounted to $188.4 million, $50.3
million and $12.1 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Marketing and
sales expenses increased in 1999 and 1998 primarily due to increased payroll and
related costs associated with fulfilling customer demand, increases in our
advertising and promotional expenditures in the US, Germany and the UK, and
increased credit card fees resulting from higher sales. The increase in 1999 was
further attributable to increased advertising during the holiday season and the
promotion of the new toys, electronics, software, video games and home
improvement stores. The increase in 1998 was also attributable to the entry into
music and video sales and the launch of new Web sites targeting Germany and the
UK. Marketing and sales expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in 1999
as compared to 1998 primarily due to increases in fulfillment expenses
associated with our expansion of our distribution center network and customer
service staff during 1999. Marketing and sales expenses decreased as a
percentage of net sales in 1998 due to the significant increase in net sales. We
intend to continue our advertising and marketing activities in the future and
expect that such expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars,
but, as a percentage of sales, will likely decline in the future. We also expect
that fulfillment costs will decline as a percentage of sales in the future as
additional capacity of our existing distribution center network is more fully
utilized. However, due to risks related to market share, seasonality,
distribution centers, inventory management and other factors, advertising and
marketing expenditures and fulfillment costs may not decline as a percentage of
sales.

     Organizations responsible for promulgating accounting standards are
currently reviewing the financial statement classification of, and accounting
for, fulfillment and order processing costs and other items by a number of
e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com. The review by these accounting
organizations may lead to new accounting standards that could require that some
or all of our fulfillment and order processing costs be classified as costs of
sales. These new standards could also require us to capitalize certain of our
fulfillment and order processing costs in inventory. We currently expense these
costs as incurred. We will adjust our accounting and classification of
fulfillment and order processing costs if required by accounting organizations
or by the SEC.

</TABLE>

     Technology and content expenses consist principally of payroll and related
expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations
personnel and consultants; systems and telecommunications infrastructure; and
costs of acquired content, including freelance reviews. The increases in
technology and content expenses in 1999 and 1998 were primarily attributable to
increased staffing and associated costs related to continual enhancements to the
features, content and functionality of our Web sites and transaction-processing
systems, as well as increased investment in systems and telecommunications
infrastructure. These increases also were the result of the costs of developing,
introducing and operating new product lines, operating expenses associated with
acquired entities and, in 1998, the costs of developing, introducing and
operating new Web sites targeting Germany and the UK. Technology and content
expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in 1999 due to the significant
number of new product lines and services launched by us

                                        4
<PAGE>   7

during the year. Technology and content expenses decreased as a percentage of
net sales in 1998 due to the significant increase in net sales. Technology and
content costs are generally expensed as incurred, except for certain costs
relating to the development of internal-use software that are capitalized and
depreciated over estimated useful lives. We believe that continued investment in
technology and content is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. In
addition to ongoing investments in our Web stores and infrastructure, we intend
to increase investments in products, services and international expansion. As a
result, we expect technology and content expenses to continue to increase in
absolute dollars.

</TABLE>

     General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses
for executive, finance and administrative personnel, recruiting, professional
fees and other general corporate expenses. The 1999 and 1998 increases in
general and administrative expenses were primarily a result of increased
salaries and related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel
and legal and other professional fees related to our growth. In both 1999 and
1998, additional expenses were incurred associated with acquired entities and
the related international expansion and expanded activities. We expect general
and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we incur
additional costs to support the growth of our business.

  Stock-based Compensation

</TABLE>

     Stock-based compensation is comprised of the portion of acquisition-related
consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of key employees of the
acquired businesses, which must be classified as compensation expense rather
than as a component of purchase price under generally accepted accounting
principles. Stock-based compensation also includes stock-based charges such as
option-related deferred compensation recorded at our initial public offering, as
well as certain other compensation and severance arrangements. The increase in
stock-based compensation in 1999 resulted primarily from acquisitions closed in
1999. Stock-based compensation for 1998 and 1997 relates primarily to
option-related deferred compensation recorded at the time of our initial public
offering.

Amortization of goodwill and other
  purchased intangibles............  $214,694      404%      $42,599      N/M        $0
</TABLE>

     Increases in amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in
1999 primarily resulted from the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles
recorded at the time of our acquisitions of Exchange.com, Alexa Internet,
Accept.com, LiveBid.com, the catalog and online commerce assets of Acme Electric
Motor Co. (Tool Crib of the North), Back to Basics Toys and other acquisitions.
In 1998, amortization charges resulted from the amortization of goodwill and
other intangibles recorded in the acquisitions of Junglee and three smaller
Internet companies. We expect that amortization charges from the acquisitions
consummated in 1999 will increase in 2000 based on a full year of amortization
for all of the acquisitions. It is likely that we will continue to expand our
business through acquisitions, which would cause amortization of goodwill and
other intangibles to increase.

</TABLE>

     Our loss from operations increased from 1997 to 1998, and from 1998 to
1999, due to continued expansion of our business. Our operating expenses have
historically increased more quickly than our revenues as we have expanded our
operations. We expect that our overall loss from operations incurred in 2000
will decrease significantly as a percentage of net sales, compared to that
percentage in 1999.

Interest expense.................   84,566      217%       26,639     8,071%        326
</TABLE>

     Interest income on cash and marketable securities increased in 1999 due to
higher investment balances resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of
$1.25 billion of 4 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the
"Convertible Subordinated Notes") in February 1999 and increased in 1998 due to
the issuance of approximately $326 million gross proceeds of 10% Senior Discount
Notes due May 1, 2008 (the "Senior Discount Notes") in May 1998. Interest
expense increased in 1999 and 1998 due to the interest expense associated with
this debt, as well as amortization of deferred charges associated with issuance
of the notes.

     On February 16, 2000, we completed an offering of E690,000,000
($680,685,000 as of February 11, 2000) of 6.875% Convertible Subordinated Notes
due 2010, also known as Premium Adjustable Convertible Securities, or "PEACS."
Therefore, we expect interest expense to increase in the future for interest
associated with these notes.

  investees..........................  $76,769     2,543%     $2,905      N/M       $ 0
</TABLE>

     Equity in losses of equity-method investees represents our share of losses
of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to exercise
significant influence, but not control, over an investee. This is generally
defined as an ownership interest of the voting stock of the investee of between
20% and 50%. We made several equity-method investments in 1999 and increased our
investment in the equity-method investment we made in 1998. We expect to make
additional equity-method investments in the future. Many of the companies in
which we have invested to date are in the early stage of their operations and
are incurring net losses. Therefore, we expect to continue to record losses on
our equity-method investments.

     In July 1999, one of our equity-method investees, drugstore.com, inc.,
completed the initial public offering of its common stock. drugstore.com
operates an online retail store and information site for health, beauty,
wellness, personal care and pharmacy products. In connection with this
transaction, we recorded a contribution to additional paid-in capital of $13.8
million, representing the difference between the carrying value of our
investment and the underlying net book value of drugstore.com after the IPO. Two
of our other equity-method investees, Pets.com and Homegrocer.com, completed
their IPOs in February 2000 and March 2000, respectively. We therefore will
record a contribution to additional paid-in capital in connection with these
transactions, and it is reasonably possible that other equity-method investees
may complete IPOs in the future.

  Income Taxes

     We did not provide any current or deferred US federal, state or foreign
income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have
experienced operating losses since inception. Utilization of our net operating
loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2010, may be subject to certain
limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and other limitations under state and foreign tax laws. We have provided a full
valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset, consisting primarily of net
operating loss carryforwards, because of uncertainty regarding its
realizability.

     At December 31, 1999, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $133.3
million, compared to $71.6 million at December 31, 1998. Our marketable
securities balance was $572.9 million and $301.9 million at December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively.


     Net cash used by operating activities amounted to $90.9 million for 1999.
This was primarily attributable to the net loss for the year of $720 million,
partially offset by non-cash charges related to depreciation, stock-based
compensation, amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles, and
equity in losses of equity-method investees totaling $358.9 million, as well as
$230.1 million of cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities is primarily a
function of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, offset by
an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets. For
1998, net cash provided by operating activities was $31 million and was
primarily attributable to non-cash expenses and increases in accounts payable
and accrued expenses, largely offset by the net loss and increases in
inventories and prepaid expenses and other.


     Net cash used in investing activities was $952 million in 1999 and
consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of $295.3 million, purchases
of fixed assets of $287.1 million and cash paid for acquisitions and investments
in businesses of $369.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities during
1998 was $324 million and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of
$276.7 million, purchases of fixed assets of $28.3 million and cash paid for
acquisitions and investments in businesses of $19 million.


     Net cash provided by financing activities of $1.104 billion for 1999 was
primarily due to $1.25 billion of proceeds from the sale of our Convertible
Subordinated Notes in February 1999, partially offset by repayment of long-term
debt, including $178.4 million of cash paid to repurchase a portion of our
outstanding Senior Discount Notes. Net cash provided by financing activities of
$254.5 million for 1998 primarily resulted from

                                        7
<PAGE>   10

net proceeds of approximately $318.2 million from the Senior Discount Notes
offering offset by the repayment of $78.1 million of long-term debt.


     As of December 31, 1999, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of
$706.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of that
date, our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under our
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 and Senior Discount Notes, as well as
obligations in connection with operating leases and commitments for advertising
and promotional arrangements. During 1999, we undertook a substantial expansion
of our distribution center network in the US, adding six distribution centers in
the US. We also opened new distribution centers in the UK and Germany. We
anticipate that our current distribution center capacity in the US will be
adequate for our needs for at least the next 12 months, but we may require
additional capacity in international markets.


     In May 1998, we completed the offering of approximately $326 million gross
proceeds of the Senior Discount Notes, in February 1999, we completed the
offering of approximately $1.25 billion Convertible Subordinated Notes, and in
February 2000, we completed the offering of E690 million of 6.875% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2010, also knows as PEACS. See Notes 7 and 15 to
Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference to Item 8 of Part
II.


     We believe that current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
balances, together with net proceeds from the PEACS, will be sufficient to meet
our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However,
any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial
uncertainty. If current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash
that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity
requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to
obtain credit facilities from lenders. The sale of additional equity or
convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the Company's
stockholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition
of or investment in complementary businesses, products, services and
technologies, and the repurchase and retirement of debt, which might impact our
liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt
securities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in
amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.


YEAR 2000 IMPLICATIONS

     Many currently installed computer systems, software programs and embedded
data chips are programmed using a two-digit date field and are therefore unable
to distinguish dates beyond the 20th century. A failure to identify and correct
any mission-critical internal or third-party year 2000 processing problem could
have a material adverse operational or financial consequence to us.

     We established a Year 2000 Project Team that, together with external
consultants, developed a process for addressing the year 2000 issue, including
performing an inventory, an assessment, remediation procedures (to the extent
necessary) and testing procedures of all mission-critical information systems
and equipment and machinery that contain embedded technology, as well as
obtaining assurances from all mission-critical third parties as to their own
year 2000 preparedness. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form
10-K, all of our mission-critical systems have been successfully tested for year
2000 compliance, and we have not experienced any significant year 2000 problems
with our own mission-critical systems or any mission-critical third parties.
Although we have not experienced any significant year 2000 problems to date, we
plan to continue to monitor the situation closely.

     We cannot be sure that we will be completely successful in our efforts to
address the year 2000 issue or that problems arising from the year 2000 issue
will not cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial
condition. We believe, however, that our most reasonably likely worst-case
scenario would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than
with our internal systems. We are limited in our efforts to address the year
2000 issue as it relates to third parties and rely solely on the assurances of
these third parties as to their year 2000 preparedness.

     As part of our broader contingency planning, we also developed business
continuity plans to address each critical process and activity that we believe
would cause a significant disruption to operations if not functional

                                        8

for 24 hours. Despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee that the contingency
plan will adequately address all circumstances that may disrupt operations or
that such planning will prevent circumstances that may cause a material adverse
effect on our operating results or financial condition.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We do not have any derivative financial instruments in our marketable
securities portfolio as of December 31, 1999. However, we are exposed to
interest rate risk on debt instruments we hold. We employ established policies
and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our
marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale as of December
31, 1999 and 1998. Our Senior Discount Notes, Convertible Subordinated Notes,
PEACS and other long-term debt have fixed interest rates and the fair value of
these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. We believe
that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not
material.

     Our exposure to currency exchange risk through December 31, 1999 has not
been material. However, with the completion of the offering of PEACS notes on
February 16, 2000, we will be exposed to currency exchange risk because the debt
is denominated in euros while our functional currency is the US dollar. We plan
to employ established policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of exchange
rate fluctuations. Additionally, the conversion price for the PEACS is
denominated in euros.

     Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about
market risk is set forth below and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital
Resources."

     The table below provides information about our marketable securities,
including principal cash flows for 2000 through 2004 and the related weighted
average interest rates.

               REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Amazon.com, Inc.

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com,
Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1999. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements
and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Amazon.com,
Inc. at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.


     As discussed in paragraph 8 of Note 1, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been restated to reflect a change in Amazon.com's
policy for determining cash equivalents.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Description of Business

     Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon.com or the Company) was incorporated in July 1994
and opened its virtual doors on the Web in July 1995. Amazon.com is an Internet
retailer offering more than 18 million unique items in categories including
books, music, DVD/video, toys, electronics, software, video games and home
improvement products. Amazon.com offers a free electronic greeting card service
and also provides a community of online shoppers with an easy and safe way to
purchase and sell a large selection of products through Amazon.com Auctions and
zShops.

  Business Combinations and Investments

     For business combinations that have been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting, the Company includes the results of operations of the
acquired business from the date of acquisition. Net assets of the companies
acquired are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable
intangible net assets acquired is included in goodwill in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

     One business combination in 1998 was accounted for under the pooling of
interests method of accounting. In this case, the assets, liabilities and
stockholders' equity of the acquired entity was combined with the Company's
respective accounts at recorded values. The consolidated financial statements
reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of the
acquired entity accounted for under the pooling of interests method of
accounting. The historical results of the pooled entity reflect its actual
operating cost structures and, as a result, do not necessarily reflect the cost
structure of the newly combined entity. The historical results do not purport to
be indicative of future results.

     Investments in affiliated entities in which the Company has the ability to
exercise significant influence, but not control, of an investee, generally an
ownership interest of the voting stock of between 20% and 50%, are accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, under the equity method of
accounting, the Company's share of the investee's earnings or loss is included
in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company records its
investments in equity-method investees on the consolidated balance sheets as
"Investments in equity-method investees" and its share of the investees'
earnings or losses in "Equity in losses of equity-method investees." The portion
of the Company's investment in an equity-method investee that exceeds its claim
of the net assets of the investee, if any, is assigned to goodwill and amortized
over a period of three years. The goodwill amount, which was $24.8 million as of
December 31, 1999, is included in "Investments in equity-method investees" in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and the amortization of the
goodwill is included in "Equity in losses of equity-method investees" in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

     All other investments, which consist of investments for which the Company
does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for
under the cost method of accounting. Dividends and other distributions of
earnings from other investees, if any, are included in income when declared. The
Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments accounted
for under the cost method of accounting and as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
such investments were recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable
value.

  Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


  Cash and Cash Equivalents



     Effective April 1, 2000, the Company changed its policy for determining
which investments are treated as cash equivalents. Effective April 1, 2000, the
Company now classifies all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity
of three months or less as cash equivalents. Prior to April 1, 2000, such
investments were included in marketable securities. The Company believes this
change is preferable because it results in a presentation that is consistent
with practice in the Company's industry and because it results in a better
reflection of the Company's liquidity. The consolidated financial statements
presented in this Form 10-K/A have been restated to reflect this change.


  Marketable Securities


     The Company's marketable securities, which consist primarily of
high-quality short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities, are classified
as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and
losses are reported, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders' equity within
accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized losses are charged against
income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary.
The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities
sold.


  Inventories

     Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are valued at the
lower of cost (specific identification) or market.

  Fixed Assets

     Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital
leases. Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (generally two to ten years). Fixed assets purchased
under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of
the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.

     Included in fixed assets is the cost of internal-use software, including
software used in connection with the Company's Web sites. The Company expenses
all costs related to the development of internal-use software other than those
incurred during the application development stage. Costs incurred during the
application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the software (generally two years).

  Goodwill, Net

     Goodwill, net, represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of assets acquired in business acquisitions accounted for under the
purchase method. Goodwill is presented net of related accumulated amortization
and is being amortized over lives ranging from two to four years.

<PAGE>   20
                                AMAZON.COM, INC.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

  Other Purchased Intangibles, Net

     Other purchased intangibles, net, include identifiable intangible assets
purchased by the Company, primarily in connection with business acquisitions.
Other purchased intangibles are presented net of related accumulated
amortization and are being amortized over lives ranging from two to four years.

  Long-Lived Assets

     The carrying values of intangible assets and other long-lived assets,
including equity-method investments, are reviewed on a regular basis for the
existence of facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, that may
suggest impairment. To date, no such impairment has been indicated.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The carrying amounts for the Company's cash, accounts payable and other
liabilities approximate fair value. The fair market value for long-term debt and
marketable securities is based on quoted market prices where available.

  Deferred Charges

     Deferred charges consist of fees associated with the issuance of the
Company's debt. The fees are being amortized and included in interest expense
over the life of the related debt.

  Deferred Revenue

     Deferred revenue consists of advertising fees to be earned in the future
under agreements existing at the balance sheet date.

  Income Taxes

     The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in
effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider
realization of such assets to be more likely than not.

  Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, net of any promotional
gift certificates, when the products are shipped to customers, which is also
when title passes to customers. Outbound shipping charges are included in net
sales and amounted to $239.0 million, $94.1 million and $24.8 million in 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively. Revenue from gift certificates is recognized upon
product shipment following redemption. The Company provides an allowance for
sales returns based on historical experience. Revenues from services are
recorded at the time the related service is performed.

     During 1999, the Company recorded approximately $5.8 million of revenue
associated with noncash transactions whereby the Company received equity
securities of other companies in exchange for advertising and promotional
services to be provided for a fixed period of time. The Company recorded the
fair value of the consideration on the date received, $54.4 million, and is
recognizing revenue ratably over the term of the agreements as the advertising
and promotional services are provided.

  Cost of Sales

     Cost of sales consists of the actual cost of products purchased for resale
and related in-bound shipping charges, out-bound shipping charges, and the
actual cost of tangible supplies used to package products for

                                       18

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

shipment to customers. Outbound shipping charges and the cost of tangible
supplies used to package products for shipment to customers totaled $227.3
million, $75.9 million and $20.4 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

  Fulfillment Costs

     Included in marketing and sales expense are fulfillment costs, which
consist of the cost of operating and staffing distribution and customer service
centers. Such costs include those attributable to receiving, inspecting and
warehousing inventories; picking, packaging and preparing customers' orders for
shipment; and responding to inquiries from customers. Fulfillment costs amounted
to $188.4 million, $50.3 million and $12.1 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

  Advertising Costs

     The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company incurred advertising expense of
$140.9 million, $60.2 million and $21.2 million, respectively.

  Technology and Content

     Technology and content expenses consist principally of payroll and related
expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations
personnel and consultants, systems and telecommunications infrastructure and
costs of acquired content.

     Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred, except for
certain costs relating to the development of internal-use software, including
those relating to the Company's Web sites, that are capitalized and depreciated
over estimated useful lives.

  Stock-Based Compensation

     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and related
interpretations, in accounting for its employee stock options rather than the
alternative fair value accounting allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. APB No. 25
provides that the compensation expense relative to the Company's employee stock
options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option. SFAS No.
123 requires companies that continue to follow APB No. 25 to provide a pro forma
disclosure of the impact of applying the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.

  Foreign Currency Translation

     The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into US
dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at
average rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Transaction gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved, which have
been insignificant, are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
To date, the Company has entered into no foreign currency exchange contracts.

  Concentrations of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of its holdings of cash and
marketable securities. The Company's credit risk is managed by investing its
cash and marketable securities in high-quality money market instruments and
securities of the

                                       19

                                AMAZON.COM, INC.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

US government and its agencies, foreign governments and high-quality corporate
issuers. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had no significant
concentrations of credit risk.

  Earnings (Loss) Per Share

     Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants
and convertible securities. Basic earnings per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding, net of shares subject to
repurchase, during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if
their effect is antidilutive.

     As a result of the Company's initial public offering in May 1997, all
preferred stock automatically converted into common stock. Accordingly, the 1997
net loss per share is a pro forma loss per share based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding and preferred stock on an "as if"
converted basis outstanding during each period. The Company believes that this
is a more meaningful presentation of earnings per share for periods prior to its
initial public offering.

  New Accounting Pronouncements

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff released
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
(SAB No. 101), which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements. SAB No. 101 did not impact the
Company's revenue recognition policies.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. As
amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of
all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is
designed as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge
transaction. The Company has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of
SFAS No. 133 on its consolidated financial statements or business practices.

  Reclassifications

     Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

NOTE 2 -- BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     The Company completed the following acquisitions during 1999: e-Niche
Incorporated (Exchange.com), Accept.com Financial Services Corporation
(Accept.com), Alexa Internet (Alexa), LiveBid.com, Inc. (LiveBid) the catalog
and online commerce assets of Acme Electric Motor Co. (Tool Crib) and Back to
Basics Toys, Inc. (Back to Basics). Each acquisition was recorded using the
purchase method of accounting under APB Opinion No. 16. Results of operations
for each acquired company have been included in the financial results of the
Company from the closing date of each transaction forward.

     In accordance with APB Opinion No. 16, all identifiable assets were
assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired companies (purchase price) on the
basis of their respective fair values. Intangible assets were identified and
valued by considering the Company's intended use of acquired assets and analysis
of data concerning products, technologies, markets, historical financial
performance, and underlying assumptions of future performance. The economic and

     Approximately $2.8 million of the purchase price of the Accept.com and
Alexa transactions attributable to in-process research and development efforts
has been expensed because, at the time of acquisition, technological feasibility
had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. Purchased
in-process research and development was identified and valued by independent
valuation through discussions with the acquired companies' management and the
analysis of data concerning developmental products, their respective stage of
development, the time and resources needed to complete them, their expected
income generating ability, target markets and associated risks.

     On May 14, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of Exchange.com, a
developer of Internet marketplaces and related online communities that bring
together buyers and sellers of rare and hard-to-find items. In connection with
the acquisition, the Company assumed all outstanding Exchange.com stock options
and issued 1,893,944 shares of Amazon.com common stock to acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of Exchange.com. Substantially all of the
approximately $145 million purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other
purchased intangibles. The goodwill and substantially all other purchased
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over lives
averaging approximately three years. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the
Company may be required to issue additional shares with a value of up to $27.5
million one year after the acquisition date dependent on certain performance
goals, which would increase the purchase price by this amount.

     On May 14, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of LiveBid, a
technology provider for live, event-based auctions on the Internet. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed all outstanding LiveBid
stock options and issued 553,770 shares to acquire all of the outstanding common
shares of LiveBid. Substantially all of the approximately $40 million purchase
price was allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles. The goodwill
and other purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over lives averaging approximately three years.

     On June 9, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of Accept.com, an
e-commerce company developing technology to simplify person-to-person and
business-to-consumer transactions on the Internet. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company assumed all outstanding Accept.com stock options and
issued 1,755,356 shares of Amazon.com common stock to acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of Accept.com. Substantially all of the approximately
$189 million purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other purchased
intangibles. The goodwill and substantially all other purchased intangible
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over lives averaging
approximately three years.

     On June 10, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of Alexa, a
developer of a Web navigation service that works with Internet browsers to
provide useful information about the sites being viewed and suggests related
sites. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed all outstanding
Alexa stock options and issued 4,369,884 shares of Amazon.com common stock to
acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Alexa. Substantially all of the
approximately $250 million purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other
purchased intangibles. The goodwill and substantially all other purchased
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over lives
averaging approximately three years.

     On October 1, 1999 and November 8, 1999, respectively, the Company
completed its acquisition of the catalog and online commerce assets of Tool
Crib, a retailer of home improvement products, and its acquisition of Back to
Basics, a catalog retailer of toys. In connection with these acquisitions, the
Company issued a total of 1,514,612 shares of Amazon.com common stock. Of the
approximately $112 million aggregate purchase price, approximately $105 million
was allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles. The goodwill and
substantially all other purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over lives averaging approximately four years.

     The Company made additional immaterial acquisitions during 1999 totaling
$44.1 million. The Company issued 200,370 shares of common stock to effect these
acquisitions.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company has conditioned a
portion of the overall consideration on the continued tenure of key employees.
Under generally accepted accounting principles, a portion of this amount is
accounted for as compensation rather than as a component of purchase price.
Consequently, a maximum of $85.4 million in additional consideration relating to
the Company's acquisitions for 1999 may be recorded as compensation expense and
classified between stock-based compensation and merger, acquisition and
investment-related costs in the results of operations. Amounts will be "earned"
based on tenure of certain employees and will be recognized as expense over a
period of 12-36 months.

     In April 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
three international Internet companies. The aggregate purchase price of the
three acquisitions, plus related charges, was approximately $55 million. The
consideration for the acquisitions was comprised of common stock and cash. The
Company issued an aggregate of approximately 6.4 million shares of common stock
to effect the transactions. The goodwill and other purchased intangibles are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over two years.

     In August 1998, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of
Junglee Corp. (Junglee). Junglee was a leading provider of advanced Web-based
virtual database technology to help shoppers find and discover products on the
Internet. The Company issued approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock
and assumed all outstanding options and warrants in connection with the
acquisition of Junglee. The Junglee acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting, with substantially all of the approximately $180
million purchase price allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles.
The goodwill and substantially all other purchased intangible assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over lives averaging approximately three
years.

     The pro forma consolidated financial information for years ended December
31, 1999 and 1998, determined as if all acquisitions had occurred on January 1
of each year, would have resulted in net sales of $1.7 billion and $685.0
million, net loss of $864.5 million and $416.6 million, and basic and diluted
loss per share of $2.65 and $1.41, respectively. This unaudited pro forma
information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations in future periods or results that would
have been achieved had Amazon.com and the acquired companies been combined
during the specified periods.

     In August 1998, the Company exchanged common stock and options for all of
the outstanding capital stock of Sage Enterprises, Inc. (PlanetAll). The Company
issued approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock and assumed all
outstanding options in connection with the merger. The PlanetAll merger was
accounted for as a pooling of interests and, as a result, the Company's
consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented.
PlanetAll issued approximately 167,000 shares of capital stock for proceeds of
approximately $1.0 million and approximately 896,000 shares of capital stock for
proceeds of approximately $7.4 million in January 1998 and April 1998,
respectively.

     Net sales for PlanetAll were not significant and net loss was $4.1 million
and $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 and the year ended
December 31, 1997, respectively, which represent separate results of the
combined entity through the periods preceding the merger. There were no
significant intercompany transactions between the two companies and no
significant conforming accounting adjustments.

     In July 1999, drugstore.com completed the initial public offering (IPO) of
its common stock. drugstore.com operates an online retail store and information
site for health, beauty, wellness, personal care and pharmacy products. Prior to
the IPO, the Company owned 10,733,523 shares of drugstore.com common stock,
which represented 29.2% of the outstanding shares. drugstore.com sold 5,000,000
shares of common stock in its IPO at a price of $18 per share, including 555,555
shares purchased by the Company. This reduced the Company's ownership percentage
to 26.7% after the IPO. In connection with this transaction, the Company
recorded a contribution to additional paid-in capital of $13.8 million,
representing the difference between the carrying value of the Company's
investment and the proportionate underlying net book value of drugstore.com
after the IPO. As of December 31, 1999, drugstore.com was the only publicly held
equity-method investee of the Company. The market value of the Company's
drugstore.com common stock was $408.5 million as of December 31, 1999.

     At December 31, 1999, "Other investments" includes $87.7 million of
investments accounted for under the cost method and $57.0 million of cost method
investments in securities with ready markets recorded at fair value pursuant to
SFAS No. 115. The cost of such noncurrent available-for-sale equity securities
at December 31, 1999 was $47.0 million. Gross unrealized gains were $15.4
million and gross unrealized losses were $5.4 million at December 31, 1999.

NOTE 7 -- LONG-TERM DEBT

  Convertible Subordinated Notes

     On February 3, 1999, the Company completed an offering of $1.25 billion of
4 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the Convertible Subordinated
Notes). The Convertible Subordinated Notes are convertible into the Company's
common stock at the holders' option at a conversion price of $78.0275 per share,
subject to adjustment in certain events. Interest on the Convertible
Subordinated Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August
1 of each year, and commenced August 1, 1999. The Convertible Subordinated Notes
are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future Senior
Indebtedness as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Subordinated
Notes (the Convertible Subordinated Notes Indenture). Subject to certain
conditions, the Convertible Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at the option of
the Company prior to February 6, 2002, in whole or in part, at the redemption
price of $1,000 per note, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price
for the Company's common stock has exceeded 150% of the conversion price for at
least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive

trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of mailing of the
notice of redemption. Upon any redemption made prior to February 6, 2002, the
Company will also make an additional cash payment with respect to the
Convertible Subordinated Notes called for redemption in an amount equal to
$212.60 per $1,000 note redeemed, less the amount of any interest actually paid
on such Convertible Subordinated Notes prior to the call for redemption. At any
time on and after February 6, 2002, the Company may redeem the notes, in whole
or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the Convertible Subordinated
Notes Indenture.

     Upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change" (as defined in the
Convertible Subordinated Notes Indenture) prior to the maturity of the
Convertible Subordinated Notes, each holder thereof shall have the right to
require Amazon.com to redeem all or any part of such holder's Convertible
Subordinated Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
being redeemed, together with accrued interest.

     The fair value of the Convertible Subordinated Notes as of December 31,
1999 was $1,416,750,000.

  Senior Discount Notes

     In May 1998, the Company completed the offering of approximately $326
million gross proceeds of 10% Senior Discount Notes due May 1, 2008 (the Senior
Discount Notes). Pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 in September
1998, the Company completed an exchange offer of 10% Senior Discount Notes due
2008 (the Exchange Notes), which are registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, for all outstanding Senior Discount Notes. The Exchange Notes
have identical terms in all material respects to the terms of the original
Senior Discount Notes, except that the Exchange Notes generally are freely
transferable (the Exchange Notes are referred to throughout these notes to
consolidated financial statements interchangeably with the Senior Discount
Notes). The Exchange Notes were issued under the indenture governing the
original Senior Discount Notes (the Indenture). The Senior Discount Notes were
sold at a substantial discount from their principal amount at maturity of $530
million. Prior to November 1, 2003, no cash interest payments are required;
instead, interest will accrete during this period to the aggregate principal
amount at maturity. From and after May 1, 2003, the Senior Discount Notes will
bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum payable in cash on each May 1 and
November 1. The Senior Discount Notes are redeemable, at the option of the
Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 1, 2003, at the
redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued interest, if any, to
the date of redemption.

     During 1999, the Company repurchased $266 million (principal amount) of the
Senior Discount Notes, representing accreted value of $178.4 million. The
Company recorded an immaterial loss on extinguishment of this debt. As of
December 31, 1999, the remaining principal amount outstanding was $190.7
million.

     The Senior Discount Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company
ranking pari passu with the Company's existing and future unsubordinated,
unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all subordinated
indebtedness of the Company. The Senior Discount Notes are effectively
subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to all existing and future
liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.

     The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit
the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the
Indenture) to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, prepay subordinated
indebtedness, repurchase capital stock, make investments, create liens, engage
in transactions with stockholders and affiliates, sell assets and engage in
mergers and consolidations. However, these limitations are subject to a number
of important qualifications and exceptions. The Company was in compliance with
all financial covenants at December 31, 1999 and 1998.

     The fair value of the outstanding Senior Discount Notes as of December 31,
1999 was $174.2 million. As of December 31, 1998, the carrying amount of the
Senior Discount Notes approximated fair value.

  Legal Proceedings

     Subsequent to December 31, 1999, certain federal class action lawsuits were
filed against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Alexa. The lawsuits
allege that Alexa tracking and storage of Internet Web usage paths violates
federal and state statutes prohibiting computer fraud, unfair competition, and
unauthorized interception of private electronic communications, as well as
common law proscriptions against trespass and invasion of privacy. The
complaints seek actual, statutory, and punitive damages, as well as restitution,
on behalf of all users of Alexa Web navigation service, as well as injunctive
relief prohibiting Alexa from tracking and storing such information or
disclosing it to third parties. Although the Company disputes the allegations of
wrongdoing in these complaints, there can be no assurance that the Company will
prevail in these lawsuits. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has
requested information and documents regarding Alexa practices and has opened a
formal investigative file in connection with its inquiry. The Company is
cooperating voluntarily with the Federal Trade Commission's investigation.
Depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all
of these matters could materially affect the Company's business, future results
of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

     From time to time, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and
claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged
infringement of trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights.
The Company currently is not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that
it believes will have,

NOTE 9 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

  Preferred Stock

     In June 1996, the Company issued 569,396 shares of Series A convertible
preferred stock at a price of $14.05 per share. In January and February 1997,
the Company sold an additional 5,000 shares of Series A preferred stock at $40
per share. The preferred stock was convertible into common stock at the option
of the holder, at any time, at an effective rate of 36 shares of common stock
for one share of preferred stock. As of the closing of the Company's initial
public offering, all of the preferred stock outstanding was converted into an
aggregate of 20,678,256 shares of common stock.

  Common Stock

     On April 18, 1997, the Company effected a 3-for-2 common stock split. On
May 15, 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of 18 million
shares of its common stock. Net proceeds to the Company aggregated $49.1
million. On June 1, 1998, the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split in the form
of a stock dividend to stockholders of record on May 20, 1998. On January 4,
1999, the Company effected a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend
to the stockholders of record on December 18, 1998. On September 1, 1999, the
Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to
stockholders of record on August 12, 1999. Accordingly, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect these stock
splits.

  Stock Option Plans

     The Company's stock option plans consist of the 1999 Nonofficer Employee
Stock Option Plan, the 1997 Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Stock Option Plan.
Shares reserved under the Plans consist of 40.0 million shares in the 1999
Nonofficer Employee Stock Option Plan, 72.0 million shares in the 1997 Stock
Option Plan and 57.6 million shares in the 1994 Stock Option Plan. Any shares of
common stock available for issuance under the 1994 Stock Option Plan that are
not issued under that plan may be added to the aggregate number of shares
available for issuance under the 1997 Stock Option Plan. In connection with
certain acquisitions in 1998 and 1999, the Company assumed outstanding options
to purchase common stock originally issued under the acquired companies' stock
option plans. The Company's stock options plans as well as the assumed stock
option plans are hereby collectively referred to as the "Plans."

     Generally, the Company's Board of Directors grants options at an exercise
price of not less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock at
the date of grant. Each outstanding option granted prior to December 20, 1996
has a term of five years from the date of vesting. Generally, outstanding
options granted on or subsequent to December 20, 1996 have a term of 10 years
from the date of grant; however, certain nonqualified stock options were granted
in 1999 with terms of 15 and 20 years. Subject to Internal Revenue Service
limitations, options granted under the Plans prior to April 1999 and granted
under certain assumed plans generally become exercisable immediately. Options
granted under the Plans since April 1999 generally vest and become exercisable
in accordance with the following vesting schedule: 20% after year one, 20% after
year two and 5% at the end of each quarter for years three through five. Shares
issued upon exercise of options that are unvested are restricted and subject to
repurchase by the Company at the exercise price upon

  Deferred Compensation

     The Company recorded aggregate deferred compensation of $72.1 million, $2.1
million, and $2.7 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. In 1999,
deferred compensation was recorded in connection with acquisitions made by the
Company in which restricted Company stock was issued to employees of acquired
companies. Such stock is considered compensation for services to be provided by
employees, and the related expense will be recognized over the term of the
services provided, which is generally four years. The amounts recorded in 1998
and 1997 represent the difference between the grant price and the deemed fair
value of the Company's common stock for shares subject to options granted in
1998 and 1997. Shares underlying options granted below fair market value and the
associated weighted average exercise price were 1,072,000 and $2.048, and 16.6
million and $0.237 during the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The amortization of deferred compensation is charged to operations
over the vesting period of the options, which is typically five years. Total
amortization expense recognized in 1999, 1998 and 1997 related to deferred
compensation was $25.9 million, $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

  Pro Forma Disclosure

     The Company follows the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stock
options. Had compensation cost been recognized based on the fair value at the
date of grant for options granted in 1999, 1998 and 1997, the pro forma amounts
of the Company's net loss and net loss per share for the years ended December
31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 would have been as follows:

- ---------------
(1) Options granted prior to the Company's initial public offering and by
    PlanetAll prior to its merger with the Company were valued using the minimum
    value method and therefore volatility was not applicable.

     The weighted average fair value of options granted during 1999, 1998 and
1997 was $43.36, $19.07 and $2.07, respectively, for options granted with
exercise prices at the current fair value of the underlying stock. During 1998
and 1997, some options were granted with exercise prices that were below the
current fair value of the underlying stock. The weighted average fair value of
options granted with exercise prices below the current fair value of the
underlying stock during 1998 and 1997 was $4.61 and $0.55, respectively.
Compensation expense that is recognized in providing pro forma disclosures might
not be representative of the effects on pro forma earnings for future years
because SFAS No. 123 does not apply to stock option grants made prior to 1995.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset,
consisting primarily of net operating loss, because of uncertainty regarding its
realizability.

     At December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss of approximately
$1.18 billion related to US federal, foreign and state jurisdictions.
Utilization of net operating loss, which begin to expire at various times
starting in 2010, may be subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and other limitations under state and
foreign tax laws. To the extent that net operating losses, when realized, relate
to stock option deductions of approximately $768 million, the resulting benefits
will be credited to stockholders' equity.

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company's deferred tax assets are approximately as follows:

NOTE 13 -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

     The Company has a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its
employees. Eligible employees may contribute through payroll deductions. The
Company matches employees' contributions at the discretion of the Company's
Board of Directors. To date, the Company has not matched employee contributions
to the 401(k) savings plan.

NOTE 14 -- SEGMENT INFORMATION

     The Company identifies operating segments based on product line
information, considering line maturity, within the United States and separately
identifies its international operations as an operating segment. The financial
results of the Company's operating segments are reported to the Company's Chief
Operating Decision Maker in the following groupings: US Books; Music; DVD/video;
International; and Early-Stage Businesses and Other. The results for US Books,
Music and DVD/video have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to the
similarity of their economic characteristics.

     The measure of profit or loss used for each reportable segment is income
(loss) from operations before other operating expenses, including stock-based
compensation, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and merger,
acquisition and investment-related costs. Assets are not allocated to operating
segments for reporting to the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker and there
are no intersegment revenues on transactions between reportable segments.

were no transfers between geographic areas during the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 or 1997. Long-lived assets, which are comprised primarily of fixed
assets, held in foreign countries totaled $9.4 million and $2.8 million as of

NOTE 15 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On February 16, 2000, the Company completed an offering of E690,000,000
($680,685,000 as of February 11, 2000) of 6.875% Convertible Subordinated Notes
due 2010, also known as PEACS. The PEACS are convertible into the Company's
common stock at an initial conversion price of E104.947 per share.

                                AMAZON.COM, INC.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Interest on the PEACS is payable annually in arrears on February 16 of each
year, commencing on February 16, 2001. The PEACS are unsecured and are
subordinated to all of the Company's existing and future senior indebtedness.
The PEACS rank equally with the Convertible Subordinated Notes. The conversion
price will be reset on February 16, 2001 and February 16, 2002 to the lesser of
(1) the then effective conversion price and (2) the euro equivalent average of
the daily closing prices of the Company's common stock for the 20 consecutive
trading days immediately preceding such date. However, in no event will the
conversion price be reset lower than E84.883 per share. The exchange ratio
between the dollar and the euro is not fixed by the indenture governing the
PEACS, and, therefore, fluctuations in that ratio may impact whether the
conversion price will be reset.

     Subject to certain conditions, the PEACS may be redeemed at the Company's
option prior to February 20, 2003, in whole or in part, at the redemption price
of E1,000 per note, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the closing price for
the Company's common stock has exceeded 160% of the initial conversion price for
at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending
on the trading day prior to the date of mailing of the notice of redemption.
Upon any redemption made prior to February 20, 2003, the Company will make an
additional cash payment with respect to the PEACS called for redemption in an
amount equal to E206.25 per E1,000 note redeemed, less the amount of any
interest actually paid on such PEACS prior to the call for redemption. At any
time on and after February 20, 2003, the Company may redeem the notes, in whole
or in part, at their principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest.

     Upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture
governing the PEACS) prior to the maturity of the notes, each holder thereof
shall have the right to require the Company to redeem all or any part of such
holder's PEACS at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes being
redeemed, together with accrued interest.
