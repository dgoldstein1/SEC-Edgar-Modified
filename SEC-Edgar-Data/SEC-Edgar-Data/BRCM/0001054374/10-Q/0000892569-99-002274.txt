                              BROADCOM CORPORATION
         NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                  JUNE 30, 1999

1. Basis of Presentation
   ---------------------

          The condensed financial statements included herein are unaudited;
however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments which, in
the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the consolidated
financial position of Broadcom Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Company") at June 30, 1999 and the consolidated results of its operations
and cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. It should be
understood that accounting measurements at interim dates inherently involve
greater reliance on estimates than at year-end. The results of operations for
the three and six months ended June 30, 1999 are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year.

          The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include footnotes and certain financial presentations normally required
under generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, these financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 1998, included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

2. Business Combinations
   ---------------------

Pooling-of-Interests Transactions

          On May 31, 1999, the Company completed the acquisitions by merger of
Maverick Networks ("Maverick"), Epigram, Inc. ("Epigram"), and Armedia, Inc.
("Armedia"). Maverick develops highly integrated silicon for multi-layer
switching equipment in enterprise networks, Epigram makes advanced semiconductor
products for high-speed home networking, and Armedia is a developer of high
performance digital video decoders. In connection with the acquisitions, the
Company issued 6,363,822 shares of its Class B Commons Stock and reserved an
additional 666,462 shares of its Class B Common Stock for issuance upon exercise
of outstanding employee stock options, warrants and other rights.

          Each of the three acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, the Company's historical consolidated financial
statements have been restated to include the historical financial information of
Maverick, Epigram and Armedia as if the companies had combined with the Company
at the beginning of the first period presented.

          None of the three acquired companies had material revenue in 1998. A
reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share originally reported
for the three and six months ended June 30, 1998, to the amounts presented in
the accompanying Statements of Operations is as follows:

</TABLE>

          Included in net income for the three and six months ended June 30,
1999 were $3.6 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of net losses from
Maverick, Epigram and Armedia incurred prior to the closing of the merger
transactions. None of the three acquired companies had material revenue in the
three and six months ended June 30, 1999.

Merger Related Costs

          In connection with the acquisitions of Maverick, Epigram and Armedia,
the Company recorded approximately $11.1 million in charges in the three months
ended June 30, 1999 for direct and other merger-related costs and certain
restructuring programs.

          Merger transaction costs of approximately $8.1 million consisted
primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
related charges. Restructuring costs of approximately $3.0 million included
provisions for the disposal of duplicative facilities and assets and the
write-down of unutilized assets. Immaterial adjustments were made to conform the
accounting policies of Maverick, Epigram and Armedia.

retroactively restated to reflect this change in the Company's capital
structure.

7. Litigation
   ----------

          In December 1996 Stanford Telecommunications, Inc. ("STI") filed an
action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. STI alleged that the Company's BCM3036, BCM3037,
BCM3300, BCM93220 and BCM93220B products infringed one of STI's patents (the
"'352 Patent"). STI sought an injunction as well as the recovery of monetary
damages, including treble damages for willful infringement, as to the products
listed above and potentially other products. The Company filed an answer and
affirmative defenses to STI's complaint, denying the allegations in STI's
complaint, and asserted a counterclaim requesting declaratory relief that the
Company was not infringing the '352 Patent and that the '352 Patent was invalid
and unenforceable. In May 1999 the Company brought a separate action against STI
and an STI subsidiary in California Superior Court for misappropriation of
certain Company trade secrets. On June 16, 1999 the parties entered into a
settlement agreement and agreed to dismiss with prejudice all claims and
counterclaims in both actions. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, STI
granted to the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to STI's
rights in patents and patent applications, and all inventions conceived, through
the date of the agreement, relating to any transmitter or receiver technology,
or design or invention capable of use over a coaxial cable transmission medium,
excluding patent claims specifically claiming Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA) inventions. The Company also obtained the option to acquire licenses on
commercially reasonable terms to STI's patent claims based upon CDMA inventions
capable

of use over a coaxial cable transmission medium, and STI agreed not to bring any
future action against the Company, its suppliers or customers for patent
infringement or trade secret misappropriation resulting from commercial use of
any of the Company's existing technology, designs or products. In connection
with the settlement, the Company made a one-time payment to STI and the parties
exchanged mutual releases. Neither party admitted any liability in connection
with the various actions.

          In April 1997 Sarnoff Corporation and Sarnoff Digital Communications,
Inc. (collectively, "Sarnoff") filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior Court
against the Company and five former Sarnoff employees now employed by the
Company (the "Former Employees") asserting claims against the Former Employees
for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and against the Company for inducing
such actions. Those claims relate to the alleged disclosure of certain
technology of Sarnoff to the Company. The complaint also asserted claims against
the Company and the Former Employees for unfair competition, misappropriation
and misuse of trade secrets and confidential, proprietary information of
Sarnoff, and tortious interference with present and prospective economic
advantage, as well as a claim against the Company alleging that it "illegally
pirated" Sarnoff's employees. The complaint sought to preliminarily and
permanently enjoin the Company and the Former Employees from utilizing any
alleged Sarnoff trade secrets, and to restrain the Former Employees from
violating their alleged statutory and contractual duties of confidentiality to
Sarnoff by, for example, precluding them from working for six months in any
capacity relating to certain of the Company's programs. In May 1997 the Court
denied Sarnoff's request for a temporary restraining order. On February 2, 1999
the Court dismissed with prejudice Sarnoff's misappropriation of trade secrets
claims, and granted summary judgment dismissing all of Sarnoff's remaining
claims except claims based upon the Company's alleged "pirating" of Sarnoff's
employees. Trial of Sarnoff's "piracy"-related claims commenced on February 22,
and concluded on March 2, 1999. On April 27, 1999 the Court issued an order and
opinion dismissing with prejudice all remaining claims that Sarnoff had against
the Company. The Court found in the Company's favor on all liability, causation,
and damages issues. Subsequently the Court denied the Company's petition for
attorneys' fees in the case. Judgment on the Court's February 2 and April 27
orders was entered on May 19, 1999. On July 1, 1999, Sarnoff filed an appeal of
both orders in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division.

          In July 1997 the Company commenced an action against Sarnoff in the
California Superior Court alleging breach of contract, fraud, misappropriation
of trade secrets, false advertising, trade libel, intentional interference with
prospective economic advantage and unfair competition. The claims center on
Sarnoff's violation of a non-disclosure agreement entered into with the Company
with respect to limited use of certain of the Company's technology and on
inaccurate comparisons that the Company believes Sarnoff has made in its product
advertising and in statements to potential customers and others. This action was
removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, and was stayed pending resolution of the New Jersey action described
in the preceding paragraph. Following trial in the New Jersey action, the
parties stipulated to lift the stay so that litigation of the California action
could go forward. Sarnoff then filed a motion for summary judgment in the
California case on the basis that the issues therein have been or should have
been previously litigated in the New Jersey action under the New Jersey "entire
controversy" doctrine. The Company has opposed the motion and believes that the
California action involves facts, circumstances and claims unrelated to those at
issue in the New Jersey action. A hearing on Sarnoff's motion has been scheduled
for August 16, 1999. No discovery has yet occurred in the case.

                                  JUNE 30, 1999

          In March 1998 Scott O. Davis, the Company's former Chief Financial
Officer, filed a complaint in California Superior Court against the Company and
its Chief Executive Officer, Henry T. Nicholas, III, alleging claims for fraud
and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, constructive fraud, conversion, breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief. The claims related to Mr. Davis'
alleged ownership of 26,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock originally
purchased by Mr. Davis in March 1996 (which shares would have converted into
156,000 shares of Class B Common Stock upon consummation of the initial public
offering). The purchase agreement between the Company and Mr. Davis contained a
provision permitting the Company to repurchase the shares in the event that Mr.
Davis did not continue to be employed by the Company for a certain period of
time. After Mr. Davis resigned in June 1997, the Company exercised its
repurchase right. Mr. Davis' complaint alleged that the repurchase right should
not be enforceable under several legal theories and sought unspecified damages
and declaratory relief. The Company asserted certain counterclaims against Mr.
Davis. On March 19, 1999 the parties entered into a settlement agreement and
agreed to dismiss with prejudice all of the claims and counterclaims in the
case. The settlement was approved by the Court on April 5, 1999. The terms of
the settlement are confidential but the Company believes that they will not have
a material effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or
equity.

          The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

          The Company's pending lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and
law and could require the expenditure of significant costs and diversion of
resources to defend. Although management believes the outcome of the Company's
outstanding legal proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial
condition, the results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and an adverse
outcome is at least reasonably possible. The Company is unable to estimate the
range of possible loss from outstanding litigation, and no amounts have been
provided for such matters in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

8. Subsequent Events
   -----------------

          Effective July 16, 1999, the Company entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire HotHaus Technologies Inc. ("HotHaus"). HotHaus is a
Richmond (Vancouver), British Columbia-based developer of embedded digital
signal processing (DSP) software that enables transmission of digital voice, fax
and data packets over data networks, including the Internet. Under the terms of
the agreement, a Canadian subsidiary of the Company will issue Exchangeable
Non-Voting Preferred Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of HotHaus
Common Stock. Shares of the Exchangeable Non-Voting Preferred Stock may in turn
be exchanged at the holder's request for shares of the Company's Class B Common
Stock on a one-for-one basis. Outstanding HotHaus stock options will become
directly exercisable for shares of Broadcom Class B Common Stock. In the
aggregate, the Company will reserve 2.0 million shares of its Class B Common
Stock for issuance upon such exchanges and exercises. HotHaus

                                  JUNE 30, 1999

shareholders may elect to receive shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock
directly in exchange for their HotHaus shares. The merger transaction is
currently expected to close within 30 days and to be accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests. The boards of directors of both companies have approved
the agreement. The transaction is subject to the approval of HotHaus
shareholders and satisfaction of regulatory requirements and other customary
closing conditions.

          On August 10, 1999, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire AltoCom, Inc. ("AltoCom"). AltoCom is a provider of software data/fax
modem implementations for general purpose embedded processors, PC CPU's, and
DSPs. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will issue 1,619,860 shares
of its Class B Common Stock in exchange for all shares of AltoCom Preferred and
Common Stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of employee stock options
and other rights. The merger transaction is currently expected to close within
60 days and to be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. The boards of
directors of both companies have approved the agreement. The transaction is
subject to the approval of AltoCom shareholders and satisfaction of regulatory
requirements and other customary closing conditions.

          The Company expects to record a one-time charge in the quarter ending
September 30, 1999 to cover expenses related to the above acquisitions. The
Company's historical consolidated financial statements presented after the
closing of these transactions will be restated to include the financial position
and results of operations of the acquired companies.

OVERVIEW

          We are a leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that
enable broadband digital transmission of voice, data and video to and throughout
the home and within the business enterprise. Our products enable the high-speed
transmission of data over existing communications infrastructures, most of which
were not originally intended for digital data transmission. Using proprietary
technologies and advanced design methodologies, we design, develop and supply
integrated circuits for some of the most significant broadband communications
markets, including the markets for cable set-top boxes, cable modems, high-speed
networking, direct


                                       11
<PAGE>   14

broadcast satellite and terrestrial digital broadcast, and digital subscriber
lines. We recently announced our entry into the home networking market. From our
inception in 1991 through 1994, we were primarily engaged in product development
and the establishment of strategic customer and foundry relationships. During
that period, we generated the majority of our total revenue from development
work performed for key customers. We began shipping our products in 1994, and
subsequently our total revenue has grown predominately through sales of our
semiconductor products. We intend to continue to enter into development
contracts with key customers, but expect that development revenue will continue
to constitute a decreasing percentage of our total revenue. We also generate a
small percentage of our product revenue from sales of system level reference
designs.

          From time to time, our key customers have placed large orders causing
quarterly revenue to fluctuate significantly. We expect these fluctuations will
continue in the future. Sales to our five largest customers (including sales to
their respective manufacturing subcontractors) represented approximately 71.0%
and 75.5% of our total revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 1999,
respectively. In the three and six months ended June 30, 1998, sales to our five
largest customers accounted for approximately 81.1% and 81.7% of our total
revenue, respectively. We expect that our key customers will continue to account
for a significant portion of our total revenue for 1999 and in the future.

          Our gross margin has been affected in the past, and may continue to be
affected in the future, by various factors, including, but not limited to, the
following:

          o         our product mix;

          o         the position of our products in their respective life
                    cycles;

          o         competitive pricing strategies;

          o         the mix of product revenue and development revenue; and

          o         manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies.

For example, newly introduced products generally have higher average selling
prices and gross margins, both of which typically decline over product life
cycles due to competitive pressures and volume pricing agreements. Our gross
margin and operating results in the future may continue to fluctuate as a result
of these and other factors.

          The sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range
from three to six months or more, with an additional three to six months or more
before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our
products. Due to these lengthy sales cycles, we may experience a significant
delay between increasing expenses for research and development and selling,
general and administrative efforts, and the generation of corresponding revenue,
if any. Furthermore, during 1999 and thereafter, we intend to continue to
increase our investment in research and development, selling, general and
administrative functions and inventory as we expand our operations. We
anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to
month. Consequently, if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not
occur when expected, expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately
high, and our operating results for that quarter and, potentially, future
quarters would be materially and adversely affected.

(1) Restated for mergers accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method.

          EFFECTS OF POOLING-OF-INTEREST TRANSACTIONS. On May 31, 1999 we
completed the acquisitions by merger of Maverick Networks, Epigram, Inc. and
Armedia, Inc. Each of the acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, our historical consolidated financial statements and the
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for
prior periods have been restated to include the historical financial information
of these three companies as if they had combined with our company at the
beginning of the first period presented. Each of the three acquired companies
was in the development stage, and none had material revenue in 1998 or in the
three and six months ended June 30, 1999. Included in net income for the three
and six months ended June 30, 1998 were net losses of $2.8 million and $5.0
million, respectively, from the acquired companies. Included in net income for
the three and six months ended June 30, 1999 were net losses of $3.6 million and
$7.2 million, respectively, from the acquired companies incurred prior to the
closing of the acquisitions.

          REVENUE. Revenue consists principally of product revenue generated by
sales of our semiconductor products. Revenue for the three months ended June 30,
1999 was $116.3 million, an increase of $71.1 million or 157.4% from revenue of
$45.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 1998. Revenue for the six
months ended June 30, 1999 was $212.6 million, an increase of $131.9 million or
163.4% from revenue of $80.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 1998. This
growth in revenue was derived mainly from increases in volume shipments of our
semiconductor products for the high-speed networking market, digital cable
set-top boxes and cable modems.

          GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit represents revenue less the cost of
revenue. Cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon
wafers processed by independent foundries, and costs associated with assembly,
test and quality assurance for those products, as well as costs of personnel and
equipment associated with manufacturing support and contracted development work.
Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 1999 was $69.2 million or 59.5%
of revenue, an increase of $44.4 million as compared with gross profit of $24.8
million or 54.9% of revenue in the three months ended June 30, 1998. The
increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the significant increase
in the volume of product shipments. The increase in gross profit as a percentage
of revenue was driven by


                                       13



<PAGE>   16

cost reductions from our suppliers as well as lower than expected rates of price
erosion in our major markets. We expect that gross profit as a percentage of
revenue will decline in future periods as volume-pricing agreements and
competitive pricing strategies continue to take effect. In addition, our gross
profit may be affected by future introduction of certain lower margin products.

         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. Research and development expense
consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in
research, design and development activities, costs related to engineering design
tools, and subcontracting costs. Research and development expense for the three
months ended June 30, 1999 was $26.1 million or 22.5%, an increase of $15.4
million or 143.3% as compared with research and development expense of $10.7
million or 23.8% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 1998. Research
and development expense in the six months ended June 30, 1999 was $48.0 million
or 22.6% of revenue, an increase of $29.6 million or 160.6% as compared with
research and development expense of $18.4 million or 22.8% of total revenue for
the six months ended June 30, 1998. The increase in research and development
expense in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition of personnel and
the investment in design tools for the development of new products and the
enhancement of existing products. The decrease in research and development
expense as a percentage of revenue reflected the significant increase in revenue
in the three and six months ended June 30, 1999 as compared to the respective
prior year periods. We expect that research and development expense in absolute
dollars will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.

          SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. Selling, general and
administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses,
professional fees, trade show expenses and facilities expenses. Selling, general
and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 1999 was $12.4
million or 10.7% of revenue, an increase of $6.1 million or 97.1% as compared
with selling, general and administrative expense of $6.3 million or 13.9% of
revenue for the three months ended June 30, 1998. Selling, general and
administrative expense for the six months ended June 30, 1999 was $24.1 million
or 11.4% of revenue, an increase of $13.0 million or 116.5% as compared with
selling, general and administrative expense of $11.1 million or 13.8% of revenue
for the six months ended June 30, 1998. The increase in absolute dollars
reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and
marketing personnel, senior management and administrative personnel, and
increased occupancy, legal and other professional fees, including expenses for
litigation. The decline in selling, general and administrative expense as a
percentage of revenue reflected the significant increase in revenue during the
three and six months ended June 30, 1999 as compared with the respective prior
year periods. We expect that selling, general and administrative expense in
absolute dollars will continue to increase for the foreseeable future to support
the planned continued expansion of our operations and periodic changes in our
infrastructure to support increased head count, acquisition and integration
activities, and international operations.

         MERGER RELATED COSTS. Merger related costs consist primarily of
transaction costs, such as fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other related fees and expenses, and certain restructuring costs related to
the disposal of duplicative facilities and assets and the write-down of
unutilized assets. Merger related costs of approximately $11.1 million in the
three and six months ended June 30, 1999 were incurred in connection with the
acquisitions by merger of Maverick Networks, Epigram, Inc. and Armedia, Inc.


                                       14

<PAGE>   17

No comparable merger related costs were incurred in the year-earlier periods.

          LITIGATION SETTLEMENT COSTS. Litigation settlement costs consist
primarily of settlement fees and associated attorneys' fees, expenses and court
costs. Litigation settlement costs of approximately $17.0 million were incurred
in the three and six months ended June 30, 1999. No comparable litigation
settlement costs were incurred in the year-earlier periods.

          INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, Net. Interest and other income, net
reflects interest earned on average cash, cash equivalents and investment
balances, less interest on our long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
Interest and other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 1999 was $1.9
million, an increase of $0.8 million as compared with $1.1 million in the three
months ended June 30, 1998. Interest and other income, net for the six months
ended June 30, 1999 was $3.6 million, an increase of $2.2 million as compared
with $1.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 1998. The increase was
principally due to higher cash balances available to invest resulting from the
consummation of our initial public offering and sale of shares to Cisco Systems,
Inc. in April 1998 and a follow-on offering in October 1998.

          PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. We accrue a provision for federal and
state income tax at the applicable statutory rates. Our effective tax rate was
approximately 35% for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and approximately 43.6%
for the six months ended June 30, 1998. The difference between our effective tax
rate for the six months ended 1999 and the federal statutory tax rate of 34% was
primarily related to the effect of state income taxes and research and
development tax credits. The effective tax rate in the six months ended June 30,
1998 was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the retroactive
restatement of prior period financial results to include net operating losses of
acquired companies accounted for as poolings of interests. The majority of those
net operating losses did not result in a current tax benefit, which in turn
resulted in a higher effective consolidated tax rate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          Since our inception, we have financed our operations through a
combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations. At
June 30, 1999, we had $183.7 million in working capital, $162.7 million in cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $28.1 million in long-term
investments. At December 31, 1998, we had $132.3 million in working capital,
$103.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $42.8
million in long-term investments.

          Operating activities provided cash in the amount of $13.5 million in
the six months ended June 30, 1999, primarily from net income, depreciation and
amortization, and a growth in accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases
in deferred tax assets and accounts receivable. Operating activities used cash
of $0.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 1998, as increases in accounts
receivable and inventory more than offset net income, depreciation and
amortization, and an increase in accounts payable.

          In the six months ended June 30, 1999, our investing activities used
$13.1 million in cash for the purchase of capital equipment and $15.2 million
for the purchase of held-to-maturity securities. In the six months ended June
30, 1998, our investing activities used



                                       15


<PAGE>   18

$11.6 million in cash for the purchase of capital equipment to support our
expanding operations and $28.8 million for the purchase of held-to-maturity
investments.

          Cash provided by financing activities was $43.7 million in the six
months ended June 30, 1999, primarily from $32.8 million in tax benefits related
to stock option exercises and $14.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of
common stock, partially offset by $4.8 million in payments on long-term
obligations of acquired companies. Financing activities provided $80.8 million
in the six months ended June 30, 1998, primarily from the aggregate net proceeds
of $79.2 million from our initial public offering and sale of shares to Cisco
Systems in April 1998.

          We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments on
hand, together with the cash we expect to generate from operations, will be
sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months.
However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our
activities beyond the next year. We could raise such funds by selling more stock
to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money. In addition, even
though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional
equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. We may not be
able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise
additional funds by issuing additional equity securities, the ownership
percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity
securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to
those of the holders of our Common Stock.

          We had commitments totaling approximately $3.6 million as of June 30,
1999, primarily for the purchase of workstation hardware and software and lab
equipment. During 1998, we spent $29.7 million on capital equipment to support
our expanding operations. We expect that we will spend more than that amount
during 1999 to purchase additional workstation hardware and design tools, test
equipment, information systems and leasehold improvements as our operations
continue to expand and as we integrate and upgrade the capital equipment and
facilities of acquired companies.

          Although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities
for at least the next twelve months, our future capital requirements may vary
materially from those now planned. The amount of capital that we will need in
the future will depend on many factors, including:

          o         the market acceptance of our products;

          o         the levels of promotion and advertising that will be
                    required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a
                    competitive position in the marketplace;

          o         volume price discounts;

          o         our business, product, capital expenditure and research and
                    development plans and technology roadmap;

          o         the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we
                    maintain;

          o         capital improvements to new and existing facilities;

          o         technological advances;

          o         our competitors' response to our products; and

          o         our relationships with suppliers and customers.





                                       16


<PAGE>   19

          In addition, we may require additional capital to accommodate planned
growth, hiring, infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions
of other businesses, products or technologies.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

          We are aware of the widely publicized problems associated with
computer systems as they relate to the year 2000. Many existing computer
hardware systems and software applications, and embedded computer chips,
software and firmware in control devices use only two digits to identify a year
in the date field, without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the
century. Others do not correctly process "leap year" dates. As a result, such
system applications and devices could fail or create erroneous results unless
corrected so that they can correctly process data related to the year 2000 and
beyond. These problems are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the
year 2000 approaches.

          We have completed our business risk assessment of the impact that the
year 2000 problem may have on our operations. As business conditions warrant,
this assessment may be revised as new information is made available to us. To
date, we have identified the following four key areas of our business that may
be affected:

          PRODUCTS. We have evaluated each of our current products and believe
that they do not contain date sensitive functionality. We cannot determine
whether all of our customers' products into which our products are incorporated
will be year 2000 compliant because we have little or no control over the
design, production and testing of our customers' products.

          INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE. The year 2000 problem could affect the
systems, transaction processing computer applications and devices used by us to
operate and monitor all major aspects of our business, including financial
systems (such as general ledger, accounts payable and payroll), security
systems, customer services, infrastructure, materials requirement planning,
master production scheduling, networks and telecommunications systems and other
systems with embedded computer chips. We believe that we have identified
substantially all of the major systems, software applications and related
equipment used in connection with our internal operations that must be modified
or upgraded in order to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to our
business. In the normal course of business, we are currently in the process of
upgrading or replacing all affected systems and expect to complete this process
by October 1999. To date, we have completed testing of our Enterprise Resource
Planning transactional application and believe it is year 2000 ready. Because
most of the software applications used by us are recent versions of vendor
supported, commercially available products, we have not incurred, and do not
expect in the future to incur, significant costs to upgrade these applications
as year 2000 compliant versions are released by the respective vendors. We will
continue to seek certifications that products installed are year 2000 ready, and
are targeting October 1999 to complete this process.

          THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS. We rely, directly and indirectly, on external
systems utilized by our third-party suppliers for the management and control of
fabrication, assembly and testing of substantially all of our products. We have
completed surveys and on-site visits of the two independent foundries, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation and Chartered



                                       17



<PAGE>   20

Semiconductor Manufacturing, that fabricate substantially all of our
semiconductor devices in current production. In addition, we have completed
surveys and on-site visits of the two subcontractors, ASAT Ltd. and ST Assembly
Test Services, that assemble and test substantially all of our current products
to identify and, to the extent possible, resolve issues involving the year 2000
problem. The key suppliers mentioned above continue to track to their internal
year 2000 plans, and while we expect to resolve any significant year 2000
problems with our key suppliers by October 1999, it is possible that these
suppliers or new suppliers will not be able to resolve all or any year 2000
problems with their systems in a timely manner. Any failure of these third
parties to resolve their year 2000 problems in a timely manner could materially
disrupt our business. Any such disruption could negatively impact our sales,
harm our relationships with our customers and materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

          FACILITY AND LABORATORY RELATED SYSTEMS. Systems such as heating,
sprinklers, elevators, test equipment and security at our facilities and labs
may also be affected by the year 2000 problem. We have completed assessing the
business risks of and costs of remediating the year 2000 problem on our facility
and lab related systems. We estimate that the total cost of completing any
required modifications, upgrades or replacements of these systems will not have
a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We currently
expect to complete the remediation of our facility and lab related systems by
October 1999.

          We presently estimate that the total cost of addressing our year 2000
issues will be approximately $300,000. To date, we have incurred approximately
$80,000 in expenditures for testing of systems. This estimate was derived
using numerous assumptions, including but not imited to the assumptions that we
have already identified our most significant year 2000 issues and that the plans
of our third party suppliers will be fulfilled in a timely manner without cost
to us. However, these assumptions may not be accurate, and actual results could
differ materially and adversely from those anticipated after completion of
remediation, testing and contingency planning phases.

          We have developed contingency plans to address those year 2000 issues
that may pose a significant risk to our on-going operations. These plans include
buffer inventories for certain products, implementation of manual procedures to
compensate for system deficiencies and contract IS resources to immediately
address issues should they arise. However, any contingency plan we implement may
not succeed or may not be adequate to meet our needs without materially
impacting our operations. In addition, the delays and inefficiencies inherent in
conducting operations in an alternative manner could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations. More specifically, if our third party
suppliers were to lose power, or the ability to ship product as a result of year
2000 related issues, we would be exposed to missing customer shipments and
potentially losing revenues and profits.

RISK FACTORS

          BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMPANY OR TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE
YOUR INVESTMENT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW, IN
ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT AND OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE
SEC, INCLUDING OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING OUR COMPANY. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN



                                       18



<PAGE>   21

TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO AFFECT OUR BUSINESS
OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR
BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THAT EVENT, THE
MARKET PRICE FOR OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR
PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.

          OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. AS A
RESULT, WE MAY FAIL TO MEET OR EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS OF SECURITIES ANALYSTS
AND INVESTORS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. Our quarterly
revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may
continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of
which are not within our control. If our operating results do not meet the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline.
Fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors,
including the following:

          o    the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume
               sales;

          o    the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer
               orders;

          o    the gain or loss of a key customer;

          o    the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products
               and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing on
               our products;

          o    our ability to specify, develop, complete, introduce, market and
               transition to volume production new products and
               technologies in a timely manner;

          o    the rate at which our present and future customers and end users
               adopt new and emerging technologies in our target markets;

          o    the rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards in
               our target markets;

          o    the timing of customer qualification and industry
               interoperability certification of new products and the risks of
               non-qualification or non-certification;

          o    the risks inherent in acquisitions of technologies and
               businesses, including the timing and successful completion of
               technology and product development through production readiness,
               integration issues, costs and unanticipated expenditures,
               changing relationships with customers, suppliers and strategic
               partners, potential contractual, intellectual property or
               employment issues, and the risks that the acquisition cannot be
               completed successfully or that the anticipated benefits are not
               realized;

          o    wafer pricing and the availability of foundry capacity and raw
               materials;

          o    the effectiveness of our product cost reduction efforts;

          o    intellectual property disputes and pending or future litigation;

          o    fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and other problems or
               delays in the fabrication, assembly, testing or delivery of our
               products;

          o    risks and uncertainties associated with our international
               operations;

          o    our ability to retain and hire key executives, technical
               personnel and other employees in the numbers, with the
               capabilities and at the compensation levels that we need to
               implement our business and product plans;

          o    problems or delays that we may face in shifting our products to
               smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher
               levels of design integration;

          o    changes in our product or customer mix;

          o    economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and
               the broadband


                                       19


<PAGE>   22

               communications markets;

          o    the quality of our products;

          o    the level of orders received that we can ship in a fiscal
               quarter;

          o    potential business disruptions, claims, expenses and other
               difficulties resulting from "Year 2000" problems in
               computer-based systems used by us, our suppliers or our
               customers; and

          o    general economic and market conditions.

          We intend to continue to increase our operating expenses in 1999. A
large portion of our operating expenses, including rent, salaries and capital
lease expenditures, is fixed and difficult to reduce or change. Accordingly, if
our total revenue does not meet our expectations, we probably would not be able
to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in
revenue. In that event, our business, financial condition and results of
operations would be materially and adversely affected.

          Due to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in
this report, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our
operating results as an indication of future performance.

          BECAUSE WE DEPEND ON A FEW SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL
PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, THE LOSS OF A KEY CUSTOMER COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR
BUSINESS. We have derived a substantial portion of our revenues in the past from
sales to a relatively small number of customers. As a result, the loss of any
significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. Sales to General Instrument, 3Com and Cisco
Systems, including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors,
accounted for approximately 31.7%, 20.1% and 13.2%, respectively, of our revenue
in the six months ended June 30, 1999. Sales to 3Com and General Instrument
accounted for 36.8% and 31.8%, respectively, of our revenue in the six months
ended June 30, 1998. Sales to our five largest customers, including sales to
their manufacturing subcontractors, represented approximately 75.5% of our
revenue in the six months ended June 30, 1999 and approximately 81.7% of our
revenue in the six months ended June 30, 1998. We expect that our key customers
will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for 1999 and
in the future. Accordingly, our future operating results will continue to depend
on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and
new products to these customers in significant quantities.

          We may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key
customers for a variety of reasons, including the following:

          o    Most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into
               their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or
               no penalty.

          o    Our agreements with our customers typically do not require them
               to purchase a minimum amount of our products.

          o    Many of our customers have pre-existing relationships with our
               current or potential competitors that may affect their decision
               to purchase our products.

          o    Our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers
               that do not use our



                                       20

<PAGE>   23
               products.

          o    Some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete
               with our products.

          o    Our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers
               may also deter other potential customers who compete with these
               customers from buying our products.

          In addition, in order to attract new customers or retain existing
customers, we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products. If
these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers, we would
have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have
contractual "most favored nation" pricing arrangements. In that event, our
average selling prices and gross margins would decline. The loss of a key
customer, a reduction in our sales to any key customer or our inability to
attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

          WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS
AND SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE. The broadband
communications markets and semiconductor industry are intensely competitive. We
expect competition to continue to increase in the future as industry standards
become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets. We
currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of
integrated circuits in the markets for cable set-top boxes, cable modems,
high-speed networking, home networking, direct broadcast satellite and
terrestrial digital satellite, and digital subscriber lines. This competition
has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for
our products. We currently compete in the cable set-top box market with
Conexant, Fujitsu, LSI Logic, Philips Electronics, STMicroelectronics and VLSI
Technology (a subsidiary of Philips Electronics) for communication devices, and
with ATI Technologies, C-Cube, LSI Logic, Motorola and STMicroelectronics in the
MPEG/graphics segment. We expect that other major semiconductor manufacturers
will enter the market as digital broadcast television and other digital cable
television markets become more established. A number of companies, including
Conexant, Libit Signal Processing and others have announced MCNS/DOCSIS
compliant products, which could result in significant competition in the cable
modem market. Texas Instruments has recently announced its intention to acquire
Libit Signal Processing. In the high-speed networking market, we principally
compete with established suppliers including Galileo, Level One Communications
(a subsidiary of Intel Corporation), Lucent Technologies, National Semiconductor
and Texas Instruments. A number of smaller companies have announced products in
our target markets, such as AdHoc, Seeq (a subsidiary of LSI Logic) and Allayer.
We also compete for customer specific ASICs against traditional ASIC suppliers
such as Lucent, LSI Logic, NEC and Toshiba. Our principal competitors in the DBS
and terrestrial broadcast market include Conexant, LSI Logic, Lucent
Technologies, Philips Electronics, Sony, STMicroelectronics and VLSI Technology.
Our principal competitors in the xDSL market include Alcatel, Analog Devices,
Conexant, Globespan, Motorola and Texas Instruments. As the home networking
market develops, we expect to encounter competition from various competitors,
including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Conexant, Intel, Lucent and Texas
Instruments. In all of the foregoing markets, we also may face competition from
newly established competitors and suppliers of products based on new or emerging
technologies. We also believe we will encounter further consolidation in the
markets in which we compete.




                                       21



<PAGE>   24
          Many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and
have longer operating histories and presence in key markets, greater name
recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales
and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and technical resources than we do.
As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to
new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also
be able to devote greater resources than we can to the promotion and sale of
their products. In addition, current and potential competitors have established
or may establish financial or strategic relationship among themselves or with
existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. Accordingly,
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge
and rapidly acquire significant market share. Existing or new competitors may
also develop technologies in the future that more effectively address the
transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures at
lower costs than our technologies. Increased competition has in the past and is
likely to continue to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss
of market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to
compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

          OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY MAY BE DILUTIVE AND DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE. A
key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition
of businesses, products or technologies that would allow us to complement our
existing product offerings, expand our market coverage or enhance our
technological capabilities. Since January 1999 we have acquired Maverick
Networks, Epigram, Inc. and Armedia, Inc., and have entered into definitive
agreements to acquire HotHaus Technologies Inc. and AltoCom, Inc. We plan to
continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future. Acquisitions may
require significant capital infusions, typically entail many risks and could
result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations,
personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired
company. We may also encounter delays in the timing and successful completion of
the acquired company's technology and product development to production
readiness, unanticipated expenditures, changing relationships with customers,
suppliers and strategic partners, or contractual, intellectual property or
employment issues. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may
decide not to work for us. The acquisition of another company or its products
and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business
market in which we have little or no prior experience. These challenges could
disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase
our expenses. In addition, acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our
results of operations because they may require large one-time write-offs,
increased debt and contingent liabilities, substantial depreciation or deferred
compensation charges or the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and
other intangible assets. We may seek to account for acquisitions under the
pooling-of-interests accounting method, but that method may not be available.
Any of these events could cause the price of our Class A Common Stock to
decline. Furthermore, if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition,
as in the case of Maverick, Epigram and Armedia, the issuance may be dilutive to
our existing shareholders. In addition, the debt or equity securities that we
issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders
of our common stock.

          We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any of our
pending acquisitions or that we will realize the benefits anticipated from these
acquisitions. In the



                                       22

<PAGE>   25

future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition opportunities.
Even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to
consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms. Moreover, due to
our limited acquisition experience, it may be difficult for us to successfully
integrate any acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel, which
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

          WE MUST KEEP PACE WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS IN ORDER TO REMAIN
COMPETITIVE. Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and
adapt to changes in technology and industry standards. We will also need to
continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our
customers' changing demands. Substantially all of our current product revenue is
derived from sales of products for the high-speed networking, cable set-top box
and cable modem markets. These markets are characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and
short product life cycles. In addition, these markets continue to undergo rapid
growth and consolidation. A significant slowdown in any of these markets or
other broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success will also
depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance
existing products for the broadband communications markets and to successfully
introduce and promote those products. The broadband communications markets may
not continue to develop to the extent or in the timeframes that we anticipate.
If new markets do not develop as we anticipate or if our products do not gain
widespread acceptance in these markets, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

          IF WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AND ADAPT TO EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS OUR
PRODUCTS COULD BECOME OBSOLETE AND WE COULD LOSE MARKET SHARE. Products for
broadband communications applications generally are based on industry standards
that are continually evolving. If new industry standards emerge, our products or
our customers' products could become unmarketable or obsolete. We may also have
to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards. Our
past sales and profitability have resulted, to a large extent, from our ability
to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and
introduce new and enhanced products. Our ability to adapt to these changes and
to anticipate future standards, and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those
standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our
competitive position and prospects for growth. We have in the past invested
substantial resources in emerging technologies, such as 100Base-T4 for
high-speed networking, which did not achieve the market acceptance that we had
expected. Our inability to anticipate the evolving standards in the
semiconductor industry and, in particular the broadband communications markets,
or to develop and introduce new products successfully into these markets could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

          OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND MARKET
ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS. Our future success will depend on our ability to
develop new silicon solutions for existing and new markets, introduce these
products in a cost-effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment
manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products.
Our quarterly results in the past have been, and are expected in the future




                                       23





<PAGE>   26
to continue to be, dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of
new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to
customers. The development of new silicon devices is highly complex, and from
time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and
introduction of new products. Our ability to successfully develop and deliver
new products will depend on various factors, including our ability to:

          o    accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry
               standards;

          o    accurately define new products;

          o    timely complete and introduce new product designs;

          o    timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification
               of our products and our customers' products into which our
               products will be incorporated;

          o    obtain sufficient foundry capacity;

          o    achieve high manufacturing yields; and

          o    gain market acceptance of our products and our customers'
               products.

          If we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully
and in a cost-effective and timely manner, our business, financial condition and
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.

          Our new products generally are incorporated into our customers'
products at the design stage. We have often incurred significant expenditures on
the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment
manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product. The value
of our products largely depends on the commercial success of our customers'
products and on the extent to which those products accommodate components
manufactured by our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will continue to
achieve design wins. In addition, the equipment that incorporates our products
may never become commercially successful.

          WE DEPEND ON TWO INDEPENDENT FOUNDRIES TO MANUFACTURE SUBSTANTIALLY
ALL OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS, AND ANY FAILURE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FOUNDRY
CAPACITY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. We do not own or
operate a fabrication facility. Two outside foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corporation ("TSMC") in Taiwan and Chartered Semiconductor
Manufacturing ("Chartered") in Singapore, currently manufacture substantially
all of our semiconductor devices in current production. Because we rely on
outside foundries with limited capacity, we face several significant risks,
including:

          o    a lack of ensured wafer supply;

          o    limited control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and
               control, manufacturing yields and production costs; and

          o    the unavailability of or potential delays in obtaining access to
               key process technologies.

          In addition, the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly
complex and technologically demanding process. Although we work closely with our
foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, our
foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated
manufacturing yields. This often occurs during the production of new products or
the installation and start-up of new process technologies.




                                       24


<PAGE>   27
          The ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices
is limited by its available capacity. Although we have entered into contractual
commitments to supply specified levels of products to certain of our customers,
we do not have a long-term volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of
production capacity with either TSMC or Chartered. Excess foundry capacity may
not always be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Availability of
excess foundry capacity has recently been reduced due to strong demand. We place
our orders on the basis of our customers' purchase orders, and TSMC and
Chartered can allocate capacity to the production of other companies' products
and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that foundry
customers that are larger and better financed than we are or that have long-term
agreements with TSMC or Chartered, may induce our foundries to reallocate
capacity to them. Such a reallocation could impair our ability to secure the
supply of components that we need. Although we primarily use two independent
foundries, most of our components are not manufactured at both foundries at any
given time and some of our products may be designed to be manufactured at only
one. Accordingly, if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with
components as needed, we could experience significant delays in securing
sufficient supplies of those components. Any of these delays would likely
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, if either TSMC or Chartered experiences financial
difficulties, whether as a result of the current Asian economic crisis or
otherwise, if either foundry suffers any damage to its facilities or in the
event of any other disruption of foundry capacity, we may not be able to qualify
an alternative foundry in a timely manner. Even our current foundries would need
to have certain manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption at
the other foundry. If we choose to use a new foundry, it would typically take us
several months to qualify the new foundry before we can begin shipping products
from it. If we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner, we may
still experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products.
We cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries would be able to
produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields. Furthermore,
our foundries may not be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a
timely basis, or at reasonable prices.

          Maverick and Epigram have established relationships with foundries
other than TSMC and Chartered, and we currently expect to use these other
foundries to produce the initial products of Maverick and Epigram, subject to
satisfactory qualification. In using these foundries, we will be subject to all
of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to TSMC and
Chartered.

          WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT KEY PERSONNEL, WHICH COULD
SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS. Our future success depends to a significant extent
upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel,
in particular, our co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Henry
T. Nicholas III, and our co-founder, Vice President of Research and Development,
and Chief Technical Officer, Dr. Henry Samueli. We do not have employment
agreements with these executives or any other key employees that govern the
length of their service. The loss of the services of Dr. Nicholas or Dr.
Samueli, or certain other key employees, would likely materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future
success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate
qualified personnel, particularly digital circuit designers, mixed-signal
circuit designers and systems applications engineers. Competition




                                       25




<PAGE>   28

for these employees is intense. We may not be able to attract as many qualified
new personnel as we were able to employ prior to our initial public offering.
Our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

          OUR INABILITY TO MANAGE GROWTH COULD STRAIN OUR MANAGERIAL,
OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR BUSINESS. During the past year, we have significantly increased the scope of
our operations and expanded our workforce, growing from 376 employees in June
1998 to 688 employees in June 1999, including contract and temporary employees.
This growth has placed, and our anticipated future growth of operations is
expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel,
systems and resources. We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of
new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls,
including the ongoing improvement of our accounting and other internal
management systems. We also expect we will need to continue to expand, train,
manage and motivate our workforce. All of these endeavors will require
substantial management effort. In order to support our growth, we recently
relocated our headquarters and Irvine operations into larger facilities, which
allowed us to centralize all of our Irvine employees and operations on one
campus. In the future, we may engage in other relocations of our employees or
operations from time to time. These relocations could result in temporary
disruptions of our operations or a diversion of our management's attention and
resources. If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations, our
business, financial condition and result of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

          THE LOSS OF EITHER OF THE TWO THIRD-PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO ASSEMBLE
AND TEST SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS COULD DISRUPT OUR SHIPMENTS,
HARM OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET SALES. Two
third-party subcontractors, ASAT Ltd. in Hong Kong and ST Assembly Test Services
("STATS") in Singapore, assemble and test almost all of our current products.
Because we rely on third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products,
we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance
and control. This lack of control has in the past, and could in the future,
result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase
our manufacturing, assembly or testing costs. We do not have long-term
agreements with either ASAT or STATS. We typically procure services from these
suppliers on a per order basis. If either ASAT or STATS experiences capacity
constraints or financial difficulties, whether as a result of the current Asian
economic crisis or otherwise, if either subcontractor suffers any damage to its
facilities or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing
capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services
in a timely manner. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to
qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in
product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers
for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery,
quality or cost of our products could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

          AS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS EXPANDS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF
LEGAL, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC RISKS SPECIFIC TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. We
currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing, assembly and testing
services from suppliers located outside of the United



                                       26




<PAGE>   29
States. In addition, approximately 14.3% of our total revenue in the six months
ended June 30, 1999 was derived from sales to independent customers outside the
United States. We also frequently ship products to our domestic customers'
international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors. We recently
established an international distribution center in Singapore and a design
center in Bunnik, The Netherlands. Furthermore, as a result of our acquisition
of Armedia, Inc. in May 1999, we also maintain design and development activities
in India. In the future, we intend to continue to expand these international
business activities and also to open other design and operational centers
abroad. International operations are subject to many inherent risks, including:

          o    political, social and economic instability;

          o    trade restrictions;

          o    the imposition of governmental controls;

          o    exposure to different legal standards, particularly with respect
               to intellectual property;

          o    burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;

          o    import and export license requirements and restrictions;

          o    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

          o    foreign technical standards;

          o    changes in tariffs;

          o    difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

          o    fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

          o    difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities; and

          o    potentially adverse tax consequences.

          In particular, certain Asian countries have recently experienced
significant economic difficulties. These difficulties include currency
devaluation and instability, business failures and a generally depressed
business climate, particularly in the semiconductor industry. Because we rely on
Asian foundries and assemblers and have expanded our international operations in
that region, the Asian economic crisis may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

          In addition, various government export regulations apply to the
encryption or other features contained in some of our products. We have applied
for export licenses under these regulations, but we cannot assure you that we
will obtain these licenses or any licenses that we may apply for in the future.
If we do not receive the required licenses, we may be unable to manufacture the
affected products at our foreign foundries or to ship these products to certain
customers located outside the United States. Moreover, the seasonality of
international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets may
negatively impact the demand for our products abroad. All of our international
sales to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, an increase in
the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our
products less competitive in international markets. Any one or more of the
foregoing factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations or require us to modify our current business
practices significantly. We anticipate that these factors will impact our
business to a greater degree as we expand our international business activities.



                                       27




<PAGE>   30

          OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN SIGNIFICANT PART ON STRATEGIC
RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. In the past, we have relied on our
strategic relationships with certain customers who are technology leaders in our
target markets. We intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic
relationships in the future. These relationships often require us to develop new
products that typically involve significant technological challenges. Our
partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight
development schedules. Accordingly, we may have to devote a substantial amount
of our limited resources to our strategic relationships, which could detract
from or delay our completion of other important development projects. Delays in
development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and
negatively impact sales of the products under development. Moreover, it is
possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a
competitor's solution for products that they currently buy from us. If that
happens, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected.

          WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSITIONING TO SMALLER GEOMETRY
PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES OR IN ACHIEVING HIGHER LEVELS OF DESIGN INTEGRATION. In
order to remain competitive, we believe that we will have to transition our
products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition will require us to
redesign certain of our products and modify the manufacturing process for our
products. We continually evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis,
of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to reduce our
costs, and we have begun shifting some of our products to smaller geometry
processes. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to
smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes. These
difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product
deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and
expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry
processes. We are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to
transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that
our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will
be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries. If our foundries or we
experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently
implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry
processes become more prevalent, we expect to integrate greater levels of
functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into
our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design
integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.

          WE MAY NOT ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS. Our success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on
our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent,
copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements
and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is
possible that certain of our competitors or other parties may obtain, use or
disclose our technologies and processes. We currently have four issued United
States patents and have filed over 140 United States patent applications. We
cannot assure you that any



                                       28



<PAGE>   31

additional patents will be issued. Even if a new patent is issued, the claims
allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition,
any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented. Moreover, any rights granted under these patents may not provide
us with meaningful protection. If our patents do not adequately protect our
technology, then our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours.
Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or
design around our patents. Moreover, because we have participated in developing
various industry standards, we may be required to license some of our patents to
others, including competitors, who develop products based on the adopted
standards.

          We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees
and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our
technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these
efforts, parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products,
services or technology without our authorization. As a result, our technologies
and processes may be misappropriated, particularly in foreign countries where
laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.

          In addition, some of our customers have entered into agreements with
us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail
to fulfill our obligations under those agreements, including product supply
obligations, and do not correct this failure within a specified time period.
Moreover, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic
customers into our own designs, and have certain obligations not to use or
disclose their intellectual property without their authorization. We cannot
assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of
our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will
succeed. In the future, we may have to engage in litigation to enforce our
intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the
validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, including our customers.
This litigation may be very expensive, divert management's attention and
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

          Companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and
pursue their intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received,
and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed
upon, misappropriated or misused other parties' proprietary rights. We recently
settled litigation with Stanford Telecommunications, Inc. that related to the
alleged infringement of one of Stanford's patents by several of our modem
products. We are also currently involved in litigation with Sarnoff Corporation
and Sarnoff Digital Communications, Inc., who allege that we misappropriated and
misused certain of their trade secrets. In addition, we have received a letter
from counsel for BroadCom, Inc. asserting rights in the "Broadcom" trademark and
demanding that we stop using the Broadcom name. We have exchanged correspondence
with BroadCom, Inc. that outlines our differing positions on that matter. It is
possible that we will not prevail in these matters. In addition, we may be sued
in the future by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or
misappropriated or misused their trade secrets, or who may seek to invalidate
one of our patents. Any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in a
patent or trade secret action, a court could issue an injunction against us that
would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or
redesign certain products offered for sale or under development. In addition, we
may be liable for damages for past



                                       29


<PAGE>   32

infringement and royalties for future use of the technology. We may also have to
indemnify certain customers and strategic partners under our agreements with
these parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have
infringed upon, misappropriated or misused these party's proprietary rights.
Even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted, these claims
could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel
resources to defend these claims. In that event, our business, financial
condition and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely
affected. If any claims or actions are asserted against us, we may seek to
obtain a license under third party's intellectual property rights. Under these
circumstances, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all.

          OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY HAVE LENGTHY SALES CYCLES AND SHORT PRODUCT
CYCLES THAT CAN AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. After we have developed and
delivered a product to a customer, our customer will often test and evaluate our
product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product. Our
customer may need three to six months or longer to test and evaluate our product
and an additional three to six months or more to begin volume production of
equipment that incorporates our product. Due to this lengthy sales cycle, we may
experience delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and our
investments in inventory, until the time that we generate revenues for these
products. It is possible that we may never generate any revenues from these
products after incurring these expenditures. Even if a customer selects our
product to incorporate into its equipment, we have no assurances that this
customer will ultimately market and sell their equipment or that these efforts
by our customer will be successful. The delays inherent in our lengthy sales
cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its
product plans. Such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause
us to lose sales that we had anticipated. In addition, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
if a significant customer curtails, reduces or delays orders during our sales
cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products.

          While our sales cycles are typically long, our average product life
cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology
environment in which we operate. As a result, the resources devoted to product
sales and marketing may not generate material revenues for us, and from time to
time, we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory. If we incur
significant marketing and inventory expenses in the future that we are not able
to recover, and we are not able to compensate for these expenses, our operating
results could be adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at
reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions, and we still have higher cost
products in inventory, our operating results would be harmed.

          WE ARE SUBJECT TO ORDER AND SHIPMENT UNCERTAINTIES. We typically sell
products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or
defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. Any cancellations
or deferrals could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, cancellations or deferrals
could cause us to hold excess inventory, which could reduce our profit margins
and restrict our ability to fund our operations. We recognize revenue upon
shipment of products to a customer. If a customer refuses to accept shipped
products or does not timely pay for these products, we could incur significant
charges against our income. These charges could materially and adversely affect
our operating results.




                                       30



<PAGE>   33
          THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN UNFORESEEN DELAYS OR
EXPENSES AND AFFECT THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS. Highly complex
products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs
when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. We have in the
past experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, these errors,
defects and bugs. If any of our products contain defects or bugs, or have
reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged
and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and
adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new
customers. In addition, these defects or problems could interrupt or delay sales
to our customers. In order to alleviate these problems, we may have to invest
significant capital and other resources. Although our suppliers, our customers
and we test our products, we cannot assure you that our new products will not
contain defects or bugs. If any of these problems are not found until after we
have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to
incur additional development costs and product repair or replacement costs.
These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others.
In addition, these problems may divert our technical and other resources from
other development efforts. Moreover, we would likely lose, or experience a delay
in, market acceptance of the affected product or products and lose credibility
with our current and prospective customers.

          OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE CYCLICALITY OF THE
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. We operate in the semiconductor industry, which is
highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological change. From time to time,
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant economic downturns,
characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of prices and
excess production capacity. This industry also periodically experiences
increased demand and production capacity constraints. Accordingly, our quarterly
results may vary significantly as a result of general conditions in the
semiconductor industry.

          WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION, AND
CHANGES IN CURRENT OR FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. The
Federal Communications Commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target
markets. Although current FCC regulations and the laws and regulations of other
federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products, they do
apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated. As a
result, the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which
they operate may, in turn, materially and adversely impact our business,
financial condition and results of operations. FCC regulatory policies that
affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain
services or other aspects of their business may impede the sale of our products.
For example, in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating
our chips failed to comply with FCC emissions specifications. We may also be
subject to regulation by countries other than the United States. Foreign
governments may impose tariffs, duties and other import restrictions on
components that we obtain from non-domestic suppliers and may impose export
restrictions on products that we sell internationally. These tariffs, duties or
restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Changes in current laws or regulations or
the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere
could also materially and adversely affect our business.



                                       31

          WE ARE CONTROLLED BY CERTAIN OF OUR DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND
THEIR AFFILIATES. As of July 31, 1999, our directors and executive officers
beneficially owned approximately 41.7% of our outstanding common stock and 67.4%
of the total voting control held by our shareholders. In particular, as of July
31, 1999, our two founders, Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III and Dr. Henry Samueli,
beneficially owned a total of approximately 39.3% of our outstanding common
stock and 64.0% of the total voting control held by our shareholders.
Accordingly, these shareholders will have enough voting power to control the
outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders. These matters
include the election of a majority of our Board of Directors, the issuance of
additional shares of Class B Common Stock and the approval of any significant
corporate transaction, including a merger, consolidation or sale of
substantially all of our assets. In addition, these insiders will also control
the management of our business. Because of their significant stock ownership, we
will not be able to engage in certain transactions without the approval of these
shareholders. These transactions include proxy contests, mergers, tender offers,
open market purchase programs or other purchases of our Class A Common Stock
that could give our shareholders the opportunity to receive a higher price for
their shares than the prevailing market price at the time of these purchases.

          OUR STOCK PRICE IS HIGHLY VOLATILE. The market price of our Class A
Common Stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue
to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Since our initial public
offering in April 1998, our Class A Common Stock has traded as low as $23.50 and
as high as $149.50 per share. These fluctuations have occurred and may continue
to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control,
including:

          o    quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;

          o    announcements of technological innovations or new products by our
               competitors, customers or us;

          o    general conditions in the semiconductor industry and
               telecommunications and data communications equipment markets;

          o    changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by
               analysts;

          o    changes in investor perceptions; or

          o    changes in expectations relating to our products, plans and
               strategic position or those of our competitors or customers.

          In addition, the market prices of securities of Internet-related and
other high technology companies have been especially volatile. This volatility
has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology
companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the
specific companies. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of
common stock at or above the price you paid. In the past, companies that have
experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the
subject of securities class action litigation. If we were the object of a
securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial losses and
divert management's attention and resources from other matters.

          OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY YEAR 2000
COMPLIANCE PROBLEMS. Many existing computer systems and applications and other
control devices use only two



                                       32



<PAGE>   35

digits to identify a year in the date field. These systems and software
applications will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish 21st century
dates from 20th century dates. As a result, these systems and applications will
need to be upgraded to comply with the Year 2000 requirements or risk system
failure, miscalculations or other disruptions to normal business activities.

          We are currently evaluating our Year 2000 readiness, both in terms of
the compliance of our products and the compliance of our information systems and
applications which monitor all aspects of our business, including financial
systems, customer services, marketing information, infrastructure and
telecommunications equipment. We are presently updating our products and
internal information systems, but we may not be able to complete these upgrades
in a timely manner or at reasonable costs. We also may not be able to anticipate
the extent of the Year 2000 impact until the Year 2000 arrives due to the
interaction between our own systems and products and the systems and products of
third parties. We believe our greatest exposure to Year 2000 risks relates to
the readiness of the third party suppliers who fabricate, assemble and test our
products and of our customers, who incorporate our products into their own
products. Any failure of these third parties to resolve their own Year 2000
issues in a timely manner could cause a material disruption in our business and
affect the marketability of our products.

          We also rely on the external systems of other third parties such as
creditors, financial organizations, governmental entities and other suppliers,
both domestic and international, to provide us with accurate data. Our business
could be materially and adversely affected if any of these third parties
experience disruptions in their operations or if an economic crisis or general
widespread problems result from systems that are not Year 2000 compliant.
Although we are working on contingency plans to address these issues, any
contingency plans that we implement may not be adequate to meet our needs
without disrupting our business or without causing delays and inefficiencies
inherent in conducting operations in an alternative manner. If we fail to
address any of the foregoing Year 2000 risks, our business, financial condition
and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Please see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Year 2000 Compliance" for detailed information on our state of
readiness, potential risks and contingency plans regarding the Year 2000 issue.

          WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE, AND ADDITIONAL
FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. We believe that the cash,
cash equivalents and investments on hand and the cash we expect to generate from
operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next
twelve months. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional
funds to fund our activities beyond the next year. We could raise these funds by
selling more stock to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing
money. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still
elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other
reasons. We may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at
all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail our
operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic
partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain
technologies or potential markets. If we raise additional funds by issuing
additional equity securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders
would be reduced. In addition, the equity securities that we issue may have
rights, preferences or privileges senior



                                       33



<PAGE>   36

to those of the holders of our common stock.

          It is possible that our future capital requirements may vary
materially from those now planned. The amount of capital that we will need in
the future will depend on many factors, including:

          o    the market acceptance of our products;

          o    the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to
               launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive
               position in the marketplace;

          o    volume price discounts;

          o    our business, product, capital expenditure and research and
               development plans and technology roadmap;

          o    the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain;

          o    capital improvements to new and existing facilities;

          o    technological advances;

          o    our competitors' response to our products; and

          o    our relationships with suppliers and customers.

          In addition, we may require additional capital to accommodate planned
growth, hiring, infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions
of other businesses, products or technologies.

          OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS CONTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER
PROVISIONS THAT COULD AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Our articles of
incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a
third party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to
our shareholders. In addition, we have in the past issued and will in the future
issue shares of Class B Common Stock to certain holders. Those shares have
superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on
matters that we submit to a shareholder vote (as compared with one vote per
share in the case of our publicly-held Class A Common Stock). Our Board of
Directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of
our preferred stock and to issue these shares without a shareholder vote. It is
possible that the provisions in our charter documents, the existence of
supervoting rights by holders of our Class B Common Stock, and our officers'
ownership of a majority of the Class B Common Stock and the ability of our Board
of Directors to issue preferred stock may prevent parties from acquiring us. In
addition, these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our Class
A Common Stock at a premium over the market price for this stock. Finally, these
factors may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A
Common Stock, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A
Common Stock.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          In December 1996 Stanford Telecommunications, Inc. ("STI") filed an
action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. STI alleged that the Company's BCM3036, BCM3037,
BCM3300, BCM93220 and BCM93220B products infringed one of STI's patents (the
"'352 Patent"). STI sought an injunction as well as the recovery of monetary
damages, including treble damages for willful infringement, as to the products
listed above and potentially other products. The Company filed an answer and
affirmative defenses to STI's complaint, denying the allegations in STI's
complaint, and asserted a counterclaim requesting declaratory relief that the
Company was not infringing the '352 Patent and that the '352 Patent was invalid
and unenforceable. In May 1999 the Company brought a separate action against STI
and an STI subsidiary in California Superior Court for misappropriation of
certain Company trade secrets. On June 16, 1999 the parties entered into a
settlement agreement and agreed to dismiss with prejudice all claims and
counterclaims in both actions. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, STI
granted to the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to STI's
rights in patents and patent applications, and all inventions conceived, through
the date of the agreement, relating to any transmitter or receiver technology,
or design or invention capable of use over a coaxial cable transmission medium,
excluding patent claims specifically claiming Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA) inventions. The Company also obtained the option to acquire licenses on
commercially reasonable terms to STI's patent claims based upon CDMA inventions
capable of use over a coaxial cable transmission medium, and STI agreed not to
bring any future action against the Company, its suppliers or customers for
patent infringement or trade secret misappropriation resulting from commercial
use of any of the Company's existing technology, designs or products. In
connection with the settlement, the Company made a one-time payment to STI and
the parties exchanged mutual releases. Neither party admitted any liability in
connection with the various actions.

          In April 1997 Sarnoff Corporation and Sarnoff Digital Communications,
Inc. (collectively, "Sarnoff") filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior Court
against the Company and five former Sarnoff employees now employed by the
Company (the "Former Employees") asserting claims against the Former Employees
for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and against the Company for inducing
such actions. Those claims relate to the alleged disclosure of certain
technology of Sarnoff to the Company. The complaint also asserted claims against
the Company and the Former Employees for unfair competition, misappropriation
and misuse of trade secrets and confidential, proprietary information of
Sarnoff, and tortious interference with present and prospective economic
advantage, as well as a claim against the Company alleging that it "illegally
pirated" Sarnoff's employees. The complaint sought to preliminarily and
permanently enjoin the Company and the Former Employees from utilizing any
alleged Sarnoff trade secrets, and to restrain the Former Employees from
violating their alleged statutory and contractual duties of confidentiality to
Sarnoff by, for example, precluding them from working for six months in any
capacity relating to certain of the Company's programs. In May 1997 the Court
denied Sarnoff's request for a temporary restraining order. On February 2, 1999
the Court dismissed with prejudice Sarnoff's misappropriation of trade secrets
claims, and granted summary judgment dismissing all of Sarnoff's remaining
claims except claims based upon the Company's alleged "pirating" of Sarnoff's
employees. Trial of Sarnoff's "piracy"-related claims commenced on February 22,
and concluded on March 2, 1999. On April 27, 1999 the Court issued an order and
opinion dismissing with prejudice all remaining claims that Sarnoff had against
the Company. The Court found in the Company's favor on all liability, causation,
and damages issues. Subsequently the Court denied the Company's petition for
attorneys' fees in the case. Judgment on the Court's February 2 and April 27
orders was entered on May 19, 1999. On July 1, 1999, Sarnoff filed an appeal of
both orders in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division.

          In July 1997 the Company commenced an action against Sarnoff in the
California Superior Court alleging breach of contract, fraud, misappropriation
of trade secrets, false advertising, trade libel, intentional interference with
prospective economic advantage and unfair competition. The claims center on
Sarnoff's violation of a non-disclosure agreement entered into with the Company
with respect to limited use of certain of the Company's technology and on
inaccurate comparisons that the Company believes Sarnoff has made in its product
advertising and in statements to potential customers and others. This action was
removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, and was stayed pending resolution of the New Jersey action described
in the preceding paragraph. Following trial in the New Jersey action, the
parties stipulated to lift the stay so that litigation of the California action
could go forward. Sarnoff then filed a motion for summary judgment in the
California case on the basis that the issues therein have been or should have
been previously litigated in the New Jersey action under the New Jersey "entire
controversy" doctrine. The Company has opposed the motion and believes that the
California action involves facts, circumstances and claims unrelated to those at
issue in the New Jersey action. A hearing on Sarnoff's motion has been scheduled
for August 16, 1999. No discovery has yet occurred in the case.

          In March 1998 Scott O. Davis, the Company's former Chief Financial
Officer, filed a complaint in California Superior Court against the Company and
its Chief Executive Officer, Henry T. Nicholas, III, alleging claims for fraud
and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, constructive fraud, conversion, breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief. The claims related to Mr. Davis'
alleged ownership of 26,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock originally
purchased by Mr. Davis in March 1996 (which shares would have converted into
156,000 shares of Class B Common Stock upon consummation of the initial public
offering). The purchase agreement between the Company and Mr. Davis contained a
provision permitting the Company to repurchase the shares in the event that Mr.
Davis did not continue to be employed by the Company for a certain period of
time. After Mr. Davis resigned in June 1997, the Company exercised its
repurchase right. Mr. Davis' complaint alleged that the repurchase right should
not be enforceable under several legal theories and sought unspecified damages
and declaratory relief. The Company asserted certain counterclaims against Mr.
Davis. On March 19, 1999 the parties entered into a settlement agreement and
agreed to dismiss with prejudice all of the claims and counterclaims in the
case. The settlement was approved by the Court on April 5, 1999. The terms of
the settlement are confidential but the Company believes that they will not have
a material effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or
equity.

          The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

          The Company's pending lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and
law and could require the expenditure of significant costs and diversion of
resources to defend. Although management believes the outcome of the Company's
outstanding legal proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial
condition, the results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and an adverse
outcome is at least reasonably possible. The Company is unable to estimate the
range of possible loss from outstanding litigation, and no amounts have been
provided for such matters in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. CHANGES IN SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

          (d) Use of Proceeds from Sales of Registered Securities. On April 21,
1998, the Company completed an initial public offering (the "Offering") of its
Class A Common Stock, $0.0001 par value. The shares of Class A Common Stock sold
in the Offering were registered under the Securities Act of 1993, as amended, on
a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the "Registration Statement") (Reg. No.
333-45619) that was declared effective by the SEC on April 16, 1998. Of the
total shares sold, 6,240,000 shares were sold by the Company (including 710,000
shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment
option), 1,810,000 shares were sold by selling shareholders (including 340,000
shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option)
and 1,000,000 shares were sold by the Company to Cisco Systems in a concurrent
registered offering that was not underwritten. The purchase price for the
underwritten shares was $12.00 per share and the purchase price of the shares
sold to Cisco Systems was $11.16 per share. The aggregate price of the Offering
amount registered was approximately $107.8 million.

          In connection with the Offering, the Company paid an aggregate of
approximately $5.2 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and paid
other expenses of approximately $1.6 million. After deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and other expenses, the Company received net aggregate
proceeds from the Offering and sale of shares to Cisco Systems of approximately
$79.2 million. Through June 30, 1999, the Company has used approximately $59.0
million of the proceeds for repayment of debt, purchase of capital equipment,
payment of merger related costs and for payment of litigation settlement costs.
The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
including working capital and capital purchases such as design tools, lab
equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the Company's continued
growth. None of the Company's net proceeds of the Offering were paid directly or
indirectly to any director, officer, general partner of the Company or their
associates, persons owning 10 percent or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company, or an affiliate of the Company.

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

                              ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

         This ACQUISITION AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of July 15,
1999, by and among Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation ("Parent"),
585573 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Acquisition Sub"), 3030814 Nova Scotia ULC, a Nova Scotia unlimited
liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (such corporation or
such other wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent as may be designated by Parent,

company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("BVI"), and HotHaus
Technologies Inc., a British Columbia corporation (the "Company"), and with

Transfer Corporation, as Depositary Agent. Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article 10.


                                    RECITALS

         A. Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, among other things, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall be exchanged for, at
the option of the Shareholders of the Company, Parent Common Stock or
Exchangeable Shares (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement) or both and (ii) all
outstanding Company Options and Company Warrants will become exercisable for
Parent Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         B. The Exchangeable Shares shall be exchangeable by the holders for
Parent Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time.

         C. In connection with the Acquisition to be effected by the Plan of

Common Stock to be issued (including Parent Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance upon exchange of Exchangeable Shares or upon exercise of any Company
Options or Company Warrants to be assumed by Parent as provided herein) shall be
the Aggregate Share Number.

         D. As an inducement to Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub and CDN2 to enter
into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have concurrently
herewith entered into Voting Agreements with Parent in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B ("Voting Agreements") pursuant to which, among other things, such
shareholders have agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Shares owned by
them in favor of the Acquisition to be effected by the Plan of Arrangement.

         E. Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub, CDN2 and the Company intend that the

financial accounting purposes by Parent from and after the Closing.

         F. Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub, CDN2 and the Company intend that the
Exchangeable Shares will be generally received by resident Canadian shareholders
of the Company without recognition of any gain or loss pursuant to the Income
Tax Act (Canada)






                                      -1-
<PAGE>   6

and resident Canadian shareholders of the Company will not be required to file
United States Tax Returns solely as a result of the Acquisition to be effected
by the Plan of Arrangement.

         G. The Company, Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub and CDN2 desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
the Acquisition.

         H. A portion of the Exchangeable Shares or shares of Parent Common
Stock otherwise issuable by Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
Plan of Arrangement shall be placed in escrow by Parent or its Subsidiaries, the
release of which amount shall be contingent upon certain events and conditions,
all as set forth in Article 7 herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises,
representations and warranties set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, intending to be legally bound hereby the parties agree as
follows:


                                   ARTICLE 1
                             THE PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT

         1.1 The Plan of Arrangement. The Company agrees that it shall, as soon
as reasonably practical, apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia (the
"Court") pursuant to Section 252 of the BC Company Act for an interim order in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to both the Company and Parent (the
"Interim Order") providing for, among other things, the calling and holding of a
special meeting of the shareholders of the Company (the "Company Shareholder
Meeting") for the purpose of considering and, if deemed advisable, approving a
plan of arrangement involving the Company, BVI, Acquisition Sub and CDN2
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Arrangement" or "Plan of
Arrangement"), the principal terms of which include:

             (a) the description and authorization of a class of preferred stock
of Acquisition Sub (the "Exchangeable Shares") that will have the rights,
privileges and restrictions, and be subject to the conditions, set forth in
Appendix A of the Plan of Arrangement;

             (b) an exchange of shares whereby all outstanding Company Common
Shares shall be exchanged for the number of Exchangeable Shares or shares of
Parent Common Stock per Company Common Share equal to the quotient (the
"Exchange Ratio") of the Aggregate Share Number divided by the aggregate number
of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
Company Common Shares issued or issuable upon exercise or conversion of all
unvested and vested Company Options which are not exercised, converted,
exchanged or expired as of the Effective Time and all Company Options which the
Company has committed to grant but under which the conditions to grant are not
fulfilled as of the Effective Time, such Exchangeable Shares to be thereafter
exchangeable for Parent Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to certain
adjustments pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement), at the option of the holder,
during the periods, at the times and subject to the conditions set forth in
Article 5 and Appendix A of the Plan of Arrangement;






                                      -2-
<PAGE>   7

             (c) the assumption by Parent of each outstanding Company Option
(and the related option plan) and the conversion of each such Company Option
into an option (the "Replacement Option") to purchase a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of Company Common
Shares subject to such Company Option times the Exchange Ratio (and rounding
down to the nearest whole share), each Replacement Option having an exercise
price per share equal to the exercise price per share of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (and
rounded up to the nearest whole cent), and having the same vesting, expiration
and other terms as such Company Option, all in accordance with the terms of the
plan governing such Company Option or the Plan of Arrangement; and

             (d) notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares to be issued (including
Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of any Replacement
Options) in exchange for all outstanding Company Common Shares and all vested
and unvested Company Options and Company Warrants which are unexpired and
unexercised shall be the Aggregate Share Number. No adjustment shall be made in
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares
issued pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement as a result of any consideration (in
any form whatsoever) received by the Company from the date hereof to the
Effective Time as a result of any exercise, conversion or exchange of Company
Options or Company Warrants.

             The foregoing is only a summary of the Acquisition to be effected
by the Plan of Arrangement. The terms, conditions and procedures for
accomplishing the exchange of shares are set forth in the Plan of Arrangement
and the Appendices thereto and the foregoing is qualified by reference thereto.

             If approval of the Acquisition to be effected by the Plan of
Arrangement by the shareholders of the Company is obtained, the Company shall
promptly take the necessary steps to submit the Arrangement to the Court and
apply for a final order of the Court approving such Acquisition to be effected
by the Plan of Arrangement (the "Final Order").


         1.2 Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement. On or before the Closing,
Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub, CDN2 and a bank or trust company to be selected by
Parent and approved by Acquisition Sub, CDN2, BVI and the Company as trustee
(the "Trustee"), shall execute and deliver a Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement
in substantially the form set forth as Exhibit C hereto, with such changes and
additions thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Trustee (as so executed,
the "Voting Trust Agreement"). Parent shall deposit with the Trustee the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares to
secure the voting rights relating to Parent Common Stock granted for the benefit
of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, such share to be held by the Trustee
in accordance with the Voting Trust Agreement.

         1.3 Parent Support Agreement. On or before the Closing, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and CDN2 shall execute and deliver the Parent Support Agreement
(the "Parent Support Agreement") in substantially the form set forth on Exhibit
D.






                                      -3-
<PAGE>   8

         1.4 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place on the Effective Date (as defined in
the Plan of Arrangement) which shall be as promptly as practicable, but no later
than five (5) Business Days following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article 6 that by their terms are not to occur at the Closing, at
the offices of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, 38 Technology Drive, Irvine,
California, unless another place or time is agreed to by Parent and the Company.
The Plan of Arrangement shall become effective at the time provided for in the
Plan of Arrangement (the "Effective Time"). The date upon which the Effective
Time actually occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date."

         1.5 Exemption from Registration. The parties intend that the
Exchangeable Shares issued pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement and the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement and shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange for the Exchangeable Shares will be
issued in transactions (the "Contemplated Issuances") exempt from registration
under the Securities Act by reason of Section 3(a)(10) and/or 3(a)(9) thereof
and, when issued, such shares of Parent Common Stock will be immediately
convertible into shares of Parent Class A Common Stock which will be tradable by
the holders without restrictions except for the restrictions set out in the
Company Affiliate agreements applicable to Company Affiliates. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Parent will submit a written
"no-action" request letter to Staff of the SEC seeking confirmation that the
Contemplated Issuances are so exempt from registration under the Securities Act
(the "No Action Request"). Parent will provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the No Action Request prior to
its submission to the SEC. In the event the SEC's response to the No Action
Request is negative or is not received by Parent prior to 30 days following the
Effective Time (a "Triggering Event"), then Parent hereby agrees as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter, in the case of one or more Contemplated
Issuances not being exempt from registration under the Securities Act, to take
all steps reasonably necessary to permit such Contemplated Issuances to proceed
in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and, in the case of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock not being tradable without restriction, to
take all steps reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause such shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock to be freely tradable without restriction in such
manner, including, but not limited to, (x) within 14 days after the occurrence
of a Triggering Event, filing with the SEC, and using commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the effectiveness of, a registration statement under the
Securities Act so as to register the issuance of such shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock, (y) using commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (the "Public Registration") until
all such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock have been issued by Parent and
(z) taking any action required to be taken under applicable SEC, state and
provincial securities Laws and the regulations of the NNM in connection with the
issuance of such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock. Notwithstanding any
provision hereof to the contrary, Parent shall be entitled, without prior
notice, to suspend the Public Registration during customary "blackout periods"
relating to material non-public information regarding Parent that causes the
prospectus contained in such registration statement to not be complete or
correct in any material respect.






                                      -4-

         1.6 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and the Acquisition to be effected by the
Plan of Arrangement, the officers and directors of the Company are fully
authorized to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

         1.7 Contemporaneous Transactions. The parties hereby agree that each of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is in fact consummated
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and not otherwise provided for
herein or in the Plan of Arrangement, be deemed consummated substantially
contemporaneously with any other transaction that is in fact consummated
pursuant to this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE 2
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and CDN2 subject to such exceptions as are disclosed with
respect to specific sections of this Article 2 in the Disclosure Schedule
delivered herewith and dated as of the date hereof or as are disclosed in
another section of the Disclosure Schedule if it is reasonably apparent on the
face of the disclosure that it is applicable to another section of this Article
2, as follows:

         2.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and has full
corporate power and authority to conduct its business as now conducted and as
currently proposed to be conducted and to own, use, license and lease its Assets
and Properties. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified,
licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership, use, licensing or leasing of its Assets and Properties,
or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such qualification, licensing or
admission necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified, licensed
or admitted and in good standing that could not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Business or Condition of the Company. Section 2.1
of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each of the Company's Subsidiaries, the
jurisdiction in which each was formed and each jurisdiction where each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is so qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and separately lists each other jurisdiction in which the Company or
its Subsidiaries owns, uses, licenses or leases its Assets and Properties, or
conducts business or has employees or engages independent contractors.

         2.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Subject only to the requisite
approval of the Acquisition to be effected by the Plan of Arrangement by the
shareholders of the Company, the holders of Company Options, the holders of
Company Warrants and the Court, the Company has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the performance by the

(as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) of which any of the Company
or any Subsidiary is or ever was a sponsor or participating employer or as to
which the Company or any Subsidiary makes contributions or is required to make
contributions, and (ii) any similar employment, severance or other arrangement
or policy of any of the Company or any Subsidiary (whether written or oral)
providing for health, life, vision or dental insurance coverage (including
self-insured arrangements), workers' compensation, disability benefits,
supplemental unemployment benefits, vacation benefits or retirement benefits,
fringe benefits, or for profit sharing, deferred compensation, bonuses, stock
options, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or
post-retirement insurance, compensation or benefits (collectively, the "Plans").
Except as disclosed on Section 2.13 of the Disclosure Schedule, (i) none of the
Plans is or was a "multi-employer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or
other pension plan subject to Title IV or Part 3 of Title I of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code, (ii) none of the Plans provides or provided post-retirement
medical or health benefits except as required by Law, (iii) none of the Plans is
or was a "welfare benefit fund," as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, or an
organization described in Sections 501(c)(9) or 501(c)(20) of the Code, and (iv)
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has announced or otherwise made any
commitment to create or amend any Plan. Notwithstanding any statement or
indication in this Agreement to the contrary, there are no Plans which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries will not be able to terminate immediately after the
Closing in accordance with their terms. With respect to each Plan, at the
Closing there will be no material unrecorded liabilities with respect to the
establishment, implementation, operation, administration or termination of any
Plan, or the termination of the participation in any Plan by the Company or any
Subsidiary.

              (b) The Company has delivered to Parent true and complete copies
of: (i) each of the Plans and any related funding agreements thereto (including
insurance contracts) including all amendments, all of which are legally valid
and binding and in full force and effect and there are no defaults thereunder,
(ii) the currently effective summary plan description pertaining to each of the
Plans (if any), (iii) the three (3) most recent annual reports for each of the
Plans (including all related schedules), (iv) the most recent Internal Revenue
Service determination letter for each Plan which is intended to constitute a
qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and (v) for each unfunded Plan,
financial statements consisting of (A) the consolidated statement of assets and
liabilities of such Plan






                                      -15-
<PAGE>   20

as of its most recent valuation date, and (B) the statement of changes in fund
balance and in financial position or the statement of changes in net assets
available for benefits under such Plan for the most recently-ended plan year,
which such financial statements shall fairly present the financial condition and
the results of operations of such Plan in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, as of such dates.

              (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any
material liability, tax or penalty whatsoever to any person or agency whomsoever
as a result of engaging in a prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code), and neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has any knowledge of any circumstances which reasonably might
result in any material liability, tax or penalty, including but not limited to,
a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA, as a result of a breach of any duty under
ERISA or under other Laws. Each Plan which is required to comply with the
provisions of Section 4980B of the Code, or with the requirements referred to in
Section 4980D of the Code, has complied in all material respects.

              (d) Each of the Plans which is intended to be a qualified plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service, and has been operated in accordance with its
terms and with the applicable provisions of the Code. Each Plan that is required
or intended to be qualified under applicable law or registered or approved by a
government agency or authority has been so qualified, registered or approved by
the appropriate governmental agency or authority, and nothing has occurred since
the date of the last qualification, registration or approval to cause the
appropriate governmental agency or authority to revoke, or otherwise adversely
affect, such qualification, registration or approval to the knowledge of the
Company. All of the Plans have been administered and maintained in substantial
compliance with their terms and ERISA, the Code and all other Laws, to the
extent applicable. All contributions required to be made to each of the Plans
under the terms of that Plan, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Laws have
been timely made. The Interim Financial Statements properly reflect all amounts
required to be accrued as liabilities to date under each of the Plans. There is
no contract, agreement or benefit arrangement covering any employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary which, individually or collectively, could give rise
to the payment of any amount which would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). Neither the execution or
performance of this Agreement nor the closing of the Acquisition will (i) result
in any obligation or liability (with respect to accrued benefits or otherwise)
of Parent or any Subsidiary to the PBGC, any Plan, or any present or former
employee of Parent or any Subsidiary, (ii) be a trigger event under any Plan
that will result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming
due to any present or former employee, officer, director, shareholder,
contractor, or consultant, or any of their dependents, or (iii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of compensation or other
remuneration (whether payable in cash, securities or other property) due to any
employee, officer, director, shareholder, contractor, or consultant of the
Company or any Subsidiary.

              (e) Other than routine claims for benefits under the Plans, there
are no pending, or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened, Actions or
Proceedings involving the Plans, or the fiduciaries, administrators, or trustees
of any of the Plans or the Company or any Subsidiary as the employer or sponsor
under any Plan, with any of the IRS,







                                      -16-

the Department of Labor, the PBGC, or other governmental authority (whether in
the U.S. or Canada), any participant in or beneficiary of any Plan or any other
person whomsoever. The Company knows of no reasonable basis for any such claim,
lawsuit, dispute, action or controversy.

         2.14 Title to Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to all of their respective properties, interests in properties
and assets, real and personal, reflected in the Company Financials or acquired
after the Financial Statement Date (except properties, interests in properties
and assets sold or otherwise disposed of since the Financial Statement Date in
the ordinary course of business), or with respect to leased properties and
assets, valid leasehold interests in, free and clear of all mortgages, liens,
pledges, charges or encumbrances of any kind or character, except (i) the lien
of current taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) such imperfections of title,
liens and easements as do not and will not materially detract from or interfere
with the use of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise
materially impair business operations involving such properties, (iii) liens
securing debt which is reflected on the Company Financials and (iv) Liens listed
on Section 2.14 of the Disclosure Schedule. The material plants, property and
equipment of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are used in the operations of
their businesses are in good operating condition and repair, subject to normal
wear and tear. All properties used in the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are reflected in the Company Financials to the extent Canadian GAAP
require the same to be reflected.

              (i) Each item of Company Registered Intellectual Property is valid
and subsisting (or in the case of trademark applications, has been applied for),
and all necessary registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and
taxes which are due and owing in connection with such Registered Intellectual
Property have been paid and all necessary documents and certificates in

Property) to the Company and, to the maximum extent provided for by, and in
accordance with, applicable Laws, the Company has recorded each such assignment

              (o) The Company has taken all commercially reasonable actions
necessary and appropriate to assure that all of its products (including products
currently under development) will, without interruption or manual intervention,
continue to consistently, predictably and accurately record, store, process,
calculate and present calendar dates falling on and after (and if applicable,
spans of time including) January 1, 2000, and will consistently, predictably and
accurately calculate any information dependent on or relating to such dates in
the same manner, and with the same functionality, data integrity and
performance, as such products record, store, process, calculate and present
calendar dates on or before December 31, 1999, or calculate any information
dependent on or relating to such dates. The Company has used commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the information technology systems and
non-information technology systems used by Company in its internal operations
will function properly on or after January 1, 2000, which efforts are described
in Section 2.15(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, and the Company has no knowledge
of material issues that have arisen in connection therewith. The Company has
made inquiries to its key third-party vendors and providers as to the status of
their Year 2000 efforts, and as a result of such inquiries has not uncovered any
problems that would adversely affect the operation of the products or that could
materially disrupt or harm the day-to-day functioning of the business or
operations of the Company.

              (p) Neither this Agreement nor any transactions contemplated by

Properties are bound.

material terms thereof, have been made available to Parent prior to the
execution of this Agreement) of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Section
2.16(a)(2) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of each
Contract of the Company and its Subsidiaries not terminable by the Company or

its Subsidiaries without penalty or obligation to make payments based on such
termination.

              (b) Each Contract required to be disclosed in Section 2.16(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule, unless otherwise stated in Section 2.16(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and, to the
knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, no other party to such Contract
is, nor has received notice that it is, in violation or breach of or default
under any such Contract (or with notice or lapse of time or both, would be in
violation or breach of or default under any such Contract).

              (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by any Contract that (i) automatically terminates or allows termination
by the other party thereto upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii)

contains any covenant or other provision which limits the ability of the Company
to compete with any Person in any line of business or in any area or territory.

         2.17 Insurance. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have policies
of insurance and bonds of the type and in amounts customarily carried by Persons
conducting businesses or owning assets similar to those of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. There is no material claim pending under any of such policies or
bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies or bonds. All premiums due and payable under all
such policies and bonds have been paid and the Company and its Subsidiaries are
otherwise in compliance with the terms of such policies and bonds. The Company
has no knowledge of any threatened termination of, or material premium increase
with respect to, any of such policies.

         2.18 Affiliate Transactions.

              (a) Except as disclosed in Section 2.18(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, (i) there are no Contracts or Liabilities between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (I) any current or former officer,

Associate of the Company or (II) any Person who, to the knowledge of the
Company, is an Associate of any such officer, director, shareholder or
Affiliate, on the other hand, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries provides or causes to be provided any assets, services or
facilities to any such current or former officer, director, shareholder,

current or former officer, director, shareholder, Affiliate or Associate.

              (b) Each of the Contracts and Liabilities listed in Section
2.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedule were entered into or incurred, as the case
may be, on terms no less favorable to the Company or its Subsidiaries (in the
reasonable judgment of the Company) than if such Contract or Liability was
entered into or incurred on an arm's- length basis on competitive terms. Any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and in which
any director of the Company has a financial interest in such Contract was
approved in accordance with applicable law.

              (a) There is no existing material dispute or controversy between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of the Company's or such
Subsidiary's employees. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
agreement and there is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceedings
pending with respect to the Company, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, and there are no facts or circumstances known to the Company that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to such complaint or claim. To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no organizational efforts presently underway
or threatened involving any employees of the Company. There has been no work
stoppage, strike or other concerted action by employees of the Company.

function, annual base salary or wage and any incentive, severance or bonus

Company to any officer, director, or employee of, or consultant to, the Company,
and to the knowledge of the Company no employee of the Company has made any
threat, or otherwise revealed an intent, to terminate such employee's

consultant of the Company is obligated under any Contract or other agreement or
subject to any Order or Law that would interfere with the Company's business as
currently conducted. Except under Company Options and the Stock Plan, neither
the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, nor the carrying on of the
Company's business as presently conducted nor any activity of such officers,
employees or consultants in connection with the carrying on of the Company's
business as presently conducted, will conflict with or result in a breach of the
terms, conditions or provisions of, constitute a default under, or trigger a
condition precedent to any rights under any Contract or other agreement under
which any of such officers, employees or consultants is now bound.

licensed or admitted to do business and are in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership, use, licensing or leasing of its Assets and

execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub and CDN2 enforceable against

             (a) any of the actions described in Sections 2.8 (a) through (jj)

will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any of the Company's
officers, directors, shareholders, attorneys, investment advisors, agents,
representatives, Affiliates or Associates from taking any such actions): (a)
solicit, initiate, entertain or encourage any proposals or offers from, or
conduct discussions with or engage in negotiations with, any Person relating to

notify Parent thereof and provide Parent with the details thereof including the
identity of the Person or Persons making such offer or proposal, and will keep

Plan of Arrangement consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company

contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement.







                                      -41-
<PAGE>   46

Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.5, all of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company, Parent, BVI, Acquisition
Sub and CDN2 contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Acquisition to be
effected by the Plan of Arrangement and continue until the earlier of (i) the
first anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the date on which Parent publishes
the combined audited financial statements of the Company and Parent for the
fiscal year which includes the Closing Date (the earlier to occur of (i) and
(ii) is referred to herein as the "Expiration Date").

         7.2 Escrow Provisions.

             (a) Establishment of the Escrow Fund. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any shareholder, will
be deposited with the Depositary Agent, such deposit to constitute an escrow
fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein. The
portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each shareholder of the
Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares
which such holder would otherwise be entitled under the Plan of Arrangement.

             (b) Recourse to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be available
to compensate Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub and CDN2, and their respective

all Losses (whether or not involving a Third Party Claim), incurred or sustained
by Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub or CDN2, their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, Affiliates or Associates, directly or indirectly, as a result
of any inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company contained herein or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement. No claim may be made by Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub
or CDN2 against the Escrow Fund unless and until the aggregate of all such
Losses exceeds $250,000. Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub, CDN2 and the Company each
acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved contingencies
existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at the Effective Time would
have led to a reduction in the aggregate Plan of Arrangement consideration to be
paid to the shareholders of the Company. Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub and CDN2,
on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, Affiliates and Associates acknowledge that (i) they will have
no recourse or claim (absent fraud) in connection with any inaccuracy or breach
of representations or covenants relating to the ability of Parent to account for
the Acquisition as a Pooling of Interests if Parent waives the condition set
forth in Section 6.3(c) in order to consummate the Acquisition and (ii) their
rights and remedies for Losses incurred by Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub and
CDN2, their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and
Associates are limited to claims against the Escrow Fund and, in the absence of
fraud, have no other recourse or rights of indemnity or other compensation of
any sort whatsoever against the Company, its shareholders or any other Person.

             (c) Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon Termination of
Escrow Period. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be
in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Expiration Date (the period of time from the
Effective Time through and including the Expiration Date is referred to herein
as the "Escrow Period"); and all shares of







                                      -42-
<PAGE>   47

Parent Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed as set
forth in the last sentence of this Section 7.2(c); provided, however, that the
Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount (or some portion
thereof) that is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent, subject to the
objection of the Shareholder Agent and the subsequent arbitration of the matter
in the manner as provided in Section 7.2(g) hereof, to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims under this Section 7.2 concerning facts and circumstances existing prior
to the termination of such Escrow Period which claims are specified in any
Officer's Certificate delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to termination of
such Escrow Period. As soon as all such claims, if any, have been resolved, the
Depositary Agent shall deliver to the shareholders of the Company the remaining
portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of
shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares remaining in the Escrow
Fund to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) shall be
made ratably in proportion to their respective contributions to the Escrow Fund
and Parent shall use all its commercially reasonable efforts to have such shares
delivered within five (5) Business Days of such resolution.

             (d) Protection of Escrow Fund.

                 (i) The Depositary Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow
Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in trust
for the shareholders of the Company subject to and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent and shall hold and dispose
of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof.

                 (ii) Any Exchangeable Share, shares of Parent Common Stock or
other Equity Equivalents securities issued or distributed by Acquisition Sub or
Parent (the "New Shares") in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock and
Exchangeable Shares in the Escrow Fund which have not been released from the
Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund. New Shares issued in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares which have been released
from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be
distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on shares of Parent
Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but
shall be distributed to the record holders of Parent Common Stock and
Exchangeable Shares on the record date set for any such dividend.

                 (iii) Each shareholder shall have voting rights with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares contributed to the
Escrow Fund by such shareholder (and on any voting securities added to the
Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable
Shares).

             (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

                 (i) Upon receipt by the Depositary Agent at any time on or
before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer
of Parent (an "Officer's Certificate"): (A) stating that Parent has paid or
properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue
Losses, directly or indirectly, as a result of any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained herein
or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and







                                      -43-
<PAGE>   48

(B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in
the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or
the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, agreement or covenant to which such item
is related, the Depositary Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section
7.2(f) hereof, deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as
practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund in an amount
equal to such Losses.

                 (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares to be delivered to Parent out of the
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(i), the Parent Common Stock and
Exchangeable Shares shall be valued at the Closing Price.

             (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer's
Certificate to the Depositary Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall
be delivered to the Shareholder Agent and for a period of thirty (30) days after
such delivery, the Depositary Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any
Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 7.2(e) hereof unless the Depositary Agent
shall have received written authorization from the Shareholder Agent to make
such delivery. After the expiration of such 30 day period, the Depositary Agent
shall make delivery of Exchangeable Shares from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with Section 7.2(e) hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery may be
made if the Shareholder Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim
made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered
to the Depositary Agent prior to the expiration of such 30 day period.

             (g) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

                 (i) In case the Shareholder Agent shall object in writing to
any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the Shareholder Agent and
Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholder Agent and Parent
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Depositary Agent. The
Depositary Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute
shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof.

                 (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Parent or the Shareholder Agent may demand arbitration of
the dispute unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in a pending
Action or Proceeding involving a Third Party Claim, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration. In either event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by 1 arbitrator agreed upon by Parent and the Shareholder Agent, or if
no such arbitrator is agreed upon within 10 days, then by 3 arbitrators, 1
selected by Parent and 1 selected by the Shareholder Agent, and the 2
arbitrators selected by Parent and the Shareholder Agent shall select a third
arbitrator. The arbitrator(s) shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery of information
relating to any dispute while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate as
determined in the sole judgment of the arbitrator(s), to discover relevant







                                      -44-
<PAGE>   49

information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.
The arbitrator(s) shall rule upon motions to compel, limit or allow discovery as
they shall deem appropriate given the nature and extent of the disputed claim.
The arbitrator(s) shall also have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys' fees and other costs incurred by the parties, to the same extent as a
court of law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was
sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or
objected to by a party without substantial justification. The decision of the
arbitrator or a majority of the 3 arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the
validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything
in Section 7.2(f) hereof, the Depositary Agent shall be entitled to act in
accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow
Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions regarding the dispute
which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the
arbitrator(s).

                 (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may
be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration
shall be held in the city and county of [Seattle] under the commercial rules of
arbitration then in effect of the [American Arbitration Association]. For
purposes of this Section 7.2(g), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim
or the amount thereof stated in the Officer's Certificate is at issue, Parent
shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party in the event that the arbitrators
award Parent less than the sum of one-half (1/2) of the disputed amount of any
Losses plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the shareholders of the
Company as represented by the Shareholder Agent shall be deemed to be the
Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its
own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the
arbitration and the expenses, including without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration.

             (h) Shareholder Agent of the Shareholders; Power of Attorney.

                 (i) In the event that the Plan of Arrangement is approved by
the shareholders of the Company, effective upon such vote, and without further
act of any shareholder, Morgan Sturdy shall be appointed as agent and
attorney-in-fact (the "Shareholder Agent") for each shareholder of the Company
(except such shareholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal or
dissenters' rights under the BC Company Act), for and on behalf of shareholders
of the Company, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
delivery to Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares from
the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such
deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Agent for the accomplishment of
the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the shareholders of the Company
from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Parent;
provided, however, that the Shareholder Agent may not be removed unless holders
of a two-thirds interest in the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the
identity of the substituted shareholder agent. Any vacancy in the position of
Shareholder Agent may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Agent,
and the Shareholder Agent shall not






                                      -45-
<PAGE>   50

receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the shareholders of
the Company.

                 (ii) The Shareholder Agent shall not be liable for any act done
or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Agent while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment.

             (i) Actions of the Shareholder Agent. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the
shareholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them
are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such shareholders, and the Depositary Agent and Parent may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of every such shareholder of the Company.
The Depositary Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Shareholder Agent.

             (j) Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a
third-party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably expects may
result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall notify the Shareholder
Agent of such claim, and the Shareholder Agent, as representative for the
shareholders of the Company, shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate
in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion
to settle any Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if Parent settles any
Third Party Claim without the Shareholder Agent's consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Parent may not make a claim against
the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by Parent in such
settlement. In the event that the Shareholder Agent has consented to any such
settlement, the Shareholder Agent shall have no power or authority to object
under any provision of this Article 7 to the amount of any claim by Parent
against the Escrow Fund for the amount of Losses incurred by Parent in such
settlement.

             (k) Depositary Agent's Duties.

                 (i) The Depositary Agent shall be obligated only for the
performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set
forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Depositary Agent
may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of
Parent and the Shareholder Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying
or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The
Depositary Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as
Depositary Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith.

                 (ii) The Depositary Agent is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey Orders of any court of law or Governmental or Regulatory
Authority, notwithstanding any notices, warnings or other communications from
any party or any other







                                      -46-
<PAGE>   51

person to the contrary. In case the Depositary Agent obeys or complies with any
such Order, the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any
such Order being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated
or found to have been entered without jurisdiction or proper authority.

                 (iii) The Depositary Agent shall not be liable in any respect
on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or
delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents
or papers deposited or called for hereunder.

                 (iv) The Depositary Agent shall not be liable for the
expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this
Agreement or any documents deposited with the Depositary Agent.

                 (v) In performing any duties under the Agreement, the
Depositary Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or
expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent shall not incur any such liability for
(A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action
taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written
statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Depositary Agent
shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Depositary Agent be
liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations or determining the
scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Depositary Agent may
consult with legal counsel in connection with the Depositary Agent's duties
under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The
Depositary Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority
of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this
Agreement.

                 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this
Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this
Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Depositary Agent will not be required to
determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Depositary
Agent may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable
Shares and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate
legal proceedings or other means as, in the Depositary Agent's discretion, the
Depositary Agent may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement. In such event, the Depositary Agent will not be liable for any
damages. Furthermore, the Depositary Agent may at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights
among themselves. The Depositary Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk
of the court all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable
Shares held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable
attorney fees incurred by the Depositary Agent due to the interpleader action
and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such
action, the Depositary Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

                 (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns
agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold the Depositary Agent harmless
against any and







                                      -47-
<PAGE>   52

all Losses incurred by the Depositary Agent in connection with the performance
of the Depositary Agent's duties under this Agreement, including but not limited
to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter.

                 (viii) The Depositary Agent may resign at any time upon giving
at least 30 days written notice to the parties; provided, however, that no such
resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor
depositary agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on a successor
depositary agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the
parties fail to agree upon a successor depositary agent within such time, the
Depositary Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor depositary agent
authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor depositary
agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it
shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, and duties of the predecessor depositary agent as if originally named as
depositary agent. The Depositary Agent shall be discharged from any further
duties and liability under this Agreement.

             (l) Fees. All fees of the Depositary Agent for performance of its
duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the fee schedule
attached as Exhibit I. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are
not promptly fulfilled, or if the Depositary Agent renders any service not
provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial
modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the Depositary
Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any Action or Proceeding pertaining
to this escrow or its subject matter, the Depositary Agent shall be reasonably
compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs,
attorney's fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or
Action or Proceeding. Parent agrees to pay these sums upon demand.

before such date; provided further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this clause 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to the Company until after

             (c) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any Law or
Order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Acquisition to

such breach within fifteen (15) days following receipt by the Company of written
notice of such breach or is not using its reasonable efforts to cure such breach

period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured), and
(ii) as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
6.2(b), as the case may be, would not then be satisfied;

             (f) by Parent, if the Acquisition to be effected by the Plan of
Arrangement shall not have been approved at the Company Shareholders Meeting by
the requisite votes of the Company's shareholders in accordance with the BC
Company Act; or

             (g) without the action of any party hereto, if, at or prior to

Parent, BVI, Acquisition Sub and CDN2 has not approved the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of a valid termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Company, or their respective officers, directors or shareholders or
Affiliates or Associates; provided, however, that each party shall remain liable
for any breaches of this Agreement prior to its termination; and provided
further that, the provisions of Sections 5.4, 5.5, 8.2, 9.6, 9.9, 9.10







                                      -49-

party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
