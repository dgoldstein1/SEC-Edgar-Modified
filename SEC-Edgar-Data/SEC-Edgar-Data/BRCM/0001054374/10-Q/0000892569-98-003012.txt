                NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

        The condensed financial statements included herein are unaudited;
however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments which, in
the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial
position of Broadcom Corporation (the "Company") at September 30, 1998 and the
results of its operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
1998 and 1997. It should be understood that accounting measurements at interim
dates inherently involve greater reliance on estimates than at year-end. The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1998 are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

        The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not include
footnotes and certain financial presentations normally required under generally
accepted accounting principles. Therefore, these financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for
the year ended December 31, 1997, included in the Company's Final Prospectus
dated October 20, 1998 (the "Final Prospectus"), filed as part of a Registration
Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Reg. No. 333-65117).

3. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

     Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS
130"), which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive
income and its components in the financial statements. For the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, the Company did not have any
components of comprehensive income as defined in SFAS 130.

4. INVESTMENTS

     The Company accounts for its investments in debt securities pursuant to
SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities." Management determines the appropriate classification of such
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of
each balance sheet date. At September 30, 1998, all of the Company's investments
were in state, municipal, county and United States government agency bonds, and
were classified as held-to-maturity. Debt securities are classified as
held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold
the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are stated at cost,
adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity. A summary of
held-to-maturity securities by balance sheet caption at September 30, 1998, is
as follows:

7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Stock Option Plan

     The 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1998 Plan") was adopted on February 3,
1998 to serve as the successor equity incentive program to the Company's Amended
and Restated 1994 Stock Option Plan (the "1994 Plan"). On April 8, 1998, the
1998 Plan effective date, outstanding options under the 1994 Plan and under the
1998 Special Stock Option Plan (the "Special Plan") (a plan adopted to permit
options to be granted with certain terms permitted by the 1998 Plan prior to the
1998 Plan becoming effective) were incorporated into the 1998 Plan, and no
further option grants will be made under the 1994 Plan or the Special Plan. A
total of 15,948,439 shares of Common Stock have been authorized for issuance
under the 1998 Plan (including shares reserved for issuance for options
outstanding under the 1994 Plan and Special Plan). As of September 30, 1998,
options to purchase an aggregate of 7,778,024 shares of Class B Common Stock
were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price per share of $5.25 and
options to purchase an aggregate of 920,050 shares of Class A Common Stock were
outstanding at a weighted average exercise price per share of $37.03.

1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     The 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") was adopted on
February 3, 1998 and became effective on April 16, 1998. The Purchase Plan
allows eligible employees to designate up to 15% of their total compensation to
purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, at semi-annual intervals,
at 85% of fair market value (determined as provided in the Purchase Plan). The
Company has reserved 750,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for issuance under
the Purchase Plan.

Initial Public Offering

     In April 1998, the Company completed its initial public offering (the
"Offering") of 4,025,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock. Of these shares,
the Company sold 3,120,000 shares (including 355,000 shares issued in connection
with the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option), and selling
shareholders sold 905,000 shares (including 170,000 shares in connection with
the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option), at a price of $24 per
share. In addition, the Company sold 500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to
Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco Systems") in a concurrent registered offering that
was not underwritten, at a price of $22.32 per share. The Company received
aggregate net proceeds from the Offering and the sale of shares to Cisco Systems
of approximately $79.2 million in cash (net of underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering costs). Upon consummation of the Offering,
all outstanding shares of the Company's Convertible Preferred Stock were
automatically converted into an aggregate of 8,453,517 shares of Class B Common
Stock.

Follow-on Public Offering

     In October 1998, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of
3,450,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock. Of these shares, the Company sold
470,000 shares (including 77,500 shares in connection with the exercise of the
underwriters' over-allotment option), and selling shareholders sold 2,980,000
shares (including 372,500 shares in connection with the exercise of the
underwriters' over-allotment option), at a price of $69 per share. The Company
received net aggregate proceeds of approximately $30.6 million after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs. The net
proceeds from the follow-on public offering have not been included in the
accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 1998.

Stock Split

     On March 9, 1998, prior to the Offering, the Company effected a 3-for-2
stock split of the Company's Class B Common Stock. All share and per share
amounts in the accompanying financial statements have been retroactively
restated to reflect this change in the Company's capital structure.

8. LITIGATION

     In December 1996, Stanford Telecommunications, Inc. ("STI") filed an action
against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. STI alleges that the Company's BCM3036, BCM3037,
BCM3300, BCM93220 and BCM93220B products infringe one of STI's patents (the "
'352 Patent"). STI is seeking an injunction as well as the recovery of monetary
damages, including treble damages for willful infringement. The Company has
filed an answer and affirmative defenses to STI's complaint, denying the
allegations in STI's complaint, and has asserted a counterclaim requesting
declaratory relief that the Company is not infringing the '352 Patent and that
the '352 Patent is invalid and unenforceable. The Company believes that it has
strong defenses to STI's claims on invalidity, noninfringement and inequitable
conduct grounds. The Company and STI are currently conducting discovery in this
case. On June 10, 1998 and July 21, 1998, the Court


                                       7


<PAGE>   10

issued orders interpreting the claims of the '352 patent. The Court has
scheduled trial for May 1999. Although the Company believes that it has strong
defenses, a finding of infringement by the Company in this action could lead to
liability for monetary damages (which could be trebled in the event that the
infringement were found to have been willful), the issuance of an injunction
requiring that the Company withdraw various products from the market,
substantial product redesign expenses (assuming that a non-infringing design is
feasible and economic) and associated time-to-market delays, and indemnification
claims by the Company's customers or strategic partners, each of which events
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
condition and results of operations.

     In April 1997, Sarnoff Corporation and Sarnoff Digital Communications, Inc.
(collectively, "Sarnoff") filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior Court against
the Company and five former Sarnoff employees now employed by the Company (the
"Former Employees") asserting claims against the Former Employees for breach of
contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of the covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and against the Company for inducing such actions. Those
claims relate to the alleged disclosure of certain technology of Sarnoff to the
Company. The complaint also asserts claims against the Company and the Former
Employees for unfair competition, misappropriation and misuse of trade secrets
and confidential, proprietary information of Sarnoff, and tortious interference
with present and prospective economic advantage, as well as a claim against the
Company alleging that it "illegally pirated" Sarnoff's employees. The complaint
seeks to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Company and the Former
Employees from utilizing any alleged Sarnoff trade secrets, and to restrain the
Former Employees from violating their alleged statutory and contractual duties
of confidentiality to Sarnoff by, for example, precluding them from working for
six months in any capacity relating to certain of the Company's programs. The
Company has asserted and believes that Sarnoff's claims are without merit. The
Company has filed an answer and is vigorously defending itself in this action.
In May 1997, the New Jersey court denied Sarnoff's request for a temporary
restraining order. In June 1998, the New Jersey court denied the Company's
motion for summary judgment. Sarnoff has clarified its claims to some extent by
specifying in greater detail the trade secrets that it alleges the Company and
the Former Employees misappropriated. The discovery period has been closed,
subject to the completion by the parties of certain additional discovery no
later than November 27, 1998. The Company has filed new motions for summary
judgment based on recent admissions and other events. The Company's renewed
motions for summary judgment are expected to be heard in December 1998 or
January 1999, with trial expected to commence on or before February 16, 1999.

     In July 1997, the Company commenced an action against Sarnoff in the
California Superior Court alleging breach of contract, fraud, misappropriation
of trade secrets, false advertising, trade libel, intentional interference with
prospective economic advantage and unfair competition. The claims center on
Sarnoff's violation of a non-disclosure agreement entered into with the Company
with respect to limited use of certain of the Company's technology and on
inaccurate comparisons that the Company believes Sarnoff has made in its product
advertising and in statements to potential customers and others. This action was
removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, and was stayed pending resolution of the New Jersey action described
in the preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding that the California action is
currently stayed, the Company believes that it involves facts, circumstances and
claims unrelated to those at issue in the New Jersey action, and the Company
intends to vigorously prosecute the California action against Sarnoff.

<PAGE>   11

     In March 1998, Scott O. Davis, the Company's former Chief Financial
Officer, filed a complaint in California Superior Court against the Company and
its Chief Executive Officer, Henry T. Nicholas, III, alleging claims for fraud
and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, constructive fraud, conversion, breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief. These claims relate to Mr.
Davis' alleged ownership of 26,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock originally
purchased by Mr. Davis in March 1996 (which shares would have converted into
78,000 shares of Class B Common Stock upon consummation of the initial public
offering). The purchase agreement between the Company and Mr. Davis contained a
provision permitting the Company to repurchase all 26,000 shares of Series D
Preferred Stock at the original price paid per share in the event that Mr. Davis
did not continue to be employed by the Company for a certain period of time.
After Mr. Davis resigned from the Company in June 1997, the Company exercised
its repurchase right. Mr. Davis' complaint alleges that the repurchase right
should not be enforceable under several legal theories and seeks unspecified
damages and declaratory relief. If Mr. Davis is successful in his claim, he may
be entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock described above and
may be entitled to certain other rights as a holder of Series D Preferred Stock,
including without limitation the right to acquire certain shares of the
Company's Series E Preferred Stock (or the shares of Class B Common Stock into
which such shares of Series E Preferred Stock would have converted upon
consummation of the initial public offering). In the alternative, Mr. Davis may
be entitled to unspecified damages and punitive damages should he prevail. This
case is currently in discovery. In April 1998, the Company filed an answer and
affirmative defenses to Mr. Davis' complaint, denying the allegations in Mr.
Davis' complaint. The Company has also asserted counterclaims against Mr. Davis
for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and is seeking to recover compensatory
and punitive damages, in addition to other relief.

     The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.

     The cases involving intellectual property rights involve complex questions
of fact and law and could require the expenditure of significant costs and
diversion of resources to defend. Although management believes the outcome of
the Company's outstanding legal proceedings, claims and litigation will not have
a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or liquidity, the results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and
such outcome is at least reasonably possible. The Company is unable to make an
estimate of the range of possible loss from outstanding litigation, and no
amounts have been provided for such matters in the accompanying financial 
statements.

OVERVIEW

     The Company is a leading developer of highly integrated silicon solutions
that enable broadband digital data transmission to the home and within the
business enterprise. The Company's products enable the high-speed transmission
of data over existing communications infrastructures, most of which were not
originally intended for digital data transmission. Using proprietary
technologies and advanced design methodologies, the Company has designed and
developed integrated circuits ("ICs") for some of the most significant broadband
communications markets including cable set-top boxes, cable modems, high-speed
networking, DBS (direct broadcast satellite) and terrestrial digital broadcast,
and xDSL (digital subscriber line). From the Company's inception in 1991 through
1994, it was primarily engaged in product development and the establishment of
strategic customer and foundry relationships. During that period, the Company
generated the majority of its total revenue from development work performed for
key customers. The Company began shipping its products in 1994, and subsequently
the Company's total revenue has grown


                                       10


<PAGE>   13

predominately through sales of its semiconductor products. The Company intends
to continue to enter into development contracts with key customers, but expects
that development revenue will constitute a decreasing percentage of its total
revenue. In any given quarter, development revenue may vary significantly due to
the number of outstanding contracts and the timing of contract milestones. The
Company generates a small percentage of its product revenue from sales of its
system level reference designs. 

     For a further overview of the Company's accounting policies and significant
factors affecting the Company's business and operations, please refer to the
additional disclosures made in the Company's Final Prospectus.

</TABLE>

     TOTAL REVENUE. Total revenue consists of product revenue generated
principally by sales of the Company's semiconductor products and development
revenue generated under development contracts with the Company's customers.
Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 1998 was $52.5 million,
an increase of $43.2 million or 467% from total revenue of $9.3 million in the
three months ended September 30, 1997. Total revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 1998 was $133.0 million, an increase of $113.3 million or 576%
from total revenue of $19.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 1997.
The increase in total revenue was derived mainly from an increase in volume
shipments of ICs for digital cable set-top boxes, high-speed networking and, to
a lesser extent, for the cable modem market.

     GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit represents total revenue less the cost of
revenue. Cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon
wafers processed by independent foundries, and costs associated with assembly,
test and quality assurance for those products,


                                       11

<PAGE>   14

as well as costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing
support and contracted development work. Gross profit for the three months ended
September 30, 1998 was $28.8 million or 54.9% of total revenue, an increase of
$23.6 million as compared with gross profit of $5.2 million or 56.3% of total
revenue in the three months ended September 30, 1997. Gross profit for the nine
months ended September 30, 1998 was $75.1 million or 56.5% of total revenue, an
increase of $64.3 million as compared with gross profit of $10.8 million or
55.0% of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 1997. The increase
in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in the
volume of product shipments. It is expected that gross profit as a percentage of
total revenue will decline in future periods as volume-pricing agreements and
competitive pricing strategies continue to take effect. In addition, the
Company's gross margin may be affected by the introduction in the future of
certain lower margin products.

     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. Research and development expense consists
primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research, design
and development activities, as well as related subcontracting costs. Research
and development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1998
was $10.9 million and $25.5 million or 20.7% and 19.2% of total revenue,
respectively, an increase of $5.4 million and $13.8 million as compared with
research and development expense of $5.5 million and $11.7 million or 59.5% of
total revenue for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 1997,
respectively. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the addition
of personnel for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing
products. The decline in research and development expense as a percentage of
total revenue reflected a significant increase in total revenue during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 1998. The Company expects that research and
development expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase for the
foreseeable future.

     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. Selling, general and
administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expenses,
professional fees, trade show expenses and facilities expenses. Selling, general
and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 1998 was
$6.5 million or 12.3% of total revenue, an increase of $3.8 million as compared
with $2.7 million or 28.8% of total revenue for the three months ended September
30, 1997. Selling, general and administrative expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 1998 was $15.8 million or 11.9% of total revenue, an increase of
$10.6 million as compared with $5.2 million or 26.4% of total revenue for the
nine months ended September 30, 1997. The increase in absolute dollars reflected
higher personnel related costs resulting from the hiring of sales and marketing
personnel, senior management and administrative personnel, and increased
occupancy, legal and other professional fees, including increased expenses for
litigation. The decline in selling, general and administrative expense as a
percentage of total revenue reflected a significant increase in total revenue
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 1998. The Company expects
that selling, general and administrative expense in absolute dollars will
continue to increase in the near term to support the planned expansion of the
Company's operations.

     DEFERRED COMPENSATION. In the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the
Company recorded approximately $5.4 million of net deferred compensation in
connection with the grant of employee stock options to purchase an aggregate of
1,298,050 shares of Class B Common Stock in late March 1998 (in addition to
approximately $1.1 million of deferred


                                       12


<PAGE>   15

compensation recorded in 1997). The deferred compensation represents the
difference between the deemed value of the Class B Common Stock for accounting
purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant.
Such amount has been presented as a reduction of shareholders' equity and is
being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options. The
Company amortized an aggregate of $406,000 and $909,000 of deferred compensation
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 1998, respectively. The
remaining balance of total deferred compensation will be amortized at a rate of
approximately $406,000 (pre-tax) per quarter through September 2001 and
approximately $338,000 (pre-tax) for the quarters ending December 31, 2001 and
March 31, 2002.

     INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. Interest and other income
(expense), net reflects interest earned on average cash and cash equivalents and
investment balances, less interest on the Company's long-term debt and capital
lease obligations. Interest and other income, net for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 1998 was $1.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively,
compared to interest and other expense, net of $41,000 in the three months ended
September 30, 1997 and interest and other income, net of $22,000 in the nine
months ended September 30, 1997. The increases were principally due to increased
cash balances available to invest resulting from consummation of the Company's
Offering and sale of shares to Cisco Systems in April 1998.

     PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES. The Company accrues a provision for
federal and state income tax at applicable statutory rates. The Company's
effective tax rates were approximately 35% and 40% for the nine months ended
September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The difference between the Company's
effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rate of 34% was primarily
related to the effect of state income taxes and research and development tax
credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Since its inception, the Company has financed its operations through a
combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations. At
September 30, 1998, the Company had $71.8 million in working capital and $57.7
million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, compared to $26.3
million in working capital and $22.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at
December 31, 1997. In addition, at September 30, 1998, the Company had long-term
investments of $43.2 million; at December 31, 1997, the Company had no long-term
investments. At October 31, 1998, the Company had $89.9 million in cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments and $43.0 million in long-term
investments. The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and investments from
September 1998 was primarily due to the net proceeds from the Company's
follow-on public offering in October 1998.

     The Company's operating activities provided cash of $22.9 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 1998, primarily as a result of net income and a
growth in accounts payable, partially offset by increases in accounts
receivable, inventory and other assets. In the nine months ended September 30,
1997, cash used in operating activities was $4.5 million, primarily as a result
of a net loss.


                                       13


<PAGE>   16

     In the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the Company's investing
activities used cash in the amount of $58.1 million for the purchase of
held-to-maturity investments and $21.4 million for the purchase of capital
equipment to support its expanding operations. In the nine months ended
September 30, 1997, the Company's investing activities used $4.0 million for the
purchase of capital equipment. At September 30, 1998, the Company had
outstanding purchase commitments for capital equipment of approximately $4.2
million.

     Cash provided by financing activities was $77.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1998, primarily from aggregate net proceeds of $79.2 million
from the Company's Offering and sale of shares to Cisco Systems in April 1998,
partially offset by the repayment of $2.5 million outstanding under a bank term
loan. In the nine months ended September 30, 1997, cash provided by financing
activities was $26.1 million, primarily from $22.7 million in net proceeds from
the issuance of preferred stock and $3.0 million in proceeds from a bank term
loan.

     In October 1998, the Company completed an underwritten follow-on public
offering. Of the 3,450,000 shares of Class A Common Stock offered, the Company
sold 470,000 shares and selling shareholders sold 2,980,000 shares, at a price
of $69 per share. The Company received net aggregate proceeds from the follow-on
offering of approximately $30.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering costs.

     The Company believes that the aggregate net proceeds from the follow-on
public offering, its initial public offering and sale of shares to Cisco Systems
in April 1998, together with cash generated from its operations, will be
sufficient to meet the Company's capital requirements for at least the next
twelve months. Nonetheless, the Company may elect to sell additional equity
securities or to obtain credit facilities. The Company's future capital
requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many
factors, including, but not limited to, the levels at which the Company
maintains inventory and accounts receivable; the market acceptance of the
Company's products; the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch
such products and attain a competitive position in the marketplace; volume
pricing concessions; the Company's business, product, capital expenditure and
research and development plans and technology roadmap; capital improvements to
new and existing facilities; technological advances; the response of competitors
to the Company's products; and the Company's relationships with suppliers and
customers. In addition, the Company may require an increase in the level of
working capital to accommodate planned growth, hiring, infrastructure and
facility needs, including the Company's recently executed lease of new
facilities to centralize all Irvine employees and operations on one campus.
Additional capital may be required for consummation of any acquisitions of
businesses, products or technologies. To the extent that the funds generated by
the follow-on offering, the Company's initial public offering and sale of shares
to Cisco Systems, together with existing resources and cash generated from
operations, are insufficient to fund the Company's future activities, the
Company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings
or borrowings. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be
available or that, if available, such financing can be obtained on terms
favorable to the Company and its shareholders.

YEAR 2000

     The Company is aware of problems associated with computer systems as the
year 2000 approaches. Many existing computer systems and applications, and other
control devices use only two digits to identify a year in the date field,
without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century. Others do
not correctly process "leap year" dates. As a result, such systems and
applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that
they can correctly process data related to the year 2000 and beyond. These
problems are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year 2000
approaches, and are commonly referred to as the "Year 2000 Problem."

     The Company is continuing to assess the impact that the Year 2000 Problem
may have on its operations and has identified the following four key areas of
its business that may be affected:

     PRODUCTS. The Company has evaluated each of its products and believes that
each is substantially year 2000 compliant. However, the Company believes that it
is not possible to determine whether all of its customers' products into which
the Company's products are incorporated will be year 2000 compliant because the
Company has little or no control over the design, production and testing of its
customers' products.

     INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE. The Year 2000 Problem could affect the systems,
transaction processing computer applications and devices used by the Company to
operate and monitor all major aspects of its business, including financial
systems (such as general ledger, accounts payable and payroll), customer
services, infrastructure, master production scheduling, materials requirement
planning, networks and telecommunications systems. The Company believes that it
has identified substantially all of the major systems, software applications and
related equipment used in connection with its internal operations that must be
modified or upgraded in order to minimize the possibility of a material
disruption to its business. The Company is currently in the process of modifying
and upgrading all affected systems and expects to complete this process by early
1999. Because most of the software applications used by the Company are recent
versions of vendor supported, commercially available products, the Company has
not incurred, and does not expect in the future to incur, significant costs to
upgrade these applications as year 2000 compliant versions are released by the
respective vendors.

     THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS. The Company relies, directly and indirectly, on
external systems utilized by its suppliers for the management and control of
fabrication, assembly and testing of substantially all of the Company's
products. The Company has sent questionnaires to the two independent foundries,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation ("TSMC") and Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing ("Chartered"), that fabricate substantially all of
its semiconductor devices, and to the two subcontractors, ASAT Ltd. ("ASAT") and
ST Assembly Test Services ("STATS"), that assemble and test substantially all of
its products to identify and, to the extent possible, resolve issues involving
the Year 2000 Problem. In addition, certain of the Company's key employees have
scheduled on-site visits at the facilities of each of these suppliers in late
1998 to evaluate the systems and remediation efforts employed by each of them.
The Company expects to resolve any significant Year 2000 Problems with its
suppliers; however, there can be no assurance that these suppliers will resolve
any or all Year 2000 Problems with their systems in a timely manner. Any failure
of these third parties to resolve their Year 2000 Problems in a timely manner
could result in the material disruption to the business of the Company. Any such
disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition or results of operations.


                                       15


<PAGE>   18

     FACILITY AND LABORATORY RELATED SYSTEMS. Systems such as heating,
sprinklers, elevators, test equipment and security systems at the Company's
facilities and labs may also be affected by the Year 2000 Problem. The Company
is currently assessing the potential effect of and costs of remediating the Year
2000 Problem on its facility and lab related systems. The Company estimates that
the total cost to the Company of completing any required modifications, upgrades
or replacements of these systems will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.

     The Company presently estimates that the total cost of addressing its year
2000 issues will be approximately $500,000. This estimate was derived utilizing
numerous assumptions, including the assumption that the Company has already
identified its most significant year 2000 issues and that the plans of its third
party suppliers will be fulfilled in a timely manner without cost to the
Company. However, there can be no guarantee that these assumptions are accurate,
and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.

     The Company is currently developing contingency plans to address the year
2000 issues that may pose a significant risk to its on-going operations. Such
plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software,
temporary use of back-up equipment or software or the implementation of manual
procedures to compensate for system deficiencies. However, there can be no
assurance that any contingency plans implemented by the Company would be
adequate to meet the Company's needs without materially impacting its
operations, that any such plan would be successful or that the Company's results
of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by the delays and
inefficiencies inherent in conducting operations in an alternative manner.

RISK FACTORS

     In future periods the Company's business, financial condition and results
of operations may be affected in a material and adverse manner by many factors,
including, but not limited to, the following:

     FLUCTUATIONS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The Company's quarterly results of
operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to
fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, many of which are not in
the Company's control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the volume
of product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales; the timing,
rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders; the gain or loss of
a significant customer; the timing of customer qualification and industry
interoperability certification of new products and the risk of non-qualification
or non-certification; the rate of adoption by customers and end users of new and
emerging technologies in the high-speed data networking, cable set-top box,
cable modem, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") and terrestrial digital
broadcast, and digital subscriber line ("xDSL") markets; the rate of adoption
and acceptance of new industry standards in the foregoing markets; the Company's
ability to specify, develop, introduce and market new products and technologies
on a timely basis; the qualification, availability and pricing of competing
products and technologies from other vendors; fluctuations in manufacturing
yields and other problems or delays in the fabrication, assembly, testing or
delivery of products; uncertainties associated with international operations;
the Company's ability to retain and hire key executives, technical personnel and


                                       16

<PAGE>   19

other employees in the numbers, with the capabilities and at the compensation
levels needed to implement its business and product plans; problems or delays in
migrating product designs to smaller geometry processes and achieving higher
levels of design integration; intellectual property disputes; changes in product
and customer mix; the amount and timing of recognition of development revenue;
general business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband
communications markets; availability of foundry capacity and raw materials; the
quality of the Company's products; the timing of investments in, and the results
of, research and development; the Company's ability to expand and implement its
sales and marketing programs; the level of orders received that can be shipped
in a quarter; the effects on operations and management of facility relocations;
currency fluctuations; and general economic conditions. The Company intends to
continue to increase its operating expenses in 1998 and 1999. Because a large
portion of the Company's operating expense, including rent, salaries and capital
lease expenses, is fixed and difficult to reduce or modify, if total revenue
does not meet the Company's expectations, the effect of any revenue shortfall
will be magnified by the fixed nature of these operating expenses. Based on the
foregoing or other factors, it is possible that in some future periods the
Company's reported or anticipated operating results will fail to meet or exceed
the expectations of analysts or investors. In such event, the price of the
Company's Class A Common Stock would likely be materially and adversely
affected.

     CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION. A relatively small number of customers have
accounted for a significant portion of the Company's total revenue to date, and
the Company expects that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. In
particular, sales to General Instrument and 3Com (including sales to their
respective manufacturing subcontractors) accounted for approximately 33.6% and
25.9%, respectively, of total revenue in the three months ended September 30,
1998 and 32.6% and 32.0%, respectively, of total revenue in the nine months
ended September 30, 1998. In 1997, sales to General Instrument and 3Com
accounted for 31.9% and 14.6%, respectively, of total revenue. Moreover, sales
to the Company's five largest customers (including sales to their respective
manufacturing subcontractors) represented approximately 73.4% and 76.1% of the
Company's total revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 1998,
respectively, and 61.7% of total revenue in fiscal 1997. Accordingly, the
Company's future results of operations will continue to be substantially
dependent on the success of its largest customers and on the Company's success
in selling its existing and future products to those customers in significant
quantities. Any reduction or delay in sales of the Company's products to one or
more of these key customers could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be
no assurance that the Company will retain its largest customers or that it will
be able to obtain additional key customers. The loss of one or more of the
Company's largest customers or the inability of the Company to successfully
develop relationships with additional key customers could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

     Most of the Company's customers can cease incorporating the Company's
products in their own products with limited notice to the Company and with
little or no penalty. The Company's agreements with its customers typically do
not require minimum purchases. In addition, certain of the Company's customers
offer or may offer products (designed by themselves or third parties) that
compete with those offered by the Company. Many of the Company's customers have
pre-existing relationships with current or potential competitors of


                                       17


<PAGE>   20

the Company, which may affect such customers' purchasing decisions. In addition,
the Company's longstanding relationship with certain of its larger customers may
affect the purchasing decisions of other potential customers who compete with
these customers. The Company's customers face intense competition from other
manufacturers that do not use the Company's products. Further, some of the
Company's customers have "most favored nation" pricing arrangements which could
materially and adversely affect the Company's average selling prices and gross
margins in the event of product pricing decisions that trigger such
arrangements.

     RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE; DEPENDENCE ON EMERGING MARKETS AND EVOLVING
STANDARDS. The semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets
are characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent new product
introductions and evolving industry standards. Substantially all of the
Company's current product revenue is derived from sales of products for the
high-speed networking, cable set-top box and cable modem markets. These markets
are characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change and short
product life cycles. In particular, the high-speed networking, cable set-top box
and cable modem markets continue to undergo a period of rapid growth and
consolidation. The Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a
significant slowdown in any of these or other broadband communications markets.
The Company's success will depend on the ability of its customers to develop new
products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets
and to successfully introduce and promote such products. There can be no
assurance that the broadband communications markets will develop to the extent
or in the timeframes anticipated by the Company. The failure of new markets to
develop as anticipated or the failure of the Company's products in these markets
to gain widespread acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Products for
broadband communications applications are generally based on industry standards,
which are continually evolving. The emergence of new industry standards could
render products of the Company or its customers unmarketable or obsolete and may
require the Company to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with any
such new standards. Moreover, the Company's past sales and profitability have
resulted, to a significant extent, from its ability to anticipate changes in
technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced
products. The Company's continued ability to adapt to such changes and to
anticipate future standards, and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those
standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving the
Company's competitive position and its prospects for growth. The Company has in
the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies, such as
100Base-T4 for high-speed networking, for which the market did not ultimately
meet the Company's expectations. There can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to anticipate the evolving standards in the semiconductor industry and,
in particular, the broadband communications markets, or that the Company will be
able to successfully develop and introduce new products into such markets. The
failure of the Company to anticipate technological change and introduce new
products that achieve market acceptance could materially and adversely affect
the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

     DEPENDENCE ON DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS. The Company's future success
will depend upon its ability to develop new silicon solutions for existing and
new markets, introduce such products in a timely and cost-effective manner and
have such products selected for design into new products of leading equipment
manufacturers ("design wins"). The development of these new devices is highly
complex, and from time to time the Company has experienced delays in completing
the development and introduction of new products. Successful product development
and introduction depends on a number of factors, including, among other things,
accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards; accurate new
product definition; timely completion and introduction of new product designs;
timely qualification and industry interoperability certification of the
Company's products and the products into which the Company's products will be
incorporated; availability of foundry capacity; achievement of high
manufacturing yields; and market acceptance of the Company's and its customers'
products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner or in sufficient
quantities to meet customer demand or that such products will satisfy customer
requirements or achieve market acceptance. The Company's quarterly results have
in the past been, and are expected in the future to continue to be, dependent
upon the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the
timely completion and delivery of those products to customers. The Company's or
its customers' failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in
a timely manner would materially and adversely affect the Company's business,
financial condition and results of operations. The Company's new products are
generally incorporated into customers' products or systems at the design stage.
Achieving a design win often requires significant expenditures by the Company
without any assurance of success. Moreover, design wins frequently precede the
generation of volume sales, if any, by six to nine months or more. The value of
any design win largely depends upon the commercial success of the customer's
product and on the extent to which the design of the customer's electronic
system accommodates components manufactured by the Company's competitors. There
can be no assurance that the Company will continue to achieve design wins or
that the products for which the Company achieves design wins will be
commercially successful.

     DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL. The Company's success depends to a significant
extent upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key
management and technical personnel and on its ability to continue to attract,
retain and motivate qualified personnel, particularly experienced mixed-signal
circuit designers and systems applications engineers. The competition for such
employees is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract as many
qualified new personnel as it was able to employ prior to its initial public
offering. The loss of the services of one or more of the Company's key employees
or the Company's failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
condition and results of operations. In particular, the loss of the services of
Dr. Henry T. Nicholas, III, the co-founder, President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company, or Dr. Henry Samueli, the co-founder, Vice President of
Research and Development and Chief Technical Officer of the Company, could
materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company does not have any
employment contracts with its employees that govern the length of their service.

     COMPETITION. The broadband communications markets and semiconductor
industry are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological
change, evolving standards, short product life cycles and price erosion. The
Company competes with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of
equipment in the markets for cable set-top


                                       19


<PAGE>   22

boxes, cable modems, high-speed networking, DBS and terrestrial digital
broadcast, and xDSL. This competition has resulted and may continue to result in
declining average selling prices for the Company's products. The Company
currently competes in the cable television set-top box market with Fujitsu, LSI
Logic, Philips Electronics, Rockwell International and VLSI Technology for
communication devices and with ATI Technologies, C-Cube, LSI Logic, Motorola and
STMicroelectronics (formerly SGS-THOMSON) in the MPEG/graphics segment. The
Company expects other major semiconductor manufacturers to enter the market as
the digital broadcast television and other digital cable television markets
become more established. A number of companies, including Hitachi, Libit Signal
Processing, LSI Logic, Rockwell International, Stanford Telecommunications, Inc.
("STI") and Toshiba have announced that they are developing and plan to
introduce MCNS/DOCSIS compliant products in 1998, which could result in
significant competition in the cable modem market. In the high-speed networking
market, the Company principally competes with established suppliers including
Level One Communications, Lucent Technologies, National Semiconductor and Texas
Instruments. The Company's principal competitors in the DBS/terrestrial
broadcast market include LSI Logic, Lucent Technologies, Philips Electronics,
Rockwell International, Sony, STMicroelectronics and VLSI Technology. The
Company's principal competitors in the xDSL market include Alcatel, Analog
Devices, Globespan, Motorola, Rockwell International and Texas Instruments. The
Company also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or
emerging technologies. Many of the Company's competitors operate their own
fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key
markets, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases and
significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing,
distribution, technical and other resources than the Company. As a result, such
competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies
and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the
promotion and sale of their products than the Company. Current and potential
competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic
relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers,
resellers or other third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new
competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire
significant market share. In addition, existing or new competitors may in the
future develop technologies that more effectively address the transmission of
digital information through existing analog infrastructures at a lower cost.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully
against current or potential competitors, or that competition will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and
results of operations.

     MANAGEMENT OF GROWTH. The Company has experienced a period of rapid growth,
expanding from 182 employees in September 1997 to 400 employees (including
temporary and contract employees) in September 1998. This expansion has placed,
and continues to place, significant strain on the Company's resources. To
accommodate this growth, the Company will be required to implement a variety of
new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls,
including the improvement of its accounting and other internal management
systems, all of which may require substantial management effort. There can be no
assurance that such efforts can be accomplished successfully. The Company's
rapid growth and expansion, as well as its product development and selling,
general and administrative activities, have necessitated the increase in the
number of employees as well as increased responsibilities for the Company's
management. To support its growth, the Company recently entered into a new lease
for larger facilities and is in the


                                       20


<PAGE>   23

process of improving these facilities. These new facilities will allow all of
the Company's Irvine employees and operations to be centralized on one campus.
This relocation of the Company's headquarters and Irvine operations could result
in a temporary disruption of the Company's operations or a temporary diversion
of management attention and resources. From time to time, the Company engages in
other relocations of employees or operations. If the Company sustains its growth
in the future, it will need to continue to implement and improve its
operational, financial and management information systems and to hire, train,
motivate and manage its expanding employee base. There can be no assurance that
the Company's systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support the
Company's operations. Any difficulties resulting from relocation of employees or
operations or any failure to improve the Company's operational, financial and
management information systems, or to hire, train, motivate or manage its
employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

     DEPENDENCE ON INDEPENDENT FOUNDRIES. The Company does not own or operate a
fabrication facility, and substantially all of its semiconductor device
requirements are currently supplied by two outside foundries, TSMC in Taiwan and
Chartered in Singapore. There are significant risks associated with the
Company's reliance on outside foundries, including the lack of ensured wafer
supply; limited control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and control,
manufacturing yields and production costs; and the unavailability of or delays
in obtaining access to key process technologies. In addition, the manufacture of
integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process.
Although the Company works closely with its foundries to minimize the likelihood
of reduced manufacturing yields, the Company's foundries have from time to time
experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, particularly in
connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and
start-up of new process technologies.

     The Company provides its foundries with rolling forecasts of its production
requirements; however, the ability of each foundry to provide semiconductor
devices to the Company is limited by the foundry's available capacity. Although
the Company has entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels
of products to certain of its customers, the Company does not have a long-term
volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of production capacity with TSMC
or Chartered because the Company believes excess foundry capacity is currently
available. The Company places its orders on a purchase order basis, and these
foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies' products
while reducing deliveries to the Company on short notice. In particular, foundry
customers that are larger and better financed than the Company or that have
long-term agreements with the Company's foundries may cause such foundries to
reallocate capacity in a manner adverse to the Company. In addition, if the
Company chooses to use a new foundry, several months are typically required to
complete the qualification process before the Company can begin shipping
products from the new foundry. Although the Company primarily utilizes two
independent foundries, most of the Company's components are not manufactured at
both foundries at any given time. Any inability of one of the foundries to
provide the necessary components could result in significant delays and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition
and results of operations. In the event either foundry experiences financial
difficulties (whether as a result of the Asian economic crisis or otherwise) or
suffers any damage or destruction to its respective facilities, or in the event
of any other disruption of foundry capacity, the Company


                                       21


<PAGE>   24

may not be able to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new
products in a timely manner. Even the Company's current outside foundries would
need to have certain manufacturing processes qualified in the event of
disruption at another foundry, which the Company may not be able to accomplish
in a timely enough manner to prevent an interruption in supply of the affected
products. There can be no assurance that any existing or new foundries would be
able to produce ICs with acceptable manufacturing yields. Furthermore, there can
be no assurance that the Company's foundries will continue to deliver sufficient
quantities of semiconductor devices on a timely basis, will not experience lower
than expected manufacturing yields in the future, or will continue to have
excess capacity, any of which events could materially and adversely affect the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

     DEPENDENCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS FOR ASSEMBLY AND TEST.
Substantially all of the Company's products are assembled and tested by one of
two third-party subcontractors, ASAT in Hong Kong and STATS in Singapore. The
Company does not have long-term agreements with either of these suppliers and
typically procures services from such suppliers on a per order basis. The
availability of assembly and testing services from these subcontractors could be
adversely affected in the event either subcontractor experiences financial
difficulties (whether as a result of the Asian economic crisis or otherwise) or
suffers any damage or destruction to its respective facilities, or in the event
of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity. As a result of this
reliance on third-party subcontractors for assembly and testing of its products,
the Company cannot directly control product delivery schedules, which has in the
past, and could in the future, result in product shortages or quality assurance
problems that could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of
the Company's products. Due to the amount of time normally required to qualify
assemblers and testers, if the Company is required to find alternative
manufacturing assemblers or testers of its components, shipments could be
delayed. Any problems associated with the delivery, quality or cost of the
Company's products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

     RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. As part of its business
strategy, the Company expects to review acquisition prospects that would
complement its existing product offerings, augment its market coverage or
enhance its technological capabilities. Although the Company has no current
understandings or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions, the
Company may make acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies in the
future. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
locate suitable acquisition opportunities or to consummate any such acquisitions
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company. Future acquisitions by the
Company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities,
large one-time write-offs, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or
amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of
which could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or
the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Furthermore, acquisitions
entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation and
integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and the information
systems of the acquired companies, diversion of management's attention from
other business concerns, risks of entering geographic or business markets in
which the Company has no or limited prior experience and the potential loss of
key employees. Since the Company has not made any material acquisitions in the
past, no assurance can be given as to the ability of the Company to


                                       22

<PAGE>   25

successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that
might be acquired in the future, and the failure of the Company to do so could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition
and results of operations.

     RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. The
Company currently procures substantially all of its manufacturing, assembly and
test services from suppliers located outside the United States and may expand
its manufacturing and distribution activities abroad. Approximately 15.8% of the
Company's total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 1998 was derived
from sales to independent customers based outside the United States. In 1997,
approximately 15.4% of the Company's total revenue was derived from sales to
independent customers based outside of the United States. In addition, the
Company often ships products to its domestic customers' international
manufacturing divisions and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company is subject
to risks inherent in international operations, which include, but are not
limited to, political, social and economic instability, trade restrictions, the
imposition of governmental controls, exposure to different legal standards
(particularly with respect to intellectual property), burdens of complying with
a variety of foreign laws, import and export license requirements, future import
and export restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, foreign
technical standards, changes in tariffs, difficulties in staffing and managing
operations, difficulties in collecting receivables and potentially adverse tax
consequences. In particular, certain Asian countries have recently experienced
significant economic difficulties, including currency devaluation and
instability, business failures and a generally depressed business climate,
particularly in the semiconductor industry. In view of the Company's reliance on
Asian foundries and assemblers, and the Company's expanded international
operations, the Asian economic crisis may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company
intends to expand its international operations in the near future and may
establish foreign subsidiaries to conduct certain of the Company's international
activities. As a result, the Company's business may be impacted to a greater
degree in the future by the foregoing risks.

     In addition, certain of the Company's products contain encryption or other
features that are subject to various government export regulations, pursuant to
which the Company has applied for export licenses. If such licenses are not
granted, the Company may be unable to manufacture such products at its foreign
foundries or to ship such products to certain customers located outside the
United States. There can be no assurance that the Company will obtain such
licenses or any licenses applied for in the future or that the failure to obtain
such licenses will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, demand for the
Company's products could be adversely affected by seasonality of international
sales and economic conditions in the Company's primary overseas markets. All of
the Company's international sales to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars.
As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
currencies could make the Company's products less competitive in international
markets. There can be no assurance that the risks associated with the Company's
international operations will not materially adversely affect the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations in the future or require
the Company to modify significantly its current business practices.


                                       23


<PAGE>   26

     RELIANCE ON STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS. The Company has relied on in the past,
and intends to continue to form in the future, strategic relationships with
certain of its customers who are technology leaders in the Company's target
markets. These relationships often involve the proposed development by the
Company of new products involving significant technological challenges. Since
the proposed product under development may offer potential competitive
advantages to the strategic partner, considerable pressure is frequently placed
on the limited resources of the Company to meet development schedules. While an
essential element of the Company's strategy involves establishing such
relationships, these projects utilize substantial amounts of the Company's
limited resources, and could materially detract from or delay the completion of
other important development projects. Delays in development could impair the
relationship between the Company and its strategic partners and negatively
impact sales of the products under development. Moreover, there can be no
assurance that customers of the Company will not develop their own solutions for
products currently supplied by the Company, which could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

     TRANSITION TO SMALLER GEOMETRY PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGHER LEVELS OF
DESIGN INTEGRATION. The Company continuously evaluates the benefits, on a
product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies
in order to reduce costs and has commenced migration of certain products to
smaller geometry processes. The Company believes that the transition of its
products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important for the Company to
remain competitive. The Company has in the past experienced difficulty in
migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing
processes, which has resulted and could continue to result in reduced yields,
delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels. Moreover, the Company
is dependent on its relationships with its foundries to migrate to smaller
geometry processes successfully. No assurance can be given that the Company's
future process migrations will be achieved without difficulties, delays or
increased expenses. The Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected if any such transition is
substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented. As smaller geometry
processes become more prevalent, the Company expects to integrate greater levels
of functionality as well as customer and third-party intellectual property into
its products. No assurance can be given that higher levels of design integration
will not adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver new integrated
products on a timely basis, or at all.

     RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION. The Company's
success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on its ability to
protect its intellectual property. The Company relies primarily on patent,
copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements
and other methods to protect its proprietary technologies and processes. There
can be no assurance that such measures will provide meaningful protection for
the Company's proprietary technologies and processes. The Company has been
issued three United States patents and has filed 14 United States patent
applications. There can be no assurance that any patent will issue as a result
of these applications or future applications or, if issued, that any claims
allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the Company's technology. In
addition, there can be no assurance that any existing or future patents will not
be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that any right granted thereunder
would provide meaningful protection to the Company. The failure of any patents
to provide protection to the Company's technology would make it easier for the
Company's competitors


                                       24


<PAGE>   27

to offer similar products. In connection with its participation in the
development of various industry standards, the Company may be required to agree
to license certain of its patents to other parties, including its competitors,
that develop products based upon the adopted standards. The Company also
generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and
strategic partners, and generally controls access to and distribution of its
documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it
may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the
Company's products, services or technology without authorization, develop
similar technology independently or design around the Company's patents. In
addition, effective copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be
unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Certain of the Company's
customers have entered into agreements with the Company pursuant to which such
customers have the right to use the Company's proprietary technology in the
event the Company defaults in its contractual obligations, including product
supply obligations, and fails to cure the default within a specified period of
time. Moreover, the Company often incorporates the intellectual property of its
strategic customers into its designs, and the Company has certain obligations
with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such intellectual property.
There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company to prevent
misappropriation or infringement of the intellectual property of the Company or
its customers will be successful. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the
future to enforce the Company's intellectual property rights, to protect the
Company's trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary
rights of others, including its customers. Such litigation could result in
substantial costs and diversion of management's efforts and other Company
resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

     The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection of and
pursuit of intellectual property rights. From time to time, the Company has
received, and may continue to receive in the future, notices of claims of
infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties' proprietary rights.
The Company has received a letter from counsel for BroadCom, Inc. asserting
rights in the "Broadcom" trademark and demanding that the Company cease and
desist from any further use of the Broadcom name. The Company and BroadCom, Inc.
have exchanged correspondence outlining their respective positions on the
matter. In addition, the Company is currently involved in litigation with STI
concerning the alleged infringement of one of STI's patents by several of the
Company's modem products and with Sarnoff Corporation and Sarnoff Digital
Communications, Inc. (collectively, "Sarnoff") concerning the alleged
misappropriation and misuse of certain Sarnoff trade secrets by the Company.
There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in these actions, or
that other actions alleging infringement by the Company of third-party patents,
misappropriation or misuse by the Company of third-party trade secrets or the
invalidity of one or more patents held by the Company will not be asserted or
prosecuted against the Company, or that any assertions of infringement,
misappropriation or misuse or prosecutions seeking to establish the invalidity
of Company-held patents will not materially and adversely affect the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in a
patent or trade secret action, an injunction could be issued against the Company
requiring that the Company withdraw certain products from the market or
necessitating that certain products offered for sale or under development be
redesigned. The Company has also entered into certain indemnification
obligations in favor of its customers and strategic partners that could be
triggered upon an allegation or finding of the Company's infringement,


                                       25


<PAGE>   28

misappropriation or misuse of other parties' proprietary rights. Irrespective of
the validity or successful assertion of such claims, the Company would likely
incur significant costs and diversion of its management and personnel resources
with respect to the defense of such claims, which could also have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations. If any claims or actions are asserted against the Company, the
Company may seek to obtain a license under a third party's intellectual property
rights. There can be no assurance that under such circumstances a license would
be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

     LENGTHY SALES CYCLE. The Company's sales cycle involves test and evaluation
of its products by the potential customer and design of the customer's equipment
to incorporate the Company's products. The sales cycle for the test and
evaluation of the Company's products can range from three to six months or more,
and it can take an additional six to nine months or more before a customer
commences volume production of equipment that incorporates the Company's
products. Because of this lengthy sales cycle, the Company may experience a
delay between increasing expenses for research and development, sales and
marketing, and general and administrative efforts, as well as increasing
investments in inventory, and the generation of revenues, if any, from such
expenditures. In addition, the delays inherent in such lengthy sales cycle raise
additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans, which
could result in the loss of anticipated sales by the Company. Achieving a design
win provides no assurance that such customer will ultimately ship products
incorporating the Company's products. The Company's business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if a
significant customer curtails, reduces or delays orders during the Company's
sales cycle or chooses not to release products employing the Company's products.

     ORDER AND SHIPMENT UNCERTAINTIES. The Company's sales are generally made
pursuant to individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by
customers on short notice without significant penalty. Cancellation or deferral
of product orders could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations and could result in the
Company holding excess inventory, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's profit margins and restrict its ability to fund its
operations. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to the
customer. Refusal of customers to accept shipped products or delays or
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant
charges against income, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

     PRODUCT COMPLEXITY. Products as complex as those offered by the Company
frequently contain errors, defects and bugs when first introduced or as new
versions are released. The Company has in the past experienced such errors,
defects and bugs. Delivery of products with production defects or reliability,
quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market
acceptance of such products, which could damage the Company's reputation and
adversely affect the Company's ability to retain its existing customers and to
attract new customers. Moreover, such errors, defects or bugs could cause
problems, interruptions, delays or a cessation of sales to the Company's
customers. Alleviating such problems may require significant expenditures of
capital and resources by the Company. There can be no assurance that, despite
testing by the Company, its suppliers or its customers, errors, defects or bugs
will not be found in new products after commencement of


                                       26


<PAGE>   29

commercial production, resulting in additional development costs, loss of, or
delays in, market acceptance, diversion of technical and other resources from
the Company's other development efforts, product repair or replacement costs,
claims by the Company's customers or others against the Company, or the loss of
credibility with the Company's current and prospective customers. Any such event
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
condition and results of operations.

     CYCLICALITY OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. The Company provides
semiconductor devices to the broadband communications markets. The semiconductor
industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and has
been subject to significant economic downturns at various times, characterized
by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices and
production overcapacity. The semiconductor industry also periodically
experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints. As a result,
the Company may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future
results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions, overall
economic conditions or other factors.

     LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY. The Company was incorporated in August 1991 but
did not begin shipping products until 1994. Accordingly, the Company has a
limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate the Company and its
prospects. The Company's recent revenue growth may not be sustainable and should
not be considered indicative of future revenue growth, if any. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be profitable in any future period. The
Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks, challenges and
difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of
development, particularly companies in intensely competitive and rapidly
evolving markets such as the semiconductor industry and the broadband
communications markets. To address these risks, the Company must, among other
things, successfully increase the scope of its operations, respond to
competitive and technological developments, continue to attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel and continue to commercialize products
incorporating innovative technologies. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in addressing these risks and challenges.

     RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION. The Federal Communications
Commission (the "FCC") has broad jurisdiction over each of the Company's target
markets. Although the Company's products are not directly subject to current
regulations of the FCC or any other federal or state communications regulatory
agency, much of the equipment into which the Company's products are incorporated
is subject to direct government regulation. Accordingly, the effects of
regulation on the Company's customers or the industries in which they operate
may, in turn, adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and
results of operations. FCC regulatory policies affecting the ability of cable
operators or telephone companies to offer certain services and other terms on
which these companies conduct their businesses may impede sales of the Company's
products. For example, the Company has in the past experienced delays when
products incorporating its chips failed to comply with FCC emissions
specifications. In addition, the Company's business, financial condition and
results of operations may also be adversely affected by the imposition of
certain tariffs, duties and other import restrictions on components that the
Company obtains from non-domestic suppliers or by the imposition of export
restrictions on products that the Company sells internationally. The Company may
also be subject to regulation by countries


                                       27


<PAGE>   30

other than the United States. Changes in current laws or regulations or the
imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere, could
materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and
results of operations.

     CONTROL BY DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND THEIR AFFILIATES. As of
October 31, 1998, the Company's directors and executive officers beneficially
owned approximately 50.1% of the outstanding Common Stock and 62.8% of the total
voting control of the Company. In particular, as of October 31, 1998, the two
founders of the Company, Dr. Henry T. Nicholas, III and Dr. Henry Samueli,
beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 46.3% of the outstanding Common
Stock and 58.3% of the total voting control of the Company. Accordingly, such
persons will have sufficient voting power to control the outcome of matters
(including the election of a majority of the Board of Directors, and any merger,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets)
submitted to the Company's shareholders for approval and will also have control
over the management and affairs of the Company. As a result of such control,
certain transactions may not be possible without the approval of such
shareholders. These transactions include proxy contests, mergers involving the
Company, tender offers, open market purchase programs or other purchases of
Class A Common Stock that could give shareholders of the Company the opportunity
to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for their shares of
Class A Common Stock.

     STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. The trading price of the Company's Class A Common
Stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in
response to quarter to quarter variations in results of operations,
announcements of technological innovations or new products by the Company, its
competitors or its customers, general conditions in the semiconductor,
telecommunications and data communications equipment markets, changes in
earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts, investor
perceptions and expectations regarding the products, plans and strategic
position of the Company, its competitors and its customers, or other events or
factors. For example, since the Company's initial public offering, the Company's
Class A Common Stock has traded as low as $47.00 and as high as $100.25 per
share. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and
trading volume volatility, particularly in high technology sectors of the
market. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of
securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the
operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock.

     YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE. Many existing computer systems and applications, and
other control devices, use only two digits to identify a year in the date field,
without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century. Others do
not correctly process "leap year" dates. As a result, such systems and
applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that
they can correctly process data related to the year 2000 and beyond, but there
can be no assurance that such upgrades will be completed on a timely basis or
without incurring substantial costs. While the Company has evaluated its
products for year 2000 compliance there can be no assurance that the Company's
products are or will ultimately be year 2000 compliant. In addition, the Company
believes that it is not possible to determine whether all of its customers'
products into which the Company's products are incorporated will be year 2000
compliant because the Company has little or no control over


                                       28


<PAGE>   31

the design, production and testing of its customers' products. The Company
relies on its systems, applications and devices in operating and monitoring all
major aspects of its business, including financial systems (such as general
ledger, accounts payable and payroll modules), customer services,
infrastructure, embedded computer chips, networks and telecommunications
equipment and end products. Although the Company is in the process of upgrading
its software to address the year 2000 issue, there can be no assurance that such
upgrades will be completed on a timely basis at reasonable costs, or that such
upgrades will be able to anticipate all of the problems triggered by the actual
impact of the year 2000. The Company also relies, directly and indirectly, on
external systems of suppliers for the management and control of fabrication,
assembly and testing of substantially all of the Company's products and of
business enterprises such as customers, suppliers, creditors, financial
organizations, and of governmental entities, both domestic and international,
for accurate exchange of data. The Company could be affected through disruptions
in the operation of the enterprises with which the Company interacts or from
general widespread problems or an economic crisis resulting from noncompliant
year 2000 systems. There can be no assurance that any contingency plans
implemented by the Company would be adequate to meet the Company's needs without
materially impacting its operations or that any such plans will be successful.
Despite the Company's efforts to address the year 2000 impact on its internal
systems and business operations, there can be no assurance that such impact will
not result in a material disruption of its business or have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
See "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations -- Year 2000."

     FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS; UNCERTAINTY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING. The Company
believes that the aggregate net proceeds from the follow-on public offering,
together with the net proceeds of the Company's initial public offering and cash
generated from its operations will be sufficient to meet its capital
requirements for at least the next twelve months. Nonetheless, the Company may
elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities. The
Company's future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned
and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the levels at
which the Company maintains inventory and accounts receivable; the market
acceptance of the Company's products; the levels of promotion and advertising
required to launch such products and attain a competitive position in the
marketplace; volume pricing concessions; the Company's business, product,
capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap;
capital improvements to new and existing facilities; technological advances; the
response of competitors to the Company's products; and the Company's
relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, the Company may require
an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth,
hiring, infrastructure and facility needs, including the Company's recently
executed lease of new facilities to centralize all Irvine employees and
operations on one campus. Additional capital may be required for consummation of
any acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies. To the extent the
Company's existing resources and any future earnings are insufficient to fund
the Company's activities, the Company may need to raise additional funds through
public or private financings or borrowings. No assurance can be given that
additional financing will be available or that if available, any such financing
can be obtained on terms favorable to the Company and its shareholders. If
adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to curtail its
operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic
partners or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain
of its


                                       29


<PAGE>   32

technologies or potential markets. If additional funds are raised through the
issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of the then existing
shareholders of the Company would be reduced. Such equity securities may have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the
Company's Common Stock.

     POTENTIAL EFFECT OF ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS. The Company's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or prevent
certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control
of the Company, including transactions in which the shareholders might otherwise
receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may
limit the ability of the shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem
to be in their best interests. In addition, the Company has outstanding Class B
Common Stock, which entitles each holder thereof to ten votes per share on all
matters presented for a shareholder vote. The Board of Directors also has the
authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of the Company's Preferred
Stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote. It is possible that
the provisions in the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the
existence of super voting rights held by insiders and the ability of the Board
of Directors to issue Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring
or preventing a change of control of the Company without further action by the
shareholders, may discourage bids for the Company's Class A Common Stock at a
premium over the market price of the Class A Common Stock and may adversely
affect the market price of the Class A Common Stock and the voting and other
rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Not applicable.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business. The current status of the Company's
previously reported claims and litigation is discussed in Note 8 of the "Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, and under "Risks
Associated with Intellectual Property Protection" in Part I, Item 2, elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q, which sections are hereby incorporated by this reference.
Although management believes the outcome of the Company's outstanding legal
proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the
results of litigation are inherently uncertain, and such outcome is at least
reasonably possible. The Company is unable to make an estimate of the range of
possible loss from outstanding litigation, and no amounts have been provided for
such matters in the financial statements included in Part I.

ITEM 2. CHANGES IN SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

     (c) SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES. During the three months ended
September 30, 1998, the Company issued 21,875 shares of Class B Common Stock to
a former employee for an aggregate purchase price of $24,792, upon the exercise
of options to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock. The sale of Class B
Common Stock made by the Company pursuant to the exercise of stock options was
made pursuant to the exemptions from registration by Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933.

     (d) USE OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF REGISTERED SECURITIES. On April 21, 1998,
the Company completed an initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock,
$0.0001 par value. The managing underwriters in the Offering were Morgan Stanley
& Co. Incorporated, BT Alex. Brown Incorporated, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Inc.
and Hambrecht & Quist LLC (the "Underwriters"). The shares of Class A Common
Stock sold in the Offering were registered under the Securities Act of 1993, as
amended, on a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the "Registration Statement")
(Reg. No. 333-45619) that was declared effective by the SEC on April 16, 1998.

     The Offering commenced on April 16, 1998 and terminated on April 21, 1998
after all 4,525,000 shares of Class A Common Stock registered under the
Registration Statement were sold. Of the total shares sold, 3,120,000 shares
were sold by the Company (including 355,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise
of the Underwriters' over-allotment option), 905,000 shares were sold by selling
shareholders (including 170,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the
Underwriters' over-allotment option) and 500,000 shares were sold by the Company
to Cisco Systems in a concurrent registered offering that was not underwritten.
The purchase price for the underwritten shares was $24.00 per share and the
purchase price of the shares sold to Cisco Systems was $22.32 per share. The
aggregate price of the Offering amount registered was $107,760,000.

     In connection with the Offering, the Company paid an aggregate of
$5,241,600 in underwriting discounts and commissions to the Underwriters and
paid other expenses of approximately $1,628,000. After deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses, the Company received
net aggregate proceeds from the Offering and sale of shares to Cisco Systems of
approximately $79,170,400. In April 1998, the Company used $2,250,000 of the
proceeds to repay the balance outstanding under its term loan with Silicon
Valley Bank and through September 1998, used approximately $13.6 million for the
purchase of capital equipment. The balance of the proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital purchases such
as test equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the Company's
planned facilities expansion. None of the Company's net proceeds of the Offering
were paid directly or indirectly to any director, officer, general partner of
the Company or their associates, persons owning 10 percent or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, or an affiliate of the Company.

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

     None.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     None.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

     In October 1998, the Company completed an underwritten follow-on public
offering. Of the 3,450,000 shares of Class A Common Stock offered, the Company
sold 470,000 shares and selling shareholders sold 2,980,000 shares, at a price
of $69 per share. The Company received net aggregate proceeds from the follow-on
offering of approximately $30.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering costs.

Dear Sirs and Mesdames:

        Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation (the "COMPANY")
co-founded by Henry T. Nicholas, III and Henry Samueli (individually a "FOUNDER"
and collectively the "Founders"), proposes to issue and sell to the several
Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "UNDERWRITERS"), and certain
shareholders of the Company (the "SELLING SHAREHOLDERS") named in Schedule I
hereto severally propose to sell to the several Underwriters, an aggregate of
3,000,000 shares (the "FIRM SHARES") of the Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "CLASS A COMMON STOCK"), of which 392,500
shares are to be issued and sold by the Company and 2,607,500 shares are to be
sold by the Selling Shareholders, each Selling Shareholder selling the amount
set forth opposite such Selling Shareholder's name in Schedule I hereto.

        The Company also proposes to issue and sell and certain Selling
Shareholders propose to sell to the several Underwriters not more than an
additional 450,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock (the "ADDITIONAL SHARES")
if and to the extent that you, as Managers of the offering, shall have
determined to exercise, on behalf of the Underwriters, the right to purchase
such shares of common stock granted to the Underwriters in Section 3 hereof. The
Firm Shares and the Additional Shares are hereinafter collectively referred to
as the "SHARES." The shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the "CLASS B COMMON STOCK"), of the Company to be
outstanding after giving effect to the sales contemplated hereby are hereinafter
referred to as the "COMMON STOCK." The Company and the Selling Shareholders are
hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the "SELLERS."

        The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") a registration statement, including a prospectus, relating to the
Shares. The registration statement as amended at the time it becomes effective,
including the information (if any) deemed to be part of the registration
statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430A under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), is hereinafter
referred to as the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT;" the prospectus in the form first
used to confirm sales of Shares is hereinafter referred to as the "PROSPECTUS."
If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement to register
additional shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the
Securities Act (the "RULE 462 REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), then any reference
herein to the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462
Registration Statement.

        1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND FOUNDERS. The
Company and, to the best of their knowledge, the Founders severally, but not
jointly, represent and warrant to and agree with each of the Underwriters that:

           (a) The Registration Statement has become effective under the
        Securities Act; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
        Registration Statement is in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose
        are pending before or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened by the
        Commission.

           (b) (i) The Registration Statement, when it became effective, did not
        contain and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not contain
        any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
        required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
        therein not misleading, (ii) the Registration Statement and the
        Prospectus comply and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will
        comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and the
        applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (iii)
        the Prospectus does not contain and, as amended or supplemented, if
        applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
        omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
        therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
        not misleading, except that the representations and warranties set forth
        in this paragraph do not apply to statements or omissions in the
        Registration Statement or the Prospectus based upon information relating
        to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such
        Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.

           (c) The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a
        corporation in good standing under the laws of the state of California,
        has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct
        its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified to
        transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
        the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property
        requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be
        so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse
        effect on the Company.

           (d) The Company has no subsidiaries.

           (e) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
        by the Company.

           (f) The authorized capital stock of the Company conforms as to legal
        matters to the description thereof set forth under the caption
        "Description of Capital Stock in the Prospectus."

           (g) The shares of Common Stock (including the Shares to be sold by
        the Selling Shareholders) outstanding prior to the issuance of the
        Shares to be sold by the Company have been duly authorized and are
        validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; except as set forth in
        the Prospectus, the Company does not have any outstanding options to
        purchase, or any preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or
        to purchase, any securities or obligations convertible into, or any
        contracts or commitments to issue or sell, shares of its capital stock
        or any such options, rights, convertible securities or obligations; and,
        except where failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect
        on the Company, all outstanding shares of capital stock and options and
        other rights to acquire capital stock have been issued in compliance
        with the registration and qualification provisions of all applicable
        securities laws and were not issued in violation of any preemptive
        rights, rights of first refusal or other similar rights that have not
        been waived.


                                      -3-


<PAGE>   4

           (h) The Shares to be sold by the Company have been duly authorized
        and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this
        Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and
        the issuance of such Shares will not be subject to any preemptive
        rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights.

           (i) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance
        by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement will not
        contravene any provision of applicable law or the articles of
        incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any agreement or other
        instrument binding upon the Company that is material to the Company or
        any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court
        having jurisdiction over the Company, and no consent, approval,
        authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body
        or agency is required for the performance by the Company of its
        obligations under this Agreement, except such as may be required by the
        securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states and jurisdictions or
        the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD") in
        connection with the offer and sale of the Shares.

           (j) There has not occurred any material adverse change, or any
        development reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change, in
        the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or
        operations of the Company from that set forth in the Prospectus
        (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the
        date of this Agreement).


           (k) There are no legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings
        pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened to which the Company
        is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company is subject
        that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the
        Prospectus and are not so described or any statutes, regulations,
        contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the
        Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to
        the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.

           (l) The Company has all necessary consents, authorizations,
        approvals, orders, certificates and permits of and from, and has made
        all declarations and filings with, all foreign, federal, state, local
        and other governmental authorities, all self-regulatory organizations
        and all courts and other tribunals, to own, lease, license and use its
        properties and assets and to conduct its business in the manner
        described in the Prospectus, except to the extent that the failure to
        obtain or file would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material
        adverse effect on the Company.

           (m) Each preliminary prospectus filed as part of the registration
        statement after September 30, 1998 as originally filed or as part of any
        amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities
        Act, complied when so filed in all material respects with the Securities
        Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission
        thereunder.

           (n) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and
        sale of the Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as
        described in the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" as such
        term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.


                                      -4-

<PAGE>   5

           (o) The Company (i) is in compliance with any and all applicable
        foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
        protection of human health and safety, the environment or hazardous or
        toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants (collectively,
        "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS"), (ii) has received all permits, licenses or other
        approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to
        conduct their respective businesses and (iii) is in compliance with all
        terms and conditions of any such permit, license or approval, except
        where such noncompliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive
        required permits, licenses or other approvals or failure to comply with
        the terms and conditions of such permits, licenses or approvals would
        not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
        Company.

           (p) There are no costs or liabilities associated with Environmental
        Laws (including, without limitation, any capital or operating
        expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance
        with Environmental Laws or any permit, license or approval, any related
        constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to
        third parties) which would, singly or in the aggregate, have a material
        adverse effect on the Company.

           (q) Except as described in the Prospectus, there is no legal or
        beneficial owner of any securities of the Company who has any rights,
        not effectively satisfied or waived, to require registration of any
        shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with the filing of
        the Registration Statement.

        its business at a cost that would not have a material adverse effect on

        their report included in the Registration Statement were, independent

        3. AGREEMENTS TO SELL AND PURCHASE. Each Seller, severally and not
jointly, hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters, and each
Underwriter, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein
contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, agrees, severally
and not jointly, to purchase from such Seller at $66.24 a share (the "PURCHASE
PRICE") the number of Firm Shares (subject to such adjustments to eliminate
fractional shares as you may determine) that bears the same proportion to the
number of Firm Shares to be sold by such Seller as the number of Firm Shares set
forth in Schedule II hereto opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the
total number of Firm Shares.


        On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to issue

agree to sell to the Underwriters the Additional Shares, of which 77,500 shares

such Selling Shareholders, each such Selling Shareholder selling the amount set
forth opposite such Selling Shareholder's name in Schedule III hereto, and the
Underwriters shall have a one-time right to purchase, severally and not jointly,
up to 450,000 Additional Shares at the Purchase Price. If you, on behalf of the
Underwriters, elect to exercise such option, you shall so notify the Company in
writing not later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement, which notice
shall specify the number of Additional Shares to be purchased by the
Underwriters and the date on which such shares are to be purchased. Such date
may be the same as the Closing Date (as defined below) but not earlier than the
Closing Date nor later than ten business days after the date of such notice.
Additional Shares may be purchased as provided in Section 5 hereof solely for
the purpose of covering over-allotments made in connection with the offering of
the Firm Shares. If any Additional Shares are to be purchased, each Underwriter
agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the number of Additional Shares
(subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as you may
determine) that bears the same proportion to the total number of Additional
Shares to be purchased as the number of Firm Shares set forth in Schedule II
hereto opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the total number of Firm
Shares.

        Each Seller hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not (x)

cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (A) the sale of any
Shares to the Underwriters to be sold hereunder, (B) the issuance by the Company

acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the offering of the
Shares. In addition, each Selling Shareholder agrees that, without the prior
written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on behalf of the
Underwriters, it will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date of
the Prospectus, make any demand for, or exercise any right with respect to, the
registration of any shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock.

        4. TERMS OF PUBLIC OFFERING. The Sellers are advised by you that the

may reallow, a concession, not in excess of $0.10 a share, to any Underwriter or
to certain other dealers.

        6. CONDITIONS TO THE UNDERWRITERS' OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of the
Sellers to sell the Shares to the Underwriters and the several obligations of
the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Shares on the Closing Date are
subject to the condition that the Registration Statement shall have become
effective not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date hereof.

        The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the
following further conditions:

           (a) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and

               (i) there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any
           notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of
           any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction
           of the possible change, in the rating accorded any of the Company's
           securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
           organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2)
           under the Securities Act; and

               (ii) there shall not have occurred any change, or any development
           involving a prospective change, in the condition, financial or
           otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the Company
           from that set forth in the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or
           supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement) that,
           in your judgment, is material and adverse and that makes it, in your
           judgment, impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the
           manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

           (b) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date a
        certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by the chief executive

        Company has complied with all of the agreements and satisfied all of the
        conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder on or
        before the Closing Date.

           The officers signing and delivering such certificate may rely upon
        the best of their knowledge as to proceedings threatened.

           (c) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date a
        certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by the Selling
        Shareholders (or by their attorney-in-fact on their behalf), to the
        effect that the representations and warranties of the Selling
        Shareholders contained in this Agreement are true and correct as of the
        Closing Date and that each Selling Shareholder has complied with all of
        the agreements and satisfied all of the conditions on its part to be
        performed or satisfied hereunder on or before the Closing Date.

        opinion of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, outside counsel for the
        Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

           and (B) in the Registration Statement in Items 14 and 15, in each
           case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal
           matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present
           the information called for with respect to such legal matters,
           documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred
           to therein;

               (x) to such counsel's knowledge, (A) there are no legal,
           regulatory or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which
           the Company is a party or to which any of the properties of the
           Company is subject that are required to be described in the
           Registration Statement or the Prospectus and are not so described or
           of any California or federal statutes or regulations, and (B) there
           are no agreements, contracts or other documents that are required to
           be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be
           filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not
           described or filed as required, as the case may be;

           defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

               (xii) to such counsel's knowledge, except as described in the
           Prospectus, no holder of any securities of the Company or any other
           person has the right, contractual or otherwise, to cause the Company
           to sell or otherwise issue them, or to permit them to underwrite the

           hereby have been waived;

               (xiii) such counsel is of the opinion that the Registration
           Statement and Prospectus (except for financial statements, including
           notes and the schedules thereto and the other financial and
           statistical data included therein, as to which such counsel need not

           and the other financial and statistical data included therein, as to
           which such counsel need not express any belief) at the time the
           Registration Statement became effective, the Registration Statement
           contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
           a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
           the statements therein not misleading and (B) has no reason to
           believe that (other than the financial statements, including the
           notes and schedules thereto and other financial and statistical data

           belief) the Prospectus, on the date hereof, contains any untrue
           statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
           necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
           the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

               (xv) to such counsel's knowledge: (A) the Registration Statement
           has become effective under the Securities Act, no stop order
           proceedings with respect thereto have been instituted or are pending,
           threatened or contemplated under the Securities Act; and (B) any
           required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant
           to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act has been made in the manner
           and within the time period required by such Rule 424(b); and

        opinion of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, counsel for the Selling
        Shareholders, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

           any judgment, order or decree known to such counsel and applicable to
           the Founders and any of its properties, or, (B) to such counsel's

               (iii) no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or
           qualification with, any governmental body or agency is required for

           will receive valid marketable title to the Shares purchased by it

           (f) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an
        opinion of Fulwider, Patton, Lee & Utecht, special patent counsel to the
        Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

               (i) the Company is listed in the records of the United States
           Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") as the holder of record of the
           patent applications listed in Exhibit A to such counsel's opinion
           (the "PATENT APPLICATIONS"). Three of such Patent Applications,
           listed on Exhibit B to such counsel's opinion, have been allowed or
           indicated as containing allowable subject matter. To such counsel's
           knowledge, written assignments to the Company of all ownership
           interests in the Patent Applications have been duly authorized,
           executed and delivered by all of the inventors in accordance with
           their terms. To such counsel's knowledge, there is no claim of any
           party other than the Company to any ownership interest or lien with
           respect to any of the Patent Applications;

               (ii) the statements in the Prospectus under the captions "Risk
           Factors -- Risks Associated With Intellectual Property Protection"
           and "Business -Intellectual Property," to such counsel knowledge,
           insofar as such statements relate to the Patent Applications or any
           legal matters, documents and proceedings relating thereto fairly
           present the information called for with respect to such legal
           matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters
           referred to therein;

               (iii) to such counsel's knowledge, other than in connection with
           assertions or inquiries made by patent office examiners in the
           ordinary course of the prosecution of the Company's Patent
           Applications, there is not pending or threatened in writing any
           action, suit, proceeding or claim by others (A) challenging the
           validity or scope of the Patent Applications or any other material
           patent or patent applications held by or licensed to the Company, or
           (B) other than as disclosed to the Underwriters in writing, asserting
           that any patent is infringed by the activities of the Company
           described in the Prospectus or by the manufacture, use or sale of any
           of the Company's products or other items made and used according to
           the Patent Applications held by or licensed to the Company; and

               (iv) to such counsel's knowledge, there is not pending or
           threatened in writing any action, suit, proceeding or claim by the
           Company asserting infringement on the part of any third party of the
           Patent Applications or any other patents or patent applications held
           by or licensed to the Company.

           (g) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an
        opinion of Irell & Manella LLP, special litigation counsel to the
        Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

               (i) the statements in the Prospectus under the caption "Business
           -Legal Proceedings," to such counsel's knowledge, insofar as such
           statements relate to any legal matters, documents and proceedings
           relating thereto fairly present the information called for with
           respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly
           summarize the matters referred to therein; and such counsel concurs
           with the Company's belief as stated in the fifth sentence of the
           first paragraph of "Business--Legal Proceedings."

           (h) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an
        opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, counsel for the
        Underwriters, dated the Closing Date, covering the matters referred to
        in Sections 6(d)(v), 6(d)(vi), 6(d)(ix) (but only as to the statements
        in the Prospectus under "Description of Capital Stock" and
        "Underwriters"), 6(d)(xiii) and 6(d)(xiv) above.

           With respect to Section 6(d)(xiii) above, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison
        LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati may state that their belief is
        based upon their participation in the preparation of the Registration
        Statement and Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto and
        review and discussion of the contents thereof, but are without
        independent check or verification, except as specified. With respect to
        Section 6(e) above, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP may rely upon an
        opinion or opinions of counsel for any Selling Shareholders and, with
        respect to factual matters and to the extent such counsel deems
        appropriate, upon the representations of each Selling Shareholder
        contained herein and in the Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney of
        such Selling Shareholder and in other documents and instruments;
        provided that (A) each such counsel for the Selling Shareholders is
        satisfactory to your counsel, (B) a copy of each opinion so relied upon
        is delivered to you and is in form and substance satisfactory to your
        counsel, (C) copies of such Custody Agreements and Powers of Attorney
        and of any such other documents and instruments shall be delivered to
        you and shall be in form and substance satisfactory to your counsel and
        Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP shall state in their opinion that they
        are justified in relying on each such other opinion.

           The opinions of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP described in Sections
        6(d) and 6(e) above (and any opinions of counsel for any Selling
        Shareholder referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph) and the
        opinions of Fulwider, Patton, Lee & Utecht and Irell & Manella LLP
        described in Sections 6(f) and 6(g) above shall be rendered to the
        Underwriters at the request of the Company or one or more of the Selling
        Shareholders, as the case may be, and shall so state therein.

           (i) The Underwriters shall have received, on each of the date hereof
        and the Closing Date, a letter dated the date hereof or the Closing
        Date, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to the
        Underwriters, from Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants,
        containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in
        accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the
        financial statements and certain financial information contained in the
        Registration Statement and the Prospectus; provided, however, that the
        letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off date" not
        earlier than the date hereof.

           be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states
           in connection with offer and sale of the Shares;

           Selling Shareholder and to sell, transfer and deliver the Shares to

           will receive valid marketable title to the Shares purchased by it
           from such Corporate Selling Shareholder, free of any adverse claim,

        connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur
        or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or
        supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in
        the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a
        purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel
        for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the
        Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file
        with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters
        and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the
        Company) to which Shares may have been sold by you on behalf of the
        Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or
        supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus
        as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the
        circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be
        misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will
        comply with law.

           (d) To endeavor to qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the
        securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall
        reasonably request.

           (e) To make generally available to the Company's security holders and
        to you as soon as practicable an earnings statement covering the
        twelve-month period ending June 30, 1999 that satisfies the provisions
        of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of
        the Commission thereunder.

           (f) to (i) enforce the terms of each Lock-up Agreement and (ii) issue
        stop-transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Common Stock
        with respect to any transaction or contemplated transaction that would
        constitute a breach of or default under the applicable Lock-up

        Stanley & Co. Incorporated, the Company agrees until the expiration of
        the Lock-up Agreements (i) not to amend or terminate, or waive any right

        directly or indirectly have the same effect as an amendment or
        termination, or waiver of any right under, any Lock-up Agreement, that
        would permit any holder of shares of Common Stock, or securities
        convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, to
        sell, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or
        otherwise transfer or dispose of, any of such shares of Common Stock or
        other securities prior to the expiration of 90 days after the date of
        the Prospectus, and (ii) not to consent to any sale, short sale, grant
        of an option for the purchase of, or other disposition or transfer of
        shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable or
        exchangeable for Common Stock, subject to a Lock-up Agreement.

<PAGE>   20

obligations of the Company hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made
in this Section. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this
Section, Section 9 entitled "Indemnity and Contribution," and the last paragraph
of Section 11 below, the Underwriters will pay all of their costs and expenses,
including fees and disbursements of their counsel, stock transfer taxes payable
on resale of any of the Shares by them and any advertising expenses connected
with any offers they may make.

        The provisions of this Section shall not supersede or otherwise affect
any agreement that the Sellers may otherwise have for the allocation of such
expenses among themselves.

        9. INDEMNITY AND CONTRIBUTION.

           (a) The Company and Founders, jointly and severally, agree to
        indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any,
        who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of
        the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
        as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), from and against any and all losses,
        claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any
        legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending
        or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue
        statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
        the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary
        prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company
        shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused
        by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
        required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
        therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages
        or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or
        alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to
        any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter
        through you expressly for use therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing
        provisions of this paragraph (a), the Company and each of the
        Underwriters agrees with each of the Founders that any claim of such
        Underwriter against such Founder for indemnification, reimbursement or
        advancement of expenses pursuant to this Section 9(a) or for breach of
        any representation or warranty in Section 1 hereof shall first be sought
        by such Underwriter to be satisfied in full by the Company and, subject
        to the limitation on the aggregate liability of the Founders set forth
        below, shall be satisfied by the Founders only to the extent that such
        claim has not been satisfied in full by the Company within the 60-day
        period following the date requested for payment in accordance with the
        terms of this Agreement. The liability of each Founder under this
        Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds
        received by such Founder from the offering of the Shares sold by such
        Founder, except with respect to (i) any breaches of the representations
        and warranties set forth in paragraphs (a), (c), (e) or (f) of Section 2
        hereof, (ii) intentional misrepresentation or (iii) fraud.

           (b) Each Selling Shareholder (other than the Founders) agrees,
        severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each
        Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within
        the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
        the Exchange Act, or is under common control with, or is controlled by,
        any Underwriter, and the Company, its directors, its officers who sign
        the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the
        Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
        Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses,
        claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any
        legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending
        or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue
        statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
        the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary
        prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company
        shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused
        by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
        required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
        therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating
        to such Selling Shareholder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such
        Selling Shareholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any
        preliminary


                                      -20-


<PAGE>   21

        prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, and
        except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused
        by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
        omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to
        the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use
        therein. The liability of each Selling Shareholder under the indemnity
        agreement contained in this paragraph shall be limited to an amount
        equal to the net proceeds received by such Selling Shareholder from the
        offering of the Shares sold by such Selling Shareholder.

           (c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify
        and hold harmless the Company, the Selling Shareholders, the directors
        of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration
        Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any
        Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
        Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any
        and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without
        limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
        connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim)
        caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
        fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof,
        any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented
        if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements
        thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein
        a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
        statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to
        information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in
        writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the
        Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or
        any amendments or supplements thereto.

           (d) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation)
        shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity
        may be sought pursuant to Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c), such person (the
        "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the person against whom such
        indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing and the
        Indemnifying Party, upon request of the Indemnified Party, shall retain
        counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent
        the Indemnified Party and any others the Indemnifying Party may
        designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of
        such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any
        Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but
        the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
        Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
        Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or
        (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded
        parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
        and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
        inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
        them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in respect
        of the legal expenses of any Indemnified Party in connection with any
        proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable
        for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in
        addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if
        any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15
        of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) the fees
        and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
        counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the


                                      -21-


<PAGE>   22

        Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company
        within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and
        expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
        counsel) for all Selling Shareholders and all persons, if any, who
        control any Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either such
        Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they
        are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters
        and such control persons of any Underwriters, such firm shall be
        designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. In the case
        of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers
        and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in
        writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the
        Selling Shareholders and such control persons of any Selling
        Shareholders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the persons
        named as attorneys-in-fact for the Selling Shareholders under the Powers
        of Attorney. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
        settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but
        if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the
        plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified
        Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
        settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior
        written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any
        pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified
        Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
        hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an
        unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on
        claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

           (e) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a),
        9(b) or 9(c) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient in
        respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to
        therein, then each Indemnifying Party under such paragraph, in lieu of
        indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall contribute to the
        amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
        losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is
        appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
        Indemnifying Party or parties on the one hand and the Indemnified Party
        or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if
        the allocation provided by clause 9(e)(i) above is not permitted by
        applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
        the relative benefits referred to in clause 9(e)(i) above but also the
        relative fault of the Indemnifying Party or parties on the one hand and
        of the Indemnified Party or parties on the other hand in connection with
        the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims,
        damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
        considerations. The relative benefits received by the Sellers on the one
        hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the
        offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective
        proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before
        deducting expenses) received by each Seller and the total underwriting
        discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as
        set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the
        aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the
        Sellers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be
        determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
        alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
        omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
        Sellers or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent,
        knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
        such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to
        contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to the
        respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not
        joint.

           (f) The Sellers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just
        or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined
        by pro rata allocation (even if the


                                      -22-


<PAGE>   23

        Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any
        other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
        considerations referred to in Section 9(e). The amount paid or payable
        by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and
        liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be
        deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal
        or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
        connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
        Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall
        be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which
        the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed
        to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
        damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by
        reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
        omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
        meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
        contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
        misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not
        exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise
        be available to any Indemnified Party at law or in equity.

           (g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this
        Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of
        the Company and the Selling Shareholders contained in this Agreement
        shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i)
        any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on
        behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, any
        Selling Shareholder or any person controlling any Selling Shareholder,
        or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the
        Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.

        10 TERMINATION. This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice
given by you to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been
suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New
York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASD, the Chicago Board of
Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade,
(ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any
exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on
commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either
federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any
calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and (b) in
the case of any of the events specified in clauses 10(a)(i) through 10(a)(iv),
such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in your
judgment, impracticable to market the Shares on the terms and in the manner
contemplated in the Prospectus.

        11 EFFECTIVENESS; DEFAULTING UNDERWRITERS. This Agreement shall become
effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

        If, on the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be,
any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that
it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate
number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but
failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number
of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be
obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth
opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate number of
Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting
Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the
Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or
refused


                                      -23-


<PAGE>   24

to purchase on such date; provided, however, that in no event shall the number
of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement
be increased pursuant to this Section 11 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of
such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on
the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to
purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to
which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm
Shares to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to you, the Company and
the Selling Shareholders for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made
within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without
liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the
Selling Shareholders. In any such case either you or the relevant Sellers shall
have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than
seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration
Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be
effected. If, on the Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall
fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of
Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than
one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased, the
non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their
obligation hereunder to purchase Additional Shares or (ii) purchase not less
than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would
have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken
under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability
in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

        If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of
them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of any Seller to comply with
the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any
reason any Seller shall be unable to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, the Sellers will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as
have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all
out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel)
reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or
the offering contemplated hereunder.

        12 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

        13 APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
