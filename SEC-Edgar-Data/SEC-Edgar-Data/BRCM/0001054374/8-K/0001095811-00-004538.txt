                         Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Altima Communications, Inc.

We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Altima Communications, Inc. as
of June 30, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. The consolidated financial statements of Altima Communications, Inc.
for the year ended June 30, 1999 and for the period from July 16, 1997
(inception) to June 30, 1998 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated
March 1, 2000, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Altima
Communications, Inc. at June 30, 2000, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

                       Report of Independent Accountants


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Altima Communications, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Altima
Communications, Inc. and its subsidiary at June 30, 1999 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the year ended June 30, 1999 and the
period from July 16, 1997 (date of inception) to June 30, 1998 then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.

1. SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Altima Communications, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the state of
California on July 16, 1997. The Company is engaged in designing, manufacturing,
and marketing low-powered, high-performance communications silicon solutions for
high-speed networking and Internet infrastructure applications.

Domestic operations primarily consist of product development, sales, and
marketing. Foreign operations consist of a subsidiary in Taiwan, established in
2000 and engaged in research and development and general administration of
contractor manufacturers located in Taiwan.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain items in the prior year financial statement captions have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company recognizes product revenue on sales to distributors and resellers at
the point of time when products have been sold to the final customer. Upon
shipment to the final customers, the Company provides for estimated returns and
allowances and for the estimated costs that can be incurred for product
warranties and post-sale customer support.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


1. SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

REVENUE RECOGNITION (CONTINUED)

The Company provides nonrecurring research and development engineering services
to certain customers under fixed price contracts. Because of uncertainties
regarding the cost to complete these contracts, revenue recognition is deferred
until the contract is completed. Due to uncertainties surrounding the successful
completion of the services, the Company expenses the cost of research and
development in the period incurred. Under the contracts, the Company is entitled
to bill certain amounts prior to completion of the contracts. Such amounts
billed are included in accounts receivable until collected and included in
deferred revenue until the contracts are completed. Deferred nonrecurring
engineering services amounted to $1,425,000 and $975,000 as of June 30, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

The Company accrues royalty revenue based on the licensees' production that
incorporates certain licensed technology.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. There were no
research and development costs capitalized during the year. The technological
feasibility of the Company's research and development projects is not
established until the project is entered into production.

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk primarily consist of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The
Company generally invests its excess cash in money market funds.

As of June 30, 2000 two customers represented 79% and 11% of the total accounts
receivable balance. One customer represented 78% of total product sales during
the year ended June 30, 2000.

As of June 30, 1999, four customers represented 35%, 32%, 17%, and 12% of the
total accounts receivable balance. Two customers represented 54% and 27% of
total product sales during the year ended June 30, 1999.

1. SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS (CONTINUED)

One supplier currently manufactures all of the Company's wafers that are used in
all of the Company's networking products. Any interruption or delay in the
supply of any of these components or the inability to produce these components
from alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time would
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and
financial condition. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working
closely with its supplier regarding production planning and product introduction
timing.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and held in banks in the form of
checking accounts and Certificates of Deposit that are reissued every 31 days
with maximum penalties for early withdrawal of the amount of interest earned.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, net of the provision for
obsolescence of $1,020,000 and $0 as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively,
and cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories consist
of the following:

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the term of the lease.

1. SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

GOODWILL

Goodwill is being amortized over its estimated useful live, which was estimated
as three years. Accumulated amortization at June 30, 2000 was $465,000. Goodwill
is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances
indicate impairment might exist.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin 101 "Revenue Recognition" (SAB 101). The Company is evaluating the
impact of SAB 101 on its financial statements and its future revenue recognition
policy, but does not believe the application of SAB 101 will result in a
material change to its financial statements upon adoption in the fourth quarter
of 2000.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133). The Company is required to adopt FAS 133 for
the year ending June 30, 2001. FAS 133 establishes methods of accounting for
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those
instruments as well as other hedging activities. Because the Company holds no
derivative financial instruments and does not currently engage in hedging
activities, the adoption of FAS 133 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued FASB
Interpretation, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25" (FIN 44). FIN 44 primarily
clarifies (a) the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion
No. 25, (b) the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, (c) the accounting consequence of awards, and (d) the
accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in FIN 44
cover specific events that occurred after either December 15, 1988 or January
12, 2000. The Company is evaluating the impact of FIN 44 on its financial
statements but does not believe the application of FIN 44 will result in a
material change to its financial statements upon adoption.

1. SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation" (FAS 123), the Company accounts for stock option
grants to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB
25), and complies with the disclosure provisions of FAS 123.

The Company accounts for stock option grants to nonemployees in accordance with
Emerging Issue Task Force Consensus No. 96-18, "Accounting Equity Instruments
That are Issued to Others Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services," which requires certain options subject to vesting
to be periodically revalued and expensed over their vesting period.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

For the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, there was no significant difference
between the Company's net income and comprehensive income.

STOCK SPLIT

The Company declared a two-for-one stock split of its common stock in February
2000. All applicable share amounts of common stock have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the stock split.

6. INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY

On July 1, 1999, the Company acquired 93% of Altima Communications, Asia (ACA)
in order to facilitate its research and development activity in Hsin Chu,
Taiwan. The total amount paid in the acquisition was $1,749,000, including
$296,000 allocated to property and equipment, $48,000 to general and
administrative expenses, and $1,405,000 to goodwill. The Company accounted for
the acquisition using the purchase method. The Company consolidated ACA's
financial results for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2000. ACA's capital
consists of 1,500,000 shares of common stock, and 1,400,000 shares were assigned
to the Company in the course of the acquisition. The remaining 100,000 shares
owned by certain minority interests are to be assigned to the Company after a
statutory period has lapsed. The Company has entered into an agreement to
transfer the shares upon lapse of the statutory period. Since all profits and
losses of ACA inure for the benefit of the Company, no minority interest has
been recorded.

Goodwill is recorded for the difference between the fair market value of the
acquired assets and purchase price and is subject to amortization over three
years using the straight-line method.

In the acquisition, the Company issued notes payable for an aggregate amount of
$920,000, which has been paid in July 2000.

7. COMMITMENTS

The Company leases its existing facility, equipment, and furniture under
operating lease agreements that expire between 2000 and 2003. All of these
agreements are cancelable after 2001. Future minimum lease payments, net of
sublease payments of $62,000, at June 30, 2000 were as follows:

to June 30, 1998, respectively.

8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

At June 30, 2000, the Company was authorized to issue up to 22,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, issuable in Series A, B, and C preferred stock. A total of
12,000,000 and 4,914,500 shares have been designated as Series A and B
convertible preferred stock, respectively.

Each share of the Series A and B convertible preferred stock has voting rights
equal to an equivalent number of shares of common stock into which it is
convertible and votes together as one class with the common stock.

At such time and for so long as at least 1,965,800 shares of Series B preferred
stock are issued and remain outstanding, the Company shall not, without the
consent of the holders of two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Series B
preferred stock (i) increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized
shares of Series B preferred stock; (ii) change the rights, preferences,
privileges, or restrictions of the Series B preferred stock, including the
voting rights of the Series B holders; and (iii) create a new class of shares
having rights, preferences, or privileges prior to the shares of Series B
preferred stock or increase the rights, preferences, or privileges or the number
of authorized shares of any class having rights, preferences, or privileges
prior to the shares of Series B preferred stock.

8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (CONTINUED)

At such time and for so long as at least 1,965,800 shares of Series B preferred
stock but less than 3,800,000 shares of Series B preferred stock are issued and
remain outstanding (as adjusted appropriately to reflect any subsequent stock
splits, stock dividends, and the like), the Series B holders, voting separately
as a class, shall be entitled to elect one of the directors of the Company. At
such time and for so long as at least 3,800,000 shares of Series B preferred
stock are issued and remain outstanding, the Series B holders, voting separately
as a class, shall be entitled to elect two of the directors of the Company. At
such time and for so long as at least 3,000,000 shares of Series A preferred
stock are issued and remain outstanding, the Series A holders, voting separately
as a class, shall be entitled to elect one of the directors of the Company.

The holders of Series A and B convertible preferred stock are entitled to
receive noncumulative dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors.
The holders of Series A and B convertible preferred stock will also be entitled
to participate in dividends on common stock, when and if declared by the Board
of Directors, based on the number of shares of common stock held on an
as-if-converted basis. No dividends on convertible preferred stock or common
stock have been declared by the Board of Directors from inception through June
30, 2000.

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company,
including a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets where the beneficial owner of
the Company's common stock and convertible preferred stock owns less than 51% of
the resulting voting power of the surviving entity, the holders of Series A and
B convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive an amount of $0.40 and
$4.07 per share, respectively, plus any declared but unpaid dividends prior to
and in preference to any distribution to the holders of common stock.

8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (CONTINUED)

Each share of the Company's preferred stock shall automatically be converted
into one share of common stock at the then effective applicable conversion price
upon the earlier of: (i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public
offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale of the common stock by the
Company to the public in which: (a) the gross public offering price is not less
than $3.75 per share (as adjusted appropriately to reflect any subsequent stock
splits, stock dividends, and the like); and (b) the aggregate gross offering
price to the public (prior to underwriter commissions and offering expenses) is
not less than $10,000,000 or (ii) the receipt by the Company of the affirmative
vote at a duly noticed shareholders' meeting or pursuant to a duly solicited
written consent of the holders of more than two-thirds of the then outstanding
shares of preferred stock in favor of the conversion of all of the shares of
preferred stock.

Upon the closing of the agreement with Broadcom Corporation and its subsidiary,
AC Acquisition Corp. (see Note 12), all of the Company's outstanding preferred
stock will be exchanged for shares of common stock of Broadcom Corporation at
the same ratio as its outstanding common stock.

COMMON STOCK

In July and August 1997, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 9,000,000
shares of its common stock under the Restricted Common Stock Purchase
Agreements. The stock generally vests over a four-year period. Until shares are
vested, certain restrictions are placed on the transferability of such shares
and provide the Company with the right to repurchase the shares. As of June 30,
2000, 2,208,516 shares are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price of
$0.002 per share.

As of June 30, 2000, the Company has reserved 14,049,004 shares of its common
stock for issuance upon conversion of its Series A and B convertible preferred
stock and 4,979,500 shares of common stock for issuance upon the exercise of
options then outstanding and available for grant under the Company's 1997 Stock
Option Plan.

1997 STOCK OPTION PLAN

In July 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the Plan) for
issuance of common stock to eligible participants. The Plan provides for the
granting of options for up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
Incentive stock options (ISOs) and nonstatutory stock options (NSOs) may be
granted under the Plan at prices not less than 100% and 85% of the fair value on
the date of grant. The exercise prices of ISOs and NSOs granted to a 10%
shareholder shall not be less than 110% of fair market value on the date of
grant. Options granted under the Plan generally become exercisable over a
four-year period and generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Expired
options become available under the Plan.

During the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 and for the period from July 16,
1997 (inception) to June 30, 1998, the Company recorded $12,450,000, $1,718,000,
and $619,000 of deferred stock compensation for the excess of the deemed fair
market value over the exercise price at the date of grant related to certain
options granted. Stock-based compensation amortized during the years ended June
30, 2000 and 1999 and for the period from July 16, 1997 (inception) to June 30,
1998, totaled $1,641,000, $449,000, and $87,000, respectively. Compensation
expense is being recognized over the options' vesting period of four years.

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) is required by FAS 123 and has
been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options
under the fair value method prescribed by FAS 123. The fair value of these
options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model for 2000 and a minimum value option pricing model for 1999 and
1998 with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rates: 5.72% to 6.33%,
4.23% to 5.44%, and 5.37% to 6.20% for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively; an
expected life of four years; expected volatility of 75% for 2000 and no
dividends for all periods presented. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options'
vesting period. The Company's pro forma information is as follows:

1997 STOCK OPTION PLAN (CONTINUED)

In February 2000, the Company granted nonemployees options to purchase 7,000
shares of common stock at $0.40 per share. The Company will recognize general
and administrative expenses related to nonemployee stock options over the
respective consultants' service periods, and that expense will be based on the
fair value of the stock options using the minimum value option valuation model.
Stock-based compensation recognized in connection with nonemployee options in
2000 totaled $10,000.

9. 401(k) RETIREMENT PLAN

The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement savings plan for its full-time
employees over the age of 21 years. Each participant in the plan may elect to
contribute up to 15% of annual compensation to the plan. The Company, at its
discretion, may make contributions to the plan. There were no matching
contributions made during the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 and for the
period from July 16, 1997 (inception) to June 30, 1998. The Company's expenses
related to the plan have been immaterial.

</TABLE>

The net valuation allowance increased by $505,000, $1,045,000, and $300,000
during the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 and for the period from July 16,
1997 (inception) to June 30, 1998, respectively. The valuation allowance has
been provided due to the uncertainty of the realizability of the respective
amount of deferred tax assets.

As of June 30, 2000, the Company had federal and state research and development
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $45,000 and $25,000, respectively.

Utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to a
substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided
by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions.
The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and
tax credits before utilization. Events that cause limitations in the amount of
net operating losses that the Company may utilize in any one year include, but
are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined,
over a three-year period.

11. LITIGATION

On December 17, 1999 a plaintiff filed an action in the Eastern District of
California, United States District Court, alleging that the Company's AC 108R
series of Switched Repeater products infringes its patent. The Company has also
been named as respondent in an International Trade Commission investigation of
the same case. The Company believes that it has meritorious defense to the claim
made by the plaintiff and intend to vigorously defend itself against the claim.
Although the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted, management believes that the
outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

Subsequent to June 30, 2000, the Company granted 7,493,000 options to purchase
shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $3.17 per share.

In July 2000, the Company entered into a number of sales agreements whereby
certain customers were granted warrants to purchase the Company's common stock
in the aggregate amount of 41,202,000 shares at the exercise price of $0.001 per
share. The warrants vest as the customers meet certain minimum purchase
requirements and the customers are subject to substantial penalties if they do
not purchase the minimum amounts. The penalty provisions included in the
agreements represent sufficiently large disincentives for nonperformance. As
such, the measurement date of the fair value of the warrants is the grant date.
In addition, the fair value of the warrants are based on the fair value of the
consideration received, which is considered to be more readily measurable than
the fair value of the warrants. The Company will reduce future revenues by the
fair value of the warrants as they are earned.

On July 28, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Broadcom
Corporation and its subsidiary, AC Acquisition Corp., whereby all of the capital
stock of the Company will be exchanged for shares of common stock of Broadcom
Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will merge with AC
Acquisition Corp. with the Company being the surviving entity.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
  of NewPort Communications, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NewPort Communications, Inc.
(the Company) as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related statements of
operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of NewPort Communications, Inc. as of December
31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

      Unaudited Information - The information set forth in these financial
      statements as of June 30, 2000 and for the six months ended June 30, 1999
      and 2000 is unaudited and reflects all adjustments, consisting only of
      normal recurring adjustments, that, in the opinion of management, are
      necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of
      operations of the Company for the period. Results of operations for the
      interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of
      operations for the full fiscal year.

      Reverse Stock Split and Stock Split - On November 3, 1998, the Company's
      Board of Directors approved and effected a .5714286-for-1 reverse stock
      split of the Company's common stock, and on April 4, 2000, the Company's
      Board of Directors approved and effected a 3-for-2 stock split. All common
      share amounts in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes have
      been restated to reflect the stock splits for all periods presented.

      Basis of Presentation - The accompanying financial statements have been
      prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
      the United States of America.

      Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid
      investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
      equivalents. Historically, the Company has invested excess cash in U.S.
      Treasury-backed money market funds. Approximately $22,800,000 and
      $17,545,000 (unaudited) was invested in one money market fund at December
      31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, respectively.

      Accounts Receivable - The Company's 1997, 1998, and the majority of 1999
      revenue is composed primarily of Integrated Circuit design services.
      Therefore, the year-end accounts receivable for those years represent
      uncollected design services revenue. During 1999, the Company transitioned
      from a service-based organization to a product-based company, following
      the "fabless" semiconductor


                                                                              29

      business model. As a result, the June 30, 2000 accounts receivable balance
      represents uncollected product sales revenue. The Company performs ongoing
      credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
      collateral. The Company periodically evaluates the need for reserves for
      credit losses and returns and has determined that no reserve was necessary
      for the period January 1, 1997 through June 30, 2000. It is the Company's
      intention to evaluate the need for allowances for product returns as
      future production volumes may require.

      Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of
      accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization
      are calculated under the straight-line basis over the estimated useful
      lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years. Computer
      software consists of purchased software.

      Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized upon shipment of the related
      product or performance of the related service. The Company's deferred
      revenue at June 30, 2000 and December 31, 1999 relates to cash received in
      advance of product shipments to a customer. The Company will recognize
      this revenue when it meets product delivery and acceptance requirements in
      accordance with the related customer contract.

      Warranties and Returns - The Company warrants products against substantial
      nonconformance to customer specifications for up to one year from the date
      of shipment. As of December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, there have been no
      warranty costs or returns associated with product shipments.

      Research and Development - Research and development costs are expensed
      as incurred.

      Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions
      of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting
      for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach in
      accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax liability
      or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable
      to temporary differences in the recognition of accounting transactions for
      tax and financial statement reporting purposes and from tax loss or credit
      carryforwards. Measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax
      laws. In the event the future consequence of differences result in a
      deferred tax asset, SFAS No. 109 requires an evaluation of the probability
      of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset. A
      valuation allowance related to a deferred asset is recorded when it is
      more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset
      will not be realized.

      Stock-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based awards to
      employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting
      Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.


                                                                              30

      Use of Estimates - The financial statements have been prepared in
      conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
      States of America, which require management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the
      financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
      from these estimates.

      Comprehensive Income - The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
      Comprehensive Income. This statement established standards for the
      reporting of comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive
      income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a
      period from nonowner sources. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998,
      and 1999, and for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 2000 there were
      no differences between net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

      New Accounting Pronouncements - In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
      Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
      and Hedging Activities (as amended), which the Company is required to
      adopt effective in its fiscal year 2001. SFAS No. 133 will require the
      Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The
      Company does not currently hold derivatives or engage in hedging
      activities but will continue to evaluate the effect of adopting SFAS No.
      133. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 in its fiscal year 2001.

4.    INCOME TAXES

      At December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
      approximately $4,800,000 and $2,400,000 for federal and state income tax
      purposes, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards will
      completely expire in the year 2019 and 2004 for federal and state
      purposes, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards are
      available to offset future federal and state taxable income. The ability
      of the Company to utilize the federal and state net operating loss carry
      forwards may be subject to annual limitations under certain provisions of
      the Internal Revenue Code, as a result of ownership changes. The Company
      has recorded a full valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets
      generated to date, as a result of losses incurred since its inception. The
      provision for income taxes represents the minimum required for state
      taxes.

      Effective for the period beginning January 1, 1997 and ending December 31,
      1997, the Company elected to be taxed for federal and state purposes under
      the provisions of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable
      sections of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. Accordingly, the tax
      accounts and taxable


                                                                              33

      income as of December 31, 1997 are treated as if they were distributed to
      the shareholders, who were responsible for any taxes due. However, in
      accordance with the provisions of the California Revenue and Taxation
      Code, regarding S corporations, the Company paid tax equal to 1.5% of the
      Company's taxable income for the year ended December 31, 1997. The
      Company's election to be taxed as a Subchapter S corporation was rescinded
      effective January 1, 1998.

      As a result of the Company's S corporation election, effective January 1,
      1997, the Company was no longer subject to federal income taxes. However,
      the Company was subject to a 1.5% income tax on its California taxable
      income for the year ended December 31, 1997. As a result of the change in
      the Company's tax status, the Company reduced its deferred tax liability
      by $36,052 as of January 1, 1997 which amount has been included in the
      deferred tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1997.

      On January 1, 1998, the company rescinded its election to be treated as an
      S corporation. As a result of the termination of S corporation status, the
      Company became subject to federal and state income taxes at statutory C
      corporation rates. The Company recorded a $75,177 deferred tax liability
      to reflect the deferred tax items accruing up to the date of the S
      corporation revocation, pursuant to the Company's C corporation rates.

      The income tax (benefit) provision consists of the following for the years
      ended December 31, 1997, 1998, and 1999:

      The holders of convertible preferred stock have various rights and
      preferences as follows:

      Voting - Each holder of shares of preferred stock shall be entitled to the
      number of votes equal to an equivalent number of shares of common stock
      into which it is convertible, voting together as a single class with
      holders of common stock. In addition to these voting rights, the following
      protective provisions exist for holders of preferred stock:

      As long as at least 1,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock are
      outstanding (adjusted for stock splits of, stock dividends on, or
      recapitalizations of the Series A preferred stock), the Company must
      obtain approval from a majority of the holders of Series A preferred stock
      in order to: (i) increase the number of authorized shares of common stock
      or Series A preferred stock; (ii) change or materially alter the rights of
      the shares of Series A preferred stock; (iii) authorize or issue any
      equity security having liquidation or dividend preferences on parity with
      or priority over the Series A preferred stock; (iv) increase or decrease
      the authorized number of members on the Company's Board of Directors; (v)
      redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any share or shares of common stock
      or preferred stock (except Series A preferred stock) other than by the
      normal repurchase provisions associated with various agreements that
      enable the Company to repurchase shares upon certain events, such as the
      termination of employment; (vi) declare or pay any dividends or
      distributions (other than a dividend payable solely in shares of common
      stock) on any shares of common stock or preferred stock (other than Series
      A and Series B preferred stock); and (vii) effect a merger,
      reorganization, consolidation or a sale of all or substantially all of the
      Company's assets where the existing stockholders retain less than 50% of
      the voting power of the successor to the Company's business.

      As long as at least 1,000,000 shares of Series B preferred stock are
      outstanding (adjusted for stock splits of, stock dividends on, or
      recapitalizations of the Series B preferred stock), the Company must
      obtain approval from a majority of the holders of Series B preferred stock
      in order to: (i) increase the number of authorized shares of common stock
      or preferred stock; (ii) change or materially alter the rights of the
      shares of Series B preferred stock; (iii) authorize or issue any equity
      security having liquidation or dividend preferences on parity with or
      priority over the Series B preferred stock; (iv) increase or decrease the
      authorized number of members on the Company's Board of Directors; (v)
      redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any share or shares of common stock
      other than by the normal repurchase provisions associated with various
      agreements that enable the Company to repurchase shares upon certain
      events, such as the termination of employment; (vi) declare or pay any
      dividends or distributions (other than a dividend payable solely in shares
      of common stock) on any shares of common stock; and (vii) effect a merger,
      reorganization, consolidation, or a sale of all or substantially all of
      the Company's assets where the existing stockholders retain less than 50%
      of the voting power of the successor to the Company's business.

      Dividends - Holders of Series A and B preferred stock are entitled to
      receive noncumulative dividends at the annual rate of $0.65 and $0.34 per
      share, respectively, when and if declared by the Board of Directors. The
      holders of Series A and Series B preferred stock are also entitled to
      participate in cash


                                                                              36

NEWPORT COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

      dividends on common stock, when and if declared by the Board of Directors,
      based upon the number of shares of common stock held on an as-converted
      basis. The Board of Directors has not declared the foregoing dividends
      from inception through June 30, 2000.

      Conversion - Each share of Series A and Series B preferred stock is
      convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into shares of common
      stock at a specific conversion ratio subject to adjustment for dilutive
      issuances, stock splits and combinations. As of June 30, 2000, the current
      conversion ratio for Series A and Series B preferred stock is 1.5 shares
      of common stock for each share of preferred stock. Each share of preferred
      stock shall automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the
      then effective conversion ratio immediately preceding the closing of a
      public offering of common stock in which the public price per share of
      common stock is not less than $9.00 and the gross proceeds received by the
      Company in such offering is at least $20,000,000.

      Liquidation Preference - In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
      winding up of the Company, distributions to the preferred stockholders
      shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: The holders of
      preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to
      any distribution of any of the assets of the Corporation to holders of
      common stock: (i) in the case of Series A preferred stock, an amount per
      share equal to the sum of (a) $0.8125 (the original Series A issue price)
      for each outstanding share of Series A preferred stock, adjusted for stock
      splits of, stock dividends on, or recapitalization of, the Series A
      preferred stock, and (b) an amount equal to any declared but unpaid
      dividends in respect of such share; and (ii) in the case of Series B
      preferred stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of (a) $4.2930 (the
      original Series B issue price) for each outstanding share of Series B
      preferred stock, adjusted for stock splits of, stock dividends on, or
      recapitalization of, the Series B preferred stock, and (b) an amount equal
      to any declared but unpaid dividends in respect of such share. If the
      assets and funds distributed among the holders of the preferred stock
      shall be insufficient to permit the payment of the aforementioned amounts,
      then the available assets of the Company shall be distributed ratably
      among holders of the Series A preferred stock and Series B preferred stock
      in proportion to the liquidation preference of each series. Upon the
      completion of the distribution to the preferred stock described above, the
      remaining assets, if any, of the Company available for distribution to
      stockholders shall be distributed ratably among the holders of common
      stock in proportion to the number of shares of common stock owned by each
      holder.

6.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

      Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted a 401(k) savings plan
      covering all employees. Employees who work for the Company are eligible
      for participation on the first day of the month following their employment
      start date. Company contributions to the 401(k) savings plan are made at
      the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company made no
      contributions for the year ending December 31, 1999 or for the six months
      ending June 30, 2000.


                                                                              37

7.    STOCK OPTION PLAN

      On November 16, 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Stock Option/Stock
      Issuance Plan (the 1998 Plan). Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, options
      to purchase 9,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock are available
      for issuance to employees, directors and consultants.

      At December 31, 1999, options to purchase 457,125 shares of the Company's
      common stock were outstanding under the 1998 Plan. Options are granted at
      exercise prices which approximate the fair value of the common stock on
      the date of grant as determined by the Company's Board of Directors.
      Generally, 25% of the options vest at the end of one year, while the
      remainder are exercisable ratably over the next 36-month period, provided
      the optionee remains in service to the Company. The options expire within
      ten years from the date of grant or upon three months after termination of
      employment for reasons other than death, disability or misconduct. At
      December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, 3,303,750 and 1,743,875 shares
      (unaudited), respectively, were available for future grants under the
      plan.

      Stock option activity for each of the three years in the period ended
      December 31, 1999 and for the six months ended June 30, 2000 is as
      follows:

      The weighted average contractual life of stock options outstanding was 9.3
      years as of December 31, 1999.

      The Company will record future compensation expense of approximately
      $3,500,000 relating to options granted at a fair value of $2.86 during the
      six months ended June 30, 2000, to purchase 1,434,450 shares of common
      stock. The expense equals the difference between the deemed fair market
      value of the Company's common stock on the grant date and the exercise
      price of the stock options and will be recognized ratably over the
      four-year vesting period of the stock options. The Company recorded
      $200,561 of expense associated with such option grants during the six
      months ended June 30, 2000.

      Additionally, the Company will record future compensation expense of
      approximately $557,000 relating to options granted to consultants during
      the six months ended June 30, 2000 to purchase 229,925 shares of common
      stock. The Company recorded $63,237 of expense associated with such option
      grants during the six months ended June 30, 2000. Additionally, such
      options will be subject to variable plan accounting which may result in
      additional compensation expense as the options vest.

      Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
      Stock-Based Compensation, requires the disclosure of pro forma net income
      and earnings per share had the Company adopted the fair value approach to
      account for all its employee stock-based compensation plans. After taking
      into account the fair value method of stock compensation using a dividend
      yield of 0%, a risk-free interest rate of 6%, an expected life of three
      months, and a volatility factor of 0%, management determined that the
      difference between reported net income and pro forma net income is not
      material for any of the periods presented.


8.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

      Leases - In October 1999, the Company entered into a 66 month lease for
      approximately 17,100 square feet of office space. The new lease amounts
      are approximately $13,250 per month through March 31, 2000, and
      approximately $26,500 per month through October 15, 2000. Thereafter, the
      monthly lease payment increases every 12 months in accordance with a
      prenegotiated rent schedule. The Company is also a party to various
      equipment operating leases.



                                                                              39

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                December 31, 1999


1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Silicon Spice Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of California
on September 26, 1996. The Company is a development stage entity focused on the
development and marketing of telecommunications processing solutions based on
signal processing chips and related software tools.

The Company's activities to date have consisted principally of conducting
research and development activities, raising capital, arranging for facilities
and recruiting management and technical personnel. Accordingly, the Company is
considered to be a development stage company.

In the course of these activities, the Company has incurred significant losses
and expects additional losses in the year ending December 31, 2000. The Company
continues to work on unproven technology and development projects which require
substantial expenditures to complete, and ultimately may be unsuccessful.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

The company classifies its short-term investments as available-for-sale. Such
investments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices with
unrealized gains and losses, which are considered to be temporary, recorded as
other comprehensive income or loss until realized.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from three to five years.


                                                                              49

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Costs to develop the Company's products are expensed as incurred in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2, "Accounting for Research
and Development Costs," which established accounting and reporting standards for
research and development costs.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company accounts for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), and
has adopted the disclosure-only alternative of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123").

INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the
use of the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.


                                                                              50

7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (CONTINUED)

Each share of convertible preferred stock is convertible into fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock at the option of the holder based upon the
conversion rate then in effect, which initially is one share of common stock for
each share of preferred stock. Such conversion is subject to certain
anti-dilution provisions. Mandatory conversion into common stock for convertible
preferred stock occurs upon the closing of an underwritten public offering of
the Company's common stock at an aggregate public offering price of at least $25
million and a per share price of at least $8.17 or upon approval of the holders
of two-thirds or more of the total number of shares of convertible preferred
stock outstanding; however, Series D convertible preferred stock will only
convert if two-thirds of the holders of Series D convertible preferred stock
approve the conversion.

The holder of each share of convertible preferred stock has the right to one
vote for each share of common stock into which the preferred stock can be
converted.

The holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D convertible preferred
stock are entitled to noncumulative annual dividends of $0.04, $0.07, $0.19, and
$0.35 per share, respectively, as declared by the Board of Directors, prior to
the payment of dividends to the holders of the common stock. No dividends had
been declared as of December 31, 1999.

In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, holders
of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D convertible preferred stock are
entitled to receive a liquidation preference equal to $0.61, $1.13, $3.00, and
$5.45 per share, respectively, plus declared and unpaid dividends. If upon the
occurrence of such event, the assets and funds available for distribution among
the holders of convertible preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the
payment to such holders of the full preferential amounts, then the entire assets
and funds of the Company legally available for distribution to the shareholders
shall be distributed among the holders of the convertible preferred stock pro
rata to the full preferential amount each such holder is entitled to receive.
After payment has been made to the holders of convertible preferred stock, the
remaining assets and funds legally available for distribution shall be
distributed ratably among the holders of common stock and convertible preferred
stock pro rata, on the basis of number of shares of common stock outstanding and
issuable upon the assumed conversion of the preferred stock, until the holders
of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D convertible preferred stock have
received $1.83, $2.26, $6.00, and $8.17 per share, respectively.


                                                                              54

STOCK OPTIONS AND COMMON STOCK

The Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), as amended, provides for
7,891,978 shares of common stock reserved for the issuance of incentive stock
options ("ISO's") to employees or non-statutory stock options ("NSO's") to
consultants and directors. The ISO's may be granted at a price per share not
less than the fair market value at the date of grant. The NSO's may be granted
at a price per share not less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of
grant. Options may be exercised immediately and generally vest over four years.
Common shares purchased under the Plan are subject to certain restrictions,
including the right of first refusal by the Company for sale or transfer of
these shares to outside parties. As of December 31, 1999, 3,547,197 shares of
common stock have been issued in connection with the exercise of stock options
or restricted stock grants which have not vested and are subject to repurchase.

The company has issued 3,425,000 shares of common stock to certain founders and
executives that are subject to repurchase by the Company until they vest, which
occurs ratably over 48 months of continued employment. As of December 31, 1999,
1,314,448 of these shares are unvested and are subject to repurchase at amounts
ranging from $0.05 to $0.125 per share (weighted-average of $0.097 per share).

Activity under the Plan is summarized as follows:

STOCK OPTIONS AND COMMON STOCK (CONTINUED)

FAS 123 requires the disclosure of pro forma net income (loss) as if the Company
had adopted the fair value method since the Company's inception. The fair value
of options was estimated at the date of grant using the minimum value method
with a risk-free interest rate of 5.5%, a weighted-average expected option life
of 5 years and 0% volatility, for both 1999 and 1998. Based on the application
of the fair value methodology, the pro forma losses of the Company for 1999 and
1998 were not materially different from the reported historical losses.

WARRANTS

At December 31, 1999, the Company has 232,102 warrants outstanding to purchase
shares of Series B convertible preferred stock with an exercise price of $2.07
per share and 93,333 warrants outstanding to purchase Series C convertible
preferred stock with an exercise price of $3.00 per share. These warrants have
terms ranging from seven years to ten years (or three years from the effective
date of the Company's initial public offering, whichever is earlier). The
Company has also committed to issue 73,008 warrants to purchase shares of Series
B convertible stock with an exercise price of $1.13 per share. These warrants
were issued, or committed to, in connection with the Company's equipment
financing activities. Using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the warrants were
determined to have a fair value of $188,518, which is being charged to interest
expense over the term of the related financings.

Certain Series D Preferred Stock investors were issued warrants granting them,
in the aggregate, the right to purchase shares of common stock equal to 3% of
the number of shares of common stock issued at the time of the Company's initial
public offering.

STOCK ISSUED FOR PATENT RIGHTS

In May 1999, the Company entered into an exclusive patent license agreement
under which it issued 355,140 shares of common stock and paid $69,251 in
exchange for certain exclusive patent rights. The Company recognized $175,793 as
the value of the patents which will be amortized straight-line over a 5-year
life. Under the agreement, the Company must make a first commercial sale of a
licensed product and/or a first commercial performance of a licensed process on
or before January 1, 2001 to be in compliance with the agreement.

NOTES RECEIVABLE

The Company has full-recourse notes receivable of $502,016 at December 31, 1999
($268,016 at December 31, 1998) related to the exercise of stock options by
certain employees of the Company. The notes bear interest at 8% per annum, are
secured by the employee's shares of common stock of the Company and are due on
dates ranging from February 2002 to December 2004.

8. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

The Company has a defined contribution plan ("401(k) Plan") under the provisions
of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering all eligible employees.
Employees may contribute to the 401(k) Plan annually up to the Internal Revenue
Service limit. The plan provides for discretionary employer contributions.
Expenses recognized related to the Company's contribution to the plan totaled
approximately $280,000, $78,000, and $0 in the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998, and 1997, respectively.

9. INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 1999, the Company has available federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $29.0 million for federal income tax purposes,
which will expire in the years 2012 through 2019. Due to the "change in
ownership" provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, utilization of the
Company's net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.

At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets of
approximately $11.9 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which relate
primarily to the future tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards. The
deferred tax assets have been entirely offset by a valuation allowance, which
increased by approximately $7.7 million and $3.6 million in the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, primarily as a result of the increase
in the net operating loss carryforwards.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                  JUNE 30, 2000


    1.  Basis of Presentation

         The condensed financial statements included herein are unaudited;
however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments which, in
the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial
position of Silicon Spice, Inc. (the "Company") at June 30, 2000 and the results
of its operations and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and
1999. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2000 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

         The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not
include footnotes and certain financial presentations normally required under
generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, these financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes
thereto for the year ended December 31, 1999, included in Broadcom Corporation's
Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on or about November 9, 2000 within which these unaudited condensed financial
statements have been included.

        Recent Accounting Pronouncements

        In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 was effective for all fiscal
quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. In August 1999, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, An
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which defers the effective date of SFAS No.
133 to all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In
June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No.
133. SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards
for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities. The Company does not currently hold


                                                                              64

                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


any derivatives and does not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact
on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

        In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44 Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation - an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25 (FIN 44). This Interpretation clarifies the definition of an
employee for purposes of applying APB 25, the criteria for determining whether a
plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequence of various
modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and the
accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2000, but certain
conclusions in this Interpretation cover specific events that occur after either
December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The adoption of FIN 44 is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

    2.  Subsequent Event

    In October 2000, the Company completed a transaction whereby it was acquired
by Broadcom Corporation. In connection with the acquisition, Broadcom
Corporation issued an aggregate of approximately 5.0 million shares of its Class
A Common Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of the Company's preferred
and common stock and the assumed exercise of outstanding employee stock options,
warrants and other rights, including approximately 9.3 million employee stock
options that were granted in July 2000.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

   The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
give effect to the acquisitions by Broadcom Corporation (the "Company") of
Altima Communications, Inc. ("Altima"), NewPort Communications, Inc. ("NewPort")
and Silicon Spice Inc. ("Silicon Spice"), collectively, the "Acquired
Companies." These acquisitions were completed on September 7, 2000, October 3,
2000 and October 6, 2000, respectively.

   The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of
Operations (the "Pro Forma Statements of Operations") for the twelve months
ended December 31, 1999 and the six months ended June 30, 2000 give effect to
each of the acquisitions of the Acquired Companies, accounted for as purchase
business combinations, as if each had occurred on January 1, 1999. The Pro Forma
Statements of Operations are based on historical results of operations of the
Company and each of the Acquired Companies for the twelve months ended December
31, 1999 and the six months ended June 30, 2000. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Balance Sheet (the "Pro Forma Balance Sheet") gives effect to
each acquisition as if each had occurred on June 30, 2000. The Pro Forma
Statements of Operations and Pro Forma Balance Sheet and accompanying notes (the
"Pro Forma Financial Information") should be read in conjunction with, and are
qualified by reference to, the historical financial statements of the Company
and the Acquired Companies and the related notes thereto.

   The Pro Forma Financial Information is intended for informational purposes
only and is not necessarily indicative of the future financial position or
future results of operations of the Company after the acquisitions of the
Acquired Companies, or of the financial position or results of operations of the
Company that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions of the Acquired
Companies been effected on January 1, 1999.

2. PRO FORMA ASSUMPTIONS

   The following represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price
over the historical net book values of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities of the Acquired Companies at June 30, 2000, and is included for
illustrative pro forma purposes only. The Company is in the process of obtaining
independent appraisals of the fair value of acquired in-process research and
development and identifiable intangible assets as of the acquisition dates.
Accordingly, these allocations are preliminary and are subject to change upon
the completion of the independent third party valuations. Assuming the
transactions had occurred on June 30, 2000, the preliminary allocations would
have been as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>

   The purchase price of Altima consists of approximately 5,427,000 shares of
common stock which includes a) approximately 1,530,000 shares of common stock
valued at $332.9 million based upon the Company's stock price for a short period
just before and after the Company and Altima reached agreement and the proposed
transaction was announced, b) approximately 2,890,000 shares for
performance-based warrants valued at $689.4 million based upon the Company's
stock price on the day the acquisition closed, and c) approximately 1,007,000
shares of restricted common stock and employee stock

                                                                              69

options valued at $197.6 million in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44,
"Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation - an
Interpretation of APB No. 25" ("FIN 44").

   The purchase price of NewPort consists of approximately 5,622,000 shares of
common stock which includes a) approximately 4,254,000 shares of common stock
valued at $1,001.6 million based upon the Company's stock price for a short
period just before and after the Company and NewPort reached agreement and the
proposed transaction was announced and b) approximately 1,368,000 shares of
restricted common stock and employee stock options valued at $284.0 million in
accordance with FIN 44.

   The purchase price of Silicon Spice consists of approximately 4,991,000
shares of common stock which includes a) approximately 3,504,000 shares of
common stock valued at $834.9 million based upon the Company's stock price for a
short period just before and after the Company and Silicon Spice reached
agreement and the proposed transaction was announced, b) approximately 40,000
shares for performance-based warrants valued at $9.0 million based upon the
Company's stock price on the day the acquisition closed, and c) approximately
1,447,000 shares of restricted common stock and employee stock options valued at
$292.1 million in accordance with FIN 44.

   For purposes of the pro forma financial information, the estimated amount of
the in-process research and development is $421.5 million for the Acquired
Companies, which is based upon preliminary independent third party valuations.
Because such in-process research and development did not reach the stage of
technological feasibility by the acquisition date and is expected to have no
alternative future use, this amount shall be immediately written-off by the
Company and has been reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as a charge
against retained earnings.

3. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     The pro forma financial information reflects the following adjustments:

a)   To record the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and
     purchased intangibles, deferred tax liabilities and deferred stock-based
     compensation.

b)   To accrue estimated transaction costs.

c)   To eliminate the Acquired Companies' common stock and retained earnings
     accounts.

d)   To record the acquisitions of the Acquired Companies' equity securities by
     the issuance of the Company's common stock, restricted common stock and
     assumption of employee stock options and performance-based warrants.

e)   To record the allocation of purchase price to in-process research and
     development.

f)   To record amortization expense for goodwill and purchased intangibles over
     an expected estimated period of benefit ranging from two to five years.

g)   To record stock-based compensation expense generally over a three to
     four-year period.

h)   Reflects the estimated tax effects of the pro forma adjustments. The pro
     forma adjustments for the amortization of goodwill and purchased
     intangibles, in-process research and development, and certain stock-based
     compensation are excluded from such computations, as the Company does not
     expect to realize any benefit from these items.

4. EARNINGS PER SHARE

   Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for each period is calculated by
dividing pro forma net income (loss) by the shares used to calculate earnings
(loss) per share in the historical period plus the effect of the shares and
options which were exchanged or assumed in connection with the acquisitions of
the Acquired Companies. Potential common shares are excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share in a loss period as the effect
would be antidilutive.


                                                                              70
