                      BROADCOM TO ACQUIRE VISIONTECH, LTD.,
               A LEADING SUPPLIER OF MPEG-2 COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY

       Broadcom and VisionTech to Debut a New Generation of Personal Video
    Recording-Enabled Set-Top Boxes at the Western Cable Show in Los Angeles

IRVINE, Calif. and HERZLIYA, ISRAEL - November 28, 2000 - Broadcom Corporation
(Nasdaq: BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband
communications, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to
acquire VisionTech, Ltd., a leading supplier of digital video/audio MPEG-2
compression and decompression chips enabling Personal Video Recording (PVR),
interactive videoconferencing, and Internet Protocol (IP) video streaming for
the consumer electronics market.

Founded in 1996, VisionTech is a privately held, fabless semiconductor company
headquartered in Herzliya, Israel. VisionTech's latest MPEG-2 video/audio
encoder chip, Kfir-2(TM), has been adopted by many set-top box manufacturers,
including Motorola Broadband Communications Sector (formerly General
Instrument), Scientific-Atlanta, Pace, Microsoft WebTV, as well as PVR pioneer
Replay TV.

"Motorola has been working with VisionTech during the past year to incorporate
PVR functionality in the DCT-5000 and our other converged interactive set-top
models," said Dave Robinson, Senior VP and General Manager of Motorola's Digital
Network System business unit. "We have been impressed with VisionTech's
technology and highly talented engineers and applaud both Broadcom and
VisionTech in their decision to combine resources. Broadcom has been a key
supplier to Motorola Broadband for years. This move helps ensure such a
continued role as we evolve our triple-play solutions--enabling broadband
operators worldwide to provide the very best integrated video, voice and
high-speed data services."

Personal Video Recording enables viewers to freeze a live TV program, instantly
replay or rewind a program being watched, and skip ahead in a recorded program
to a favorite movie scene or the next play of a sporting event, offering greater
control over the TV-viewing experience. Viewers will be able to quickly find
programs to watch, as well as to record and view programs of their choice. PVR
can monitor viewers' program preferences and record similar shows for future
viewing.

According to Cahners In-Stat, PVR unit shipments are expected to grow
significantly over the next few years. Between 2001 and 2003, unit shipments of
PVR-enabled set-top boxes are expected to increase approximately 275 percent
each year. During the same period, the installed base of PVR-enabled set-top
boxes is expected to grow to eight million units.

"PVR is one of the most compelling consumer applications which will radically
change the way people watch TV, allowing simultaneous recording and playback of
live broadcast - without a VCR or videotape, " said Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III,
Broadcom's President and CEO. "VisionTech's capability to compress live video in
real time will be used across all of Broadcom's product lines for applications
ranging from distributed video over home networking to IP video streaming over
the Internet, also changing the way people use their computers, digital video
cameras and other consumer electronics to communicate over broadband."

"By 2005, PVR functionality will become an integral component of virtually every
set-top box. We look forward to combining our MPEG expertise with Broadcom's
market-leading broadband technologies," said Amir Morad, VisionTech's President
and CEO. "By integrating our technology with Broadcom's key strengths in
video/audio decompression and broadband communication technologies, we will be
uniquely positioned to address the growing set-top box and home networking
markets."

The combination of Broadcom's family of interactive-TV video decoder devices and
VisionTech's MPEG-2 single-chip compression technology creates the industry's
most advanced and comprehensive solution for next generation PVR-enabled set-top
boxes. This combination will give set-top manufacturers more integrated
features, higher flexibility and improved price/performance. Broadcom and
VisionTech will demonstrate a complete PVR-enabled set-top box solution at the
Western Cable Show, November 29-December 1, at the Los Angeles Convention
Center.

Following the acquisition, VisionTech will form the core of Broadcom Israel, a
new subsidiary that will be managed by Morad. Broadcom Israel will continue to
focus on developing silicon solutions that enable MPEG compression of voice,
video and data as well as evaluate new synergistic technologies from the myriad
start-up companies operating in the region.

In connection with the acquisition, Broadcom will issue in aggregate about 7.96
million shares of its Class A common stock in exchange for substantially all of
the assets of VisionTech and upon exercise of outstanding employee stock options
and other rights of VisionTech. The consideration includes Broadcom Class A
common stock reserved for future issuance to customers upon the exercise of
outstanding performance-based warrants of VisionTech that become exercisable
upon satisfaction of certain customer purchase requirements. The
<PAGE>   3

transaction is expected to close within 60 days and will be accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting. The Boards of Directors of both companies
have approved the transaction, which awaits approval by VisionTech's
shareholders and the satisfaction of regulatory requirements and other customary
closing conditions. Broadcom expects to record a one-time charge for purchased
in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition upon its
consummation.
