</TABLE>

Consolidated revenue for the quarter grew 15% from last year to $1,148 million. 
Revenue growth in the Company's three largest businesses, Employer, Brokerage
and Dealer Services, was strong at 21%, 16% and 7% respectively.  Each includes
some acquisitions.

The primary components of "Other revenue" are claims services, services for
wholesalers, interest income, foreign exchange differences and miscellaneous
processing services.  In addition, "Other revenue" has been reduced to adjust
for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested tax filing
funds and income credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 6%.  

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 19% from last year.  Consolidated
pre-tax margins increased slightly in the quarter, due primarily to the impact
of higher trading volume in Brokerage Services.  Systems development and
programming investments increased to accelerate automation, migrate to new
computing technologies, and develop new products.


<PAGE>

Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher effective tax rate, increased 16%
to $147 million.  The effective tax rate of 31.3% increased from 29.4% in the
comparable quarter last year, primarily as a result of the greater weighting of
taxable versus non-taxable earnings.

Basic earnings per share grew 14% to $.50 from $.44 last year, on a greater
number of shares outstanding.  The Company expects over 15% growth in revenue
and pretax earnings for the full year and basic EPS growth in the area of 13-14%
above fiscal 1997's $1.80 per share (which is prior to non-recurring items in
1997).

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong,
and operations continue to generate a strong cash flow.  At December 31, 1997,
the Company had cash and marketable securities of $1.6 billion.  Shareholders'
equity was $3.0 billion and the ratio of long-term debt to equity was 9%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 1998 are expected to approximate $225 million,
compared to $175 million in fiscal 1997.

During the first half of fiscal 1998, ADP purchased 896,000 shares of common
stock for treasury at an average price of approximately $46.  The Company has
remaining Board authorization to purchase up to 8.5 million additional shares to
fund equity related employee benefit plans.

During the first half of fiscal 1998, 315,000 of the Company's zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes were converted to over 4 million shares of common
stock.  

The Company's investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade fixed 
income investments, such as AA or better rated fixed income municipal 
instruments, maturing in less than 7 years and such portfolio does not subject
the Company to material market risk.
