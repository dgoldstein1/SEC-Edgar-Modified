                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OPERATING RESULTS

Revenue and earnings again reached record levels during the quarter ended
September 30, 1998.

Revenue and revenue growth by ADP's major business units for the three months
ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 are shown below:

     Employer Services     $  695      $   587         18%        20%
     Brokerage Services       252          223         13         19

                           ------      -------         --        --- 
                           $1,210      $ 1,038         17%        14%
                           ======      =======         ==        === 

Consolidated revenue for the quarter of $1,210 million was up 17% from last
year. Revenue growth in the Company's three largest businesses, Employer,
Brokerage and Dealer Services, was strong at 18%, 13%, and 9%, respectively.

The primary components of "Other" revenue are claims services, interest income,
foreign exchange differences, and miscellaneous processing services. In
addition, "Other" revenue has been reduced to adjust for the difference between
actual interest income earned on invested tax filing funds and income credited
to Employer Services at a standard rate of 6%.

Pretax earnings for the quarter increased 19% to $182 million. Systems
development and programming investments increased to accelerate automation,
migrate to new computing technologies, and develop new products.

Net earnings for the quarter, after a higher effective tax rate, increased 17%
to $123 million. The effective tax rate of 32.4% increased from 31.3% in the
comparable quarter last year, primarily as a result of the greater weighting of
taxable versus non-taxable earnings.

Diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $0.40 from $0.35 last year.

For the full year, we expect double digit revenue growth and diluted earnings
per share growth of 13-16%.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's financial condition and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong,
and operations continue to generate a strong cash flow. At September 30, 1998,
the Company had cash and marketable securities of $1.9 billion. Shareholders'
equity was $3.5 billion and the ratio of long-term debt to equity was 5%.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 1999 are expected to approximate $200 million,
compared to $199 million in fiscal 1998.

During the quarter, ADP purchased 108,500 shares of common stock for treasury at
an average price of about $65. At September 30, 1998, the Company had remaining
Board authorization to purchase up to 8.4 million additional shares to fund
equity related employee benefit plans.

The Company's investment portfolio for corporate and client funds consists
primarily of fixed income securities subject to interest rate risk, including
reinvestment risk. The Company has historically had the ability to hold these
investments until maturity, and therefore this has not had an adverse impact on
income or cash flows.

OTHER MATTERS

The majority of the Company's services involve computer processing and, as such,
the Year 2000 could have a significant impact on the Company's products and
services. As a result, the Company has worked for several years addressing both
internal and third-party Year 2000 compliance issues. To date, the Company has
completed its process of identifying and assessing Year 2000 issues related to
its mission-critical systems and is currently in the remediation and testing
phases. The Company plans to have the majority of mission-critical systems Year
2000 compliant by December 31, 1998, with the few remaining systems, primarily
from recent acquisitions, compliant by March 31, 1999. In addition, the Company
has been actively working with external agencies and partners, including
governmental agencies, to determine and conform to their Year 2000 compliance
plans. Third-party interface testing and resolution of Year 2000 issues with
external agencies and partners is dependent upon those third parties completing
their own Year 2000 remediation efforts.

The Year 2000 remediation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company's overall results, as these costs are not expected to be
substantially different from normal recurring costs that are incurred for
systems development and implementation.

This report contains "forward-looking statements" based on management's
expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from those expressed. Factors that could cause
differences include: ADP's success in obtaining, retaining and selling
additional services to clients; the pricing of products and services; overall
economic trends, including interest rate and foreign currency trends; impact of
Year 2000; stock market activity; auto sales and related industry changes;
employment levels; changes in technology; availability of skilled technical
associates and the impact of new acquisitions.
