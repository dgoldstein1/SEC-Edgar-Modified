                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus contain
forward-looking statements, including statements regarding expectations of
future profitability of our US books business, sales growth, gross margin and
improvement in operating loss, all of which are inherently difficult to predict.
These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and
are subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.
Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including the
Internet and online commerce growing at a slower rate than we anticipate, the
amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of
those investments, customer spending patterns, the mix of products sold to
customers, the mix of revenues derived from product sales as compared to
services, risks of inventory management, and risks of distribution and
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include
Amazon.com's limited operating history, anticipated losses, potential
fluctuations in quarterly operating results, seasonality, consumer trends,
competition, risks associated with the distribution center expansion, adverse
consequences arising from system interruptions, risks associated with management
of potential growth, risks related to auction and zShops services, risks related
to fraud and Amazon.com Payments, and risks of new business areas, international
expansion, business combinations and strategic alliances. Other potential risks
and uncertainties are set forth herein under "Risk Factors," as well as
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources." Except as required by law, we
undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however,
carefully review the factors set forth in other reports or documents that we
file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                                    SUMMARY

     The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed
information and financial statements, including the notes thereto, included or
incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. All information herein
is adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 split of our common stock effected on June 1,
1998, the 3-for-1 split of our common stock effected on January 4, 1999 and the
2-for-1 split of our common stock effected on September 1, 1999, except that the
September 1, 1999 2-for-1 split is not reflected in the December 31, 1998
audited consolidated financial statements. References in this prospectus
supplement to "Amazon.com," "we," "us," or "our" mean Amazon.com, Inc. and its
subsidiaries unless the context indicates another meaning.

     Amazon.com seeks to be the world's most customer-centric company where
customers can find and discover anything they may want to buy online. We believe
we have the leading platform for retailing on the Internet. This platform
consists of strong brand recognition, a large and growing group of customers,
innovative technology, extensive and sophisticated distribution capabilities,
and significant e-commerce expertise.

     Amazon.com is the world's leading online retailer. Amazon.com directly
offers for sale millions of distinct items in categories such as books, music,
toys, electronics, videos, DVDs, home improvement products, software and video
games. Through our marketplace services such as Amazon.com Auctions, zShops and
sothebys.amazon.com, we have created Web-based marketplaces where buyers and
sellers can enter into transactions with respect to a wide range of products.
Amazon.com has also invested in and developed strategic commercial relationships
with a number of selected e-commerce companies. Amazon.com offers its customers
a superior shopping experience by providing high value through selection,
convenience, ease of use, product information and an intense focus on customer
service. Amazon.com is a proven technology leader, having developed electronic
commerce innovations such as 1-Click technology, personalized shopping services,
easy-to-use search and browse features, secure payment protections and wireless
access to the Amazon.com site. In 1999, Amazon.com significantly expanded its
distribution capabilities worldwide with the addition of eight new distribution
centers comprising approximately four million square feet of warehouse and
distribution space. These new facilities increase our control over the
distribution process and facilitate our ability to deliver merchandise to
customers on a reliable and timely basis.

     Amazon.com has served over 17 million customer accounts in over 150
countries. In addition to our US Web site, we currently have two internationally
focused Web sites located at www.amazon.co.uk and www.amazon.de. Each of
Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de was ranked the number one e-commerce site and the
number 10 most visited site overall in the UK and Germany, respectively,
according to the Media Metrix ratings for Europe released in January 2000. Both
of these sites were launched in October 1998, and currently have product and
service offerings consisting of books, music, auctions and zShops. These
international sites have the same look, feel and functionality as the US Web
site, including 1-Click technology, personalized recommendations and product
reviews, but offer content, products and services tailored to the local market.
The Amazon.de Web site is presented in the German language. In the fourth
quarter of 1999, combined sales from these sites totaled $71 million, a 360%
increase from the fourth quarter of 1998. We currently have distribution centers
and customer service centers in the UK and Germany.

     Amazon.com intends to continue to expand internationally by increasing the
product and service offerings on Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de, establishing new
Web sites focused on particular international markets, entering into strategic
relationships that enhance our international operations and continuing to sell
products from the US to international customers. We believe that there are
significant e-commerce opportunities outside of the US and that Amazon.com is
extremely well-positioned to be a global e-commerce leader given the platform we
have created in the US and our experience in international markets to date.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On January 21, 2000, we announced that we had agreed to acquire 5% of the
outstanding shares of Greenlight.com, an online car buying service, and warrants

this investment, we also announced that we had entered into a promotional

     On January 24, 2000, we announced that we had agreed to make an additional
$30 million investment in drugstore.com, an online retail and information source

drugstore.com common stock. We also agreed to create a health and beauty store

Amazon.com will receive $105 million over a three-year period.

     On January 31, 2000, we announced that we had agreed to acquire 5% of
Audible, Inc., a leader in Internet-delivered spoken audio for PC-based
listening or playback on AudibleReady (TM) portable digital audio devices. In
connection with this investment, we also announced that we had entered into an
agreement to feature on the Amazon.com Web site content and services from
Audible, Inc. in exchange for payments of $30 million to us over a three-year
period.

     On February 1, 2000, we announced that we had agreed to acquire an 18%
stake in living.com, an online retailer of products and services for the home,
with warrants for another 9%. In connection with this investment, we also
announced that we had entered into an agreement to create a home living store on
the Amazon.com Web site. Under the commercial agreement for this transaction,
Amazon.com will receive $145 million from living.com over a five-year period.

     Pro forma operating loss for the fourth quarter of 1999 was $175 million,

     Net sales for all of 1999 were $1.64 billion, a 169% increase over net

$390 million, or $1.19 per share, compared with a pro forma net loss in 1998 of
$74 million, or $.25 per share.

     Cumulative customer accounts increased by 3.8 million during the fourth
quarter to more than 16.9 million at December 31, 1999, an increase of more than
170% from our 6.2 million customer accounts at December 31, 1998. Cumulative
customer accounts now stand at over 17 million. Repeat customer orders
represented more than 73% of orders in the fourth quarter, up from 72% in the
previous quarter.

(1) Certain amounts in the statement of operations data have been reclassified
    compared to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this
    prospectus supplement.

(2) Capital expenditures include assets acquired under capital leases.

(3) Earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
    EBITDA, is provided because it is a commonly accepted financial indicator
    used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on
    the basis of operating performance. EBITDA is presented to enhance the
    understanding of our operating results and is not intended to represent cash
    flows or results of operations in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, or GAAP, for the periods indicated. EBITDA is not a
    measurement under GAAP and is not necessarily comparable with similarly
    titled measures of other companies. Net cash flows from operating activities
    as determined using GAAP are also presented in Other Operating Data.

(4) Earnings consist of income (loss) before provision for income taxes plus
    fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest charges and amortization of
    debt expense and discount or premium related to indebtedness, whether
    expensed or capitalized, and that portion of rental expense we believe to be
    representative of interest.

(5) As adjusted for the offering and application of the net proceeds as if the
    offering had occurred on September 30, 1999. Euros were converted to dollars
    using the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers on February
    10, 2000. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Capitalization."

                                  THE OFFERING

Securities Offered.........  E690,000,000 principal amount of 6 7/8% PEACS due
                             2010.

Interest...................  6.875% per annum on the principal amount, payable
                             annually in arrears in cash on February 16 of each
                             year, beginning February 16, 2001.

Conversion.................  You may convert each note into our common stock at
                             any time on or before February 16, 2010, subject to
                             our right to redeem the notes or withdraw such
                             conversion rights, at an initial conversion price
                             of E104.947 per share of common stock, subject to
                             certain adjustments.

                             The conversion price will be reset on February 16,
                             2001 and February 16, 2002 to the lesser of (1) the
                             conversion price then in effect and (2) the euro
                             equivalent average of the daily closing prices of
                             our common stock for the 20 consecutive trading
                             days immediately preceding such date. However, in
                             no event will the conversion price be reset to less
                             than E84.883 (subject to any antidilution
                             adjustments). As a result of this limitation on
                             resetting the conversion price, no more than 11.781
                             shares of our common stock would be issuable upon
                             conversion of E1,000 principal amount of notes
                             (subject to any anti-dilution adjustments).

                             In addition, the conversion price will be subject
                             to adjustment if certain events affecting our
                             common stock occur. Please see the discussion in
                             "Description of Notes -- Conversion of Notes."

Subordination..............  The notes will be subordinated to all of our
                             existing and future senior indebtedness and to all
                             debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. The
                             notes will rank equally with our 4 3/4% Convertible
                             Subordinated Notes due 2009. As of December 31,
                             1999, we had approximately $900.7 million of
                             indebtedness that constituted senior indebtedness.
                             Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is
                             prohibited from incurring debt, including senior
                             indebtedness, under the indenture.

Rights.....................  If at any time and each time prior to February 20,
                             2003 the euro equivalent of the closing price of
                             our common stock exceeds 160% of the initial
                             conversion price (E167.915) for at least 20 trading
                             days in any consecutive 30-trading day period, we
                             may withdraw your conversion rights. We must give
                             you notice of the occurrence of the event described
                             above at least 30 days, and no more than 60 days,
                             prior to withdrawing your conversion rights, and
                             such notice shall be given no later than five
                             business days after the last day on which such
                             event had occurred or was continuing. If we
                             withdraw your conversion rights in the time frame
                             discussed above, we will pay you an additional
                             amount in cash with respect to each of your notes
                             equal to E206.25 per E1,000 note, less the amount
                             of any interest actually paid on such note prior to
                             the date in which we give you notice as described
                             above. We refer to this additional payment as a
                             "make-whole payment". We will make this make-whole
                             payment to all note holders, including to note
                             holders who convert their notes into our common
                             stock during the period between the date we give
                             notice of our intention to withdraw the conversion
                             rights and the date on which the conversion rights
                             are actually withdrawn.

Optional Redemption........  We may redeem any of the notes on or after February
                             20, 2003 by giving you at least 30 days' notice. We
                             may redeem the notes either in whole or in part at
                             principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid
                             interest.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an
investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks
described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

RISKS RELATED TO AMAZON.COM

     WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY UPON WHICH YOU CAN EVALUATE OUR
BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS

     We incorporated in July 1994 and began offering products for sale on our
Web site in July 1995. Accordingly, we have a relatively short operating history
upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. You should consider our
prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently
encountered by online commerce companies. As an online commerce company, we have
a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business model, we face intense
competition, we must effectively manage our growth, and we must respond quickly
to rapid changes in customer demands and industry standards. We may not succeed
in addressing these challenges and risks.

     WE HAVE AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT AND ANTICIPATE FURTHER LOSSES

     We have incurred significant losses since we began doing business. As of
December 31, 1999, we had an accumulated deficit of $882 million. We believe
that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for several years
and may continue to incur such losses for the foreseeable future. These losses
may be significantly higher than our current losses. To succeed, we must invest
heavily in marketing and promotion and in developing our product, technology and
operating infrastructure. In addition, the expenses associated with our recent
and future acquisitions and investments and interest expense related to our
outstanding notes will adversely affect our operating results. Our aggressive
pricing programs have resulted in relatively low product gross margins, so we
need to generate and sustain substantially higher revenues in order to become
profitable. Although our revenues have grown, we cannot sustain our current rate
of growth. Our percentage growth rate will decrease in the future.

     OUR SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

     We have significant indebtedness. As of December 31, 1999, we had
indebtedness under senior discount notes, convertible subordinated notes,
capitalized lease obligations and other asset financing totaling approximately
$1.48 billion. Upon completion of this offering, we will have total indebtedness
of $2.16 billion. We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Our
indebtedness could:

     - make it difficult to make principal and interest payments on our
       convertible subordinated notes, our senior discount notes and the notes
       sold in this offering,

     - make it difficult to obtain necessary additional financing for working
       capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other
       purposes in the future,

     - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
       business and competition, and

     - make it more difficult for us to react in the event of an economic
       downturn.

     We may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. If our cash flow
is inadequate to meet our obligations, we may face substantial liquidity
problems. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for
required payments, or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our
indebtedness, we will be in default. This would permit our creditors to
accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness.

     WE CANNOT ACCURATELY FORECAST REVENUES OF OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE
SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS. OUR BUSINESS IS
SUBJECT TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATION. FUTURE FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS OR
REVENUE SHORTFALLS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT.

     Due to our limited operating history and the unpredictability of our
industry, we cannot accurately forecast our revenues. We base our current and
future expense levels on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues.
Our expenses are to a large extent fixed. We may not be able to adjust our
spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations. Further, we may
make pricing, purchasing, service, marketing, acquisition, investment or
financing decisions that could adversely affect our business results.

     Our quarterly operating results will fluctuate for many reasons, including:

     - our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and
       satisfy our customers' demands,

     - our ability to acquire merchandise, manage our inventory and fulfill
       orders,

     - changes in gross margins of our current and future products, services and
       markets,

     - introductions of popular books, music selections, DVDs, videos, toys,
       electronics products, home improvement products, software and other
       products or services, and our ability to properly anticipate demand,

     - purchases of large quantities of toys, electronics products, home
       improvement products, software and other products, particularly in
       advance of the holidays, for which demand may not materialize,

     - introduction of our new Web sites, services and products or those of
       competitors,

     - termination of Web sites, services and/or products that we determine are
       not viable,

     - changes in usage of the Internet and online services and consumer
       acceptance of the Internet and online commerce,

     - timing of upgrades and developments in our systems and infrastructure,

     - the level of traffic on our Web sites,

     - the effects of acquisitions and other business combinations, and related
       integration,

     - technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet brownouts,

     - the mix of books, music products, DVDs, videos, toys, electronics
       products, home improvement products, software and other products we sell,

     - the mix of revenues derived from products as compared to services,

     - our inability to prevent fraud perpetrated by third parties through
       credit card transactions, Amazon.com Payments transactions, and auction
       and zShops transactions,

     - our level of merchandise and vendor returns, and

     - disruptions in service by common shipping carriers due to strikes or
       otherwise.

     Both seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and traditional retail
seasonality may affect our business. Internet usage generally declines during
the summer. Sales in the traditional retail book, music, toy, electronics and
home improvement industries usually increase significantly in the fourth
calendar quarter of each year. The fourth quarter seasonal impact may be even
more pronounced in our toys and electronics businesses.

     For these reasons, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of
our financial results to forecast our future performance. Our future operating
results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors,
which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.

     WE COULD LOSE MARKET SHARE IF WE DO NOT KEEP UP WITH THE INTENSE
COMPETITION IN THE ONLINE COMMERCE MARKET

     The online commerce market is new, rapidly evolving and intensely
competitive. In addition, the retail book, music, video, toy, electronics, home
improvement and software industries are intensely competitive. Our current or
potential competitors include:

     - online vendors of books, music, DVDs, videos, toys, electronics, home
       improvement products and software,

     - a number of indirect competitors, including Web portals and Web search
       engines, that are involved in online commerce, either directly or in
       collaboration with other retailers,

     - online auction services,

     - publishers, distributors and store-based retailers of books, music, DVDs,
       videos and other products, many of which possess significant brand
       awareness, sales volume and customer bases,

     - major store-based retailers of toys, electronics, home improvement
       products, software and other products, and

     - traditional retailers and manufacturers who currently sell, or who may
       sell, products or services through the Internet, mail order or direct
       marketing.

     We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include
brand recognition, selection, personalized services, convenience, price,
accessibility, customer service, quality of search tools, quality of editorial
and other Web site content, reliability and speed of fulfillment.

     Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating
histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly
greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. They may be able
to secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms and may be able to
adopt more aggressive pricing or inventory policies. They also can devote more
resources to technology development and marketing than we can. We also expect to
experience increased competition from online commerce sites that provide goods
and services at or near cost, relying on advertising revenues to achieve
profitability.

     As the online commerce market continues to grow, other companies may enter
into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive
positions. Competition in the Internet and online commerce markets probably will
intensify. As various Internet market segments obtain large, loyal customer
bases, participants in those segments may use their market power to expand into
the markets in which we operate. In addition, new and expanded Web technologies
may increase the competitive pressures on online retailers. The nature of the
Internet as an electronic marketplace may facilitate competitive entry and
comparison shopping and render it inherently more competitive than conventional
retailing formats. For example, "shopping agent" technologies, including our own
"shopping agent" technology, permit customers to quickly compare our prices with
those of our competitors. This increased competition may reduce our operating
margins, diminish our market share or impair the value of our brand.

     WE MAY EXPERIENCE SYSTEM INTERRUPTIONS, WHICH AFFECT THE VOLUME OF ORDERS
WE FULFILL AND THEREFORE OUR REVENUES

     Customer access to our Web sites directly affects the volume of orders we
fulfill and thus affects our revenues. We experience occasional system
interruptions that make our Web sites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently
fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the
attractiveness of our products and services. These interruptions will continue.
We need to add additional software and hardware and upgrade our systems and
network infrastructure to accommodate both increased traffic on our Web sites
and increased sales volume and to fully integrate our systems. Without these
upgrades, we may face additional system interruptions, slower response times,
diminished customer service, impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment and
delays in our financial reporting. We cannot accurately project the rate or
timing of any increases in traffic or sales volume on our Web sites and,
therefore, the integration and timing of these

                                      S-14
<PAGE>   14

upgrades are uncertain. In addition, our inventory management systems are not
fully integrated with our financial reporting systems, and a significant amount
of manual effort may be necessary to reconcile our inventory and other financial
accounts.

     We maintain substantially all of our computer and communications hardware
at a single leased facility in Seattle, Washington. Our systems and operations
could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications
failure, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. We do not have backup systems
or a formal disaster recovery plan and we may not have sufficient business
interruption insurance to compensate us for losses from a major interruption.
Computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions could
cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data and could prevent
us from providing services and accepting and fulfilling customer orders.

     OUR PLANNED GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR
MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

     We have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and will further
expand our operations to address potential growth of our product and service
offerings and customer base. This expansion will continue to place a significant
strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will expand
our product and service offerings and our international operations and will
pursue other market opportunities. We need to successfully execute our expansion
of our distribution centers and customer service centers and continue to improve
our transaction-processing and operational and financial systems, procedures and
controls. We also need to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our
current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be
adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations. We may not be
able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel or to
successfully identify, manage and exploit market opportunities, which may limit
our growth.

     WE FACE SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY RISKS BECAUSE OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS ARE NOT WELL INTEGRATED AND BECAUSE CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONAL PROCESSES
ARE MANUAL; WE FACE ADDITIONAL INVENTORY RISK ARISING OUT OF CHANGES IN CONSUMER
DEMAND AND PRODUCT CYCLES

     We are exposed to significant inventory risks because our inventory
forecasting, purchasing, receiving, reconciliation, accounting and payment
systems are not well integrated. This lack of systems integration makes it a
difficult and manual process to receive inventory, reconcile inventory invoices
to purchase orders, account for inventory efficiently, request refunds from
suppliers and pay supplier invoices. In addition, certain manual operational
processes further complicate our ability to manage inventory efficiently.

     We are also exposed to significant inventory risks as a result of
seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and changes
in consumer tastes with respect to our products. In order to be successful, we
must accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking
products. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the
time inventory is ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin
selling a new product, it is particularly difficult to forecast product demand
accurately.

     We may also be exposed to inventory risk if we are unable to negotiate
satisfactory terms and conditions with our manufacturers, distributors and other
suppliers. The acquisition of certain types of inventory, or inventory from
certain sources, may require a significant lead-time and pre-payment, and such
inventory may not be returnable.

     We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of products,
and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the
relevant selling seasons.

     Any one of the factors set forth above may require us to mark-down or
write-off inventory. Substantial inventory mark-downs or write-offs will
decrease gross margins. In the fourth quarter of 1999, we incurred
inventory-related charges which significantly decreased our gross margins.

                                      S-15
<PAGE>   15

     ENTERING NEW BUSINESS AREAS WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND COULD
STRAIN MANAGEMENT, FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES

     We intend to expand our operations by promoting new or complementary
products, services or sales formats and by expanding our product or service
offerings. This will require significant additional expense and could strain our
management, financial and operational resources. We cannot expect to benefit in
these new markets from the first-to-market advantage that we experienced in the
online book market. Our gross margins in these new business areas may be lower
than our existing business activities. In addition, we may have limited or no
experience in these new business areas. We may not be able to expand our
operations in a cost-effective or timely manner. Any new business that our
customers do not receive favorably could damage our reputation and the
Amazon.com brand.

     IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND AND OPERATE OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, OUR
     BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED

     If we do not successfully expand our distribution operations to accommodate
peak volumes, or if our distribution centers fail to operate properly, it could
significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand. During the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1999, we added distribution centers in Nevada, Georgia,
Kentucky, Kansas, North Dakota, Germany and the UK. Most of these distribution
centers are or will be highly automated, and we have had limited experience with
automated distribution centers. The two distribution centers we operated prior
to 1999, in Washington and Delaware, are manually operated. Our distribution
center expansion may cause disruptions in our business. We are not experienced
in coordinating and managing distribution operations in geographically distant
locations. Because it is difficult to predict sales increases and lead times for
developing distribution centers are long, we may over-expand our facilities,
which may result in excess inventory, warehousing, fulfillment and distribution
capacity. We also need to retain flexibility within our distribution and
logistics network, including the ability to manage the operational challenges of
shipping non-uniform and sometimes heavy products as part of the fulfillment of
toy, electronics, home improvement orders and other products.

     THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF OUR NET SALES THAT WE EXPECT TO REALIZE
DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR PLACES SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR
BUSINESS

     Because we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to be realized
during the holiday season in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we face
significant risks in the fourth quarter. We may fail to accurately predict the
optimal inventory levels at our distribution centers for the fourth quarter. If
we do not stock popular products in sufficient amounts during the fourth quarter
and fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly impact our revenue. If
we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory
mark-downs or write-offs, which could reduce gross margins. In the fourth
quarter of 1999, we incurred inventory-related charges, which significantly
decreased our gross margins. A failure to optimize inventory at our distribution
centers will harm our shipping margins by requiring us to make partial shipments
from one or more locations. In addition, we may experience a decline on our
shipping margins due to complimentary upgrades and split-shipments necessary to
ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our
Web sites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may
experience system interruptions that make our Web sites unavailable or prevent
us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we
sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be
unable to adequately staff our distribution and customer service centers during
these peak periods. Finally, our new automated distribution centers may fail to
operate properly, which will interfere with our ability to meet customer demand.

     WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND INTO INTERNATIONAL
     MARKETS

     We plan to expand our presence in international markets. We have relatively
little experience in purchasing, marketing and distributing products or services
for these markets and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages. It
will be costly to establish international facilities and operations, promote our
brand internationally, and develop localized Web sites and stores and other
systems. We may not succeed in our efforts in these countries. If revenues from
international activities do not offset the expense of establishing
                                      S-16
<PAGE>   16

and maintaining foreign operations, our business, prospects, financial condition
and operating results will suffer.

     Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks
inherent in selling and operating abroad, including, but not limited to, risks
with respect to:

     - currency exchange rate fluctuations,

     - local economic and political conditions,

     - disruptions of capital and trading markets,

     - restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of
       funds and trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas
       and custom duties and tariffs),

     - changes in legal or regulatory requirements,

     - import or export licensing requirements,

     - limitations on the repatriation of funds,

     - difficulty in obtaining distribution and support,

     - nationalization,

     - laws and policies of the US affecting trade, foreign investment and
       loans, and

     - tax laws.

     As the international online commerce market continues to grow, competition
in this market will likely intensify. We may have to compete with local
companies who understand the local markets better than we do and who have better
brand name recognition locally than we do. In addition, governments in foreign
jurisdictions may regulate Internet or other online services in such areas as
content, privacy, network security, encryption or distribution. This may affect
our ability to conduct business internationally. We may not be able to hire,
train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel, which may limit our
growth in international markets.

     OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN MAKING AND INTEGRATING
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

     We plan to continue to expand our operations and market presence by
entering into business combinations, investments, joint ventures or other
strategic alliances with other companies. These transactions create risks such
as:

     - difficulty assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of the
       combined companies,

     - disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on
       existing businesses and other market developments,

     - problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel,

     - expenses associated with amortization of goodwill and other purchased
       intangible assets,

     - additional operating losses and expenses of acquired businesses,

     - impairment of relationships with existing employees, customers and
       business partners, and

     - additional losses from our equity investments.

     We may not succeed in addressing these risks. As part of our business
strategy, we intend to increase the number of our strategic investments and
alliances with online commerce businesses and other companies pursuant to which
they pay us licensing or other fees, such as fees to establish co-branded stores
on our Web sites or to participate in our auction or zShops services. We believe
these arrangements will have a positive impact on our results of operations,
particularly our gross margins. We may not be able to make business
                                      S-17
<PAGE>   17

combinations and strategic investments on terms that are acceptable to us. If
not, our gross margins may not improve and may even deteriorate. In addition,
the businesses we have acquired, and in the future may acquire, may incur
operating losses.

     WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT QUICKLY ENOUGH TO CHANGING CUSTOMER
     REQUIREMENTS AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS

     Technology in the online commerce industry changes rapidly. We may not be
able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and preferences
and industry standards. Competitors often introduce new products and services
with new technologies. These changes and the emergence of new industry standards
and practices could render our existing Web sites and proprietary technology
obsolete. To succeed, we must enhance our Web site responsiveness, functionality
and features, acquire and license leading technologies, enhance our existing
services, develop new services and technology and respond to technological
advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and
timely basis.

     THE LOSS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

     We depend on the continued services and performance of our senior
management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our chief
executive officer and chairman of the board. We do not have "key person" life
insurance policies. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key
employees could harm our business.

     WE RELY ON A SMALL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS; OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE HARMED IF OUR
CURRENT SUPPLIERS STOP SELLING MERCHANDISE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS

     Although we increased our direct purchasing from manufacturers during 1999,
we purchase a majority of our book, music, DVD and video titles from three major
vendors, Ingram Book Group, Baker & Taylor, Inc. and Valley Media, Inc. We do
not have long-term contracts or arrangements with most of our vendors to
guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms or the
extension of credit limits. Our current vendors may stop selling merchandise to
us on acceptable terms. We may not be able to acquire merchandise from other
suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms.

     WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE OR MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE DOMAIN NAMES

     We hold rights to various Web domain names, including "Amazon.com,"
"Amazon.co.uk," "Amazon.de," "zShops.com" and "Amazon.com Auctions."
Governmental agencies typically regulate domain names. These regulations are
subject to change. We may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain
names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations
governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary
rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names
that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and
other proprietary rights.

     THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THE INTERNET AS A MEDIUM FOR COMMERCE IS NOT
     CERTAIN

     Consumer use of the Internet as a medium for commerce is a recent
phenomenon and is subject to a high level of uncertainty. While the number of
Internet users has been rising, the Internet infrastructure may not expand fast
enough to meet the increased levels of demand. The increased use of the Internet
as a medium for commerce raises concerns regarding Internet security,
reliability, pricing, accessibility and quality of service. If use of the
Internet does not continue to grow, or grows at a slower rate than we
anticipated, or if the necessary Internet infrastructure or complementary
services are not developed to support effectively growth that may occur, our
business, financial condition and growth prospects would be harmed.

     WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS IF PEOPLE OR PROPERTY ARE
     HARMED BY THE PRODUCTS WE SELL

     As we enter new lines of business, we may increasingly sell products, such
as toys and home improvement products, that may increase our exposure to product
liability claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by
such products, and that may require us to take actions such as product recalls.
We
                                      S-18
<PAGE>   18

maintain liability insurance, but we cannot be certain that our coverage will be
adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be
available to us on economically reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, some
of our vendor agreements with our suppliers do not indemnify us from product
liability.

     GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF INTERNET COMMERCE IS EVOLVING AND UNFAVORABLE
     CHANGES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS

     We are subject to general business regulations and laws or regulations
regarding taxation and access to online commerce. These laws or regulations may
impede the growth of the Internet or other online services. Regulatory
authorities may adopt specific laws and regulations governing the Internet or
online commerce. These regulations may cover taxation, user privacy, pricing,
content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and characteristics and
quality of products and services. Changes in consumer protection laws also may
impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online, both in the
US and internationally. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such
as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply
to the Internet and online commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may
harm our business.

     In addition, many states currently regulate "auctions" and "auctioneers" in
conducting auctions and may regulate online auction services. States may also
regulate consumer-to-consumer fixed price online markets, like zShops. This
could, in turn, diminish the demand for our products and services and increase
our cost of doing business.

     WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO COLLECT TAXES ON THE PRODUCTS WE SELL

     In accordance with current industry practice, we do not currently collect
sales taxes or other taxes with respect to shipments of goods into states other
than Washington. In addition, we collect Value Added Tax, or VAT, for products
that are ordered on www.amazon.co.uk and www.amazon.de and shipped into European
Union member countries. Our new distribution center and customer service center
networks, and any future expansion of those networks, along with other aspects
of our evolving business, may result in additional sales and other tax
obligations. One or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or
other tax collection obligations on out-of-jurisdiction companies which engage
in electronic commerce as we do. A successful assertion by one or more states or
foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of
merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues or
prospects.

     Recent federal legislation limits the imposition of US state and local
taxes on Internet-related sales. In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax
Freedom Act, which places a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on
Internet access, unless such tax was already imposed prior to October 1, 1998,
and on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. There is a possibility that
Congress may not renew this legislation in 2001. If Congress chooses not to
renew this legislation, US state and local governments would be free to impose
new taxes on electronically purchased goods. The imposition of taxes on goods
sold over the Internet by US state and local governments would create
administrative burdens for us and could reduce one competitive advantage that
the purchase of goods over the Internet now possesses.

     The European Commission is currently evaluating its VAT position on
electronic commerce transactions. It is possible that future VAT legislation in
the European Union or changes to our business model may result in additional VAT
collection obligations and administrative burdens.

     WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY OR MAY BE COMPELLED TO CHANGE CERTAIN
BUSINESS PRACTICES IF WE ARE FOUND TO HAVE IMPROPERLY COLLECTED OR USED
INFORMATION THROUGH OUR ALEXA INTERNET SUBSIDIARY

     Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Alexa Internet, develops and distributes
software that facilitates Web navigation. This software is the subject of two
pending lawsuits and an informal information review by the US Federal Trade
Commission.

     We and Alexa Internet have been named as defendants in two lawsuits
alleging that Alexa Internet secretly intercepted electronic communications and
other personal data with its computer software program and transmitted that
information to third parties, including us. The lawsuits allege that we and
Alexa Internet

                                      S-19
<PAGE>   19

invaded the privacy of the users of the software and violated provisions of the
US Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
and the California Business and Professions Code. Both lawsuits seek to proceed
as class actions. We have filed or plan to file answers denying the allegations
of wrongdoing and asserting applicable defenses. If the plaintiff's were to
prevail, we may be required to pay statutory, compensatory and punitive damages,
as well as to disgorge gains and pay restitution of any money received as a
result of conduct found to have been unlawful. We may also be made subject to
court orders preventing us from engaging in certain business practices or
requiring that we take certain corrective measures. Although we have denied the
allegations of wrongdoing in the complaints, if either plaintiff were to prevail
on some, or all of their claims, it could have a material adverse effect on us.

     We have also been advised that the Federal Trade Commission is conducting
an informal inquiry into certain information practices by Alexa Internet. In
order to determine whether Alexa Internet has engaged in unfair or deceptive
acts, the FTC requested that Alexa Internet provide information about its
practices and submit various materials and documents.

     WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR UNLAWFUL OR FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES BY USERS OF OUR
     AUCTION AND ZSHOPS SERVICES

     We may be unable to prevent users of our auction and zShops services from
selling unlawful goods, or from selling goods in an unlawful manner. We may face
civil or criminal liability for unlawful and fraudulent activities by our
auction and zShops users. Any costs we incur as a result of liability relating
to the sale of unlawful goods, the unlawful sale of goods, the fraudulent
receipt of goods or the fraudulent collection of payments could harm our
business.

     In running our auction and zShops services, we rely on sellers of goods to
make accurate representations and provide reliable delivery and on buyers to pay
the agreed purchase price. For our auction and zShops services, we do not take
responsibility for delivery of payment or goods to any users of our services.
While we can suspend or terminate the accounts of users of auctions or zShops
who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users, we cannot require
users to make payments or deliver goods. We do not compensate users who believe
they have been defrauded by other users except through our guarantee program.
Under the guarantee program, fraudulent activities by our auction and zShops
users, such as the fraudulent receipt of goods and the fraudulent collection of
payments, may create liability for us. In addition, we are aware that
governmental agencies are currently investigating the conduct of online
auctions.

     WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR BREACHES OF SECURITY ON OUR WEB SITE AND FRAUDULENT
ACTIVITIES OF USERS OF OUR AMAZON.COM PAYMENTS PROGRAM

     A fundamental requirement for electronic commerce is the secure
transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we have
developed systems and processes to prevent fraudulent credit card transactions
and other security breaches, failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may
impact our financial results.

     The law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services
is currently unsettled. We guarantee payments made through Amazon.com Payments
up to certain limits for both buyers and sellers, and we may be unable to
prevent users of Amazon.com Payments from fraudulently receiving goods when
payment may not be made to a seller or fraudulently collecting payments when
goods may not be shipped to a buyer. Our liability risk will increase as we
encourage or require sellers to use Amazon.com Payments. Any costs we incur as a
result of liability because of our guarantee of payments made through Amazon.com
Payments or otherwise could harm our business. In addition, the functionality of
Amazon.com Payments depends on certain third-party vendors delivering services.
If these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services, Amazon.com
Payments will not be viable (and our businesses that use Amazon.com Payments may
not be viable).

     WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INFORMATION POSTED ON OUR WEB
     SITE BY THIRD PARTIES

     Our Web site features customer reviews of the products we sell and customer
ratings of sellers on our auctions site. Although these reviews and ratings are
generated by customers and not by us, it is possible that a
                                      S-20
<PAGE>   20

claim could be made against us for reviews and ratings posted on our Web site.
If we become liable for information posted on our Web site by customers, we
could be harmed and may be forced to discontinue certain services.

     WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
OR MAY BE ACCUSED OF INFRINGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

     We regard our patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade dress,
trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as
critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law,
trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our
employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We
have applied for the registration of some of our trademarks and service marks in
the US and internationally. In addition, we have filed US and international
patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Effective
trademark, service mark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not
be available in every country in which our products and services are made
available online. The protection of our intellectual property may require the
expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

     Third parties that license our proprietary rights, such as trademarks,
patented technology or copyrighted material, may take actions that diminish the
value of our proprietary rights or reputation. In addition, the steps we take to
protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may
infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, patents and
similar proprietary rights. Other parties may claim that we infringed their
proprietary rights. We have been subject to claims, and expect to continue to be
subject to legal proceedings and claims, regarding alleged infringement by our
licensees and us of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of
third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the
expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions
against us or the imposition of damages that we must pay. We may need to obtain
a license from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but
such license may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

     WE MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE US SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO
RECLASSIFY OUR REPORTING OF FULFILLMENT COSTS

     The US Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the financial
statement classification of fulfillment costs and other items by a number of
e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com. Amazon.com defines fulfillment costs
as costs directly attributable to the operation of its distribution centers and
customer service centers, and classifies these costs in marketing and sales
expense. We estimate that fulfillment costs represented approximately 60% of
marketing and sales expenses for the fourth quarter of 1999. The activities of
our distribution centers consist of receiving, inspecting and warehousing
inventories of product purchased from outside suppliers and picking, packaging
and preparing customers' orders for shipment. The SEC has advised us that it may
decide to require that certain distribution center costs be classified as costs
of sales. In that event, we will reclassify any fulfillment costs as required
and our gross margin would be correspondingly reduced. Any such reclassification
would not materially impact our sales, operating profit or loss, net profit or
loss, or cash flow.

     WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM WILL NOT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

     Thus far, we have had no significant problems related to year 2000 issues
associated with the computer systems, software, other property and equipment we
use. However, we cannot guarantee that the year 2000 problem will not adversely
affect our business, operating results or financial condition at some point in
the future. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations -- Year 2000 Implications."

RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING

     THE NOTES ARE SUBORDINATED

     The notes will be unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of
our existing and future senior indebtedness. In the event of our bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event
of default under the indenture and in certain other events, our assets will be
available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has
been paid. As a result, there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay
amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes. The notes also will be
effectively subordinated to the liabilities, including trade payables, of our
subsidiaries. Neither we nor our subsidiaries are prohibited from incurring
debt, including senior indebtedness, under the indenture. If we or our
subsidiaries were to incur additional debt or liabilities, our ability to pay
our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected. As of December 31,
1999, we had approximately $900.7 million of indebtedness that constituted
senior indebtedness, including trade payables and other liabilities and
excluding intercompany liabilities, as to which the notes are effectively
subordinated. We may from time to time incur additional debt, including senior
indebtedness. See "Description of Notes -- Subordination of Notes."

     WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDEEM THE NOTES UPON A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE

     Upon a fundamental change of Amazon.com, you may require us to redeem all
or a portion of your notes. If a fundamental change were to occur, we may not
have enough funds to pay the purchase price for all tendered notes. Any future
credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain
provisions that prohibit the repurchase of the notes upon a fundamental change
or may provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under
that agreement. If a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited
from purchasing the notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders to purchase
the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not obtain a
consent, we could not purchase the notes. Our failure to purchase tendered notes
would constitute an event of default under the indenture, which might constitute
a default under the terms of our other debt. In such circumstances, or if a
fundamental change would constitute an event of default under our senior
indebtedness, the subordination provisions of the indenture would restrict
payments to you. The term "fundamental change" is limited to transactions in
which all or substantially all of our outstanding common stock is converted into
consideration other than a common stock listed on a US national securities
exchange or approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market and does not
include other events that might harm our financial condition or business
operations. Our obligation to offer to purchase the notes upon a fundamental
change would not necessarily afford you protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving
us.

     A PUBLIC MARKET MAY NOT DEVELOP FOR THE NOTES

     Prior to the offering there has been no trading market for the notes. The
underwriters have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the
notes. However, the underwriters are not obligated to make a market and may
discontinue this market making activity at any time without notice. In addition,
market-making activity by the underwriters will be subject to the limits imposed
by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. As a result, we cannot assure you
that any market for the notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will
be maintained. If an active market for the notes fails to develop or be
sustained, the trading price of the notes could decline significantly.

     We have applied to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for listing of the notes.
We cannot assure you, however, when the notes will be listed on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, or whether they will be listed at all. The delivery of the notes
is not contingent on their admission to listing on any exchange. Therefore, we
cannot give you any assurance as to the existence or liquidity of any trading
market for the notes.

                                      S-22
<PAGE>   22

     THE NOTES MAY NOT BE RATED OR MAY RECEIVE A LOWER RATING THAN ANTICIPATED

     We believe it is likely that one or more rating agencies may rate the
notes. If one or more rating agencies assign the notes a rating lower than
expected by investors, the market price of the notes and our common stock would
be harmed.

     THE PRICE OF OUR NOTES AND OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD
CAUSE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY

     The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly. These
fluctuations may harm the market price of the notes and the common stock into
which the notes are convertible. For example, during the 52-week period ended
February 10, 2000 (as adjusted for the 3-for-1 split of our common stock on
January 4, 1999 and the 2-for-1 split of our common stock on September 1, 1999),
the reported sale price of our common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was as
high as $113 and as low as $42.13 per share. Trading prices of our common stock
may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as:

     - quarterly variations in operating results,

     - announcements of innovations,

     - new products, services and strategic developments by us or our
       competitors, or business combinations and investments by us or our
       competitors,

     - changes in our operating expense levels or losses,

     - changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities
       analysts,

     - performance by other online commerce companies, and

     - news reports relating to trends in the Internet, book, music, video, DVD,
       toys, electronics, home improvement products, software, auctions,
       consumer-to-consumer fixed price online markets, or other product or
       service industries.

     Any of these events may cause our stock price to fall, which may adversely
affect our business and financing opportunities. In addition, the stock market
in general and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular
have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to such
companies' operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations
may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock regardless of our
operating performance.

     WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE EURO RELATIVE
TO THE US DOLLAR, AND YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY
AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THAT RELATIVE VALUE

     Following the offering of the notes, a significant portion of our
indebtedness will be denominated in euros. The majority of our revenues and
expenses are denominated in US dollars, and the shares issuable upon conversion
of the notes are US dollar-denominated securities. As a result, we are exposed
to currency exchange risks with respect to both principal and interest payable
on the notes. In addition, if the euro strengthens against the US dollar, the
value of your conversion right may diminish, thereby adversely affecting the
market value of your notes.

     WE WILL HAVE BROAD DISCRETION OVER THE ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE
OFFERING

     We will raise approximately E672,750,000 ($663,667,875) after deducting the
fee paid to the underwriters. We currently have no specific plans for a
significant amount of our net proceeds from this offering. Consequently, we will
have the discretion to allocate the net proceeds to uses that investors may not
deem desirable. We may be unable to yield a significant return on any
investments of the proceeds. We will invest substantially all of our proceeds
from the offering in short-term, interest bearing investment-grade securities.

                                      S-23
<PAGE>   23

                                USE OF PROCEEDS

     The net proceeds from the offering will be approximately E672,750,000
($663,667,875) after deducting the fee paid to the underwriters. We expect to
use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, without
limitation, working capital to fund anticipated operating losses, the expansion
of our core business, investments in new markets, expansion of our European
operations and capital expenditures.

     Pending the foregoing uses, we will invest the net proceeds from the
offering in short-term, interest bearing investment-grade securities.

split effected on June 1, 1998, the 3-for-1 stock split effected on January 4,
1999, and the 2-for-1 stock split effected September 1, 1999.

     On February 10, 2000, the last reported bid price for our common stock as
reported by the Nasdaq National Market was $76 1/8, and the last reported last
sale price for our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq National Market was
$76 3/16. On December 31, 1999, there were approximately 3,812 holders of record
of our common stock.

     We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend
to retain earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our
business and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.

(1) Capital expenditures include assets acquired under capital leases.

(2) EBITDA is provided because it is a commonly accepted financial indicator
    used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on
    the basis of operating performance. EBITDA is presented to enhance the
    understanding of our operating results and is not intended to represent cash
    flows or results of operations in accordance with GAAP for the periods
    indicated. EBITDA is not a measurement under GAAP and is not necessarily
    comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Net cash flows
    from operating activities as determined using GAAP are also presented in
    Other Operating Data.

(3) Earnings consist of income (loss) before provision for income taxes plus
    fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest charges and amortization of
    debt expense and discount or premium related to indebtedness, whether
    expensed or capitalized, and that portion of rental expense we believe to be
    representative of interest.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

     Amazon.com seeks to be the world's most customer-centric company where
customers can find and discover anything they may want to buy online. We intend
to leverage our Internet platform to expand the range of products and services
offered to our customers through internal development, business combinations and
relationships with strategic partners. We also intend to continue to expand
internationally through additional product and service offerings on our
Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de Web sites, the establishment of new Web sites focused
on particular international markets, the entry into strategic relationships that
enhance our international operations, and the continued sale of products from
the US to international customers.

     To succeed in our strategy, we must invest heavily in marketing and
promotion and in developing our product, technology and operating
infrastructure, whether internally or through acquisitions or strategic
investments. In addition, we pursue aggressive pricing programs that result in
relatively low product gross margins. As a result, we believe we will continue
to incur substantial operating losses. Although we expect our US books business
to be profitable in the year 2000, we cannot predict, when, if ever, our newer
businesses will be profitable. Gross margins attributable to new business areas
may be lower than those associated with our existing business activities. In
addition, we may be unable to accurately forecast inventory needs in new and
existing product lines, resulting in additional inventory reserves that will
negatively impact gross margin. In particular, we anticipate that the
introduction of toys, electronics, home improvement products and software will
result in continued lower overall gross margins in upcoming quarters.

     Net sales include the selling price of books, music, videos, DVDs, toys,
electronics and other products we sold, net of returns and gift certificate
discounts, and also include outbound shipping and handling charges. Net sales
also include commissions from auctions and zShops transactions, which include
placement fees, sales commissions, fees from payment service transactions, and
advertising revenues under commercial agreements with our strategic partners.

     Gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of sales, which
consists principally of the cost of merchandise sold to customers and inbound
and outbound shipping costs.

     Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of fulfillment costs,
advertising, public relations and promotional expenditures, and all payroll and
related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing, selling and fulfillment
activities. Fulfillment costs include the cost of operating and staffing
distribution and customer service centers. We estimate that fulfillment costs
represented approximately 60% of marketing and sales expenses for the fourth
quarter of 1999. The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the
financial statement classification of fulfillment costs and other items by a
number of e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com. Amazon.com defines
fulfillment costs as costs directly attributable to the operation of its
distribution centers and customer service centers, and classifies these costs in
marketing and sales expense. The activities of our distribution centers consist
of receiving, inspecting and warehousing inventories of product purchased from
outside suppliers and picking, packaging and preparing customers' orders for
shipment. The SEC has advised us that it may decide to require that certain
distribution center costs be classified as costs of sales. In that case, we will
reclassify any fulfillment costs as required and our gross margin would be
correspondingly affected. Any such reclassification would not materially impact
our sales, operating profit or loss, net profit or loss, or cash flow.

     Product development expenses consist principally of payroll and related
expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations
personnel and consultants, systems and telecommunications infrastructure and
costs of acquired content.

     General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses
for executive, finance and administrative personnel, recruiting, professional
fees and other general corporate expenses.

     Amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles represents
amortization charges associated with goodwill recorded in acquisitions we made,
as well as amortization of other intangible assets identified in these
acquisitions.

     Equity in losses of equity-method investees includes our share of the
losses of other companies in which we have investments that give us significant
influence over the investee.

     Certain items included in this prospectus supplement, including
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, as well as equity in losses of
equity-method investees and stock-based compensation, have been reclassified
compared to the audited consolidated financial statements for December 31, 1998
and the three years then ended and compared to the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements for September 30, 1999 and the three months
and nine months then ended, which are incorporated by reference in the
accompanying prospectus.

RECENT OPERATING RESULTS

     Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 1999 were $676 million, an
increase of 90% over the quarter ended September 30, 1999 and 167% over net
sales for the fourth quarter of 1998, which totaled $253 million.

     Fourth quarter 1999 net sales highlights included:

     - US-based book sales totaled $317 million in the fourth quarter, a 66%
       increase over the fourth quarter of 1998.

     - US-based music sales totaled $78 million, a 136% increase over the fourth
       quarter of 1998. Fourth quarter 1999 US-based DVD/Video sales totaled $64
       million, a more than 500% increase over the fourth quarter of 1998. DVD
       sales accounted for more than half of this total.

     - Combined sales from our Web sites targeted at the UK and German markets
       totaled $71 million, a 360% increase from the fourth quarter of 1998.

     Growth in net sales reflects a significant increase in units sold due to
the growth of our customer base, repeat purchases from our existing customers
and the launch of additional product lines, including toys, electronics, home
improvement products and software. The increase is also attributable to the
expansion of our international operations and the fact that the fourth quarter
includes the holiday season, during which sales are generally higher than at
other times of the year.

     Gross profit increased in absolute dollars, from $70 million in the quarter
ended September 30, 1999 to $88 million in the quarter ended December 31, 1999,
reflecting our increased sales volume. However, the gross margin percentage in
the fourth quarter decreased as compared to the third quarter from 19.8% to
13.0%. This decrease was largely due to inventory-related charges, higher
shipping costs and increased redemption of promotional gift certificates, which
are netted against revenue.

     Operating expenses, excluding amortization of goodwill and intangibles and
merger and acquisition related costs, increased from $161.5 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 1999 to $277.2 million for the quarter ended
December 31, 1999. This increase reflects our increased sales volume, as well as
increased sales and marketing expenditures related primarily to higher
fulfillment costs, particularly those associated with newer product lines.

     The loss from operations and the net loss for the quarter ended December
31, 1999 were $273.8 million and $323.2 million, respectively. The pro forma
loss from operations for the quarter ended December 31, 1999, which excludes
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, stock-based compensation and
merger, acquisition and investment-related costs, was $175.3 million. The pro
forma net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 1999, which excludes the above
items as well as equity in losses of equity-method investees, was $184.9
million. The shares used in the computation of basic and diluted loss per share
were 338.4 million, resulting in a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.96 and
a pro forma basic and diluted loss per share of $0.55 for the quarter ended
December 31, 1999.

                                      S-28
<PAGE>   28

     At December 31, 1999, our cash balance was $117 million. Marketable
securities, which include highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less, were $589.2 million.

     Net cash provided by operating activities of $31.5 million for the quarter
ended December 31, 1999 was primarily attributable to increases in accounts
payable, other liabilities and accrued expenses and noncash expenses, offset by
the net loss and increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other. During
the quarter ended December 31, 1999, we used $105.2 million in cash for capital
expenditures primarily in connection with the continued expansion of our
distribution center network, and an additional $146.8 million for investments in
other companies.

</TABLE>

     Growth in net sales reflects a significant increase in units sold due to
the growth of our customer base, repeat purchases from existing customers, and
new product offerings including music and video product offerings in the second
half of 1998 and toys and electronics in July 1999.

     At September 30, 1999, our cumulative customer accounts, inclusive of
accounts with Amazon.com Auctions, reached 13.1 million, compared with 10.7
million at June 30, 1999, and 6.2 million and 4.5 million at December 31, and
September 30, 1998, respectively.

     Net foreign sales, including domestic export and foreign-domicile sales,
represented 24.5% and 20.1% of net sales for the quarters ended September 30,
1999 and 1998, and 23.7% and 20.6% of net sales for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. We launched Amazon.co.uk and
Amazon.de, sites that target the UK and German markets, respectively, in the
fourth quarter of 1998.

</TABLE>

     For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999, gross profit
increased in absolute dollars over the same periods in 1998, primarily
reflecting our increased sales volume. Gross margin percentages declined over
the same periods due primarily to the introduction of newer product lines such
as music, video, toys and electronics, as well as inventory reserves taken in
the third quarter of 1999 due to large inventory purchases in advance of holiday
sales. Gross profit was also impacted by our 50% discount on every book on the
New York Times bestseller list. Offsetting these declines in gross margin was
the effect of improved product sourcing.

     We believe that offering our customers attractive prices is an essential
component of our business strategy. Accordingly, in addition to the 50% discount
on every book on the New York Times bestseller list, we continue to offer up to
40% off on hundreds of thousands of other titles. We may in the future expand or
increase the discounts we offer to our customers and may otherwise alter our
pricing structure and policies.

     Marketing and sales expenses increased during the quarter and nine-month
periods ended September 30, 1999 due to several factors including the opening of
new distribution and customer service centers, increases in our advertising and
promotional expenditures, increases in payroll and related costs associated with
fulfilling customer demand, costs associated with new product offerings, and
increases in credit card merchant fees resulting from higher sales.

</TABLE>

     The increase in product development expenses was primarily attributable to
increased staffing and associated costs related to enhancing the features,
content and functionality of our Web sites and transaction-processing systems,
as well as increased investment in systems and telecommunications infrastructure
and new product offerings. Product development costs are generally expensed as
incurred, except for certain costs relating to the development of internal-use
software that are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful lives. We
believe that continued investment in product development is critical to
attaining our strategic objectives. In addition to ongoing investments in our
Web stores and infrastructure, we intend to increase investments in product,
service and international expansion. As a result, we expect product development
expenses to increase significantly.

general and administrative costs to continue to increase commensurate with our
expansion plans.

Stock-based compensation..............................  $11,789    $1,214    $16,570    $1,591
</TABLE>

     Stock-based compensation is comprised of the portion of acquisition-related
consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of key employees, which must
be classified as compensation expense rather than as a component of purchase
price under generally accepted accounting principles. Stock-based compensation
also includes stock-based charges such as option-related deferred compensation
recorded at our initial public offering, as well as certain other compensation
and severance arrangements. The increase in stock-based compensation results
primarily from 1999 acquisition activity. Stock-based compensation for the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1998 relates primarily to
option-related deferred compensation recorded at the time of our initial public
offering.

     Increases in amortization charges primarily resulted from the amortization
of goodwill and other intangibles recorded at the time of our acquisitions of
Exchange.com, Alexa Internet and Accept.com. It is likely that we will continue
to expand our business through acquisitions which would cause amortization of
goodwill and other intangibles to increase.

     Interest income on cash and marketable securities increased due to higher
balances resulting from our financing activities, principally the February 1999
issuance of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4 3/4% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2009, or the Convertible Notes. Interest expense for the
quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 1999 consisted primarily of
interest on the Convertible Notes and the 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2003, or
the Senior Discount Notes, the amortization of deferred charges and interest on
asset acquisitions financed through loans and capital leases.

     Other income is comprised of net gains and losses on sales of marketable
securities, fixed assets and other miscellaneous items. For the three and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 other income, net was primarily
related to the disposition of an investment security. No comparable activity was
recorded in the respective periods of the prior year.

Equity in losses of equity-method investees..............  $23,359    $500    $36,876    $500
</TABLE>

     Equity in losses of equity-method investees increased from 1998 to 1999 due
to additional equity-method investments we made, as well as a higher level of
losses reported by the companies in which we have equity-method investments. We
have made substantial investments in companies that are accounted for under the
equity method and anticipate making additional such investments in the future.
Many of these companies are in the early stage of their operations and are
incurring net losses. Therefore, we expect to continue to record losses on our
equity-method investments.

Income Taxes

     We have not generated any taxable income to date and therefore have not
paid any federal income taxes since inception. Utilization of our net operating
loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2011, may be subject to certain
limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Due to uncertainties regarding realizability of the deferred tax assets, we have
provided a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset in an amount necessary
to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero.

     Pro forma information regarding our results, excluding amortization of
goodwill and other intangibles, stock-based compensation and merger, acquisition
and investment-related costs discussed above are presented for informational

</TABLE>

     Growth in net sales in 1998 and 1997 reflects a significant increase in
units sold due to the growth of our customer base and repeat purchases from our
existing customers. We had approximately 6.2 million and 1.5 million cumulative
customer accounts as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Repeat
customer orders accounted for over 60% of orders placed on the Amazon.com Web
site during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998. Additionally, the increase
in net sales in 1998 was partially due to the opening of the music store in June
1998, the launch of the Web sites that target customers in the UK and German
markets in October 1998 and the opening of the video store in November 1998.

     International sales, including export sales from the US, represented
approximately 20%, 25% and 33% of net sales for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

</TABLE>

     Gross profit increased in 1998 and 1997 in absolute dollars, reflecting our
increased sales volume. Gross margin increased in 1998 as a result of
improvements in product costs through improved supply chain management,
including increased direct purchasing from publishers, which together more than
offset the impact of aggressive product pricing and lower music and video
margins. Gross margin decreased in 1997 due to a combination of lower prices and
lower overall shipping margins, partially offset by improvements in product
cost.

     During this period, we offered everyday discounts of up to 40% on hundreds
of thousands of titles and certain "special value" editions discounted up to
85%.

     Gross margins attributable to new business areas may be lower than those
associated with our existing business activities. In particular, in June 1998,
we launched our new music store and in November 1998 launched a video store.
Music and video gross margins are lower than book gross margins. To the extent
music and video become a larger portion of our product mix, we expect those
categories to have a proportionate impact on overall product gross margin.

</TABLE>

     Marketing and sales expenses increased in 1998 and 1997 primarily due to
increases in our advertising and promotional expenditures, increased payroll and
related costs associated with fulfilling customer demand and increased credit
card fees resulting from higher sales. The increase in 1998 was also
attributable to the entry into music and video sales and the launch of Web sites
that target customers in the UK and German

markets. Marketing and sales expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due
to the significant increase in net sales.

</TABLE>

     The increases in product development expenses in 1998 and 1997 were
primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated costs related to
continual feature content and functionality enhancements to our Web sites and
transaction-processing systems, as well as increased investment in systems and
telecommunications infrastructure. Such increases in 1998 included investments
associated with the entry into music and video sales, the launch of an enhanced
holiday gift store, new Web sites that target customers in the UK and German
markets and operating expenses associated with the acquired entities. Product
development expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the
significant increase in net sales. To date, product development costs have been
expensed as incurred.

</TABLE>

     The 1998 and 1997 increases in general and administrative expenses were
primarily a result of increased salaries and related expenses associated with
the hiring of additional personnel and legal and other professional fees related
to our growth. In 1998, we incurred additional expenses associated with the
acquired entities and the related international expansion and expanded
activities. Beginning in 1997, general and administrative costs have included
costs attributable to being a public company. General and administrative
expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant increase
in net sales.

Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles

     Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was approximately $42.6
million or 7.0% of net sales in 1998. Such amortization relates to goodwill and
other intangibles recorded in connection with our April 1998 acquisitions of
three Internet companies and our August 1998 acquisition of Junglee. These
acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We
anticipate that future amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated
with our 1998 acquisitions will continue to be amortized on a straight line
basis over lives of up to approximately three years, and will amount to
approximately $22 million per quarter until March 2000 and approximately $15
million per quarter thereafter until the related goodwill and other intangibles
are fully amortized. It is likely that we will continue to expand our business
through acquisitions and internal development. Any additional acquisitions or
impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangibles could result in
additional goodwill, other intangibles and merger and acquisition related costs.

Interest Income and Expense

                                      S-34
<PAGE>   34

     Interest income on cash and marketable securities increased in 1998 due to
higher investment balances resulting from the proceeds from the Senior Discount
Notes issued in May 1998, and in 1997 due to higher investment balances
resulting from the proceeds of our initial public offering in May 1997. Interest
expense in 1998 includes interest and amortization of deferred charges related
to the Senior Discount Notes.

     Interest expense in 1998 and 1997 consists of interest and amortization of
deferred charges related to our $75 million three-year senior secured term loan,
or the Senior Loan, entered into in December 1997, as well as asset acquisitions
financed through loans and capital leases. In 1998, interest expense also
includes the write-off of $2.0 million of unamortized loan fees following
prepayment of the Senior Loan in May 1998.

     We expect interest expense to increase in the future as a result of the
Senior Discount Notes, the Convertible Notes and potentially increased financing
of asset acquisitions through loans and capital leases. We also expect interest
income to increase because of higher cash balances resulting from the net
proceeds of the Convertible Notes.

Income Taxes

     We did not provide any current or deferred US federal, state or foreign
income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have
experienced operating losses since inception. Utilization of our net operating
loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2011, may be subject to certain
limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
We have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset,
consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, because of uncertainty
regarding its realizability.

Pro Forma Information

     In April 1998, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of three
Internet companies. Each of the acquisitions was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price of the three
acquisitions, plus related charges, was approximately $55 million. The
consideration for the acquisitions was comprised of common stock and cash. We
issued an aggregate of approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock to
affect the transactions. We are amortizing the goodwill resulting from the
acquisitions on a straight-line basis over approximately two years.

     In August 1998, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Junglee. We issued approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock and assumed
all outstanding options and warrants in connection with the acquisition of
Junglee. The Junglee acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, with substantially all of the approximately $180 million purchase
price allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles. The goodwill and
substantially all other purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over lives averaging approximately three years.

     In August 1998, we exchanged common stock and options for all of the
outstanding capital stock of PlanetAll. We issued approximately 2.4 million
shares of common stock and assumed all outstanding options in connection with
the merger. The PlanetAll merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests
and, as a result, our consolidated financial statements have been restated for
all periods presented.

     Pro forma information regarding our results, excluding approximately $50.9
million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, equity in losses of
equity method investees, stock-based compensation and merger, acquisition and
investment-related costs, was as follows for the year ended December 31, 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     At September 30, 1999, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of
$43.1 million of cash and $862.5 million of marketable securities compared to
$25.6 million of cash and $347.9 million of marketable securities at December
31, 1998.

     Net cash used in operating activities was $122.4 million and $7.7 million
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net
operating cash flows were primarily attributable to quarterly net losses and
increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other, partially offset by
non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and merger and
acquisition-related costs, as well as increases in accounts payable, accrued
advertising and interest payable. Net cash provided by operating activities of
$31.0 million and $687,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively, was primarily attributable to increases in accounts payable, other
liabilities and accrued expenses, accrued advertising and non-cash expenses,
largely offset by the net loss and increases in inventories and prepaid expenses
and other.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $938 million and $231.1 million
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and
consisted of net purchases of marketable securities, purchases of fixed assets
primarily for distribution center expansion, and cash paid for acquisitions and
equity investments. Cash available for investment purposes increased
substantially in 1999 as a result of the issuance of the Convertible Notes. Net
cash used in investing activities was $261.8 million for the year ended December
31, 1998 and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities, purchases of
fixed assets, and acquisitions, dispositions and investments in businesses. For
the year ended December 31, 1997, net cash used in investing activities was
$125.7 million and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities and
purchases of fixed assets.

     Net cash provided by financing activities of $1.1 billion for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 1999 resulted from proceeds relating to
the issuance of the Convertible Notes, net of financing costs, and proceeds from
issuance of capital stock and exercises of stock options, offset by cash
payments of $184.7 million on long-term debt including $180.9 million for
repurchases of the Senior Discount Notes. Net cash provided by financing
activities of $254.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 resulted from
net proceeds of approximately $318.2 million from the Senior Discount Notes
offering, net proceeds of approximately $8.4 million from PlanetAll's issuance
of capital stock, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $6 million,
partially offset by the repayment of a senior loan. Net cash provided by
financing activities of $126 million for the year ended December 31, 1997
resulted primarily from net proceeds from a senior loan, our initial public
offering and PlanetAll's issuance of capital stock.

     As of September 30, 1999, our principal commitments consisted of
obligations outstanding under our Convertible Notes, including interest
payments, and Senior Discount Notes, obligations in connection with the
acquisition of fixed assets and leases, and commitments for advertising and
promotional arrangements. Expansion of our distribution center network has and
will require us to continue to commit to lease obligations, stock inventories,
and purchase fixed assets and install leasehold improvements. Failure to achieve
favorable financing for asset acquisitions could negatively impact our cash
flows. In addition, our plans are to continue to increase our merchandise
inventory in order to provide broader product offerings and better availability
to customers and to support the recently introduced toys, electronics, home
improvement and software product lines. Geographic expansion and continued
acquisitions and investments will also require future capital expenditures.

     We believe that the proceeds of this offering, together with current cash
and marketable securities balances, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections
of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. If
current cash, marketable securities and cash that may be generated from
operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek
to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a line of credit. Upon
completion of this offering, our universal shelf registration statement will
permit us, from time to time, to offer and sell various types of securities, up
to a total value of approximately $1.32 billion. The sale of

                                      S-36
<PAGE>   36

additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional
dilution to our stockholders. In addition, we will periodically consider the
acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, products, services and
technologies, and the repurchase and retirement of debt, which might impact our
liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt
securities. We cannot be sure that financing will be available in amounts or on
terms acceptable to us, if at all.

YEAR 2000 IMPLICATIONS

     Many currently installed computer systems, software programs, and embedded
data chips are programmed using a 2-digit date field and are therefore unable to
distinguish dates beyond the 20th century. A failure to identify and correct any
mission-critical internal or third party year 2000 processing problem could have
a material adverse operational or financial consequence to us.

     We established a Year 2000 Project Team that, together with external
consultants, developed a process for addressing the year 2000 issue including
performing an inventory, an assessment, remediation procedures (to the extent
necessary) and testing procedures of all mission-critical information systems
and equipment and machinery that contain embedded technology, as well as
obtaining assurances from all mission-critical third parties as to their own
year 2000 preparedness. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, all of our
mission-critical systems have been successfully tested for year 2000 compliance
and we have not experienced any significant year 2000 problems with our own
mission-critical systems or any mission-critical third parties. Although we have
not experienced any significant year 2000 problems to date, we plan to continue
to monitor the situation closely.

     We cannot be sure that we will be completely successful in our efforts to
address the year 2000 issue or that problems arising from the year 2000 issue
will not cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial
condition. We believe, however, that our most reasonably likely worst-case
scenario would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than
with our internal systems. We are limited in our efforts to address the year
2000 issue as it relates to third parties and rely solely on the assurances of
these third parties as to their year 2000 preparedness.

     As part of our broader contingency planning, we also developed business
continuity plans to address each critical process and activity that we believe
would cause a significant disruption to operations if not functional for 24
hours. Despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee that the contingency plan will
adequately address all circumstances that may disrupt operations or that such
planning will prevent circumstances that may cause a material adverse effect on
our operating results or financial condition.

                                  THE COMPANY

GENERAL

     Amazon.com is the world's leading online retailer. Amazon.com directly
offers for sale millions of distinct items in categories such as books, music,
toys, electronics, videos, DVDs, home improvement products, software and video
games. Through our marketplace services such as Amazon.com Auctions, zShops and
sothebys.amazon.com, we have created Web-based marketplaces where buyers and
sellers can enter into transactions with respect to a wide range of products.
Amazon.com has also invested in and developed strategic commercial relationships
with a number of selected e-commerce companies. Amazon.com offers its customers
a superior shopping experience by providing high value through selection,
convenience, ease of use, product information and an intense focus on customer
service. Amazon.com is a proven technology leader, having developed electronic
commerce innovations such as 1-Click technology, personalized shopping services,
easy-to-use search and browse features, secure payment protections and wireless
access to the Amazon.com Web site. In 1999, Amazon.com significantly expanded
its distribution capabilities worldwide with the addition of eight new
distribution centers comprising approximately four million square feet of
warehouse and distribution space. These new facilities increase our control over
the distribution process and facilitate our ability to deliver merchandise to
customers on a reliable and timely basis.

     Amazon.com has served over 17 million customer accounts in over 150
countries. In addition to our US Web site, we currently have two internationally
focused Web sites located at www.amazon.co.uk and www.amazon.de. Each of
Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de was ranked the number one e-commerce site and the
number 10 most visited site overall in the UK and Germany, respectively,
according to the Media Metrix ratings for Europe released in January 2000. Both
of these Web sites were launched in October 1998, and currently have product and
service offerings consisting of books, music, auctions and zShops. These
international Web sites have the same look, feel and functionality as the US Web
site, including 1-Click technology, personalized recommendations and product
reviews, but offer content, products and services tailored to the local market.
The Amazon.de Web site is presented in the German language. In the fourth
quarter of 1999, combined sales from these Web sites totaled $71 million, a 360%
increase from the fourth quarter of 1998. We currently have distribution centers
and customer service centers in the UK and Germany.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

     Amazon.com seeks to be the world's most customer-centric company where
customers can find and discover anything they may want to buy online. We intend
to leverage our Internet platform to expand the range of products and services
offered to our customers. This platform consists of strong brand recognition, a
large and growing group of customers, innovative technology, extensive and
sophisticated distribution capabilities and significant e-commerce expertise.
Amazon.com believes that this platform allows us to launch new e-commerce
businesses quickly, with a high quality of customer experience, economical
incremental cost and good prospects for success. We also believe that this
platform allows us to expand the range of products and services offered to our
customers through relationships with strategic partners on terms that are
attractive to our customers, our strategic partners and us.

     We intend to continue expanding internationally by increasing the product
and service offerings on Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de, establishing new Web sites
focused on particular international markets, entering into strategic
relationships that enhance our international operations and continuing the sale
of products from the US to international customers. We believe that there are
significant e-commerce opportunities outside of the US and that Amazon.com is
well-positioned to be a global e-commerce leader given the platform we have
created in the US and our experience in international markets to date.

</TABLE>

     In the past, we have offered our products and services primarily through
two means: Amazon.com's online retail stores and Amazon.com's marketplace
services (including Amazon.com Auctions, sothebys.amazon.com and zShops). We
have recently entered into agreements to expand the product and services we
offer by allowing selected strategic partners to sell products and services
under co-branded sections on the Amazon.com Web site. We refer to these new
arrangements as the Amazon.com Commerce Network.

     Our US online retail stores currently consist of books, music, DVD/Video,
electronics and software, toys and video games and home improvement. With the
exception of books, which we launched in 1995, and music and video, which we
launched in 1998, we launched all of the remaining stores in 1999. We anticipate
new store additions in 2000 and beyond.

     US Books, Music and DVD/Video. We are the Internet's number one books,
number one music and number one DVD/Video retailer based upon our 1999 revenues
and industry rankings. We currently offer an aggregate of over 13 million titles
in books, music and DVD/Video.

     During 1999, we continued to enhance our Book Store by expanding selection
and improving the customer experience. We created new specialty stores such as
our professional and technical store, expanded our editorial content through
partnerships with experts in certain fields and increased selection with the
addition of millions of used and out-of-print titles.

     During 1999, our Music Store launched an improved classical musical store,
enhanced its product recommendation services and added new features to promote
independent artists via Amazon.com Advantage. Amazon.com became the first major
online music retailer to dedicate an area of its store to free, full-length song
downloads from established artists and major-label performers, and continues to
offer the largest selection of free promotional song downloads from major label
artists of any major online music retailer.

     Our DVD/Video Store, which opened in November 1998, enjoyed strong revenue
growth in 1999. In addition, our DVD/Video Store continued its integration with
our Internet Movie Database, a leading online information source for movie
enthusiasts, created and hosted the official Web site for "American Beauty,"
winner of three Golden Globe(TM) awards, and began streaming exclusive outtake
footage from motion pictures such as "The Blair Witch Project" and "Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me."

     International Sales. We have two internationally focused Web sites located
at www.amazon.co.uk and www.amazon.de. Both of these Web sites were launched in
October 1998, and currently have product and service offerings consisting of
books, music, auctions and zShops which are tailored to their individual
markets. We intend to expand the product and service offerings of these Web
sites in the future.

<PAGE>   39

     Other US Retail. Amazon.com's other online retail stores consist of
electronics and software, toys and video games and home improvement. Our Toy and
Video Games Store and Electronics and Software Store have each been ranked the
number one online stores in their respective categories based upon 1999 industry
rankings.

     Marketplace Services. We facilitate the sale of products through our
marketplace services which currently consist of Amazon.com Auctions, zShops and
sothebys.amazon.com. Amazon.com Auctions allows buyers and sellers to conduct
transactions with respect to a wide variety of products in an easy to use
auction format. Amazon.com zShops allows individuals and businesses to offer
popular as well as hard-to-find items to Amazon.com's customers.
sothebys.amazon.com is an online auction site devoted to antiques and
collectibles.

     During the fourth quarter of 1999, these marketplace services surpassed a
combined 1 million registered users and 1.5 million active listings. Since its
launch in November, 1999, sothebys.amazon.com has achieved average close rates,
which are rates of actual purchases by customers visiting the site, in excess of
50% and average auction closing prices of over $500.

     The participants of our marketplace services can use our Amazon.com
Payments service, which allows individuals and small businesses to accept credit
card payments through Amazon.com's 1-Click payment feature, thus eliminating the
problems associated with checks and money orders.

     Amazon.com Commerce Network. We have recently entered into agreements to
allow selected strategic partners to sell products under co-branded sections on
our Web site. We believe that these arrangements will be attractive to
Amazon.com customers as a result of the increase in product and service
selection available on our site, attractive to the strategic partners as a
result of the potential growth of their customer base and brand awareness, and
financially attractive to us. See "Summary -- Recent Developments."

AMAZON.COM WEB SITES

     We believe that the sale of products and services over the Web offers
attractive benefits to customers, including greater selection, convenience,
ease-of-use, competitive pricing and personalization. The key features of
Amazon.com's Web sites include browsing, searching, useful product information,
reviews, recommendations and personalization, broad selection, low prices,
1-Click technology, secure payment systems and availability and fulfillment. Our
Web sites promote brand loyalty and repeat purchases by providing an inviting
and satisfying experience that encourages customers to return frequently and to
interact with other customers.

     Browsing. The Amazon.com sites offer visitors a variety of highlighted
subject areas, styles and special features arranged in a simple, easy-to-use
fashion intended to enhance product search and selection. In addition, the Web
sites present a variety of products and services and topical information. To
enhance the customers' shopping experience and increase sales, we feature a
variety of products and services on a rotating basis throughout the stores.

     Searching. A primary feature of Amazon.com Web sites is their interactive,
searchable catalogs of millions of books, music products, videos, DVDs, toys and
video games, electronics and software and home improvement products. We provide
a variety of search tools to find desired products based on numerous search
criteria. We license some of our catalog and other information from third
parties.

     Reviews and Content. The Amazon.com online stores offer numerous forms of
content to enhance the customer's shopping experience and encourage purchases.
Various types of content are available for particular titles, including cover
art, synopses, annotations, reviews by editorial staff and other customers, and
interviews by authors and artists.

     Recommendations and Personalization. Amazon.com personalizes its product
and service offerings. These features include greeting customers by name,
instant and personalized recommendations, personal notification services,
purchase pattern filtering and a number of other related features. Amazon.com's
Wish List feature allows users to create an online wish list of desired products
and services that others can reference for gift-giving purposes. We believe that
personalization of a customer's shopping experience at our Web sites

                                      S-40
<PAGE>   40

is an important element of the value proposition we offer to customers, and we
intend to continue to enhance our personalized services.

     Other Web Site Services. The Amazon.com Web site provides other services to
make online shopping more enjoyable for our customers. In our Gift Ideas
section, we feature a seasonally appropriate selection of gift ideas and
services. In our Community section, we provide a gathering place where customers
can share product information and recommendations. Through our E-Cards section,
customers can send free animated electronic greeting cards to friends and
family.

     1-Click Technology. Amazon.com provides customers with a streamlined
ordering process using 1-Click technology. If a customer has previously
activated 1-Click functionality, that customer can place an order by clicking
one button without having to fill out an order form. The customer's shipping and
billing information is automatically referenced on our secure server.

     Secure Credit Card Payment. Amazon.com uses secure server software for
secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of the customer's personal
information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot
be read as the information travels over the Internet.

     Availability and Fulfillment. Many of our products are available for
shipment within 24 hours, although some products take longer and some may not be
available at all. Customers can select from a variety of delivery options,
including overnight and various international shipping options, as well as
gift-wrapping services. We use e-mail to notify customers of order status under
various conditions and provide links to shipping carriers so that the customers
can track their shipments. We seek to provide rapid and reliable fulfillment of
customer orders and to continue to improve our speed of availability and
fulfillment.

     Remote Access. In October 1999, we launched Amazon.com Anywhere which
allows Amazon.com customers to access the Amazon.com site from hand-held
wireless devices, such as cellular phones and the Palm VII Connected Organizer,
and to utilize features such as 1-Click purchasing and product-searching
capabilities on their wireless devices.

     Return Policy. For the 30 days following receipt of a customer order,
Amazon.com provides a full refund for any book in its original condition, any
Amazon.com recommended book in any condition, any unopened music CD, DVD, VHS
tape or software, and any other merchandise item in new condition, with its
original packaging and accessories.

STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS

     We have entered into a number of strategic relationships with selected
e-commerce companies. These relationships generally consist of our making, or
having the future right to make, a minority investment in the companies,
generally ranging from 5% to 49%, and the entry into commercial agreements which
vary in scope from customer promotional activities and links to recently
announced deals involving the sale of products and services on co-branded
sections of the Amazon.com Web site. Certain of our strategic relationships are
listed below:

<TABLE>

     COMPANY                            NATURE OF BUSINESS

Audible            Internet delivered spoken audio for PC-based listening or
                   playback devices

                   personalized gift suggestions
drugstore.com      Online retail and information source for health, beauty,
                   wellness, personal care and pharmacy

                   prices

Sothebys           Auction house with whom we partnered to create an online
                   auction site devoted to antiques and collectibles
</TABLE>

     We believe that these investments and commercial arrangements are
attractive to us for a variety of reasons. First, our customers are given access
to a wider range of products and services. Second, we are able to generate
revenue from the strategic partners for allowing them access to the Amazon.com
customer base. Third, we have the opportunity to participate in the future
success of our strategic partners as a result of our ownership interest in such
companies. We believe that our strategic partners are also well served as a
result of the opportunity to quickly grow their customer base and build brand
recognition.

MARKETING AND PROMOTION

     Amazon.com's marketing strategy is designed to strengthen the Amazon brand
name, increase customer traffic to the Amazon.com Web sites, build customer
loyalty, encourage repeat purchases and develop incremental product and service
revenue opportunities.

     Amazon.com creatively applies technology to deliver personalized programs
and services, as well as flexible merchandising. We employ a variety of media,
business development and promotional methods to achieve these goals. We also
benefit from public relations activities as well as online and traditional
advertising, including radio, television and print media.

     We extend our market presence through our Associates Program, which enables
associated Web sites to make products available to their audiences with order
fulfillment by Amazon.com. Approximately 350,000 Web sites have enrolled in the
Associates Program.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

     We believe that our ability to establish and maintain long-term
relationships with our customers and to encourage repeat visits and purchases
depends, in part, on the strength of our customer service operations. We seek to
achieve frequent communication with and feedback from our customers to
continually improve the Amazon.com experience. Users can contact customer
service representatives via telephone and e-mail 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
We have automated certain tools used by our customer support and service staff
and have plans for further enhancements. As of December 31, 1999, we had
customer service personnel working in five customer service centers located in
Seattle and Tacoma, Washington; Slough, England;

                                      S-42
<PAGE>   42

Regensburg, Germany; and Grand Forks, North Dakota. We plan to open an
additional customer service center in Huntington, West Virginia in 2000.

WAREHOUSING, FULFILLMENT AND DISTRIBUTION

     We significantly expanded our US distribution infrastructure in 1999 with
the addition of new distribution facilities in Fernley, Nevada; Coffeyville,
Kansas; Campbellsville, Kentucky; Lexington, Kentucky; McDonough, Georgia; and
Grand Forks, North Dakota. We also opened new distribution centers in the UK and
Germany. On an aggregate basis, we added eight new distribution centers in 1999
comprising approximately four million square feet of warehouse space. The
geographic coverage of these distribution centers and their capacity has
dramatically improved our fulfillment capabilities and will allow us to continue
to increase our volume. The new distribution centers also give us more control
over the distribution process and facilitate our ability to deliver merchandise
to customers on a reliable and timely basis. We now have a total of 10
distribution centers, including our facilities in Seattle, Washington, and
Newcastle, Delaware. We anticipate that our current distribution center capacity
will be sufficient for our needs in the US for at least the next 12 months.

     We purchase products from a network of manufacturers, distributors,
publishers and labels. For orders that cannot be filled from our inventory, our
proprietary software selects the orders that can be filled via electronic
interfaces with vendors and, in some cases, forwards the remaining orders to our
special orders group. This special orders group has developed customized
information systems and consists of trained ordering personnel who specialize in
hard-to-find products. Under our arrangements with certain distributors,
electronically ordered products often are shipped to us by the distributor
within hours of a receipt of an order from Amazon.com. We ship all products
through our own distribution centers to ensure a high quality customer
experience.

TECHNOLOGY

     We have implemented numerous Web site management, search, customer
interaction, recommendation, transaction-processing and fulfillment services and
systems using a combination of our own proprietary technologies and commercially
available, licensed technologies. Our current strategy is to focus our
development efforts on creating and enhancing the specialized, proprietary
software that is unique to our business and to license or acquire commercially
developed technology for other applications where available and appropriate.

     We use a set of applications for accepting and validating customer orders,
placing and tracking orders with suppliers, managing and assigning inventory to
customer orders and ensuring proper shipment of products to customers based on
various ordering criteria. Our transaction-processing systems handle millions of
items, a number of different status inquiries, gift-wrapping requests and
multiple shipment methods and allow the customer to choose whether to receive
single or several shipments based on availability. These applications also
manage the process of accepting, authorizing and charging customer credit cards.
Amazon.com Web sites also incorporate a variety of search and database tools.

     Systems administrators and network managers monitor and operate our Web
sites, network operations and transaction-processing systems. The continued
uninterrupted operation of our Web sites and transaction-processing systems is
essential to our business and it is the job of the Web site operations staff to
ensure their reliability. We use the services of five Internet service providers
to obtain connectivity to the Internet, both domestically and internationally,
over multiple dedicated lines.

                              DESCRIPTION OF NOTES

     The notes are to be issued under an indenture to be dated as of February
16, 2000, between Amazon.com and The Bank of New York, as trustee. You may
request a copy of the indenture from the trustee.

     The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the
notes and the indenture. It does not purport to be complete. This summary is
subject to and is qualified by reference to all the provisions of the indenture,
including the definitions of certain terms used in the indenture. Wherever
particular provisions or defined terms of the indenture or form of note are
referred to, these provisions or defined terms are incorporated in this
prospectus supplement by reference.

     As used in this "Description of Notes" section, references to "Amazon.com,"
"we", "our" or "us" refer solely to Amazon.com, Inc. and not Amazon.com together
with its subsidiaries.

GENERAL

     The notes will be general unsecured obligations of Amazon.com. Our payment
obligations under the notes will be subordinated to our senior indebtedness as
described under "-- Subordination of Notes." The notes are convertible into our
common stock as described under "-- Conversion of Notes." The notes will be
limited to E690,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The notes will be issued
only in denominations of E1,000 and multiples of E1,000. The notes will mature
on February 16, 2010 unless earlier converted, redeemed at our option, or
redeemed at your option upon a fundamental change of Amazon.com. The notes will
be issued at an initial conversion price of E104.947. The conversion price will
be reset on February 16, 2001 and February 16, 2002 as provided in
"-- Conversion of Notes."

     We are not subject to any financial covenants under the indenture. In
addition, we are not restricted under the indenture from paying dividends,
incurring debt, including senior indebtedness, or issuing or repurchasing our
outstanding securities.

     You are not afforded protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction or a change in control of Amazon.com under the indenture except to
the extent described below under "-- Redemption at Option of the Holder."

     The notes will bear interest of 6.875% from February 16, 2000, or from the
most recent interest payment date in which interest has been paid or duly
provided for. We will pay interest on February 16 of each year, beginning
February 16, 2001, to record holders at the close of business on the preceding
February 1, as the case may be, except that:

     - interest payable upon redemption will be paid to the person to whom
       principal is payable, unless the redemption date is an interest payment
       date; and

     - as set forth in the next sentence and the paragraph thereafter.

     In case you convert any of your notes into common stock during the period
after any record date but prior to the next interest payment date either:

     - we will not be required to pay interest on the interest payment date if
       the note has been called for redemption on a redemption date that occurs
       during this period; or

     - we will not be required to pay interest on the interest payment date if
       the note is to be redeemed in connection with a fundamental change on a
       repurchase date that occurs during this period; or

     - if otherwise, except in the situation in which we give you notice of
       withdrawal of your conversion rights, any note not called for redemption
       that is submitted for conversion during this period must also be
       accompanied by an amount equal to the interest due on the interest
       payment date on the converted principal amount, unless at the time of
       conversion there is a default in the payment of interest on the notes.
       See "-- Conversion of Notes."

     In addition, if we withdraw your conversion rights as described below under
"-- Withdrawal of Conversion Rights," we will be required to pay you an
additional amount in cash which we refer to as a
                                      S-46
<PAGE>   46

"make-whole payment." If we make such a make-whole payment, we will continue to
pay interest on your notes so long as they remain outstanding, except that if
the record date for any interest payment date occurs prior to the date our
withdrawal of conversion rights is effective, we will not be required to pay
interest on that interest payment date.

     We will maintain an office in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New
York, for the payment of interest, which shall initially be an office or agency
of the trustee.

     We may pay interest either:

     - by check mailed to your address as it appears in the note register,
       provided that if you are a holder with an aggregate principal amount in
       excess of E10.0 million, you shall be paid, at your written election, by
       wire transfer in immediately available funds; or

     - by transfer to an account maintained by you in the United States.

     However, payments to The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York,
which we refer to as DTC, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account of DTC or its nominee. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

FORM, DENOMINATION AND REGISTRATION

     The notes will be issued:

     - in fully registered form,

     - without interest coupon, and

     - in denominations of E1,000 principal amount and integral multiples of
       E1,000.

     GLOBAL NOTES, BOOK-ENTRY FORM

     The notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes. We will
deposit the global note or notes with DTC and register the global note or notes
in the name of Cede & Co. as DTC's nominee. Except as set forth below, a global
note may be transferred, in whole or in part, only to another nominee of DTC or
to a successor of DTC or its nominee.

     Holders of the notes may hold their interest in a global note directly
through DTC if such holder is a participant in DTC, or indirectly through
organizations which are direct or indirect participants in DTC (called
"participants"). Holders may hold beneficial interests in the global notes
directly through DTC, the Euroclear System ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking
S.A. ("Clearstream", formerly Cedelbank), if they are participants in these
systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in these
sytems.

     Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities on behalf of their participants
through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of
their respective depositaries, which in turn hold such securities in customers'
securities accounts in the depositaries' names on the books of DTC. Chase
Manhattan Bank initially will act as depositary of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A.
initially will act as depositary for Clearstream.

     Holders of the notes who are not participants may beneficially own
interests in a global note held by DTC only through direct or indirect
participants in DTC (including Euroclear and Clearstream), or certain banks,
brokers, dealers, trust companies and other parties that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or
indirectly (called "indirect participants"). So long as Cede & Co., as nominee
of DTC, is the registered owner of a global note, Cede & Co. for all purposes
will be considered the sole holder of such global note.

     Except as provided below, owners of a beneficial interest in a global note
will:

     - not be entitled to have certificates registered in their names,

     - not receive physical delivery of certificates in definitive registered
       form, and

     - not be considered direct holders of the global note.

                                      S-47
<PAGE>   47

     Accordingly, any person owning a beneficial interest in the global notes
must rely on the procedures of DTC and, to the extent relevant, Euroclear and
Cedelbank, and, if such person is not a direct participant, on the procedures of
the participants through which such person owns its interests, to exercise any
rights of a noteholder.

     Notes represented by a global note may be exchanged for definitive notes in
registered form only if:

     - DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary
       for that global note and we do not appoint a successor depositary within
       90 days after receiving that notice;

     - at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the US
       Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and we do not
       appoint a successor depositary within 90 days after becoming aware that
       DTC has ceased to be registered as a clearing agency;

     - we in our sole discretion determine that the global note will be
       exchangeable for definitive notes in registered form and notify the
       trustee of our decision; or

     - an event of default with respect to the notes represented by that global
       note has occurred and is continuing.

     A global note that may be exchanged as described in the preceding sentence
will be exchanged for definitive notes issued in denominations of E1,000 and
integrated multiples of E1,000 in registered form for the same aggregate amount.
The definitive notes will be registered in the names of the owners of the
beneficial interests in the global note as directed by DTC.

     We will pay interest on and the redemption price of a global note to Cede &
Co., as the registered owner of the global note, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on each interest payment date or the redemption or repurchase
date, as the case may be. Neither we, the trustee nor any paying agent will be
responsible or liable:

     - for the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial
       ownership interests in a global note, or

     - for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to the
       beneficial ownership interests.

     We have been informed that DTC's practice is to credit participants'
accounts on that payment date with payment in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the principal amount represented by a global
note as shown in the records of DTC, unless DTC has reason to believe that it
will not receive payment on that payment date. Payments by participants to
owners of a beneficial interest in the principal amount represented by a global
note will be the responsibility of the participants, as is now the case with
securities held for the accounts of customers registered in "street name".

     Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having a beneficial
interest in the principal amount represented by the global note to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack
of a physical certificate evidencing its interest.

     Neither Amazon.com, the trustee, the registrar, the paying agents nor the
conversion agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or any
of its participants (including Euroclear and Clearstream) or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations. DTC has advised us that it will take any action
permitted to be taken by a holder of notes, including the representation of
notes for exchange, only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account with DTC interests in the global note are credited, and only in respect
of the principal amount of the notes represented by the global note as to which
the participant or participants has or have given such direction.

     DTC has advised us that it is:

     - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of
       New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System,

                                      S-48
<PAGE>   48

     - a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial
       Code, and

     - a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17
       of the Exchange Act.

     DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate
the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants
through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants.
Participants include Euroclear, Clearstream, securities brokers, dealers, banks,
trust companies and clearing corporations and other organizations. Some of the
participants and their representatives, together with other entities, own DTC.
Indirect access to the DTC system is available to banks, brokers, dealers, trust
companies and others that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a participant, either directly or indirectly.

     DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate the transfer of
interests in a global note among participants. However, DTC is under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform these procedures, and may
discontinue these procedures at any time. If DTC is at any time unwilling or
unable to continue as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by
us within 90 days, we will issue notes in certificated form in exchange for
global notes.

CONVERSION OF NOTES

     You may convert your note, in whole or in part, into common stock from the
issue date, February 16, 2000, through the final maturity date of the notes,
February 16, 2010, subject to prior redemption or repurchase of the notes and
subject to our right, in certain circumstances described below, to withdraw your
right to convert the notes. The number of shares of common stock you will
receive upon conversion of your notes will be determined by dividing the
principal amount of notes you convert by the conversion price on the date of
conversion. The initial conversion price is E104.947. The initial conversion
price is subject to adjustments, as described below, including a reset on each
of February 16, 2001 and February 16, 2002. Please read the section below
entitled "-- Reset of Conversion Price" for a more complete description of the
reset to the conversion price. Conversion of notes may result in income for US
federal income tax purposes. See "United States Federal Income Tax
Consequences -- US Holders -- Conversion of the Notes".

     GENERAL

     If we call notes for redemption, you may convert the notes only until the
close of business on the business day prior to the redemption date unless we
fail to pay the redemption price. You may convert your notes in part so long as
this part is E1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple of E1,000. If any
notes not called for redemption are converted after a record date for any
interest payment date and prior to the next interest payment date, holders must
include with the notes an amount equal to the interest payable on the interest
payment date on the converted principal amount unless a default exists at the
time of conversion.

     In the case of notes called for redemption, conversion rights will expire
at the close of business on the business day preceding the day fixed for
redemption unless we default in the payment of the redemption price. A note in
respect of which a holder is exercising its option to require redemption upon a
fundamental change of Amazon.com may be converted only if such holder withdraws
its election to exercise its option in accordance with the terms of the
indenture.

     To convert your note into common stock you must:

     - complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the note
       or facsimile of the conversion notice and deliver this notice to the
       conversion agent;

     - surrender the note to the conversion agent;

     - if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;

     - if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes; and

     - if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next interest
       payment date.

                                      S-49
<PAGE>   49

     The date you comply with these requirements is the conversion date under
the indenture. When you convert your notes you may do so directly through the
trustee or through another agent, including through Banque Internationale a
Luxembourg, our Luxembourg paying and conversion agent. Conversion of notes may
result in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See "United States
Federal Income Tax Consequences -- U.S. Holders -- Conversion of the Notes".

     Upon conversion of an interest in a note, the trustee will make a notation
on the global note to indicate the reduction in principal amount, and once the
requirements set forth above have been satisfied, as promptly as practicable we
will issue to the holder of such converted interest a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of our common stock issuable upon
such conversion. We will not issue any fractional shares and will instead
deliver a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest in a share of our
common stock arising upon such conversion. All such deliveries, and payments, if
any, will be made through our paying agents, which include the trustee and
Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, our Luxembourg paying and conversion agent.

     ADJUSTMENT OF CONVERSION PRICE

     Except as described below, you will not receive any accrued interest or
dividends upon conversion.

     We will adjust the conversion price if any of the following events occurs:

          (1) we issue common stock as a dividend or distribution on our common
     stock;

          (2) we issue to all holders of common stock certain rights or warrants
     to purchase our common stock;

          (3) we subdivide or combine our common stock;

          (4) we distribute to all holders of common stock our capital stock,
     evidences of indebtedness or assets, including securities but excluding:

             - rights or warrants listed in (2) above;

             - dividends or distributions listed in (1) above; and

             - cash distributions listed in (5) below;

          (5) we distribute cash, excluding any quarterly cash dividend on our
     common stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of
     common stock in any quarter does not exceed the greater of:

             a. the amount per share of common stock of the next preceding
        quarterly cash dividend on the common stock to the extent that such
        preceding quarterly dividend did not require an adjustment of the
        conversion price pursuant to this clause (5), as adjusted to reflect
        subdivisions or combinations of the common stock, and

             b. 3.75% of the average of the last reported sales price of the
        common stock during the ten trading days immediately prior to the
        declaration date of the dividend, and excluding any dividend or
        distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding
        up of Amazon.com.

     If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause (5) as a result
     of a distribution that is a quarterly divided, the adjustment would be
     based upon the amount by which the distribution exceeds the amount of the
     quarterly cash dividend permitted to be excluded pursuant to this clause
     (5). If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause (5) as a
     result of a distribution that is not a quarterly dividend, the adjustment
     would be based upon the full amount of the distribution;

          (6) we or one of our subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a
     tender offer or exchange offer for our common stock to the extent that the
     cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share
     of common stock exceeds the price per share of common stock on the trading
     day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made
     pursuant to such tender or exchange offer; and

                                      S-50
<PAGE>   50

          (7) someone other than us or one of our subsidiaries makes a payment
     in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer in which, as of the closing
     date of the offer, our board of directors is not recommending rejection of
     the offer. The adjustment referred to in this clause (7) will only be made
     if:

        - the tender offer or exchange offer is for an amount that increases the
          offeror's ownership of common stock to more than 25% of the total
          shares of common stock outstanding, and

        - the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment
          per share of common stock exceeds the current market price per share
          of common stock on the business day next succeeding the last date on
          which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to the tender or
          exchange offer.

     However, the adjustment referred to in this clause (7) will generally not
be made if, as of the closing of the offer, the offering documents disclose a
plan or an intention to cause us to engage in a consolidation or merger of
Amazon.com or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In certain
circumstances, an adjustment to the conversion price could give rise to a deemed
stock distribution to US Holders and Non-US Holders. We have undertaken to
publish a notice of any such adjustment in Luxembourg within 10 days after the
occurrence of any of the above. See also "-- Notices". See "United States
Federal Income Tax Consequences -- US Holders -- Constructive Dividends on
Notes."

     RESET OF CONVERSION PRICE

     The initial conversion price will be reset on February 16, 2001 and
February 16, 2002 to the lesser of (1) the conversion price then in effect and
(2) the euro equivalent average of the daily closing prices of our common stock
for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding such date, provided
that the conversion price shall not be reset to lower than E84.883 (subject to
any anti-dilution adjustments). As a result of this limitation on resetting the
conversion price, no more than 11.781 shares of our common stock would be
issuable upon conversion of E1,000 principal amount of notes (subject to any
anti-dilution adjustments). The euro equivalent average will be calculated by
converting the applicable dollar price of the common stock into euros based on
the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers on each of the 20
consecutive trading days mentioned above and then taking the average of such
converted prices. In certain circumstances, an adjustment to the conversion
price could give rise to a deemed stock distribution to US Holders and Non-US
Holders. We have undertaken to publish a notice of each reset in Luxembourg
within 10 days after the occurrence of such reset. See also "-- Notices". See
"United States Federal Income Tax Consequences -- US Holders -- Constructive
Dividends on Notes."

     OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING CONVERSION

     In the event of:

     - any reclassification of our common stock, or

     - a consolidation, merger or combination involving Amazon.com, or

     - a sale or conveyance to another person or entity of all or substantially
       all the property and assets of Amazon.com as an entirety,

in which holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive stock, other
securities, other property, assets or cash for their common stock, you will
generally be entitled thereafter to convert your notes into the same type of
consideration which you would have been entitled to receive if you had converted
the notes into our common stock immediately prior to any of these events.

     You may in certain situations be deemed to have received a distribution
subject to US federal income tax as a dividend in the event of any taxable
distribution to holders of common stock or in certain other situations requiring
a conversion price adjustment. See "US Federal Income Tax Consequences."

     We may from time to time reduce the conversion price for a period of at
least 20 days if our board of directors has made a determination that this
reduction would be in our best interests. Any such determination

                                      S-51
<PAGE>   51

by our board will be conclusive and binding on holders. We would give holders at
least 15 days' notice of any reduction in the conversion price. In addition, we
may reduce the conversion price if our board of directors deems it advisable to
avoid or diminish any income tax liability of holders of common stock resulting
from any stock or rights distribution. See "US Federal Income Tax Consequences."

     We will not be required to make an adjustment in the conversion price
unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the conversion
price. However, we will carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of
the conversion price. Except as described above in this section, we will not
adjust the conversion price for any issuance of our common stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or any rights to purchase
our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common
stock.

     We are not required to issue fractional shares of common stock upon
conversion of notes and, in lieu thereof, will pay a cash adjustment based upon
the market price of the common stock on the last business day prior to the date
of conversion. This cash payment will be made in euros and will be calculated by
multiplying the US dollar value of the cash adjustment by the noon buying rate
in New York City for cable transfers in euros on the date on which such
conversion is made.

WITHDRAWAL OF CONVERSION RIGHTS

     If at any time and each time prior to February 20, 2003 the euro equivalent
of the closing price of our common stock shall have exceeded 160% of the initial
conversion price (E167.915) for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive
30-trading day period, we may withdraw your conversion rights. We must give you
notice at least 30 days, and no more than 60 days, prior to the date on which
your conversion rights are withdrawn, and such notice shall be given no later
than five business days after the last day on which such event had occurred or
was continuing.

     If we withdraw your conversion rights in the time frame discussed above, we
will pay you an additional amount in cash with respect to each of your notes
equal to E206.25 per E1,000 notes, less the amount of any interest actually paid
on such note prior to the date in which we give you notice as described above.
We refer to this additional payment as a "make-whole payment". We will make this
make-whole payment to you on the date on which the withdrawal of your conversion
right is effective. WE WILL MAKE THIS MAKE-WHOLE PAYMENT TO ALL NOTE HOLDERS,
INCLUDING TO NOTE HOLDERS WHO CONVERT THEIR NOTES INTO OUR COMMON STOCK DURING
THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE DATE WE GIVE NOTICE OF OUR INTENTION TO WITHDRAW THE
CONVERSION RIGHTS AND THE DATE ON WHICH THE CONVERSION RIGHTS ARE ACTUALLY
WITHDRAWN.

OPTIONAL REDEMPTION BY AMAZON.COM

     The notes are not entitled to any sinking fund. At any time on or after
February 20, 2003, we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at par. In such
case, we will pay you interest on the principal amount of your redeemed notes,
but excluding, the redemption date. If the redemption date is an interest
payment date, interest shall be paid to the record holder on the relevant record
date. We are required to give notice of redemption by mail to holders not less
than 30 days, and no more than 60 days, prior to the redemption date.

     If less than all of the outstanding notes are to be redeemed, the trustee
shall select the notes to be redeemed in principal amounts of E1,000 or integral
multiples of E1,000 by lot, pro rata or by another method the trustee considers
fair and appropriate. If a portion of your notes is selected for partial
redemption and you convert a portion of your notes, the converted portion shall
be deemed to be of the portion selected for redemption.

     We may not redeem the notes if we have failed to pay any interest on the
notes and such failure is continuing. We have undertaken to publish a notice of
any such redemption in Luxembourg and also to provide the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange with the amounts redeemed and the amounts outstanding on a regular
basis.

                                      S-52
<PAGE>   52

REDEMPTION AT OPTION OF THE HOLDER

     If a fundamental change of Amazon.com occurs prior to February 16, 2010,
you may require us to redeem your notes, in whole but not in part, on a
repurchase date that is 30 days after the date of our notice of the fundamental
change. The notes will be redeemable in integral multiples of E1,000 principal
amount.

     We shall redeem the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. If
the repurchase date is an interest payment date, we will pay interest to the
record holder on the relevant record date.

     We will mail to all record holders a notice of a fundamental change of
Amazon.com within 10 days after it has occurred. We are also required to deliver
to the trustee a copy of the fundamental change notice. If you elect to redeem
your notes, you must deliver to us or our designated agent, on or before the
30th day after the date of our fundamental change notice, your redemption notice
and any notes to be redeemed, duly endorsed for transfer. We will promptly pay
the redemption price for notes surrendered for redemption following the
repurchase date.

     A "fundamental change" of Amazon.com is any transaction or event (whether
by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger,
combination, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with
which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for, converted
into, acquired for or constitute solely the right to receive, consideration
which is not all or substantially all common stock that:

     - is listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
       listed on, a United States national securities exchange, or

     - is approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be
       approved, for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market or any similar
       United States system of automated dissemination of quotations of
       securities prices.

     We will comply with any applicable provisions of Rule 13e-4 and any other
tender offer rules under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in
the event of a fundamental change.

     These fundamental change redemption rights could discourage a potential
acquiror of Amazon.com. However, this fundamental change redemption feature is
not the result of management's knowledge of any specific effort to obtain
control of Amazon.com by means of a merger, tender offer or solicitation, or
part of a plan by management to adopt a series of anti-takeover provisions. The
term "fundamental change" is limited to certain specified transactions and may
not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or
business operations. Our obligation to offer to redeem the notes upon a
fundamental change would not necessarily afford you protection in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction
involving Amazon.com.

     We may be unable to redeem the notes in the event of a fundamental change
of Amazon.com. If a fundamental change were to occur, we may not have enough
funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered notes. In addition, our
senior discount notes indenture also generally prohibits redemptions of the
notes while the senior discount notes are outstanding. Any future credit
agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain similar
provisions, or expressly prohibit our repurchase of the notes upon a fundamental
change or may provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default
under that agreement. If a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are
prohibited from purchasing or redeeming notes, we could seek the consent of our
lenders to redeem the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do
not obtain a consent, we would not be permitted to purchase or redeem the notes.
Our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under
indenture, which might constitute a default under the terms of our other
indebtedness. In these circumstances, or if a fundamental change would
constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness, the subordination
provisions of the indenture would restrict payments to the holders of notes. We
have undertaken to publish notice of a fundamental change in Luxembourg as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of the event. You may effect
your redemption through our agents, including the trustee and Banque
Internationale a Luxembourg.

SUBORDINATION OF NOTES

     Payment on the notes will, to the extent provided in the indenture, be
subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all our senior
indebtedness. The notes also are effectively subordinated to all debt and other
liabilities, including trade payables and lease obligations, if any, of our
subsidiaries. The notes will rank equally with our outstanding Convertible
Notes. The aggregate principal amount of such notes is $1.25 billion.

     Upon any distribution of our assets upon any dissolution, winding up,
liquidation or reorganization, the payment of the principal of and interest on
the notes will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full
in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of senior indebtedness of
all senior indebtedness. In the event of any acceleration of the notes because
of an event of default, the holders of any senior indebtedness would be entitled
to payment in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to such holders of all
senior indebtedness obligations before the holders of the notes are entitled to
receive any payment or distribution. The indenture requires us or the trustee to
promptly notify holders of designated senior indebtedness if payment of the
notes is accelerated because of an event of default.

     We may not make any payment on the notes, including upon redemption at the
option of the holder of any note or at our option, if:

     - a default in the payment of the principal, premium, if any, interest,
       rent or other obligations in respect of designated senior indebtedness
       occurs and is continuing beyond any applicable period of grace (called a
       "payment default"); or

     - a default other than a payment default on any designated senior
       indebtedness occurs and is continuing that permits holders of designated
       senior indebtedness to accelerate its maturity, and the trustee receives
       a notice of such default (called a "payment blockage notice") from us or
       any other person permitted to give such notice under the indenture
       (called a "non-payment default").

     We may resume payments and distributions on the notes:

     - in the case of a payment default, upon the date on which such default is
       cured or waived or ceases to exist; and

     - in the case of a non-payment default, the earlier of the date on which
       such nonpayment default is cured or waived or ceases to exist and 179
       days after the date on which the payment blockage notice is received by
       the trustee, if the maturity of the designated senior indebtedness has
       not been accelerated.

No new period of payment blockage may be commenced pursuant to a payment
blockage notice unless 365 days have elapsed since the initial effectiveness of
the immediately prior payment blockage notice and all scheduled payments of
principal, premium and interest, including any liquidated damages, on the notes
that have come due have been paid in full in cash. No non-payment default that
existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any payment blockage notice
shall be the basis for any later payment blockage notice unless the non-payment
default is based upon facts or events arising after the date of delivery of such
payment blockage notice.

     If the trustee or any holder of the notes receives any payment or
distribution of our assets in contravention of the subordination provisions on
the notes before all senior indebtedness is paid in full in cash, property or
securities, including by way of set-off, or other payment satisfactory to
holders of senior indebtedness, then such payment or distribution will be held
in trust for the benefit of holders of senior indebtedness or their
representatives to the extent necessary to make payment in full in cash or
payment satisfactory to the holders of senior indebtedness of all unpaid senior
indebtedness.

     In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or reorganization, holders of
senior indebtedness may receive more, ratably, and holders of the notes may
receive less, ratably, than our other creditors (including our trade creditors).
This subordination will not prevent the occurrence of any event of default under
the indenture.

     We have significant indebtedness. As of December 31, 1999, we had
approximately $900.7 million of indebtedness that constituted senior
indebtedness. We may incur substantial additional debt in the future.
                                      S-54
<PAGE>   54

     We are obligated to pay reasonable compensation to the trustee and to
indemnify the trustee against certain losses, liabilities or expenses incurred
by the trustee in connection with its duties relating to the notes. The
trustee's claims for these payments will generally be senior to those of
noteholders in respect of all funds collected or held by the trustee.

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

     "designated senior indebtedness" shall mean any of our outstanding senior
indebtedness that expressly provides that such senior indebtedness shall be
"designated senior indebtedness" for purposes of the indenture, provided, that
the instrument or agreement creating or evidencing such senior indebtedness may
place limitations and conditions on the right of senior indebtedness to exercise
the rights of designated senior indebtedness.

     "senior indebtedness" means the principal, premium, if any, interest,
including any interest accruing after bankruptcy, and rent or termination
payment on or other amounts due on our current or future indebtedness, whether
created, incurred, assumed, guaranteed or in effect guaranteed by us, including
any deferrals, renewals, extensions, refundings, amendments, modifications or
supplements to the above. However, senior indebtedness does not include:

     - indebtedness that expressly provides that it shall not be senior in right
       of payment to the notes or expressly provides that it is on the same
       basis or junior to the notes;

     - our indebtedness to any of our majority-owned subsidiaries; and

     - the notes.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT; NOTICE AND WAIVER

     The following will be events of default under the indenture:

     - we fail to pay principal or premium, if any, upon redemption or otherwise
       on the notes, whether or not the payment is prohibited by subordination
       provisions;

     - we fail to pay any interest on the notes, whether or not the payment is
       prohibited by subordination provisions of the indenture, for 30 days;

     - we fail to perform or observe any of the covenants in the indenture for
       60 days after notice; or

     - certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of
       Amazon.com.

     The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the notes of any default,
except defaults in payment of principal or interest on the notes. However, the
trustee must consider it to be in the interest of the holders of the notes to
withhold this notice.

     If an event of default occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of
at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare the
principal, premium, and accrued interest and liquidated damages, if any, on the
outstanding notes to be immediately due and payable. In case of certain events
of bankruptcy or insolvency involving Amazon.com, the principal, premium and
accrued interest and liquidated damages, if any, on the notes will automatically
become due and payable. However, if we cure all defaults, except the nonpayment
of principal or interest that became due as a result of the acceleration, and
meet certain other conditions, with certain exceptions, this declaration may be
cancelled and the holders of a majority of the principal amount of outstanding
notes may waive these past defaults. Payment of principal, premium, or interest
on the notes that are not made when due will accrue interest at the annual rate
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus supplement from the required
payment date.

     The holders of a majority of outstanding notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of any proceedings for any remedy available to
the trustee, subject to limitations specified in the indenture.

                                      S-55
<PAGE>   55

     No holder of the notes may pursue any remedy under the indenture, except in
the case of a default in the payment of principal, premium or interest on the
notes, unless:

     - the holder has given the trustee written notice of an event of default;

     - the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of outstanding notes make
       a written request, and offer reasonable indemnity, to the trustee to
       pursue the remedy;

     - the trustee does not receive an inconsistent direction from the holders
       of a majority in principal amount of the notes; and

     - the trustee fails to comply with the request within 60 days after
       receipt.

NOTICES

     We will send all notices to holders by mail to the registered holder. We
will also publish all such notices in a daily newspaper of general circulation
in Luxembourg so long as our notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
We expect that publication will be made in Luxembourg in the Luxemburger Wort.
We will deem any notice to have been made on the date such notice was first
published. We have undertaken to publish any change in the Luxembourg paying
agent in Luxembourg in the manner stipulated above so long as our notes are
listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

MODIFICATION OF THE INDENTURE

     The consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding notes is required to modify or amend the indenture. However, a
modification or amendment requires the consent of the holder of each outstanding
note if it would:

     - extend the fixed maturity of any note;

     - reduce the rate or extend the time for payment on interest of any note;

     - reduce the principal amount of any note;

     - reduce any amount payable upon redemption of any note;

     - adversely change our obligation to redeem any note upon a fundamental
       change;

     - impair the right of a holder to institute suit for payment on any note;

     - change the currency in which any note is payable;

     - impair the right of a holder to convert any note;

     - adversely modify the subordination provisions of the indenture; or

     - reduce the percentage of notes required for consent to any modification
       of the indenture.

We are permitted to modify certain provisions of the indenture without your
consent.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE AND LUXEMBOURG PAYING AGENT

     We have appointed The Bank of New York, the trustee under the indenture, as
paying agent, conversion agent, note registrar and custodian for the notes. The
Bank of New York also acts as trustee for our senior discount notes. We have
appointed Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, 69, route d'Esch, L-2953,
Luxembourg, as our Luxembourg paying and conversion agent.

RATING OF NOTES

     We believe it is likely that one or more rating agencies may rate the
notes. However, we cannot assure you whether any such agency or agencies will
rate the notes or, if they do, what rating or ratings they will assign to the
notes. If one or more rating agencies assign the notes a rating lower than that
expected by investors, it could have a material adverse effect on the market
price of the notes and our common stock.

                                 UNITED STATES
                        FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following is a summary of the material US federal income tax
consequences relating to the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the notes
and of common stock into which notes may be converted, but does not purport to
be a complete analysis of all the potential tax consequences that may be
material to an investor based on his or her particular tax situation. This
summary is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or the Code, the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated or
proposed thereunder, or Treasury Regulations, judicial authority and current
administrative rulings and practice, all of which are subject to change,
possibly on a retroactive basis. This summary deals only with the beneficial
owner of a note or common stock that will hold notes and common stock into which
notes may be converted as "capital assets", within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Code, and does not address tax consequences applicable to US Holders that
may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt organizations,
pension funds, insurance companies, dealers in securities or foreign currencies,
persons that will hold notes as a position in a hedging transaction, "straddle"
or "conversion transaction" for tax purposes, or persons that have a "functional
currency" other than the US dollar (except as disclosed below under "Non-US
Holders"). This summary discusses the tax consequences applicable to the holders
who purchase the notes at their "issue price" as defined in Section 1273 of the
Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial portion of the notes is sold
to the public) and generally does not discuss the tax consequences applicable to
subsequent purchasers of the notes. Amazon.com has not sought any ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, with respect to the statements made and
the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance
that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions. Due to the unique
characteristics of the notes, the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or
disposition of the notes is uncertain. INVESTORS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF
NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF
THE US FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL
AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN
TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.

     As used herein, the term "US Holder" means a holder of a note or common
stock that is (i) for US federal income tax purposes, a citizen or resident of
the US, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in
or under the laws of the US or any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an
estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless
of its source, or (iv) (a) a trust, the administration of which is subject to
the primary supervision of a court within the US and which has one or more US
persons with authority to control all substantial decisions, or (b) a trust in
existence on August 20, 1996 and has elected to continue to be treated as a US
trust. As used herein, the term "Non-US Holder" means a holder of a note or
common stock that is not a US Holder.

US HOLDERS

     The following is a summary of the principal US federal income tax
consequences resulting from the ownership and disposition of the notes and
common stock by US Holders.

     PAYMENT OF INTEREST

     Interest on a note generally will be includable in the income of a US
Holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued, in
accordance with such US Holder's method of accounting for US federal income tax
purposes. We may be obligated to make a make-whole payment to holders of the
notes in circumstances described under "Description of the Notes -- Withdrawal
of Conversion Rights." According to Treasury Regulations, the possibility of an
additional payment on the notes will not affect the amount or timing of interest
income recognized by a holder if the likelihood of the additional payment, as of
the date the notes are issued, is remote. We believe that the likelihood of
payment of the make-whole payment is remote, and do not intend to treat the
possibility of such payment as affecting the yield to maturity of any note.
However, such belief is not binding on the IRS. Notwithstanding the above, if a
make-whole payment is made, the payment may be treated as income to the holder.
See "Conversion of the Notes."

                                      S-57
<PAGE>   57

     A cash basis US Holder receiving an interest payment in euros will be
required to include in income the US dollar value of such payment (determined
using the spot rate in effect on the date such payment is received) regardless
of whether such payment is subsequently converted into US dollars (the
consequences of which are discussed below). No "exchange gain or loss" will be
recognized by a cash basis US Holder with respect to the receipt of such
payment; however, "exchange gain or loss" may be recognized by such US Holder
upon conversion of the euros if the euros are not converted to US dollars on the
date received (the consequences of conversion of euros to US dollars are
discussed below).

     An accrual basis US Holder will be required to include in income the US
dollar value of the amount of euro interest income that has accrued on a note in
a taxable year, determined by translating such income at the average rate of
exchange for the relevant interest accrual period or, with respect to an
interest accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for
the portion of such interest accrual period within the taxable year. The average
rate of exchange for an interest accrual period (or portion thereof) is the
simple average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of such period
(or such other average exchange rate that is reasonably derived and consistently
applied by the holder). An accrual basis US Holder may elect to translate
interest income on a note using the spot rate in effect on the last day of an
interest accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year for the portion of
such period within the taxable year). In addition, a US Holder may elect to use
the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt (or payment) for such purpose if
such date is within five business days of the last date of an interest accrual
period. The election must be made in a statement filed with the taxpayer's
return, and is applicable to all debt instruments for such year and thereafter
unless changed with the consent of the IRS.

     Upon receipt of an interest payment on a note, an accrual basis US Holder
will recognize ordinary gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income in
an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the payment
received (determined using the spot rate in effect on the date such payment is
received) in respect of such interest accrual period and the US dollar value of
the interest income that has accrued during such interest accrual period (as
determined in the preceding paragraph). Any such gain or loss generally will not
be treated as interest income or expense, except to the extent provided by
administrative pronouncements of the IRS.

     SALE, EXCHANGE OR REDEMPTION OF THE NOTES

     Upon the sale, exchange or redemption of a note, a US Holder generally will
realize and recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized (except to the extent attributable to accrued and unpaid interest,
which will be taxable as such) on the sale, exchange or redemption (or, if it is
realized in other than US dollars, the US dollar value of the amount using the
spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange or redemption) and the US
Holder's tax basis in such note. For these purposes, the amount realized on the
sale, exchange or redemption of the notes does not include any amount
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as such
unless previously taken into account. A US Holder's tax basis in a note
generally will be the US dollar value of the purchase price of such note on the
date of purchase (determined by translating the purchase price into US dollars
at the spot rate in effect on the date of purchase). Except as described below
under "Conversion of the Notes," and except with respect to gains or losses
attributable to changes in exchange rates, as described in the next paragraph,
gain or loss so recognized will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term
capital gain or loss if, at the time of the sale, exchange or redemption, the
note was held for more than one year.

     Gain or loss recognized by a US Holder on the sale, exchange or retirement
of a note that is attributable to changes in the rate of exchange between the US
dollar and the euro will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally
will not be treated as interest income or expense except to the extent provided
by administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Such foreign currency gain or loss
is recognized on the sale or retirement of a note only to the extent of total
gain or loss recognized on the sale of retirement of such note.

                                      S-58
<PAGE>   58

     TRANSACTIONS IN EUROS

     Euros received as interest on, or on the sale or retirement of, a note will
have a tax basis equal to their US dollar value at the time such interest is
received or at the time payment is received in consideration of such sale or
retirement. The amount of gain or loss recognized on a sale or other disposition
of such euros will be equal to the difference between (i) the amount of US
dollars, or the fair market value in US dollars of the other currency or
property received in such sale or other disposition, and (ii) the tax basis of
such euros.

     A US Holder that purchases a note with previously owned euros would
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
such US Holder's tax basis in such euros and the US dollar fair market value of
such note on the date of purchase. Generally, any such gain or loss will be
ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense,
except to the extent provided by administrative pronouncements of the IRS.

     CONSTRUCTIVE DIVIDENDS ON NOTES

     If at any time (i) Amazon.com makes a distribution of cash or property to
its stockholders or purchases common stock and such distribution or purchase
would be taxable to such stockholders as a dividend for US federal income tax
purposes (e.g., distributions of evidences of indebtedness or assets of
Amazon.com, but generally not stock dividends or rights to subscribe for common
stock) and, pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions, the conversion price of
the notes is decreased, or (ii) the conversion price of the notes is decreased
at the discretion of Amazon.com, such decrease in conversion price may be deemed
to be a stock distribution to US Holders (pursuant to Section 305 of the Code).
In addition, although Amazon.com believes this should not be the case, it is
possible that the Market Price Adjustment may be treated as a deemed stock
distribution (see "Description of the Notes -- Conversion of Notes.") The value
of the deemed distribution only will be taxable as a dividend to the extent of
Amazon.com's current and accumulated earnings and profits as of the year of
distribution. Any dividend resulting from a deemed distribution could give rise
to a withholding obligation of Amazon.com. See "-- Non-US Holders -- Dividends,"
below.

     CONVERSION OF THE NOTES

     A US Holder generally will not recognize any income, gain or loss upon
conversion of a note into common stock, except with respect to (i) gain or loss
recognized by a US Holder attributable to changes in the rate of exchange
between the US dollar and the euro (as discussed below), and (ii) cash received
in lieu of a fractional share of common stock. However, if upon conversion a US
Holder receives a make-whole payment, the make-whole payment may be taxable to
the holder as additional gain or as ordinary income (possibly as interest or
dividends), or if we have no current or accumulated earnings and profits,
perhaps as a return of capital. A US Holder's tax basis in the common stock
received on conversion of a note will be the same as such US Holder's adjusted
tax basis in the note at the time of conversion, increased by the amount of gain
recognized (or decreased by the amount of loss recognized) attributable to
changes in the rate of exchange between the US dollar and the euro, and reduced
by any basis allocable to a fractional share interest. The holding period for
the common stock received on conversion will generally include the holding
period of the note converted.

     Upon a conversion of a note, a US holder will recognize gain or loss with
respect to the principal amount of the note so converted, determined by
subtracting the US dollar value of the purchase price of the note on the date
the note was purchased (determined by translating the purchase price of the note
into US dollars at the spot rate in effect on the date of purchase) from the US
dollar value of the purchase price of the note on the date the note is converted
into common stock (determined by translating the purchase price of the note into
US dollars at the spot rate in effect on the conversion date). Such foreign
currency gain or loss is recognized on the conversion of a note (despite the
fact that the conversion price will not change as a result of increases or
decreases in the value of euros against the US dollar) only to the extent of
total gain or loss realized on the conversion of the note. Any such gain or loss
will be treated as ordinary. Accrued but unpaid interest, if any, will be
treated as described above under "Payment of Interest."

                                      S-59
<PAGE>   59

     Cash received in lieu of a fractional share of common stock upon conversion
will be treated as a payment in exchange for the fractional share of common
stock. Accordingly, the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share of common
stock generally will result in capital gain or loss (measured by the difference
between the cash received for the fractional share and the US Holder's adjusted
tax basis in the fractional share).

     DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK

     Generally, distributions will be treated as a dividend, subject to tax as
ordinary income, to the extent of Amazon.com's current or accumulated earnings
and profits as of the year of distribution, then as a tax-free return of capital
to the extent of the US Holder's tax basis in the common stock and thereafter as
gain from the sale of exchange of such stock.

     In general, a dividend distribution to a corporate US Holder may qualify
for the 70% dividends received deduction if the US Holder owns less than 20% of
the voting power and value of our stock (other than any non-voting,
non-convertible, non-participating preferred stock). A corporate US Holder that
owns 20% or more of the voting power and value of our stock (other than any
nonvoting, non-convertible, non-participating preferred stock) generally will
qualify for an 80% dividends received deduction.

     SALE OF COMMON STOCK

     Upon the sale or exchange of common stock, a US Holder generally will
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount of
cash and the fair market value of any property received upon the sale or
exchange and (ii) such US Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock. Such
capital gain or loss will be long-term if the US Holder's holding period is more
than one year and will be short-term if the holding period is equal to or less
than one year. In the case of certain noncorporate taxpayers, including
individuals, long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% and
short-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 39.6%. A US Holder's
basis and holding period in common stock received upon conversion of a note are
determined as discussed above under "Conversion of the Notes." Corporate
taxpayers are subject to a maximum regular tax rate of 35% on all capital gains
and ordinary income.

NON-US HOLDERS

     The following discussion is a summary of the principal US federal income
and estate tax consequences resulting from the ownership of the notes or common
stock by Non-US Holders.

     PAYMENT OF INTEREST

     Subject to the discussion below of backup withholding, interest paid on the
notes to a Non-US Holder generally will not be subject to US federal income tax
if: (i) such interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business within the US by such Non-US Holder; (ii) the Non-US Holder does not
actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total voting power of all
classes of our stock and is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related
to us through stock ownership (for this purpose, the holder of notes would be
deemed to own constructively the common stock into which it could be converted);
(iii) the beneficial owner, under penalty of perjury, certifies that the owner
is not a US person and provides the owner's name and address; and (iv) the
interest is not considered a contingent interest. If certain requirements are
satisfied, the certification described in clause (iii) above may be provided by
a securities clearing organization, a bank, or other financial institution that
holds customers' securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business.
Under Treasury Regulations, which generally are effective for payments made
after December 31, 2000, subject to certain transition rules, the certification
described in clause (iii) above may also be provided by a qualified intermediary
on behalf of one or more beneficial owners (or other intermediaries), provided
that such intermediary has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS and
certain other conditions are met. A holder that is not exempt from tax under
these rules will be subject to US federal income tax withholding at a rate of
30%, unless the interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a US trade
or business, in which case the interest will be subject to the US federal income
tax on net income that applies to US persons generally (and, with respect to
corporate holders and under certain circumstances, the branch

                                      S-60
<PAGE>   60

profits tax), or unless a lower treaty rate a treaty applies. Non-US Holders
should consult applicable income tax treaties, which may provide different
rules.

     CONVERSION OF THE NOTES

     A Non-US Holder generally will not be subject to US federal income tax on
the conversion of a note into shares of common stock. To the extent a Non-US
Holder receives cash in lieu of a fractional share on conversion, such cash may
give rise to gain that would be subject to the rules described below with
respect to the sale or exchange of a note or common stock. In addition, if upon
conversion a Non-US Holder receives a make-whole payment, the make-whole payment
may be taxable to the holder as additional gain or as ordinary income (possibly
as interest or dividends subject to withholding), or if we have no current or
accumulated earnings and profits, perhaps as a return of capital.

     DIVIDENDS

     Subject to the discussion below of backup withholding, dividends, if any,
paid on the common stock to a Non-US Holder generally will be subject to a 30%
US federal withholding tax, subject to reduction for Non-US Holders eligible for
the benefits of certain income tax treaties. Dividends for this purpose may
include stock distributions treated as deemed dividends as discussed in "US
Holders -- Constructive Dividends on Notes" above. We do not believe that a
reset of the conversion price as described under "Description of Notes -- Reset
of Conversion Price" should be treated as a deemed stock distribution; however,
in the event such a reset were treated as a deemed stock distribution, we had
current or accumulated earnings and profits in the year of the reset and we did
not withhold taxes from Non-U.S. Holders, we would be liable for unpaid
withholding taxes, as well as interest, and possibly penalties. Currently, for
purposes of determining whether tax is to be withheld at the 30% rate or at a
reduced treaty rate, we will ordinarily presume that dividends paid to an
address in a foreign country are paid to a resident of such country absent
knowledge that such presumption is not warranted. Under Treasury Regulations
effective for payments after December 31, 2000, holders will be required to
satisfy certain certification requirements to claim treaty benefits. Except to
the extent otherwise provided under an applicable tax treaty, a Non-US Holder
generally will be taxed in the same manner as a US Holder on dividends paid (or
deemed paid) that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the US by the Non-US Holder. If such Non-US Holder is a foreign
corporation, it may also be subject to a US branch profits tax on such
effectively connected income at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be
specified by an applicable income tax treaty.

     GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES AND COMMON STOCK

     A Non-US Holder generally will not be subject to US federal income tax on
gain realized on the sale, exchange or redemption of a note, or the sale or
exchange of common stock, unless (i) in the case of an individual Non-US Holder,
such holder is present in the US for 183 days or more in the year of such sale,
exchange or redemption and certain other requirements are met, (ii) the Non-US
Holder is subject to tax pursuant to the provisions of US tax law applicable to
certain US expatriates, (iii) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct
of a US trade or business of the Non-US Holder, or (iv) in the case of the
disposition of common stock, Amazon.com is a US real property holding
corporation. Amazon.com does not believe that it is a US real property holding
corporation as of the date hereof, although it has not determined or established
whether it is now or will be a US real property holding corporation. If
Amazon.com is or becomes a US real property holding corporation, so long as the
common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities
market, only a Non-US Holder who actually or constructively owns or owned (at
any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of
disposition or the Non-US Holder's holding period) more than five percent of the
common stock will be subject to US federal income tax on the disposition of the
common stock. Any Non-US Holder that may approach or exceed 5% ownership, either
alone or in conjunction with related persons, should consult its own tax advisor
concerning the US tax consequences that may result.

     US FEDERAL ESTATE TAX

     A note held by an individual who at the time of death is not a citizen or
resident of the US (as specially defined for US federal estate tax purposes)
will not be subject to US federal estate tax if the individual did not actually
or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock of Amazon.com and, at the time of the individual's death,
payments with respect to such note would not have been effectively connected
with the conduct by such individual of a trade or business in the US. Common
stock held by an individual who at the time of death is not a citizen or
resident of the US (as specially defined for US federal estate tax purposes)
will be included in such individual's estate for US federal estate tax purposes,
unless an applicable estate tax treaty otherwise applies.

BACKUP WITHHOLDING AND INFORMATION REPORTING

     US HOLDERS

     A US Holder of notes or common stock may be subject to "backup withholding"
at a rate of 31% with respect to certain "reportable payments," including
interest payments, dividend payments and, under certain circumstances, principal
payments on the notes. These backup withholding rules apply if the US Holder,
among other things, (i) fails to furnish a social security number or other
taxpayer identification number ("TIN") certified under penalties of perjury
within a reasonable time after the request therefor, (ii) furnishes an incorrect
TIN, (iii) fails to report properly interest or dividends or (iv) under certain
circumstances, fails to provide a certified statement, signed under penalties of
perjury, that the TIN furnished is the correct number and that such US Holder is
not subject to backup withholding. A US Holder who does not provide Amazon.com
with its correct TIN may also be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Any
amount withheld from a payment to a holder under the backup withholding rules is
creditable against the holder's federal income tax liability. Backup withholding
will not apply, however, with respect to payments made to certain US Holders,
including corporations and tax-exempt organizations, provided their exemption
from backup withholdings is properly established. We will report to US Holders
of notes and common stock and to the IRS the amount of any "reportable payments"
for each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any, with respect to
such payments.

     NON-US HOLDERS

     Amazon.com must report annually to the IRS and to each Non-US Holder the
amount of any dividends paid to, and tax withheld with respect to, such holder,
regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. Copies of these information
returns may also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or
agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-US Holder
resides.

     Under current Treaty Regulations, backup withholding and information
reporting will not apply to payments of principal on the notes by us or our
agent to a Non-US Holder if the Non-US Holder certifies as to its Non-US Holder
status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption
(provided that neither we nor our agent has actual knowledge that the holder is
a US person or that the conditions of any other exemptions are not in fact
satisfied). The payment of the proceeds on the disposition of notes or shares of
common stock to or through the US office of a US or foreign broker will be
subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the owner
provides the certification described above or otherwise establishes an
exemption. The proceeds of the disposition by a Non-US Holder of notes or shares
of common stock to or through a foreign office of a broker generally will not be
subject to backup withholding or information reporting. However, if such broker
is a US person, a controlled foreign corporation for US tax purposes, or a
foreign person, 50% or more of whose gross income from all sources for certain
periods is from activities that are effectively connected with a US trade or
business, information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, will
apply unless such broker has documentary evidence in its files of the holder's
Non-US status and has no actual knowledge to the contrary or unless the holder
otherwise establishes an exemption.

     New Treasury Regulations, which we refer to as the New Regulations, would
modify the application of information reporting requirements and the backup
withholding tax requirements applicable to Non-US

                                      S-62
<PAGE>   62

Holders for reportable payments made after December 31, 2000. In general, the
New Regulations do not significantly alter the current substantive withholding
and information reporting requirements but unify current certification
procedures and forms and clarify reliance standards. Under the New Regulations,
special rules apply which permit the shifting of primary responsibility for
withholding to certain financial intermediaries acting on behalf of beneficial
owners. A holder of a note or common stock that is received upon the conversion
of a note should consult with its tax advisor regarding the application of the
backup withholding rules to its particular situation, the availability of an
exemption therefrom, the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if
available, and the impact of the New Regulations on payments made with respect
to the notes or shares of common stock received upon the conversion of the notes
after December 31, 2000.

                              CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS

THE SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES

     In May 1998, we issued $530 million of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008
pursuant to an indenture among Amazon.com and The Bank of New York, as trustee.

     PRINCIPAL, MATURITY AND INTEREST

     The Senior Discount Notes are our unsecured unsubordinated obligations, and
mature on May 1, 2008. Interest on the Senior Discount Notes accrues at the rate
of 10% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year,
commencing November 1, 2003. Until November 1, 2003, the Senior Discount Notes
will accrete in value. In 1999, Amazon.com repurchased 50.2% of outstanding
Senior Discount Notes. Net of repurchase, on November 1, 2003 the Senior
Discount Notes will have an accreted value of $264 million.

     OPTIONAL REDEMPTION

     The Senior Discount Notes will be redeemable at our option, in whole or in
part, at any time or from time to time, on or after May 1, 2003 at the following
redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the
12-month period commencing May 1 of the years set forth below:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                           YEAR                             REDEMPTION PRICE
                           ----                             ----------------
<S>                                                         <C>
2003......................................................      105.000%
2004......................................................      103.333%
2005......................................................      101.667%
2006 and thereafter.......................................      100.000%
</TABLE>

     In addition, at any time prior to May 1, 2001, we may redeem up to 35% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Discount Notes with the net
proceeds of one or more sales of certain types of its stock at a redemption
price of 110%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date;
provided that at least 65% of the Senior Discount Notes initially issued remain
outstanding.

     CHANGE OF CONTROL

     Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture), we
would be required to make an offer to purchase the Senior Discount Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of their Accreted Value on the date of purchase,
plus accrued interest, if any. There can be no assurance that we would have
sufficient funds available at the time of any Change of Control to make any
required debt repayment (including repurchases of the Senior Discount Notes).

     RANKING

     The indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Discount Notes ranks pari passu in
right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness
and senior in right of payment to all our existing and future subordinated
indebtedness.

     COVENANTS

     The Senior Notes Indenture restricts, among other things, our ability to
incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted
payments, incur certain liens to secure indebtedness, or engage in merger
transactions. There are significant "carve-outs" and exceptions to these
covenants.

CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES

     In February 1999, we completed an offering of approximately $1.25 billion
of the 4 3/4% Convertible Notes due 2009.

                                      S-64
<PAGE>   64

     PRINCIPAL, MATURITY AND INTEREST

     Interest payments on the Convertible Notes of 4 3/4% per annum are due and
payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 1 and August 1 of each year,
commencing August 1, 1999.

     RANKING

     The Convertible Notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing
and future Senior Indebtedness, as defined in the indenture governing the
Convertible Notes.

     CONVERSION

     The Convertible Notes are generally convertible into our common stock,
unless redeemed or repaid prior to maturity, at a conversion price of $78.028
per share.

     REDEMPTION

     We may redeem Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to
February 6, 2002, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per Convertible Note to
be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption
if (1) the closing price of our common stock shall have exceeded 150% of the
conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive
30-trading day period and (2) the shelf registration statement covering resales
of the Convertible Notes and our common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Convertible Notes is effective and available for use and is expected to remain
effective and available for use for the 30 days following the date of
redemption. Upon any redemption, we will make an additional payment in cash with
respect to the Convertible Notes called for redemption in an amount equal to
$212.60 per $1,000 Convertible Note, less the amount of any interest actually
paid on such Convertible Note prior to the call for redemption. We must make
these payments on all of the Convertible Notes called for redemption, including
Convertible Notes called after the date of the call for redemption.

     After February 6, 2002, the Convertible Notes will be redeemable on at
least 30 days' notice at our option, in whole or in part, at any time, at the
following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during
the 12-month period commencing February 1 of the years set forth below:

</TABLE>

     FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE

     Upon occurrence of any Fundamental Change, as defined in the Convertible
Notes Indenture, prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, each holder of
the Convertible Notes has the right to require us to redeem all or any part of
the holder's Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount,
plus any accrued interest, of the Convertible Notes being redeemed.

     REGISTRATION

     We have on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission an effective
registration statement covering resales of the Convertible Notes and our common
stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.

                          DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

     Our authorized capital stock consists of 1,500,000,000 shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
$0.01 par value per share. The following summary of certain provisions of our
common stock and preferred stock does not purport to be complete and is subject
to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of our Restated Certificate
of Incorporation.

     Common Stock. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each
share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Subject
to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred
stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such
dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
legally available for the payment of dividends. In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Amazon.com, the holders of common stock are
entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities
and liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.
Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights or rights to convert their
common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to our common stock. All outstanding shares of common
stock are fully paid and nonassessable, and the shares of common stock to be
issued upon conversion of the notes will be fully paid and nonassessable.

     Preferred Stock. Pursuant to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the
Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the
stockholders, to issue up to 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or
more series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences, privileges and
relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion
rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or
all of which may be greater than the rights of our common stock. The Board of
Directors, without stockholder approval, can issue Preferred stock with voting,
conversion or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and
other rights of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock could thus be
issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of
Amazon.com or make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, the
issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price
of our common stock, and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the
holders of common stock. Amazon.com has no plans to issue any preferred stock.

     Antitakeover Effects of Washington and Delaware Law. The laws of
Washington, where our principal executive offices are located, impose
restrictions on certain transactions between certain foreign corporations and
significant stockholders. Chapter 23B.19 of the Washington Business Corporation
Act, or WBCA, prohibits a "Target Corporation," with certain exceptions, from
engaging in certain "Significant Business Transactions" with a person or group
of persons which beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting securities of the
Target Corporation, referred to as an Acquiring Person, for a period of five
years after such acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is
approved by a majority of the members of the Target Corporation's board of
directors prior to the time of acquisition. Prohibited transactions include,
among other things, a merger or consolidation with, disposition of assets to, or
issuance or redemption of stock to or from, the Acquiring Person, termination of
5% or more of the employees of the Target Corporation as a result of the
Acquiring Person's acquisition of 10% or more of the shares or allowing the
Acquiring Person to receive disproportionate benefit as a stockholder. After the
five year period a Significant Business Transaction may take place as long as it
complies with certain fair price provisions of the statute or is approved at an
annual or special meeting of stockholders. A Target Corporation includes a
foreign corporation if (i) the corporation has a class of voting stock
registered pursuant to Section 12 or 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, (ii) the corporation's principal executive office is located in
Washington, (iii) any of (a) more than 10% of the corporation's stockholders of
record are Washington residents, (b) more than 10% of its shares of record are
owned by Washington residents or (c) 1,000 or more of its stockholders of record
are Washington residents, (iv) a majority of the corporation's employees are
Washington residents or more than 1,000 Washington residents are employees of
the corporation and (v) a majority of the corporation's tangible assets are
located in Washington or the corporation has more than $50 million of tangible
assets located in Washington. A corporation may not "opt out" of this statute.
If Amazon.com meets the definition of a Target Corporation, Chapter 23B.19 of
the WBCA may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
control of Amazon.com.

<PAGE>   66

     Although Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the
"DGCL," generally prohibits Delaware corporations from engaging in certain
"Business Combinations" with "Interested Stockholders" for a period of three
years unless certain criteria are met, Amazon.com has expressly elected in its
Restated Certificate of Incorporation not to be governed by Section 203 of the
DGCL.

     Registration Rights. Pursuant to an agreement among Amazon.com, Mr. Bezos,
who is the holder of 117,524,337 shares of common stock, and certain holders of
up to 4,816,512 shares of common stock converted from Series A preferred stock,
Mr. Bezos and these former holders of preferred stock are entitled to certain
rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities
Act. If the Company proposes to register any of its securities under the
Securities Act, either for its own account or for the account of other security
holders, Mr. Bezos and these former holders of preferred stock are entitled to
notice of such registration and to include shares of common stock in such
registration at our expense. Additionally, these former holders of preferred
stock are entitled to demand registration rights pursuant to which they may
require Amazon.com to file a registration statement under the Securities Act at
our expense with respect to their shares of common stock, and Amazon.com is
required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such registration.
Further, these former holders of preferred stock may require Amazon.com to file
additional registration statements on Form S-3 at the expense of these former
holders of preferred stock. All of these registration rights are subject to
conditions and limitations, among them the right of the underwriters of an
offering to limit the number of shares included in such registration.

     Transfer Agent and Registrar. The transfer agent and registrar for our
common stock is ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey.

     Nasdaq National Market Listing. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol "AMZN."

     Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in an underwriting
agreement dated February 11, 2000, the underwriters named below have severally
agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to them, severally, the
respective principal amount of notes set forth opposite the names of the
underwriters below:

</TABLE>

     The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several
underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the notes are subject to the
approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other
conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the notes
offered hereby if any are taken.

     The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the notes directly to
the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page hereof and
part to certain dealers at a price that represents a concession not in excess of
1.5% of the principal amount of the notes.

     In order to facilitate the offering of the notes, the underwriters may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of
the notes or the common stock. Specifically, to stabilize the price of the
notes, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, the notes or shares of common
stock in the open market. In addition, the underwriters may reclaim selling
concessions allowed to a dealer for distributing the notes in the offering, if
the underwriters repurchase previously distributed notes in stabilization
transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the
market price of the notes or the common stock above independent market levels.
The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any
of these activities at any time.

     We have made an application to list the notes on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange.

     We and our executive officers and directors have agreed that we will not
(a) offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase,
purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to
purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any
shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for common stock, or (b) enter into any swap or other agreement
that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of the common stock, whether any such transaction described in clause
(a) or (b) above is to be settled by delivery of common stock or such other
securities, in cash or otherwise for a 90-day period after the date of this
prospectus supplement, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co.
International Limited, except that (A) we may, without such consent, issue
common Stock (1) upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or warrants or
upon the conversion of any other security outstanding on the date of this

               REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Amazon.com, Inc.

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com,
Inc. as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Amazon.com,
Inc. at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  Description of Business

     Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon.com" or the "Company"), an Internet retailer, was
incorporated in July 1994 and opened its virtual doors on the Web in July 1995.
Amazon.com offers book, music CD, video, DVD, computer game and other titles on
its Web sites.

  Business Combinations and Investments

     For business combinations which have been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting, the Company includes the results of operations of the
acquired business from the date of acquisition. Net assets of the companies
acquired are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is included in
goodwill and other purchased intangibles in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.

     Other business combinations are accounted for under the pooling of
interests method of accounting. In such cases, the assets, liabilities and
stockholders' equity of the acquired entities are combined with the Company's
respective accounts at recorded values. The consolidated financial statements
reflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of
merged entities accounted for under the pooling of interests method of
accounting. The historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their
actual operating cost structures and, as a result, do not necessarily reflect
the cost structure of the newly combined entity. The historical results do not
purport to be indicative of future results.

     Investments in affiliated entities in which the Company has the ability to
exercise significant influence of an investee, generally a 20% or greater
ownership interest of the voting stock, are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share
of the investee's earnings or loss is included in consolidated operating
results.

     All other investments, for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method of
accounting. Dividends and other distributions of earnings from other investees,
if any, are included in income when declared. The Company periodically evaluates
the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of
accounting and as of December 31, 1998, such investments were recorded at the
lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.

  Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  Marketable Securities

     The Company's marketable securities consist primarily of high-quality
short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and money market mutual
funds, are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, as a component of
stockholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized
losses are charged against income when a decline in
                                       F-7

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

fair value is determined to be other than temporary. The specific identification
method is used to determine the cost of securities sold. The Company classifies
all investments of cash as marketable securities, including highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less, and reflects the related
cash flows as investing cash flows. As a result of the classification of highly
liquid investments within marketable securities, a significant portion of the
Company's gross marketable securities purchases and maturities disclosed as
investing cash flows is related to highly liquid investments.

  Inventories

     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company
purchases a majority of its products from three major vendors, Ingram Book Group
("Ingram"), Baker & Taylor, Inc. and Valley Media Inc. In late 1998, Barnes &
Noble announced an agreement to purchase Ingram. Ingram is the Company's single
largest supplier and accounted for approximately 40% and approximately 60% of
the Company's inventory purchases in 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Company
does not have long-term contracts or arrangements with most of its vendors to
guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms or the
extension of credit limits. The Company's current vendors may stop selling
merchandise to the Company on acceptable terms. The Company may not be able to
acquire merchandise from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on
acceptable terms.

  Fixed Assets

     Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital
leases. Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (generally one to ten years). Fixed assets purchased
under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of
the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.

  Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles

     Goodwill and other purchased intangibles represent the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired. Total goodwill of
approximately $215.7 million and other purchased intangibles of approximately
$13.3 million are stated net of total accumulated amortization of $42.6 million
at December 31, 1998 in the accompanying balance sheet. Goodwill and
substantially all other purchased intangibles are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over lives ranging from two to three years.

  Long-Lived Assets

     In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, the carrying
value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular
basis for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internally and
externally, that may suggest impairment. To date, no such impairment has been
indicated. Should there be an impairment in the future, the Company will measure
the amount of the impairment based on undiscounted expected future cash flows
from the impaired assets. The cash flow estimates that will be used will contain
management's best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and
projections at the time.

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The carrying amounts for the Company's cash, prepaid expenses and other,
deposits and other, accounts payable, accrued advertising, and other liabilities
and accrued expenses approximate fair value. The fair market value for long-term
debt and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices where available.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

  Deferred Charges

     In May 1998, the Company issued approximately $326 million gross proceeds
of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Discount Notes"). At December
31, 1998, deferred charges consisted of fees associated with the issuance of the
Senior Discount Notes. The fees are being amortized into interest expense over
the life of the Senior Discount Notes.

  Income Taxes

     The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in
effect when the differences are expected to be recovered.

  Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, net of any discounts,
when the products are shipped to customers. Outbound shipping and handling
charges are included in net sales. Revenue from gift certificates is recognized
upon product shipment following redemption. The Company provides an allowance
for sales returns, which has been insignificant, based on historical experience.

  Advertising Costs

     The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company incurred advertising expense of
$60.2 million, $21.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively.

  Product Development

     Product development expenses consist principally of payroll and related
expenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations
personnel and consultants, systems and telecommunications infrastructure and
costs of acquired content. To date, all product development costs have been
expensed as incurred.

  Merger and Acquisition Related Costs

     Merger and acquisition related costs consist primarily of amortization of
goodwill and other purchased intangibles of approximately $42.6 million, as well
as approximately $7.6 million, composed primarily of equity in loss of investee
and other merger and acquisition related costs.

  Stock-Based Compensation

     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB No. 25"), and related
interpretations, in accounting for its employee stock options rather than the
alternative fair value accounting allowed by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation. APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense relative
to the Company's employee stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value
of the stock option. SFAS No. 123 requires companies that continue to follow APB
No. 25 to provide a pro forma disclosure of the impact of applying the fair
value method of SFAS No. 123.

  Foreign Currency Translation

     The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars at year end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are
translated at average rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of
stockholders' equity. Transaction gains

and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency of the entity involved, which have been insignificant, are
included in the consolidated statements of operations. To date, the Company has
entered into no foreign currency exchange contracts or other such derivative
instruments.

  Segment and Geographic Information

     The Company operates in one principal business segment across domestic and
international markets. International sales, including export sales from the
United States, represented approximately 20%, 25%, and 33% of net sales for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. No foreign country
or geographic area accounted for more than 10% of net sales in any of the
periods presented. There were no transfers between geographic areas during the
years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. Substantially all of the domestic
operating results and identifiable assets are in the United States.

  Concentrations of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of its holdings of cash and
marketable securities. The Company's credit risk is managed by investing its
cash and marketable securities in high-quality money market instruments and
securities of the U.S. government and its agencies, foreign governments and
high-quality corporate issuers. At December 31, 1998, the Company has no
significant concentrations of credit risk.

  Earnings (Loss) Per Share

     Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants
and convertible securities. Basic earnings per share is computed using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and
common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent
shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

     As a result of the Company's initial public offering in May 1997, all
preferred stock automatically converted into common stock. Accordingly, the 1997
and 1996 net loss per share is a pro forma loss per share based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding and preferred stock on an
"as if" converted basis outstanding during each period. The Company believes
that this is a more meaningful presentation of earnings per share for periods
prior to its initial public offering.

  Comprehensive Income (Loss)

     As of January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for the reporting and display
of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. The only
items of comprehensive income (loss) that the Company currently reports are
unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities and foreign currency
translation adjustments.

  New Accounting Pronouncements

     In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued
Statement of Position 98-1 ("SOP 98-1"), Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires all costs
related to the development of internal use software other than those incurred
during the application development stage to be expensed as incurred. Costs
incurred during the application development stage are required to be capitalized
and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. SOP 98-1 is
effective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 1999. Adoption is
not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
statements as the Company's policies are substantially in compliance with SOP
98-1.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. SOP 98-5 is
effective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 1999. SOP 98-5
requires costs of start-up activities and organization costs to be expensed as
incurred. Adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a
hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. The Company does
not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements because the Company does not currently hold
any derivative instruments.

  Reclassifications

     Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

NOTE 2 -- BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND INVESTMENTS

     In April 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
three international Internet companies. The aggregate purchase price of the
three acquisitions, plus related charges, was approximately $55 million. The
consideration for the acquisitions was comprised of common stock and cash. The
Company issued an aggregate of approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock
to effect the transactions. The goodwill and other purchased intangibles are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over two years.

     In August 1998, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of
Junglee Corp. ("Junglee"). Junglee is a leading provider of Web-based virtual
database technology which allows visitors to access a variety of products sold
by other merchants. The Company issued approximately 4.7 million shares of
common stock and assumed all outstanding options and warrants in connection with
the acquisition of Junglee. The Junglee acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting, with substantially all of the approximately $180
million purchase price allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles.
The goodwill and substantially all other purchased intangible assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over lives averaging approximately three
years. In November 1998, the Company sold the employment business unit of
Junglee in exchange for cash and approximately 1.7 million shares of the
purchaser's common stock. There was no gain or loss recorded from this sale. The
investment is recorded at cost and is classified within marketable securities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

     The pro forma combined consolidated financial information for the aggregate
of all the business combinations described above and accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting, as though the acquisitions had occurred on
January 1 of each year, would have resulted in net sales of $615.0 million and
$155.8 million; net loss of $171.6 million and $118.7 million; and basic and
diluted loss per share of $1.12 and $0.86 for the years ended December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively. The pro forma net loss includes amortization of goodwill
and purchased intangibles of $83.0 million for the years ended December 31, 1998
and 1997. This unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial information
is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of
the consolidated results of operations in future periods or the results that
actually would have been realized had Amazon.com, the international subsidiaries
and Junglee been a combined company during the specified periods.

     In August 1998, the Company exchanged common stock and options for all of
the outstanding capital stock of Sage Enterprises, Inc. ("PlanetAll"). The
Company issued approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock and assumed all
outstanding options in connection with the merger. The PlanetAll merger was
accounted for as a pooling of interests and, as a result, the Company's
consolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented.
PlanetAll issued approximately 167,000 shares of capital stock for
                                      F-11

proceeds of approximately $1.0 million and approximately 896,000 shares of
capital stock for proceeds of approximately $7.4 million in January 1998 and
April 1998, respectively.

     Net sales for PlanetAll were not significant and net loss was $4.1 million,
$3.4 million and $469,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 and the
years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively, which represent separate
results of the combined entity through the periods preceding the merger. There
were no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies and no
significant conforming accounting adjustments.

     As of December 31, 1998, the Company has an investment of approximately 46%
in drugstore.com, inc., an online drugstore, that is accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. The Company's basis in its equity investment is
classified within other purchased intangibles in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet and the Company's share of the investee's loss is classified in
merger and acquisition related costs, including amortization of goodwill and
other purchased intangibles. To date, this investment has not materially
impacted the Company's results of operations or its financial position.

NOTE 5 -- LONG-TERM DEBT

SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES

     In May 1998, the Company completed the offering of approximately $326
million gross proceeds of the Senior Discount Notes due May 1, 2008. Pursuant to
a registration statement on Form S-4 in September 1998, the Company completed an
exchange offer of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the "Exchange Notes"),
which were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for all
outstanding Senior Discount Notes. The Exchange Notes have identical terms in
all material respects to the terms of the original Senior Discount Notes, except
that the Exchange Notes generally are freely transferable (the Exchange Notes
are referred to throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements
interchangeably with the Senior Discount Notes). The Exchange Notes were issued
under the indenture governing the original Senior Discount Notes (the
"Indenture"). The Senior Discount Notes were sold at a substantial discount from
their principal amount at maturity of $530 million. Prior to November 1, 2003,
no cash interest payments are required; instead, interest will accrete during
this period to the $530 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. From and
after May 1, 2003, the Senior Discount Notes will bear interest at a rate of 10%
per annum payable in cash on each May 1 and November 1. The Senior Discount
Notes are redeemable, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after May 1, 2003, at the redemption prices set forth in the
Indenture, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption.

     The Senior Discount Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company
ranking pari passu with the Company's existing and future unsubordinated,
unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all subordinated
indebtedness of the Company. The Senior Discount Notes are effectively
subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to all existing and future
liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.

     The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit
the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the
Indenture) to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, prepay subordinated
indebtedness, repurchase capital stock, make investments, create liens, engage
in transactions with stockholders and affiliates, sell assets and engage in
mergers and consolidations. However, these limitations are subject to a number
of important qualifications and exceptions. The Company was in compliance with
all financial covenants at December 31, 1998.

     A portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Discount
Notes was used to retire approximately $75 million of indebtedness outstanding
as of December 31, 1997. Future principal payments related to the Senior
Discount Notes do not commence until 2008. The carrying amount of the Senior
Discount Notes is approximately $347.2 million as of December 31, 1998, which
approximates fair value.

under operating lease agreements for 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $8.5 million, $2.1
million and $270,000, respectively.

     The Company has also entered into certain marketing agreements, which
include fixed fees through 2000. The costs associated with these agreements are
recognized on a systematic basis over the term of the related agreements as
services are received.

  Legal Proceedings

     In October 1998, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart") filed a lawsuit in
Bentonville, Arkansas against the Company and other defendants alleging actual
and threatened misappropriation of trade secrets and ancillary common-law
claims. Wal-Mart subsequently requested a temporary restraining order preventing
the defendants from misappropriating Wal-Mart's alleged trade secrets, from
placing employees in positions in which they would "inevitably disclose"
Wal-Mart's alleged trade secrets and from soliciting, inducing or recruiting
Wal-Mart employees. In January 1999, Wal-Mart filed an identical action in
Seattle, Washington, and the Arkansas court dismissed Wal-Mart's action on
jurisdictional grounds before deciding the temporary restraining order. The
dismissal is pending appeal. Wal-Mart has advised the Company that it will file
a preliminary injunction motion. In addition to injunctive relief, Wal-Mart has
requested compensatory damages, pre- and postjudgment interest and attorneys'
fees and costs. The Company believes that Wal-Mart's claims are without merit
and intends to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs' claims.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Amazon.com has filed a counterclaim based in part on unfair competition and
intentional interference. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be
no assurance that the Company will prevail in the lawsuit.

     From time to time, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and
claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged
infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights. The Company
currently is not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that it believes
will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

NOTE 7 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

  Reincorporation and Authorized Capital

     In May 1996, the Company reincorporated in the state of Delaware with
authorized capital of 5 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock and 25
million shares of $0.01 par value common stock. In April 1997, the Company
increased its authorized common stock to 100 million shares and increased its
authorized preferred stock to 10 million shares. In June 1998, the Company
increased the number of authorized shares of common stock, from 100 million
shares to 300 million shares. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been restated to reflect these recapitalizations.

  Preferred Stock

     In June 1996, the Company issued 569,396 shares of Series A convertible
preferred stock at a price of $14.05 per share. In January and February 1997,
the Company sold an additional 5,000 shares of Series A preferred stock at $40
per share. The preferred stock was convertible into common stock at the option
of the holder, at any time, at an effective rate of 36 shares of common stock
for one share of preferred stock. As of the closing of the Company's initial
public offering, all of the preferred stock outstanding was converted into an
aggregate of 20,678,256 shares of common stock.

  Common Stock

     On November 23, 1996, the Company effected a 4-for-1 common stock split. On
April 18, 1997, the Company effected a 3-for-2 common stock split. On May 15,
1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of 18 million shares of
its common stock. Net proceeds to the Company aggregated $49.1 million. On June
1, 1998, the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock
dividend to stockholders of record on May 20, 1998. On January 4, 1999, the
Company effected a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to the
stockholders of record on December 18, 1998. Accordingly, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect these stock
splits.

  Stock Option Plans

     The Company's stock option plans consist of the 1997 Stock Option Plan and
the 1994 Stock Option Plan. Shares reserved under the plans consist of 36.0
million shares in the 1997 Stock Option Plan and 28.8 million shares in the 1994
Stock Option Plan. Any shares of common stock available for issuance under the
1994 Stock Option Plan that are not issued under that plan may be added to the
aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 1997 Stock Option
Plan. In connection with the acquisition of Junglee and the merger with
PlanetAll in August 1998, the Company assumed outstanding options to purchase
common stock originally issued under these companies' stock option plans. The
Company's stock options plans as well as the assumed stock option plans are
hereby collectively referred to as the "Plans."

     Generally, options are granted by the Company's Board of Directors at an
exercise price of not less than the fair market value of the Company's common
stock at the date of grant. Each outstanding option granted prior to December
20, 1996 has a term of five years from the date of vesting. Each outstanding
option granted

on or subsequent to December 20, 1996 has a term of ten years from the date of
grant. Subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations, options granted under
the Plans generally become exercisable immediately. Options generally vest at
the rate of 20% after year one, 20% after year two and 5% at the end of each
quarter for years three through five. Shares issued upon exercise of options
that are unvested are restricted and subject to repurchase by the Company upon
termination of employment or services and such restrictions lapse over the
original vesting schedule. At December 31, 1998, approximately 3.9 million
shares of restricted common stock were subject to repurchase.

  Deferred Compensation

     The Company recorded aggregate deferred compensation of $2.1 million, $2.7
million and $612,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The amounts recorded
represent the difference between the grant price and the deemed fair value of
the Company's common stock for shares subject to options granted in 1998, 1997
and 1996. Options granted below fair market value and the associated weighted
average exercise price per share were 536,000 and $4.095, 8.3 million and
$0.473, and 9.3 million and $0.133 during the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively. The amortization of deferred compensation is
charged to operations over the vesting period of the options, which is typically
five years. Total amortization recognized in 1998 and 1997 was $2.4 million and
$1.4 million, respectively. No amortization was recognized in 1996.

  Pro Forma Disclosure

     The Company follows the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stock
options. Had compensation cost been recognized based on the fair value at the
date of grant for options granted in 1998, 1997 and 1996, the pro forma amounts
of the Company's net loss and net loss per share for the years ended December
31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 would have been as follows:

(1) Options granted prior to the Company's initial public offering and by
    PlanetAll prior to its merger with the Company were valued using the minimum
    value method and therefore volatility was not applicable.

     The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years 1998,
1997 and 1996 was $19.07, $2.07 and $0.01, respectively, for options granted at
fair market value. The weighted-average fair value of options granted at less
than fair market value during 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $4.61, $0.55 and $0.09,
respectively. Compensation expense recognized in providing pro forma disclosures
may not be representative of the effects on pro forma earnings for future years
because SFAS No. 123 does not apply to stock option grants made prior to 1995.

  Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance

     In June 1998, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4, the Company
registered 15 million shares of its common stock, which may from time to time be
offered in connection with the acquisition of entities. Such shares may be
issued in exchange for the shares of capital stock (by merger or otherwise),
partnership interests or other assets representing an interest in other
companies or other entities, or in exchange for assets used in or related to the
business of such entities.

     At December 31, 1998, common stock reserved for future issuance is as

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 9 -- INCOME TAXES

     The Company did not provide any current or deferred United States federal,
state or foreign income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods
presented because it has experienced operating losses since inception. The
Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset,
consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, because of uncertainty
regarding its realizability.

     At December 31, 1998, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $207 million related to U.S. federal, foreign and state
jurisdictions. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to
certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Substantially all of these carryforwards will begin to expire at
various times starting in 2011. To the extent that net operating loss
carryforwards, when realized, relate to stock option deductions of approximately
$103 million, the resulting benefits will be credited to stockholders' equity.

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company's deferred tax assets are approximately as follows:

NOTE 11 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

  Convertible Subordinated Notes

     On February 3, 1999, the Company completed an offering of $1.25 billion of
4 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "Convertible Notes"). The
Convertible Notes are convertible into the Company's common stock at a
conversion price of $156.055 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events
and at the holders' option. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable
semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on
August 1, 1999. The Convertible Notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all
existing and future Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Convertible Notes
indenture) of the Company. The Convertible Notes may be redeemed at the option
of the Company prior to February 6, 2002, in whole or in part, at the redemption
prices set forth in the Convertible Notes indenture. The Company is obligated to
file by May 4, 1999, a shelf registration statement covering resales of the
Convertible Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Convertible Notes.

     Upon occurrence of any Fundamental Change (as defined in the Convertible
Notes indenture) prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, each holder of
the Convertible Notes has the right to require the Company to redeem all or any
part of the holder's Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount, plus any accrued interest, of the Convertible Notes being redeemed.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The interim consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 1999 have
been prepared by Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon.com" or the "Company") pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
for interim financial reporting. These consolidated statements are unaudited
and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments and accruals) necessary to present fairly the consolidated
balance sheets, consolidated operating results, and consolidated cash flows for
the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1998 has been derived
from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date. Operating
results for the quarter and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 may not
be indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 1999. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements, and accompanying notes, included in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation.

USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

     Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss, unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Comprehensive loss was $206.6 million and $44.6 million for the quarters ended
September 30, 1999 and 1998, and $417.5 million and $77.5 million for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain items, including amortization of goodwill and other intangibles,
equity in losses of equity-method investees and stock-based compensation, have
been reclassified compared to the financial statements incorporated by reference
in the accompanying prospectus.

NOTE 2 -- BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND INVESTMENTS

     The Company completed three significant acquisitions during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 1999: e-Niche Incorporated ("Exchange.com"),
Accept.com Financial Services Corporation ("Accept.com"), and Alexa Internet
("Alexa"). Each acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting
under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 16. The Company issued an
aggregate of approximately 8.0 million shares of common stock to effect the
transactions. The aggregate purchase price of the acquired companies, plus
related charges, was approximately $579.7 million, and was comprised of common
stock and cash. Results of operations for each acquired company have been
included in the financial results of the Company from the closing date of each
transaction forward.

                                AMAZON.COM, INC.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                  (UNAUDITED)

     In accordance with APB Opinion No. 16, all identifiable assets were
assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired companies (purchase price) on the
basis of their respective fair values. Identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill are included in "Intangibles and other, net" on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over their estimated useful lives
which approximates 3 years. Intangible assets were identified and valued by
considering the Company's intended use of acquired assets and analysis of data
concerning products, technologies, markets, historical financial performance,
and underlying assumptions of future performance. The economic and competitive
environment in which the Company and the acquired companies operate was also
considered in the valuation analysis. The Company periodically evaluates its
intangible assets for impairment and as of September 30, 1999 no write-downs
have been recorded.

     An immaterial portion of the purchase price of the Accept.com and Alexa
transactions attributable to in-process research and development efforts has
been expensed because, at the time of acquisition, technological feasibility had
not been established and no alternative future uses existed. Purchased
in-process research and development was identified and valued through
discussions with the acquired companies' management and the analysis of data
concerning developmental products, their respective stage of development, the
time and resources needed to complete them, their expected income generating
ability, target markets and associated risks.

     On May 14, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of Exchange.com, a
developer of Internet marketplaces and related online communities that bring
together buyers and sellers of rare and hard-to-find items. In connection with
the acquisition, the Company assumed all outstanding Exchange.com stock options
and issued 1,893,944 shares of Amazon.com common stock to acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of Exchange.com. Pursuant to the terms of the
agreement, the purchase price may increase by up to $27.5 million based on the
tenure of certain employees.

     On June 9, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of Accept.com, an
e-commerce company developing technology to simplify person-to-person and
business-to-consumer transactions on the Internet. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company assumed all outstanding Accept.com stock options and
issued 1,755,314 shares of Amazon.com common stock to acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of Accept.com.

     On June 10, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition of Alexa, a
developer of a web navigation service that works with Internet browsers to
provide useful information about the sites being viewed and suggests related
sites. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed all outstanding
Alexa stock options and issued 4,369,884 shares of Amazon.com common stock to
acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Alexa.

     The Company made additional immaterial acquisitions and other investments
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 1999 totaling $298.9 million.
Equity investments are reflected in "Investments in equity-method investees" in
the consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for under the equity method.
The Company's share of affiliates' losses has been included in net loss from the
closing date of the related transactions forward.

     In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company has conditioned a
portion of the acquisition consideration on the continued tenure of key
employees. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a portion of this
amount is accounted for as compensation rather than as a component of purchase
price. Consequently, a maximum of $52.7 million in additional consideration
relating to the Company's acquisitions for the nine-month period ended September
30, 1999 may be recorded as compensation expense and classified between
stock-based compensation and merger, acquisition and investment related costs in
the results of operations. Amounts will be "earned" based on tenure of certain
employees and will be recognized as expense over a period of 12 - 36 months.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                  (UNAUDITED)

     The pro forma consolidated financial information for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, determined as if all acquisitions had
occurred on January 1 of each period, would have resulted in net sales of $966.2
million and $358.1 million, net loss of $532.3 million and $296.6 million, and
basic and diluted loss per share of $1.60 and $0.98, respectively. This
unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and
is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations in future periods or
results that would have been achieved had Amazon.com and the acquired companies
been combined during the specified periods.

NOTE 3 -- MARKETABLE SECURITIES

     Marketable securities available-for-sale, at fair value, consist of the

</TABLE>

     The Company's marketable securities consist primarily of high quality
short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and money market mutual
funds. The Company classifies all uninvested funds on deposit with investment
managers as marketable securities, as well as highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less. The Company reflects the related cash flows
as investing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a
result of the classification of highly liquid investments within marketable
securities, a significant portion of the Company's gross marketable securities
purchases and maturities disclosed as investing cash flows is related to highly
liquid investments.

     At September 30, 1999 and December 31, 1998 the cost of the Company's
marketable securities approximated fair value.

NOTE 4 -- FIXED ASSETS

NOTE 5 -- GOODWILL AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLES

     Goodwill and other purchased intangibles, arising primarily from business
acquisitions, consists of $664.7 million in goodwill and $213.8 million in
purchased intangibles and other assets, net of accumulated amortization of
$175.0 million as of September 30, 1999. Total net goodwill and other purchased
intangibles were $178.6 million as of December 31, 1998 and were comprised
primarily of goodwill. The Company periodically evaluates its intangible assets
for impairment and as of September 30, 1999 no write-downs have been recorded.

NOTE 6 -- DEFERRED CHARGES

     Deferred charges relate to fees and charges resulting from the issuance of
the Company's debt. The net increase in deferred charges relates to the February
1999 issuance of 4 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009, offset by
amortization charges and periodic repurchases of the 10% Senior Discount Notes
due 2003 (see Note 7). Net deferred charges are amortized into interest expense
over the life of the underlying debt.

NOTE 7 -- LONG-TERM DEBT

CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES

     On February 3, 1999, the Company completed an offering of $1.25 billion of
4 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "Convertible Notes"). The
Convertible Notes are convertible into the Company's common stock at the
holders' option at a conversion price of $78.0275 per share, subject to
adjustment in certain events. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, and commenced
August 1, 1999. The Convertible Notes are unsecured and are subordinated to the
prior payment in full of all of Amazon.com's senior debt and are also
effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the
Company. Subject to certain conditions, the Convertible Notes may be redeemed at
the option of the Company prior to February 6, 2002, in whole or in part, at the
redemption price of $1,000 per note, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the
closing price for the Company's common stock has exceeded 150% of the conversion
price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day prior to the date of mailing of the notice of
redemption. Upon any redemption made prior to February 6, 2002, the Company will
also make an additional cash payment with respect to the Convertible Notes
called for redemption in an amount equal to $212.60 per $1,000 note redeemed,
less the amount of any interest actually paid on such Convertible Notes prior to
the call for redemption. At any time on and after February 6, 2002, the Company
may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in
the Convertible Notes indenture.

     Upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change" (as defined in the
Convertible Notes indenture) prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes,
each holder thereof shall have the right to require Amazon.com to redeem all or
any part of such holder's Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the notes being redeemed, together with accrued interest.

SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES

     In May 1998, the Company completed the offering of approximately $530
million aggregate principal amount of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2003 (the
"Senior Discount Notes") for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $326
million. The Senior Discount Notes were sold at a substantial discount from
their principal amount at maturity of $530 million. Prior to November 1, 2003,
no cash interest payments are required; instead, interest will accrete during
this period to the principal amount at maturity. From and after May 1, 2003, the
Senior Discount Notes will bear interest of a rate of 10% per annum payable in
cash on each May 1 and November 1.

     During the nine-month period ended September 30, 1999 the Company
repurchased $266.0 million (face amount) of the Senior Discount Notes,
representing accreted value of $178.4 million. As of September 30, 1999, the
remaining face amount outstanding was $264.0 million.

NOTE 8 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     On January 4, 1999, the Company effected a three-for-one stock split to
stockholders of record on December 18, 1998; and on September 1, 1999, the
Company effected a two-for-one stock split to stockholders of record on August
12, 1999. Each stock split was effected in the form of a stock dividend. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the
splits.

     The Convertible Notes (see Note 7) initially may be converted into an
aggregate of 16,019,992 shares of Amazon.com common stock.

     All of the Company's stock options are excluded from diluted loss per share
since their effect is antidilutive.

NOTE 10 -- STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     Stock-based compensation is comprised of the portion of acquisition-related
consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of key employees, which must
be classified as compensation expense rather than as a component of purchase
price under generally accepted accounting principles. Stock-based compensation
also includes stock-based charges such as option-related deferred compensation
recorded at the Company's initial public offering, as well as certain other
compensation and severance arrangements.
