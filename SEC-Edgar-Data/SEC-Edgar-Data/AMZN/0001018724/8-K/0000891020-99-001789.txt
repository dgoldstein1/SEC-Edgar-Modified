                     AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES FINANCIAL RESULTS
                             FOR THIRD QUARTER 1999

                  TOYS, ELECTRONICS, AND zSHOPS MAKE AMAZON.COM
                  THE ONE-STOP DESTINATION FOR HOLIDAY SHOPPING

         SEATTLE, WA--October 27, 1999--Having added a complete toy store, a
complete electronics store, and zShops, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today
announced financial results for the third quarter of 1999. Net sales for the
third quarter were $356 million, an increase of 132 percent over net sales of
$154 million for the third quarter of 1998.

         Amazon.com reported a third-quarter pro forma operating loss of $79
million, compared to a pro forma operating loss of $21 million in the third
quarter of 1998. Third-quarter pro forma net loss of $86 million, or $0.26 per
share, compared with a pro forma net loss of $24 million, or $0.08 per share, in
the third quarter of 1998. On a GAAP basis, reported third-quarter net loss was
$197 million, or $0.59 per share, and included $111 million of merger-,
acquisition-, investment-related costs, and stock-based compensation charges.

         Amazon.com announced that cumulative customer accounts, including
Auctions users, increased by 2.4 million during the third quarter to 13.1
million at September 30, 1999, an increase of more than 190 percent from 4.5
million customer accounts at September 30, 1998. Repeat customer orders
represented more than 72 percent of orders during the quarter ended September
30, 1999, up from 70 percent in the previous quarter.

         The growth in sales and customers accompanied the addition of a
complete toy store, a complete electronics store, and the introduction of zShops
to Amazon.com. zShops make it possible for any individual or business to sell
through Amazon.com, reaching more than 13 million experienced online shoppers.
Also, the company's new All Product Search helps shoppers find anything they
want to buy on the Net, making Amazon.com the one destination for shoppers to
find whatever they are looking for.

         "In the third quarter, we announced our new Toys Store, which was
immediately recognized by both Forrester Research and MSNBC as the best toy
store on the Internet," said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com founder and CEO. "Toys and
our other product expansions round out our rich selection and establish
Amazon.com as the one-stop holiday shopping destination."

         Regarding Amazon.com's ongoing expansion, the company will be working
hard during the holiday season to deliver the great service that Amazon.com
customers have come to expect. The company has substantially increased its
customer-service capability and increased distribution square footage more than
four times compared to the 1998

holiday season, which will help the company better serve customers during this
busy time. The company expects its combined focus on growth and customer
satisfaction will impact fourth-quarter financial performance, relative to the
third quarter, primarily in four ways: first, top-line revenues will increase
significantly; second, gross margins will decrease; third, fulfillment expenses
as a percentage of sales will slightly increase or be flat; and fourth,
marketing expenses will increase.

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

         Heads-down focus on customers helped Amazon.com continue to improve
customer experience and grow brand and reach. Recent highlights include
Amazon.com rated as:

         o  The most widely recognized e-commerce brand in the United States, as
            rated by online shoppers in a nationwide survey by Opinion Research
            Corp. Some 117.8 million adults, or 60 percent of the adult
            population in the U.S., recognize the Amazon.com brand, according to
            the survey;

         o  The 57th most valuable brand worldwide, just above Hilton, Guinness,
            and Marriott, and just below Pampers, in a June study of global
            brands by Interbrand Newell and Sorrell;

         o  The No 1. Toys store, Books, Music, and Video stores, and General
            Merchandise store in Forrester Research's recently released
            PowerRankings(TM);

         o  The best online toy store in an MSNBC survey, barely one month after
            the launch of the Amazon.com Toys Store, beating out
            longer-established players;

         o  The No. 1 place to save money on the Internet, as rated by online
            shoppers in a nationwide survey by Opinion Research Corp.;

         o  The No. 1 online shopping site and the No. 7 Web property during
            September, according to Media Metrix;

         o  The No. 1 Video store, the No.1 Music store, and the No. 1 Bookstore
            by Gomez Advisors in their most recent scorecards of online stores
            in these categories;

         o  The most-visited music store online, according to Greenfield
            Online's study of more than 5,000 consumers who have shopped for
            music online.

WISH LIST

         In early October, Amazon.com introduced Wish List, an advanced and
extensive online gift registry for the coming holiday season
(http://www.amazon.com/wishlist). Designed to take the stress and hassle out of
finding the perfect gift, Wish List was the No. 1 customer request during last
year's holiday shopping season. Since its introduction, Wish List has seen
faster adoption than almost any other feature Amazon.com has offered its
customers.

zSHOPS

         In late September, Amazon.com introduced zShops, which enable anyone to
offer merchandise for sale at Amazon.com, whether they are micro-manufacturers
or major manufacturers, small businesses or global corporations, or specialized
retailers. With zShops, anyone can now offer a vast array of popular or
hard-to-find items to Amazon.com's more than 13 million customers.

AMAZON.COM PAYMENTS

         With the launch of zShops, Amazon.com introduced Amazon.com Payments,
which allows individuals to pay for zShops purchases with credit cards using
Amazon.com's 1-Click payment feature, thus eliminating what is considered the
greatest inconvenience of online transactions between individuals: the delays,
hassles, and risks of sending checks and money orders through regular mail.

ALL PRODUCTS SEARCH

         All Products Search, located in the search box on the upper-left of the
Amazon.com Welcome page, helps shoppers find anything for sale on the Net,
providing customers with a convenient, easy-to-use guide for finding and
discovering exactly what they want among the Net's millions of offerings. This
customized and specialized Web search engine is dedicated solely to shopping and
makes Amazon.com the place to start online shopping.

AMAZON.COM ANYWHERE

         In early October, Amazon.com launched Amazon.com Anywhere, an
initiative in wireless e-commerce that allows customers to shop and check the
status of auction items at Amazon.com securely when they are away from their
desktop computers. With the national launch of the new Palm VII(TM) organizer,
Amazon.com's vast selection of merchandise is now accessible to customers
anywhere, anytime.

MANAGEMENT TEAM EXPANSION

         The company continued to build on its management strength, naming
Warren C. Jenson as its senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Jenson had been executive vice president and CFO at Delta Airlines, the largest
domestic airline. Prior to Delta, Jenson was CFO of NBC, a division of General
Electric. Jenson came to Amazon.com with a strong record of achievement in
financial management, innovative transactions, and Web-based initiatives.

         Jeffrey A. Wilke was named vice president-general manager of
operations. Wilke was formerly vice president and general manager of
AlliedSignal's Pharmaceutical Fine Chemicals unit. Wilke was directly
responsible for 15 plants/distribution centers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
