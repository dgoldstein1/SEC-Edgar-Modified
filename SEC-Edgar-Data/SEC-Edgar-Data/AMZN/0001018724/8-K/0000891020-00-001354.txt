(BW) (WA-AMAZON.COM) (AMZN) AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR SECOND
QUARTER 2000

      U.S. Books, Music and DVD/Video Segment Achieves Pro Forma Operating
                                 Profitability;
           Over 23 Million Cumulative Customers Served in Five Years;
                          Cash Balance at $908 Million

        SEATTLE, WA--July 26, 2000--Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) today
announced that net sales for the second quarter of 2000 were $578 million, an
increase of 84% over net sales of $314 million for the second quarter of 1999.
The Amazon Electronics store, launched in July 1999, became Amazon.com's
fastest-growing store yet.

        Pro forma operating loss for the second quarter of 2000 was $89 million,
or 15% of sales, compared to a pro forma operating loss of $67 million, or 21%
of sales, in the second quarter of 1999. Second-quarter pro forma net loss was
$0.33 per share, compared with a pro forma net loss of $0.26 per share in the
second quarter of 1999. Amazon.com's U.S. Books, Music and DVD/Video segment pro
forma operating profit was $10 million.

        Cumulative customer accounts increased by 2.5 million during the second
quarter to more than 22.5 million as of June 30, 2000, and now stand at over 23
million. Repeat customer orders represented 78% of orders in the second quarter,
up from 70% the previous year. Trailing 12-month sales per customer who
purchased during the 12 months ended June 30, 2000, was $125, up from $108 for
the same period a year ago.

        Total sales outside the United States, including exports from the U.S.,
were 23% of sales in the second quarter. Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de sales were
$73 million, up 134% from $31 million for the second quarter of 1999. The two
sites added more than 500,000 new customer accounts in the second quarter of
2000, bringing their total customer accounts to more than 3 million, up from
about 800,000 as of June 30, 1999.

        "Our vision remains being Earth's most customer-centric company, the
best place for customers to find and discover anything they want to buy online,"
said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com founder and CEO. "While we continue to see
improvements in all of our businesses, we are especially pleased with the
profitability in our U.S. Books, Music and Video group and the unusual growth in
our Electronics store. For the company as a whole, we're well on our way to
achieving our 2000 objectives."

        "We are pleased to report strong year-over-year growth in revenue, gross
margin and operating margin improvement, U.S. Books, Music and DVD/Video segment
pro forma operating profitability, and a cash balance of $908 million," said
Warren Jenson, Amazon.com chief financial officer. "Looking ahead, we continue
to expect pro forma operating losses in the single digits as a percentage of
sales by the fourth quarter of this year and strong year-over-year sales growth.
In addition we expect to end the year with roughly $1 billion in cash."

        In July, a worldwide total of 410,000 copies of Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire were ordered in advance of its release, making it the largest
pre-order ever. Amazon.com accounted for nearly 10% of the print run for the
book and teamed up with

                                  Page 1 of 8
<PAGE>   2
FedEx to deliver 250,000 copies to fans on Saturday, July 8--the first day the
book was available to the public.

        Amazon.com's overall fulfillment expenses, which comprise distribution
center costs, customer service costs and net credit card fees, were $88 million,
or 15% of sales in the second quarter.

        A live Webcast of the company's second quarter 2000 financial results
conference call can be heard at 5:00 p.m. EDT/2:00 p.m. PDT today at
www.amazon.com/ir. The call will also be archived and available until September
30, 2000.

        Historical results of operations are preliminary and unaudited. This
press release also contains forward-looking statements, including statements
regarding expectations of future sales, pro forma operating losses and cash, all
of which are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ
materially for a variety of reasons, including the rate of growth of the
Internet and online commerce, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, customer spending patterns,
the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of revenues derived from products
sales as compared to services, risks of inventory management, the magnitude of
losses arising from investments accounted for under the equity method, the
degree to which the company enters into Amazon Commerce Network (ACN) and other
strategic transactions, fluctuations in the value of securities and non-cash
payments Amazon.com receives in connection with such transactions, and risks of
distribution and fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and
uncertainties include Amazon.com's limited operating history, anticipated
losses, potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results,

                                  Page 4 of 8
<PAGE>   5
seasonality, consumer trends, competition, risks associated with distribution
center expansion, adverse consequences arising from system interruptions, risks
associated with management of potential growth, risks related to auction and
zShops services, risks related to fraud and Amazon.com Payments, and risks of
new business areas, international expansion, business combinations, and
strategic alliances. More information about factors that potentially could
affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 1999, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended March 31, 2000.
