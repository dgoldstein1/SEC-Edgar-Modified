3.  Long-Term Obligations
    ---------------------

   In March 1997, the Company sold in a private placement under Rule 144A of the
   Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), $517.5 million of
   3 1/4% convertible subordinated notes due 2002 (the "3 1/4% Notes"). The
   3 1/4% Notes are generally convertible into shares of common stock of the
   Company at a conversion price of $45.31 per share, subject to adjustment in
   certain events. Interest is payable semiannually and the 3 1/4% Notes are
   redeemable at the option of the Company at set redemption prices (which range
   from 100.65% to 101.30% of principal), plus accrued interest, commencing
   March 15, 2000. The Company has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3
   with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act, which
   became effective on June 26, 1997, permitting the resale, on a registered
   basis, of the Notes and of the shares of common stock issuable upon
   conversion of the Notes from time to time by the securityholders named or to
   be named therein.


4.  Net Income Per Share
    --------------------

   Net income per share was computed on the basis of weighted average common and
   dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. Primary and fully diluted
   weighted average shares outstanding used in the per share computations
   reflect the dilutive effects of the 3 1/4% Notes for the three and nine
   months ended September 30, 1997, and of the 4 1/4% convertible subordinated
   notes due 2001 (the "4 1/4% Notes") for the three and nine months ended
   September 30, 1996. The dilutive effects of outstanding stock options are
   reflected in all periods presented.

   In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
   of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" which is
   effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 1997. This Statement
   replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share ("EPS") with a
   presentation of diluted EPS and adds the presentation of basic EPS, which
   excludes dilutive securities. It also requires a reconciliation of the basic
   EPS to diluted EPS and dual presentation on the face of the income statement.

5. Common Stock
   ------------

   On October 21, 1997, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split in the form
   of a 100% stock dividend with a record date of October 31, 1997 and a
   distribution date of November 17, 1997. Share and per share amounts have not
   been restated to reflect the stock split. Pro forma fully diluted per share
   amounts as restated to reflect the stock split are $.25 and $.18 for the
   three months ended September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively, and $.72 and
   $.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 and 1996.

6. Litigation
   ------------

   On August 20, 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit against the Company in
   the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Civil
   Action No. 97-6211) alleging that the Company is infringing two patents and
   seeking unspecified damages. The Company believes TM's claims are without
   merit.

   The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine and
   incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of
   these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or
   financial condition.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Third Quarter of 1997 compared to Third Quarter of 1996
(in thousands)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenues
- --------

The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth on page
18 and in EMC's other filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Total revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 1997 were $732,570
compared to $550,754 for the third quarter of 1996, an increase of $181,816 or
33%.  The increase in revenues was due primarily to the continued strong demand
for the Company's Symmetrix series of products.  These products address the
growing demand for enterprise-wide storage solutions regardless of operating
systems. Enterprise Storage allows users to move and store mission critical
information from mainframe, UNIX and Windows NT environments.

Revenues from products sold directly and through original equipment
manufacturers ("OEM's") and resellers into the open systems storage market,
which include the Symmetrix products operating in an open systems environment
and other products, were $404,054 in the third quarter of 1997, compared to
$182,613 in the third quarter of 1996, an increase of $221,441 or 121%. This was
the second consecutive quarter in which open systems revenue levels exceeded
mainframe revenue levels.  The Company expects further growth in the open
systems revenue levels and revenue as a percentage of total revenue in this
market for the remainder of 1997. (See, however, "Factors that May Affect Future
Results.")

Revenues from products sold directly and through OEM's and resellers into the
mainframe storage market, which include Symmetrix products operating primarily
in the Multiple Virtual Storage ("MVS") environment, were $266,226 in the third
quarter of 1997, compared to $305,605 in the third quarter of 1996.  The
decrease of $39,379 or 13% resulted from the continuing market transition from
proprietary mainframe storage to products operating in an open systems
environment and some seasonality in the European market which tends to be more
mainframe-oriented.

Revenues from products sold by McDATA Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
EMC (See Note 8) ("McDATA"), which include the ESCON Director series of
products, were $43,126 in the third quarter of 1997, compared to $43,776 in the
third quarter of 1996, a decrease of $650 or 1%.

                                EMC CORPORATION


Revenues from all other products, which include the midrange series of products,
were less than $1 million in the third quarter of 1997, compared to $4,285 in
the third quarter of 1996. Midrange revenue levels are not expected to be
material in the remainder of 1997 and thereafter.

Software revenues were $49,782 and $26,401 in the third quarters of 1997 and
1996, respectively.  Software revenues are included in the product revenues for
the respective mainframe and open systems markets.

Revenues from service and rental income were $18,621 in the third quarter of
1997, compared to $14,475 in the third quarter of 1996, an increase of $4,146 or
29%, due principally to a broadening base of customers under service agreements.

In October 1995, the Company entered into a reseller agreement with HP under
which HP markets and resells the Symmetrix 3000 series of systems worldwide for
connection to HP's 9000 series computers.  This agreement was expanded to enable
HP to also market and resell this family of systems for connection to HP's 3000
series computers. The current agreement extends through August 1998.  Revenues
for the third quarter of 1997 and 1996 under this agreement were $134,608 and
$62,161, or 18% and 11% of total revenues, respectively.

Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $426,733 in the third
quarter of 1997 compared to $330,520 in the third quarter of 1996, an increase
of $96,213, or 29%.  This increase was due primarily to increased revenue levels
from sales of the Symmetrix series of products in the open systems storage
market.

Revenues on sales into all markets outside North America were $305,837 or 42% of
total revenues in the third quarter of 1997 compared to $220,234 or 40% of total
revenues for the third quarter of 1996, an increase of $85,603 or 39%. The
increase in revenue levels is primarily due to sales of the Symmetrix series of
products in the open systems storage market.

Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, Africa and the Middle East were
$221,606 in the third quarter of 1997 compared to $173,724 in the third quarter
of 1996, an increase of $47,882, or 28%.

Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region, primarily Japan,
were $77,366 in the third quarter of 1997 compared to $45,656 in the third
quarter of 1996, an increase of $31,710, or 69%.

Revenues on sales into the markets of South America were $6,865 in the third
quarter of 1997 compared to $854 in the third quarter of 1996, an increase of
$6,011 or 704%.

Gross Margins
- -------------

Gross margins increased to 46.6% of revenues in the third quarter of 1997,
compared to 44.4% of revenues in the third quarter of 1996.  This increase is
primarily attributable to increasing sales of software which have a higher gross
margin than hardware sales.  Other factors impacting gross margins to a lesser
extent in the third quarter of 1997 include the rates of price declines in the
marketplace and component cost declines which were about equal.  The Company
currently believes that price declines will continue.

Research and Development
- ------------------------

Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $56,531 and $41,151 in the third
quarters of 1997 and 1996, respectively, an increase of $15,380, or 37%.  R&D
expenses were 7.7% and 7.5% of revenues in the third quarters of 1997 and 1996,
respectively.  The increase was partially due to the cost of additional
technical staff to support a variety of initiatives including both fibre channel
connectivity and Enterprise Storage software.  The increase is also attributable
to expenses associated with computer equipment acquired to facilitate this
development.  The Company expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for
R&D for the balance of 1997 and thereafter.

Selling, General and Administrative
- -----------------------------------

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $122,093 and $90,268
in the third quarters of 1997 and 1996, respectively, an increase of $31,825 or
35%. SG&A expenses were 16.7% and 16.4% of revenues in the third quarters of
1997 and 1996, respectively.  The dollar increase is due primarily to costs
associated with additional worldwide sales and support personnel and their
related overhead costs.  These costs are attributable to the Company's increased
revenue levels and the Company's initiatives to expand sales of its Enterprise
Storage products.  The Company has expanded its international direct sales
force, as well as its OEM, reseller, alliance and partnership programs with
applications, systems and database vendors.  SG&A expenses are expected to
increase in dollar terms for the balance of 1997 and thereafter.

Investment Income and Interest Expense
- --------------------------------------

Investment income was $20,708 in the third quarter of 1997 compared with $9,537
in the same period a year ago.  Interest income was earned from investments in
cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments and other receivables.
Investment income increased in 1997 primarily due to higher cash and investment
balances which were derived from operations and the 3 1/4% Notes that were
issued in March of 1997.

Interest expense increased by $1,661 to $4,706 in the third quarter of 1997 from
$3,045 in the third quarter of 1996.  The increase is attributable to the
issuance of the 3 1/4% Notes in March of 1997.

                                EMC CORPORATION

Provision for Income Taxes
- --------------------------

The provisions for income taxes were $45,754 and $29,134 in the third quarters
of 1997 and 1996, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.6%
in the third quarter of 1997 and 24.4% in the third quarter of 1996.  In the
third quarter of 1996 the Company reduced its expected year-to-date effective
tax rate to 25.6% which resulted in the lower rate for the three month period
ended September 30, 1996.  The lower tax rate was due to the realization of
benefits associated with the continued progress on the Company's various tax
strategies.  The Company provides for income taxes based upon its estimate of
full year earnings on a country-by-country basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - First Nine Months of 1997 compared to First Nine Months
of 1996 (in thousands)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenues
- --------

The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth on page
18 and in EMC's other filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 were $2,064,468
compared to $1,617,258 for the first nine months of 1996, an increase of
$447,210 or 28%. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the continued
strong demand for the Company's Symmetrix series of products.  These products
address the growing need for enterprise-wide storage solutions regardless of
operating systems.  Enterprise Storage allows users to move and store data
mission critical information from mainframe, UNIX and Windows NT environments.

Revenues from products sold directly and through OEM's and resellers into the
open systems storage market, which include the Symmetrix products operating in
an open systems environment and other products, were $1,011,756 in the first
nine months of 1997, compared to $498,902 in the first nine months of 1996, an
increase of $512,854 or 103%.  The Company expects further growth in the open
systems revenue levels and revenue as a percentage of total revenue in this
market for the remainder of 1997. (See, however, "Factors that May Affect Future
Results.")

Revenues from products sold directly and through OEM's and resellers into the
mainframe storage market, which include Symmetrix products operating primarily
in the MVS environment, were $857,155 in the first nine months of 1997, compared
to $924,254 in the first nine months of 1996, a decrease of $67,099 or 7%.  The
trend in the mainframe revenue levels reflects a continuing market transition
from proprietary mainframe storage to products operating in an open systems
environment.

Revenues from products sold by McDATA, which include the ESCON Director series
of products, were $136,209 in the first nine months of 1997, compared to
$129,052 in the first nine months of 1996, an increase of $7,157 or 6%.

Revenues from all other products, which include the midrange series of products,
were $4,240 in the first nine months of 1997, compared to $26,490 in the first
nine months of 1996, a decrease of $22,250 or 84% attributable to customer
demand shifting to Symmetrix Enterprise Storage.  Midrange revenue levels are
not expected to be material in the remainder of 1997 and thereafter.

Software revenues were $117,152 and $53,034 in the first nine months of 1997 and
1996, respectively.  Software revenues are included in the product revenues for
the respective mainframe and open systems markets.

Revenues from service and rental income were $55,108 in the first nine months of
1997, compared to $38,560 in the first nine months of 1996, an increase of
$16,548 or 43%, due to a broadening base of customers under service agreements.

for the first nine months of 1997 and 1996 under this agreement were $360,722
and $175,477, or 17% and 11% of total revenues, respectively.

Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $1,188,891 in the first
nine months of 1997 compared to $965,322 in the first nine months of 1996, an
increase of $223,569, or 23%.  This increase was due primarily to increased
revenue levels from sales of the Symmetrix series of products in the open
systems storage market.

Revenues on sales into all markets outside North America were $875,577 or 42% of
total revenues in the first nine months of 1997 compared to $651,936 or 40% of
total revenues for the first nine months of 1996. The increase in revenue levels
is primarily due to sales of the Symmetrix series of products in the open
systems storage market.

Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, Africa and the Middle East were
$656,662 in the first nine months of 1997 compared to $502,983 in the first nine
months of 1996, an increase of $153,679, or 31%.

Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region, primarily Japan,
were $204,467 in the first nine months of 1997 compared to $141,883 in the first
nine months of 1996, an increase of $62,584, or 44%.

Revenues on sales into the markets of South America were $14,448 in the first
nine months of 1997 compared to $7,070 in the first nine months of 1996, an
increase of $7,378 or 104%.

Gross Margins
- -------------

Gross margins increased to 46.1% of revenues in the first nine months of 1997,
compared to 44.1% of revenues in the first nine months of 1996.  This increase
is primarily attributable to increasing sales of software which have a higher
gross margin than hardware sales.  Other factors impacting gross margins to a
lesser extent in the first nine months of the year include the rates of price
declines in the marketplace and component cost declines which were about equal.
The Company currently believes that price declines will continue.

Research and Development
- ------------------------

R&D expenses were $158,068 and $116,101 in the first nine months of 1997 and
1996, respectively, an increase of $41,967, or 36%.  R&D expenses were 7.7% and
7.2% of revenues in the first nine months of 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The
increase was partially due to the cost of additional technical staff to support
a variety of initiatives including both fibre channel connectivity and
Enterprise Storage software.  The increase is also attributable to expenses
associated with computer equipment acquired to facilitate this development.  The
Company expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the balance
of 1997 and thereafter.

Selling, General and Administrative
- -----------------------------------

SG&A expenses were $334,357 and $259,190 in the first nine months of 1997 and
1996, respectively, an increase of $75,167 or 29%. SG&A expenses were 16.2% and
16.0% of revenues in the first nine months of 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The
dollar increase is due primarily to costs associated with additional worldwide
sales and support personnel and their related overhead costs.  These costs are
attributable to the Company's increased revenue levels and the Company's
initiatives to expand sales of its Enterprise Storage products.  The Company has
expanded its international direct sales force, as well as its OEM, reseller,
alliance and partnership programs with applications, systems and database
vendors.  SG&A expenses are expected to increase in dollar terms for the balance
of 1997 and thereafter.

Investment Income and Interest Expense
- --------------------------------------

Investment income was $49,804 in the first nine months of 1997 compared with
$23,903 in the same period a year ago.  Interest income was earned from
investments in cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments and other
receivables.  Investment income increased in 1997 primarily due to higher cash
and investment balances which were derived from operations and the 3 1/4% Notes
that were issued in March of 1997.

                                EMC CORPORATION

Interest expense increased by $1,647 to $10,748 for the nine months ended
September 30, 1997 from $9,101 for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 and
relates primarily to the 3 1/4% Notes and 4 1/4% Notes, respectively.


Provision for Income Taxes
- --------------------------

The provisions for income taxes were $128,436 and $90,369 in the first nine
months of 1997 and 1996, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate
of 25.6% in the first nine months of 1997 and 1996.  This effective tax rate is
mainly attributable to the realization of benefits associated with the Company's
various tax strategies.  The Company provides for income taxes based upon its
estimate of full year earnings on a country-by-country basis.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $1,472,915
and $840,858 at September 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996, respectively, an
increase of $632,057.

Cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 1997 was
$254,286, generated primarily from net income and offset by an increase in
working capital, primarily driven by an increase in inventory related to the
transition to the new Symmetrix products.  Cash used by investing activities was
$302,102, principally for the purchase of short and long-term investments and
additions to property, plant and equipment.  Cash provided by financing
activities was $524,898, principally from the issuance of the 3 1/4% Notes in
March of 1997 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

At September 30, 1997, the Company had available for use its credit line of $50
million.  The Company may elect to borrow at any time.  Based on its current
operating and capital expenditure forecasts, the Company believes funds
currently available, funds generated from operations and its available line of
credit will be adequate to finance its operations, as well as potential
acquisitions.

Financial Reporting Release No. 48, issued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, requires enhanced disclosures regarding accounting policies for and
market risks inherent in derivatives and other financial instruments.  Note M of
the notes to the financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1996 describes the Company's use of
derivatives and its related accounting policy.  There have been no significant
changes to the policy set forth in Note M through September 30, 1997.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
- --------------------------------------

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements as
defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of
certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) a failure by any
supplier of high density DRAMs, disk drives or other components to meet EMC's
requirements for an extended period of time; (ii) changes in EMC's sales
strategy and product development plans; (iii) the transition to new products;
(iv) the historic and recurring "hockey stick" pattern of the Company's sales by
which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter's total sales occur in the last
month and weeks and days of each quarter; (v) the "hockey stick" pattern of the
Company's sales, making it extremely difficult to predict near-term demand and
adjust production capacity accordingly; (vi) competitive factors, including but
not limited to pricing pressures, in the computer storage market; (vii)
fluctuating currency exchange rates; (viii) the relative and varying rates of
product price and component cost declines; (ix) termination of the agreements
with certain of the Company's OEM's or resellers; (x) other one-time events and
other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's
other filings at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

                                    PART II.
                               OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
         -----------------
 
     On August 20, 1997, TM Patents, L.P. ("TM") filed suit against the
     registrant in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
     New York (Civil Action No. 97-6211) alleging that the registrant is
     infringing two patents and seeking unspecified damages. The registrant
     believes TM's claims are without merit.

     The registrant is a party to other litigation which it considers routine
     and incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of
     any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on the registrant's
     business or financial condition.

Item 5.  Other Information
         -----------------

         (a)  In August 1997, the registrant announced plans to more than 
              double its worldwide manufacturing capacity. The registrant is
              constructing a manufacturing facility in Franklin, Massachusetts
              of approximately 650,000 square feet and increasing the size of
              its manufacturing plant in Cork, Ireland, to a total of
              approximately 400,000 square feet.

         (b)  On October 1, 1997, a new McDATA Corporation was formed to design,
              develop and market fibre channel solutions for switched enterprise
              environments. The registrant is currently the majority shareholder
              in the new company. McDATA Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned
              subsidiary of the registrant, continues to focus on McDATA's
              existing ESCON business and holds the registrant's equity
              investment in the new McDATA Corporation.

         (c)  Subsequent Events.  See Notes 5 and 8 to Notes to Interim 
              Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I of this report.
