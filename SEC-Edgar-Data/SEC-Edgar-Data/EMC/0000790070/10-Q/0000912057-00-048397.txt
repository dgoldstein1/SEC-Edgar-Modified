    The calculation of earnings per share excludes the Company's 6% convertible
subordinated notes due 2004 (the "6% Notes"), as the effect of the conversion
would be antidilutive.

5. EQUITY TRANSACTIONS

    CONVERTIBLE NOTES

    In March 1997, the Company sold $517.5 of its 3 1/4% convertible
subordinated notes due 2002 (the "3 1/4% Notes"). In March 2000, all of the
outstanding 3 1/4% Notes were converted into common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of EMC ("Common Stock"). In May 1997, Data General Corporation ("Data
General") sold $212.8 of the 6% Notes, which were assumed by the Company in
connection with the acquisition of Data General in 1999. In May 2000, $212.6 of
the 6% Notes were converted into Common Stock. The Company paid approximately
one hundred fifty-five thousand dollars to redeem the remaining 6% Notes.

    STOCK SPLIT

    On May 3, 2000, the Company announced a two-for-one stock split in the form
of a 100% stock dividend with a record date of May 19, 2000 and a distribution
date of June 2, 2000. Share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect
the stock splits for all periods presented.

    ISSUANCE OF SUBSIDIARY STOCK

    On August 9, 2000, the Company completed the initial public offering of
14,375 shares of Class B common stock of its indirect majority owned subsidiary
McDATA Corporation (including the exercise

of the underwriters' over-allotment option). The offering represented
approximately 13% of the McDATA common stock outstanding. McDATA offered the
shares at a price of $28 per share and realized net proceeds from the offering
of $376,607. McDATA has retained the net proceeds for general corporate
purposes. After the offering, the Company continues to own approximately 75% of
the outstanding McDATA common stock which it currently intends to distribute to
holders of the Common Stock on a pro rata basis, subject to certain conditions.
The proposed distribution is anticipated to occur in 2001, no later than
February 8. The Company will, in its sole discretion, determine whether to
complete this distribution, and the timing, structure and all other terms of the
distribution. The Company did not recognize any gains in its income statement as
a result of this transaction. The net proceeds were allocated ratably between
additional paid-in capital and minority interest in the Company's consolidated
balance sheet based upon the Company's ownership position in McDATA on the date
of the offering.

6. LITIGATION

    The Company is a party to certain litigation which it considers routine and
incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of
these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.

7. DERIVATIVES

    The Company uses derivatives to hedge foreign currency cash flows on a
continuing basis for periods consistent with its net asset and forecasted
exposures. Since the Company is using foreign exchange derivative contracts to
hedge foreign exchange exposures, the changes in the value of the derivatives
are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of
the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the derivatives is recognized in
current earnings, which represented immaterial amounts for all periods
presented. The ineffective portion of the derivatives is primarily related to
option premiums and to discounts or premiums on forward contracts. The Company's
derivative contracts generally mature within nine months.

    The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a
portion of its forecasted transactions. These derivatives are designated as cash
flow hedges, and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(expense) until the underlying forecasted transaction
occurs. Once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized, the appropriate
gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense) to the income
statement, in revenue and expense, as appropriate. In the event the underlying
forecasted transaction does not occur, the amount recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(expense) will be reclassified to the other
income/(expense) line of the income statement in the then-current period.

    The Company recorded in revenue and expense approximately $15,541 and
$23,847 in net gains from cash flow hedges related to items forecasted for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2000, respectively. The amount that will
be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/ (expense) to
earnings over the next twelve months is a gain of approximately $6,436, net of
tax.

8. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

    In January 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Softworks, Inc. by means of a tender offer, whereby all the shares of Softworks
were converted into the right to receive cash. Also in January 2000, the Company
acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Terascape Software, Inc. In July
2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Avalon, Inc.
and in August 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Digital Bitcasting, Inc. The aggregate cost of these transactions was
approximately $245 million, net of cash acquired of approximately $28 million.

    The Company accounted for each acquisition as a purchase transaction. The
interim consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each
business from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material to
the Company on either an individual or an aggregate basis.

    The Company calculated amounts allocated to in-process research and
development ("IPR&D") using established valuation techniques and expensed such
amounts in the quarter that each acquisition was consummated because
technological feasibility of the in-process technology had not been achieved and
no alternate future use has been established. The Company computed its
valuations of IPR&D for the acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis
on the anticipated income stream to be generated by the purchased technology.
During the first quarter, the Company recorded a $3,300 charge to research and
development expense representing the write-off of IPR&D associated with certain
of these acquisitions.

    The excess of the purchase price over the estimated value of the net
tangible assets was allocated to various intangible assets, consisting primarily
of developed technology and goodwill, as well as other intangible assets. The
value of developed technology was based upon future discounted cash flows
relating to the existing product's projected income stream. Intangible assets,
including goodwill, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, which is a maximum of five years.

9. RESTRUCTURING, MERGER AND OTHER CHARGES

    During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company approved and implemented a
restructuring program in connection with its acquisition of Data General. The
restructuring plan, which is expected to be substantially completed by December
2000, provides for the consolidation of the Company's operations and elimination
of duplicative facilities worldwide. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of
1999, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $170.6 million related to
employee termination benefits, facility closure costs, asset disposals, and
other exit costs which the Company has recorded in operating expenses. The total
cash impact of the charge is approximately $140.7 million, of which $52.4
million was paid in 1999 and $55.3 million has been paid during the first nine
months of 2000.

    The restructuring plan includes a net reduction of the workforce by
approximately 1,100 employees, approximately 59% of whom are or were based in
North America and 23% of whom are or were based in Europe. The employee
separations affect the majority of business functions and job classes. As of
September 30, 2000, employee separations due to restructuring actions totaled
approximately 1,050.

9. RESTRUCTURING, MERGER AND OTHER CHARGES (CONTINUED)
    During fiscal year 1998, Data General recorded a charge of $82.4 million
related to a restructuring program. The charge included employee termination
benefits, asset write-downs, and other exit costs. The total cash impact of the
restructuring charge is approximately $58.5 million, of which $46.0 million was
paid prior to December 31, 1999 and $1.8 million was paid during the first nine
months of 2000. As of September 30, 2000, the remaining accruals of $13.8
million from the 1998 restructuring program are primarily related to excess
vacant rental properties in Europe.

    The amounts charged against the established provisions described above were
as follows:

11. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements," subsequently updated by SAB 101A and SAB 101B ("SAB 101"). SAB 101
summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The Company is
required to adopt SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The
Company does not expect that the adoption of SAB 101 will have a material impact
on its results of operations or financial position.

    In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation--an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44
clarifies the application of APB Opinion No. 25 and among other issues clarifies
the following: the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB
Opinion No. 25, the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequences of various modifications to
the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards, and the accounting for an
exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 was
effective as of July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in FIN 44 cover specific
events that occurred after either December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The
Company adopted FIN 44 for the third quarter of 2000 and there was no material
impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position for such
quarter.

    In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities--an amendment of FAS 133" ("FAS
138"). This statement amends the accounting and reporting standards for certain
derivative instruments and hedging activities. For an entity that has adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 prior to June 15, 2000, FAS
138 is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after June 15, 2000. The
Company adopted FAS 138 for the third quarter of 2000 and there was no material
impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position for such
quarter.

12. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

    As of October 31, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common
stock of CrosStor Software, Inc. in exchange for approximately $300 million in
Common Stock. The transaction is being accounted for as a pooling-of interests.
CrosStor develops high-performance software for networked storage systems.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations should be read in conjunction with "Factors That May Affect Future
Results" set forth on page 22 and in EMC's other filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

ALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THIS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ARE IN MILLIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--THIRD QUARTER OF 2000 COMPARED TO THIRD QUARTER OF 1999

    REVENUES

    Total revenues for the third quarter of 2000 were $2,283.0 compared to
$1,708.9 for the third quarter of 1999, representing an increase of $574.1, or
34%.

    Enterprise storage hardware revenues were $1,450.6 in the third quarter of
2000, compared to $1,013.5 in the third quarter of 1999, representing an
increase of $437.1, or 43%. The increase in enterprise systems revenues was due
to increased sales volume resulting from continued strong demand for the
Company's Symmetrix series of products and the successful introduction of new
hardware products. These products address the growing demand for enterprise-wide
storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and protect mission critical
information in UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe environments.

    Enterprise storage software revenues were $332.3 in the third quarter of
2000 compared to $206.6 in the third quarter of 1999, representing an increase
of $125.7, or 61%. The increase in software revenues was primarily due to
increased licenses of enterprise storage software on Symmetrix systems both
newly shipped and already installed, and the successful introduction of new and
enhanced software products.

    Revenues from enterprise switching products sold directly by McDATA Holdings
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of EMC and the direct parent of McDATA
Corporation ("McDATA Holdings"), including the ESCON Director series of
products, were $34.0 in the third quarter of 2000 compared to $24.3 in the third
quarter of 1999, representing an increase of $9.7, or 40%. The increase was due
to increased sales of fibre channel-based directors. ESCON revenues were
generally unchanged compared to the third quarter of 1999. The Company
anticipates that future revenues from ESCON directors will generally decline.

    Revenues from the midrange line of storage products, including the CLARiiON
product line, were $162.2 in the third quarter of 2000, compared to $114.3 in
the third quarter of 1999, excluding related service revenues. This increase of
$47.9, or 42%, reflects a significant increase in sales volume from non-original
equipment manufacturer sales channels offset in part by a decrease in sales
volume from indirect channels.

    Total storage product revenues were $1,979.2 in the third quarter of 2000,
compared to $1,358.7 in the third quarter of 1999, representing an increase of
$620.5, or 46%. The increase is due primarily to increased sales of enterprise
storage hardware and software products.

    Revenues from AViiON server products were $71.4 in the third quarter of 2000
compared to $166.8 in the third quarter of 1999, representing a decrease of
$95.4, or 57%. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of reduced
volume due to the refocusing of the AViiON business on the most profitable
product lines combined with the effect of closing certain international sales
offices. In addition, the Company is reallocating AViiON resources within the
consolidated Company.

    Overall service revenues were $232.4 in the third quarter of 2000 compared
to $183.4 in the third quarter of 1999, an increase of $49.0, or 27%. Storage
service revenues were $161.4 in the third quarter

                                       15
<PAGE>
of 2000 compared to $92.8 in the third quarter of 1999, an increase of $68.6, or
74%. These increases were primarily related to increased maintenance revenues on
enterprise storage hardware and software products and increased revenues from
professional services. Server service revenues from the Company's Data General
division were $71.0 in the third quarter of 2000 compared to $90.6 in the third
quarter of 1999, a decrease of $19.6, or 22%. The decrease is primarily due to
the refocusing of the AViiON business combined with the effect of closing
certain international sales offices.

    Total revenues from storage products and services were $2,140.6 in the third
quarter of 2000, compared to $1,451.5 in the third quarter of 1999, representing
an increase of $689.1, or 47%. Total revenues from server products and services
were $142.4 in the third quarter of 2000, compared to $257.4 in the third
quarter of 1999, representing a decrease of $115.0, or 45%.

    Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $1,411.6 in the third
quarter of 2000 compared to $1,097.9 in the third quarter of 1999, an increase
of $313.7, or 29%. The revenue growth reflects strong demand for the Company's
storage products and services, which increased by 41% compared to the third
quarter of 1999. This growth was offset in part by a decrease in AViiON server
revenues due to the refocusing of the business on the most profitable product
lines.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, the Middle East and Africa
were $568.5 in the third quarter of 2000 compared to $453.2 in the third quarter
of 1999, an increase of $115.3, or 25%. The increase is primarily due to strong
demand for the Company's storage products and services, which increased by 39%
compared to the third quarter of 1999. This growth was offset by decreased
revenues from AViiON products due to the closing of certain regional sales
offices acquired in connection with the acquisition of Data General in 1999.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $248.0 in
the third quarter of 2000 compared to $116.1 in the third quarter of 1999, an
increase of $131.9, or 114%. The increase was primarily due to the Company's
efforts to expand its business in this region combined with continued strong
demand for the Company's storage products and services, which increased by 130%
compared to the third quarter of 1999. This growth was offset in part by
decreased revenues from AViiON products due to the closing of certain regional
sales offices acquired in connection with the acquisition of Data General in
1999.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of Latin America were $55.0 in the third
quarter of 2000 compared to $41.7 in the third quarter of 1999, an increase of
$13.3, or 32%. The increase was primarily due to strong demand for the Company's
storage products and services, which increased by 62% compared to the third
quarter of 1999. This growth was offset by decreased revenues from AViiON
products due to the closing of certain regional sales offices acquired in
connection with the acquisition of Data General in 1999.

    GROSS MARGINS

    Overall gross margins increased to 57.7% of revenues in the third quarter of
2000, compared to 51.9% of revenues in the third quarter of 1999. Product gross
margins increased to 60.3% in the third quarter of 2000, compared to 54.4% in
the third quarter of 1999. This increase in product margins was primarily
attributable to increased licensing of the Company's enterprise software
products, which has higher gross margins than sales of the Company's hardware
products. Software revenue as a percentage of total revenues increased to 15% in
the third quarter of 2000 from 12% in the third quarter of 1999. Other factors
affecting product gross margins include the impact of component cost declines
being greater than the impact of product price declines. The Company currently
believes that product price declines will continue.

    Service gross margins increased to 34.2% in the third quarter of 2000,
compared to 30.9% in the third quarter of 1999. This increase in service margins
from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to a

                                       16
<PAGE>
decrease in less profitable service revenues for Data General products caused by
the closure of certain international sales offices.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $204.8 and $149.4 in the
third quarters of 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $55.4, or 37%. R&D
expenses were 9.0% and 8.7% of revenues in the third quarters of 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The increase in R&D spending levels from 1999 to 2000 reflects the
Company's ongoing research and development efforts in a variety of areas,
including EMC Enterprise Storage Network technologies, network attached storage
products, enhancements to the Symmetrix family of products, new enterprise
storage software products and fibre channel connectivity products. The Company
expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the balance of 2000
and thereafter.

    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

    Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $533.1 and $363.8
in the third quarters of 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $169.3, or
47%. SG&A expenses were 23.4% and 21.3% of revenues in the third quarters of
2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in spending levels was primarily due
to the Company's efforts to build an infrastructure to achieve broader coverage
and greater account depth around the world and to expand its technical sales
organization to support the current and expected growth in software revenues.

    INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE

    Investment income increased to $54.4 in the third quarter of 2000 from $34.4
in the third quarter of 1999. Interest income was earned primarily from
investments in cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. Investment
income increased in the third quarter of 2000 primarily due to higher cash and
investment balances which were derived from operations and the net proceeds from
McDATA's initial public offering.

    Interest expense decreased to $2.2 in the third quarter of 2000 from $7.9 in
the third quarter of 1999 primarily due to conversion of the Company's 3 1/4%
convertible subordinated notes due 2002 (the "3 1/4% Notes") in March 2000 and
the Company's 6% convertible subordinated notes due 2004 (the "6% Notes") in May
2000.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

    The provision for income taxes was $169.5 and $103.9 in the third quarters
of 2000 and 1999, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of 27.0%
and 26.0%, respectively. The effective tax rate is less than U.S. statutory
rates due to the Company's various tax strategies and benefits related to
offshore manufacturing.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2000 COMPARED TO FIRST NINE MONTHS
  OF 1999

    REVENUES

    Total revenues for the first nine months of 2000 were $6,251.5 compared to
$4,839.9 for the first nine months of 1999, representing an increase of
$1,411.6, or 29%.

    Enterprise storage hardware revenues were $3,922.5 in the first nine months
of 2000, compared to $2,860.2 in the first nine months of 1999, representing an
increase of $1,062.3, or 37%. The increase in enterprise systems revenues was
due to increased sales volume resulting from continued strong demand for the
Company's Symmetrix series of products and the successful introduction of new
hardware products. These products address the growing demand for enterprise-wide
storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and protect mission critical
information in UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe environments.

    Enterprise storage software revenues were $952.6 in the first nine months of
2000 compared to $540.7 in the first nine months of 1999, representing an
increase of $411.9, or 76%. The increase in software revenues was primarily due
to increased licenses of enterprise storage software on Symmetrix systems both
newly shipped and already installed, and the successful introduction of new and
enhanced software products.

    Revenues from enterprise switching products sold directly by McDATA
Holdings, including the ESCON Director series of products, were $110.0 in the
first nine months of 2000 compared to $109.1 in the first nine months of 1999,
representing an increase of $0.9, or 1%. The results reflect increased sales of
fibre channel-based directors offset by a decrease in ESCON revenues. The
Company anticipates that future revenues from ESCON directors will generally
decline.

    Revenues from the midrange line of storage products, including the CLARiiON
product line, were $397.5 in the first nine months of 2000, compared to $323.0
in the first nine months of 1999, excluding related service revenues. This
increase of $74.5, or 23%, reflects a significant increase in sales volume from
non-original equipment manufacturer sales channels offset in part by a decrease
in sales volume from indirect channels.

    Total storage product revenues were $5,382.5 in the first nine months of
2000, compared to $3,833.0 in the first nine months of 1999, representing an
increase of $1,549.5, or 40%. The increase is due primarily to increased sales
of enterprise storage hardware and software.

    Revenues from AViiON server products were $229.0 in the first nine months of
2000 compared to $475.4 in the first nine months of 1999, representing a
decrease of $246.4, or 52%. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of
reduced volume due to the refocusing of the AViiON business on the most
profitable product lines combined with the effect of closing certain
international sales offices. In addition, the Company is reallocating AViiON
resources within the consolidated Company.

    Overall service revenues were $640.0 in the first nine months of 2000
compared to $531.5 in the first nine months of 1999, an increase of $108.5, or
20%. Storage service revenues were $412.2 in the first nine months of 2000
compared to $251.9 in the first nine months of 1999, an increase of $160.3, or
64%. These increases are primarily related to increased maintenance revenues on
enterprise storage hardware and software products and increased revenues from
professional services. Server service revenues from the Company's Data General
division were $227.8 in the first nine months of 2000 compared to $279.6 in the
first nine months of 1999, a decrease of $51.8, or 19%. The decrease is
primarily due to the refocusing of the AViiON business combined with the effect
of closing certain international sales offices.

    Total revenues from storage products and services were $5,794.8 in the first
nine months of 2000, compared to $4,084.8 in the first nine months of 1999,
representing an increase of $1,710.0, or 42%.

                                       18

Total revenues from server products and services were $456.8 in the first nine
months of 2000, compared to $755.0 in the first nine months of 1999,
representing a decrease of $298.2, or 40%.

    Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $3,891.3 in the first
nine months of 2000 compared to $3,085.0 in the first nine months of 1999, an
increase of $806.3, or 26%. The revenue growth reflects strong demand for the
Company's storage products and services, which increased by 37% compared to the
first nine months of 1999. This growth was offset by a decrease in AViiON server
revenues due to the refocusing of the business on the most profitable product
lines.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, the Middle East and Africa
were $1,633.9 in the first nine months of 2000 compared to $1,330.7 in the first
nine months of 1999, an increase of $303.2, or 23%. The increase is primarily
due to strong demand for the Company's storage and switching products and
services, which increased by 35% compared to the first nine months of 1999. This
growth was offset by decreased revenues from AViiON products due to the closing
of certain regional sales offices acquired in connection with the acquisition of
Data General in 1999.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $592.4 in
the first nine months of 2000 compared to $309.9 in the first nine months of
1999, an increase of $282.5, or 91%. The increase was primarily due to the
Company's efforts to expand its business in this region combined with continued
strong demand for the Company's storage products and services, which increased
by 108% compared to the first nine months of 1999. This growth was offset by
decreased revenues from AViiON products due to the closing of certain regional
sales offices acquired in connection with the acquisition of Data General in
1999.

    Revenues on sales into the markets of Latin America were $133.9 in the first
nine months of 2000 compared to $114.3 in the first nine months of 1999, an
increase of $19.6, or 17%. The increase was primarily due to increased sales of
the Company's storage products and services, which increased by 49% compared to
the first nine months of 1999. This growth was offset by decreased revenues from
AViiON products due to the closing of certain regional offices acquired in
connection with the acquisition of Data General in 1999.

    GROSS MARGINS

    Overall gross margins increased to 57.4% of revenues in the first nine
months of 2000, compared to 50.4% of revenues in the first nine months of 1999.
Product gross margins increased to 60.4% in the first nine months of 2000,
compared to 52.7% in the first nine months of 1999. This increase in product
margins is primarily attributable to increased licensing of the Company's
enterprise software products, which has higher gross margins than sales of the
Company's hardware products. Software revenue as a percentage of total revenues
increased to 15% in the first nine months of 2000 from 11% in the first nine
months of 1999. Other factors affecting product gross margins include the impact
of component cost declines being greater than the impact of product price
declines. The Company currently believes that product price declines will
continue.

    Service gross margins decreased to 31.4% in the first nine months of 2000,
compared to 31.5% in the first nine months of 1999.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $560.9 and $418.5 in the
first nine months of 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of $142.4, or 34%.
R&D expenses were 9.0% and 8.6% of revenues in the first nine months of 2000 and
1999, respectively. The increase in R&D spending levels from 1999 to 2000
reflects the Company's ongoing research and development efforts in a variety of
areas, including EMC Enterprise Storage Network technologies, network attached
storage products,

                                       19
<PAGE>
enhancements to the Symmetrix family of products, new enterprise storage
software products and fibre channel connectivity products. The Company expects
to continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the balance of 2000 and
thereafter.

    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

    Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $1,487.4 and
$1,010.7 in the first nine months of 2000 and 1999, respectively, an increase of
$476.7, or 47%. SG&A expenses were 23.8% and 20.9% of revenues in the first nine
months of 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in spending levels from 1999
to 2000 is primarily due to the Company's efforts to build an infrastructure to
achieve broader coverage and greater account depth around the world and to
expand its technical sales organization to support the current and expected
growth in software revenues.

    INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE

    Investment income increased to $143.1 in the first nine months of 2000 from
$92.5 in the first nine months of 1999. Interest income was earned primarily
from investments in cash equivalents and short and long-term investments.
Investment income increased in the first nine months of 2000 primarily due to
higher cash and investment balances which were derived from operations and the
net proceeds from McDATA's initial public offering.

    Interest expense decreased to $12.0 in the first nine months of 2000 from
$24.8 in the first nine months of 1999 primarily due to conversion of the
Company's 3 1/4% Notes during March 2000 and the Company's 6% Notes during May
2000.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

    The provision for income taxes was $450.9 and $274.8 in the first nine
months of 2000 and 1999, respectively, which resulted in effective tax rates of
27.0% and 25.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate is less than U.S.
statutory rates due to the Company's various tax strategies and benefits related
to offshore manufacturing.

    RESTRUCTURING, MERGER AND OTHER CHARGES

    During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company approved and implemented a
restructuring program in connection with its acquisition of Data General. The
restructuring plan, which is expected to be substantially completed by December
2000, provides for the consolidation of the Company's operations and elimination
of duplicative facilities worldwide. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of
1999, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $170.6 related to employee
termination benefits, facility closure costs, asset disposals, and other exit
costs which the Company has recorded in operating expenses. The total cash
impact of the charge is approximately $140.7, of which $52.4 was paid in 1999
and $55.3 has been paid during the first nine months of 2000.

    The restructuring plan includes a net reduction of the workforce by
approximately 1,100 employees, approximately 59% of whom are or were based in
North America and 23% of whom are or were based in Europe. The employee
separations affect the majority of business functions and job classes. As of
September 30, 2000, employee separations due to restructuring actions totaled
approximately 1,050.

a restructuring program. The charge included employee termination benefits,
asset write-downs, and other exit costs. The total cash impact of the
restructuring charge is approximately $58.5, of which $46.0 was paid prior to
December 31, 1999 and $1.8 was paid during the first nine months of 2000. As of
September 30,

    FINANCIAL CONDITION

    Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $4,446.7
and $3,173.7 at September 30, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively, an
increase of $1,273.0. Cash provided by operating activities for the first nine
months of 2000 was $1,603.4, generated primarily from net income. Cash used by
investing activities was $1,021.5, principally from the acquisition of
Softworks, Inc. and additions to property, plant and equipment. Cash provided by
financing activities was $553.0, principally from the issuance of stock in
McDATA's initial public offering and from stock option exercises.

    In March 1997, the Company sold $517.5 of the 3 1/4% Notes. In March 2000,
all of the outstanding 3 1/4% Notes were converted into Common Stock. In May
1997, Data General sold $212.8 of the 6% Notes, which were assumed by the
Company in connection with the acquisition of Data General in 1999. In May 2000,
$212.6 of the 6% Notes were converted into Common Stock. The Company paid
approximately one hundred fifty-five thousand dollars to redeem the remaining 6%
Notes.

    At September 30, 2000, the Company had available for use its credit line of
$50.0 and may elect to borrow at any time. Based on its current operating and
capital expenditure forecasts, the Company believes that the combination of
funds currently available, funds generated from operations and its available
line of credit will be adequate to finance its ongoing operations.

    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,"
subsequently updated by SAB 101A and SAB 101B ("SAB 101"). SAB 101 summarizes
certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles
to revenue recognition in financial statements. The Company is required to adopt
SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of SAB 101 will have a material impact on its results
of operations or financial position.

    In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation--an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44
clarifies the application of APB Opinion No. 25 and among other issues clarifies
the following: the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB
Opinion No. 25, the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequence of various modifications to the
terms of previously fixed stock options or awards, and the accounting for an
exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 was
effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in FIN 44 cover specific events
that occurred after either December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The Company
adopted FIN 44 for the third quarter of 2000 and there was no material impact on
the Company's results of operations or financial position for such quarter.

                                       21
<PAGE>
    In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities--an amendment of FAS 133" ("FAS
138"). This statement amends the accounting and reporting standards for certain
derivative instruments and hedging activities. For an entity that has adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 prior to June 15, 2000, FAS
138 is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after June 15, 2000. The
Company adopted FAS 138 for the third quarter of 2000 and there was no material
impact on its results of operations or financial position for such quarter.

    FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
