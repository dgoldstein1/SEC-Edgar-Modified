4.  LITIGATION

  In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit against
the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California alleging that the Company was infringing a patent covering virtual
tape and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions and unspecified damages.
The Company's response raised as an affirmative defense that EMC was licensed to
promote the use of, market, sell and make virtual tape products pursuant to a
patent license agreement between EMC and STK dated April 11, 1996 (the "License
Agreement").  After a trial held in August 1998, the court ruled that EMC is
licensed to promote the use of, market, sell and make virtual tape products
pursuant to the License Agreement.  The Court found that STK's suit was without
foundation and awarded costs to EMC. In October 1998, STK filed an appeal of the
Court's ruling.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Court affirmed the lower
court's ruling in July 1999.

   The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine and
incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of
these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.


5.  ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133").  SFAS 133 is effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  SFAS 133
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at
their fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each
period in either current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive
income/(expense), depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a
hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.  For fair-value
hedge transactions in which the Company is hedging changes in fair value of an
asset, liability or firm commitment, changes in the fair value of the derivative
instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by changes in the
fair value of the hedged item.  For cash-flow hedge transactions, in which the
Company is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable rate
asset, liability or a forecasted transaction, changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income/(expense).  The gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense) will be
reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the
variability of the cash flows of the hedged item.  The ineffective portion of
all hedges will be recognized in current earnings.

   The Company adopted SFAS 133 on January 1, 1999.  As a result of this
adoption, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Company uses derivatives to hedge foreign currency cash flows on a
continuing basis for periods consistent with its net asset and forecasted
exposures. Since the Company is using foreign exchange derivative contracts to
hedge foreign exchange exposures, the changes in the value of the derivatives
are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of
the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the derivatives is recognized in
current earnings, which represented an immaterial amount in the second quarter
of 1999.  The ineffective portion of the derivatives is primarily related to
option premiums and discounts or premiums on forward contracts.  All derivative
contracts generally mature within six months.

        NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

               (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)


   The Company hedges its net asset (balance sheet) position with forward
exchange contracts.  Since these derivatives hedge existing net assets that are
denominated in foreign currencies, the contracts do not qualify for hedge
accounting under SFAS 133.  The changes in fair value from these contracts as
well as the underlying exposures are generally offsetting, and are recorded in
other income/(expense) on the income statement.

   The Company uses forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of
its forecasted transactions.  These derivatives are designated as cash-flow
hedges, and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(expense) until the underlying forecasted transaction
occurs. Once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized, the appropriate
gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense) to the income
statement, in revenue and expense, as appropriate.  In the event the underlying
forecasted transaction does not occur, the amount recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(expense) will be reclassified to the other
income/(expense) line of the income statement in the then-current period.

   As a result of adoption of SFAS 133, the Company recorded an unrealized loss
of $340 in accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense) to recognize the
fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as cash-flow hedging
instruments.  In addition, net realized losses of $2,720 from derivatives
designated as cash-flow hedging instruments have been recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(expense).  The Company recorded in revenue and
expense as appropriate, approximately $702 in net gains from cash flow hedges
related to items forecasted for the second quarter of 1999 and approximately
$4,152 in net gains from cash flow hedges related to items forecasted for the
six months ended June 30, 1999.  The amount that will be reclassified from other
accumulated comprehensive income/(expense) to earnings over the next twelve
months is a charge of approximately $1,090, net of tax.  The Company did not
record any cumulative adjustment to earnings from derivatives designated as fair
value hedges, as these hedges were previously carried at fair value, with all
changes in fair value recorded to the income statement.

   As permitted with the adoption of SFAS 133, the Company also reclassified
$602,575 of held-to-maturity securities as "available for sale."  This
reclassification resulted in an immaterial adjustment recorded to accumulated
other comprehensive income/(expense) to reflect the difference between the
carrying cost and market value of these securities.  The net unrealized loss on
available for sale securities at June 30, 1999 was $10,880, net of tax.

7.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

  On August 9, 1999, EMC announced that it would acquire Data General
Corporation in a transaction intended to be accounted for as a pooling-of-
interests.  Under the terms of the agreement, EMC will issue 0.3262 of a share
of EMC common stock for each share of Data General common stock, subject to
certain adjustments.  The transaction is valued at approximately $19.58 per Data
General share, for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, based
upon the closing price per share of EMC common stock on August 6, 1999.
Completion of the transaction is subject to approval of Data General
stockholders and appropriate regulatory review, and is expected to occur before
the end of 1999.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


     This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
     Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with "Factors That May
     Affect Future Results" set forth on page 17 and in EMC's other filings with
     the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


ALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THIS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE IN MILLIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SECOND QUARTER OF 1999 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF
1998

 Revenues

  Total revenues for the second quarter of 1999 were $1,291.8 compared to $952.0
for the second quarter of 1998, an increase of $339.8 or 36%.

  Enterprise systems revenues from products sold directly and through resellers
and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") were $985.5 in the second quarter
of 1999, compared to $765.8 in the second quarter of 1998, an increase of $219.7
or 29%.  The increase was due to continued strong demand for the Company's
Symmetrix series of products.  These products address the growing demand for
enterprise-wide storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and protect
mission critical information in UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe environments.

  Enterprise software revenues from products sold directly and through resellers
and OEMs were $178.6 in the second quarter of 1999 compared to $97.9 in the
second quarter of 1998, an increase of $80.7 or 83%.  The increase in software
revenues was primarily due to increased licenses of enterprise storage software
on Symmetrix systems, both newly shipped and already installed, and the
successful introduction of new and enhanced software products.

  Revenues from products sold by McDATA Corporation, primarily the ESCON
Director series of products, were $45.8 in the second quarter of 1999, compared
to $55.1 in the second quarter of 1998, a decrease of $9.3 or 17%, due primarily
to the product transition from ESCON-based to fibre-channel-based directors.

  Service and rental revenues were $81.9 in the second quarter of 1999, compared
to $33.2 in the second quarter of 1998, an increase of $48.7 or 147%, primarily
as a result of the growth of EMC professional services and maintenance revenue.

  Revenues under the Company's reseller agreement with Hewlett-Packard Company
("HP") were $72.2 and $186.2, or 6% and 20% of total revenues, for the second
quarter of 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The Company and HP agreed to terminate
this contract effective as of June 30, 1999.

  Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $814.6 in the second
quarter of 1999 compared to $577.2 in the second quarter of 1998, an increase of
$237.4 or 41%.  The revenue growth reflects continued strong demand for the
Company's products and services.

  Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, the Middle East and Africa were
$355.5 in the second quarter of 1999 compared to $295.3 in the second quarter of
1998, an increase of $60.2 or 20%.

  Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $86.1 in
the second quarter of 1999 compared to $71.1 in the second quarter of 1998, an
increase of $15.0 or 21%.

  Revenues on sales into the markets of Latin America were $35.6 in the second
quarter of 1999 compared to $8.5 in the second quarter of 1998, an increase of
$27.1 or 320%.  The increase was primarily due to the Company's efforts to
expand its business in this region.

                                       12
<PAGE>

 Gross Margins

  Gross margins increased to 55.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 1999,
compared to 50.9% of revenues in the second quarter of 1998.  This increase is
primarily attributable to increased licensing of the Company's enterprise
software, which has higher gross margins than sales of enterprise systems.
Other factors contributing to the increase include a larger percentage of direct
sales, a trend towards larger configurations of enterprise systems, and the
impact of component cost declines being greater than the impact of product price
declines. The Company currently believes that product price declines will
continue.

 Research and Development

  Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $110.9 and $74.2 in the second
quarters of 1999 and 1998, respectively, an increase of $36.7 or 49%.  R&D
expenses were 8.6% and 7.8% of revenues in the second quarters of 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  The increase reflects the Company's ongoing research and
development efforts in a variety of areas, including EMC Enterprise Storage
Network technologies, enhancements to the Symmetrix family of products, new and
enhanced enterprise storage software products and fibre channel connectivity.
The Company expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the
balance of 1999 and thereafter.

 Selling, General and Administrative

  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $245.1 and $177.4
in the second quarters of 1999 and 1998, respectively, an increase of $67.7 or
38%. SG&A expenses were 19.0% and 18.6% of revenues in the second quarters of
1999 and 1998, respectively.  This increase primarily reflects the Company's
objective of building an infrastructure to achieve broader coverage and greater
account depth around the world and to expand its technical sales organization to
support the current and expected growth in software revenues.

 Investment Income and Interest Expense

  Investment income was $26.9 in the second quarter of 1999 compared with $24.0
in the second quarter of 1998.  Interest income was earned from investments in
cash equivalents and short and long-term investments.  Investment income
increased in the second quarter of 1999 primarily due to higher cash and
investment balances which were derived from operations.

  Interest expense decreased to $4.7 in the second quarter of 1999 from $5.0 in
the second quarter of 1998.

 Provision for Income Taxes

  The provision for income taxes was $96.3 and $63.2 in the second quarters of
1999 and 1998, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.0% in
each period.  The effective tax rate is mainly attributable to the realization
of benefits associated with the Company's various tax strategies and benefits
related to offshore manufacturing.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1999 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF
1998

 Revenues

  Total revenues for the first six months of 1999 were $2,419.8 compared to
$1,780.4 for the first six months of 1998, an increase of $639.4 or 36%.

  Enterprise systems revenues from products sold directly and through resellers
and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") were $1,846.6 in the first six
months of 1999, compared to $1,464.6 in the first six months of 1998, an
increase of $382.0 or 26%.  The increase was due to continued strong demand for
the Company's Symmetrix series of products.  These products address the growing
demand for enterprise-wide storage solutions, allowing users to move, store and
protect mission critical information in UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe
environments.

  Enterprise software revenues from products sold directly and through resellers
and OEMs were $334.1 in the first six months of 1999 compared to $163.9 in the
first six months of 1998, an increase of $170.2 or 104%.  The increase in
software revenues was primarily due to increased licenses of enterprise storage
software on Symmetrix systems, both newly shipped and already installed, and the
successful introduction of new and enhanced software products.

  Revenues from products sold by McDATA Corporation, primarily the ESCON
Director series of products, were $84.8 in the first six months of 1999,
compared to $96.3 in the first six months of 1998, a decrease of $11.5 or 12%,
due primarily to the product transition from ESCON-based to fibre-channel-based
directors.

  Service and rental revenues were $154.3 in the first six months of 1999,
compared to $55.6 in the first six months of 1998, an increase of $98.7 or 177%,
primarily as a result of the growth of EMC professional services and maintenance
revenues.

  Revenues under the Company's reseller agreement with HP were $219.0 and
$343.0, or 9% and 19% of total revenues, for the first six months of 1999 and
1998, respectively.  The Company and HP agreed to terminate this contract
effective as of June 30, 1999.

  In March 1999, the Company announced a five-year strategic technology and
business alliance with IBM.  Under the terms of the accord, the Company will
continue to purchase IBM disk drives for incorporation into EMC's Symmetrix
Enterprise Storage systems.  The alliance also provides for a broad patent
cross-license between the two companies for storage and other technologies.

  Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $1,518.6 in the first
six months of 1999 compared to $1,058.9 in the first six months of 1998, an
increase of $459.7 or 43%.  The revenue growth reflects continued strong demand
for the Company's products and services.

  Revenues on sales into the markets of Europe, the Middle East and Africa were
$695.1 in the first six months of 1999 compared to $557.4 in the first six
months of 1998, an increase of $137.7 or 25%.

  Revenues on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific region were $154.0 in
the first six months of 1999 compared to $148.1 in the first six months of 1998,
an increase of $5.9 or 4%.

  Revenues on sales into the markets of Latin America were $52.1 in the first
six months of 1999 compared to $16.0 in the first six months of 1998, an
increase of $36.1 or 226%.  The increase was primarily due to the Company's
efforts to expand its business in this region.

Gross Margins

  Gross margins increased to 54.6% of revenues in the first six months of 1999,
compared to 49.5% of revenues in the first six months of 1998.  This increase is
primarily attributable to increased licensing of the Company's enterprise
software, which has higher gross margins than sales of enterprise systems.
Other factors contributing to the increase include a larger percentage of direct
sales, a trend towards larger configurations of enterprise systems, and the
impact of component cost declines being greater than the impact of product price
declines. The Company currently believes that product price declines will
continue.


Research and Development

  Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $211.6 and $139.9 in the first
six months of 1999 and 1998, respectively, an increase of $71.7 or 51%.  R&D
expenses were 8.7% and 7.9% of revenues in the first six months of 1999 and
1998, respectively.  The increase reflects the Company's ongoing research and
development efforts in a variety of areas, including EMC Enterprise Storage
Network technologies, enhancements to the Symmetrix family of products, new and
enhanced enterprise storage software products and fibre channel connectivity.
The Company expects to continue to spend substantial amounts for R&D for the
balance of 1999 and thereafter.

 Selling, General and Administrative

  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $469.7 and $330.8
in the first six months of 1999 and 1998, respectively, an increase of $138.9 or
42%. SG&A expenses were 19.4% and 18.6% of revenues in the first six months of
1999 and 1998, respectively.  This increase primarily reflects the Company's
objective of building an infrastructure to achieve broader coverage and greater
account depth around the world and to expand its technical sales organization to
support the current and expected growth in software revenues.

 Investment Income and Interest Expense

  Investment income was $52.5 in the first six months of 1999 compared with
$46.5 in the first six months of 1998.  Interest income was earned from
investments in cash equivalents and short and long-term investments.  Investment
income increased in the first six months of 1999 primarily due to higher cash
and investment balances which were derived from operations.

  Interest expense increased to $9.9 in the first six months of 1999 from $9.7
in the first six months of 1998.

 Provision for Income Taxes

  The provision for income taxes was $169.9 and $111.9 in the first six months
of 1999 and 1998, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.0%
in each period.  The effective tax rate is mainly attributable to the
realization of benefits associated with the Company's various tax strategies and
benefits related to offshore manufacturing.

Financial Condition

  Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $2,440.0
and $2,092.8 at June 30, 1999 and December 31, 1998, respectively, an increase
of $347.2.  Cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of
1999 was $568.5, generated primarily from net income.  Cash used by investing
activities was $598.4, principally from the purchases of short and long-term
investments and additions to property, plant and equipment.  Cash used by
financing activities was $10.2, principally from payments of short and long-term
obligations offset by the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises.

  At June 30, 1999, the Company had available for use its credit line of $50.0
and may elect to borrow at any time.  Based on its current operating and capital
expenditure forecasts, the Company believes that the combination of funds
currently available, funds generated from operations and its available line of
credit will be adequate to finance its ongoing operations.

 Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement

   In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS 133.  SFAS 133 is effective for all fiscal
quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  SFAS 133 requires
that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair
value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in
either current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense),
depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction
and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.  For fair-value hedge transactions
in which the Company is hedging changes in fair value of an asset, liability or
firm commitment, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will
generally be offset in the income statement by changes in the fair value of the
hedged item.  For cash-flow hedge transactions, in which the Company is hedging
the variability of cash flows related to a variable rate asset, liability or a
forecasted transaction, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument
will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense).  The gains
and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(expense) will be reclassified as earnings in the periods
in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the
hedged item.  The ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in
current earnings.  The Company adopted SFAS 133 on January 1, 1999.  (See Note 5
to the Company's Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.)


 Year 2000 Issues

  The information provided below constitutes a "Year 2000 Readiness
Disclosure" under the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.

  Certain computer hardware and software is unable to appropriately interpret
the upcoming calendar year 2000. These systems and software refer to years in
terms of their final two digits only and may interpret the year 2000 as the year
1900 in error.  Therefore, they will need to be modified prior to the year 2000
in order to remain functional.  The Company has established a Year 2000 program
that involves assessing the Company's key hardware and software, assessing Year
2000 compliance by third parties with which the Company has a material
relationship, assessing Year 2000 compliance of the Company's products, and
modifying and testing hardware and software in the Company's internal systems
and products, where necessary.

  The Company has completed an assessment of the hardware and software in its
core business information systems and has substantially completed the necessary
modifications.  The Company has also completed an assessment of the hardware and
software in other information systems used in its operations and has
substantially completed the necessary modifications.  In addition, the Company
has completed an assessment of the hardware and software used in its business
that is not supported by the Company's information system department.  The
necessary modifications have been substantially completed for such hardware and
software.

  The Company has contacted key vendors and suppliers and other third parties
whose systems failures could potentially have a significant impact on the
Company's operations.  The Company has received certifications of Year 2000
compliance from substantially all of its key vendors and suppliers.  The Company
continues to make progress in receiving certifications of Year 2000 compliance
from other vendors and suppliers and in assessing questionnaire responses and
related information from other third parties.

  The Company has designed and tested the current versions of its Symmetrix
series of products and the current versions of its other products to be Year
2000 compliant.  Some of the Company's customers are running earlier versions of
its Symmetrix series of products and other products that have not been tested
for Year 2000 compliance.  The Company has made upgrades available for the older
versions of its Symmetrix series of products and for certain other of its older
products so that such products will test as Year 2000 compliant.

  The Company believes the assessment and remediation phases of its Year 2000
conversion program is substantially complete, although the testing phase and the
contingency planning phase will continue extensively throughout 1999.  The total
cost of such program has not had, and the Company does not anticipate that the
total cost of such program will have, a material effect on its business, results
of operations or financial condition.

  The most reasonably likely worst case scenarios regarding the Year 2000 issue
would include a hardware failure, the corruption or loss of data contained in
the Company's internal information systems, a failure affecting the Company's
key vendors, suppliers or customers, the failure of infrastructure services
provided by government agencies or other third parties, and customer
dissatisfaction related to the performance of the Company's products.

                                       16
<PAGE>

  The Company is currently developing a Year 2000 contingency plan.  The Company
expects its contingency plan will include, among other things, manual "work-
arounds" for hardware and software failures, as well as substitution of
systems, if required.

  Further information about the Company's Year 2000 readiness is available at
the Company's website at http://www.emc.com/year2000/.

  There can be no assurance that conversion of the Company's hardware and
software will be successful, that key third parties will have successful
conversion programs, that the Company's products do not contain undetected
errors or defects associated with Year 2000 date functions, or that other
factors relating to Year 2000 compliance, including but not limited to
litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.

 Euro Conversion

  On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European
Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign
currencies and the Euro.  The Euro is currently the common legal currency in
such countries. The Euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non-
cash transactions.  The participating countries are issuing sovereign debt
exclusively in Euros, and have redenominated outstanding sovereign debt.  The
participating countries no longer control their own monetary policies by
directing independent interest rates for the legacy currencies.  Instead, the
authority to direct monetary policy, including money supply and official
interest rates for the Euro, is exercised by the European Central Bank.

  The legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries
as denominations of the Euro between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002 (the
"transition period").  During the transition period, public and private
parties may pay for goods and services using either the Euro or the
participating country's legacy currency on a "no compulsion, no prohibition"
basis.  However, conversion rates are no longer computed directly from one
legacy currency to another. Instead, a triangular process is applied whereby an
amount denominated in one legacy currency is first converted into the Euro.  The
resultant Euro-denominated amount is then converted into the third legacy
currency.

  The Company has developed and implemented the necessary modifications for the
technical adaptation of its internal IT and other systems to accommodate Euro-
denominated transactions.  The Company is continuing to assess certain business
implications of conversion to the Euro, including the long term competitive
implications of the conversion and the impact on market risk with respect to
financial instruments.  Management is also continuing to evaluate other impacts
of this conversion on the Company, including the potential actions which may or
may not be taken by the Company's competitors and suppliers.

 Factors That May Affect Future Results

  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements as
defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of
certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) component quality and
availability; (ii) delays in the development of new technology and the
transition to new products; (iii) competitive factors, including but not limited
to pricing pressures, in the computer storage market; (iv) the relative and
varying rates of product price and component cost declines; (v) economic trends
in various geographic markets and fluctuating currency exchange rates; (vi)
deterioration or termination of the agreements with certain of the Company's
resellers or OEMs; (vii) the uneven pattern of quarterly sales; (viii) risks
associated with acquisitions; (ix) Year 2000 issues; and (x) other one-time
events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in
EMC's other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

                                    PART II.
                               OTHER INFORMATION


ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation ("STK") filed suit against
the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California alleging that the Company was infringing a patent covering virtual
tape and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions and unspecified damages.
The Company's response raised as an affirmative defense that EMC was licensed to
promote the use of, market, sell and make virtual tape products pursuant to a
patent license agreement between EMC and STK dated April 11, 1996 (the "License
Agreement").  After a trial held in August 1998, the court ruled that EMC is
licensed to promote the use of, market, sell and make virtual tape products
pursuant to the License Agreement.  The Court found that STK's suit was without
foundation and awarded costs to EMC. In October 1998, STK filed an appeal of the
Court's ruling.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Court affirmed the lower
court's ruling in July 1999.

  The Company is a party to other litigation which it considers routine and
incidental to its business. Management does not expect the results of any of
these actions to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.


ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

  The Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on May 5, 1999. There was no
solicitation in opposition to management's nominees as listed in the Company's
proxy statement and all such nominees were elected as Class III directors for a
three-year term. In addition, the stockholders approved an amendment to the
Corporation's Articles of Organization to increase the number of shares of
authorized common stock to 3,000,000,000 shares, an amendment to the Company's
1993 Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares available for grant
under the plan by 8,500,000, and an amendment to the Company's 1989 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares available for purchase
under the plan by 2,200,000. The results of the votes for each of these
proposals were as follows:

1. Election of Class III Directors:
