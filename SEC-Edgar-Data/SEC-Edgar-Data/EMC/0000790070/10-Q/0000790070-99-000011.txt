 Accounting

     The   accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements   are
unaudited  and  have  been prepared in accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles.  These  statements  include  the
accounts  of  EMC  and its subsidiaries.  Certain information  and
footnote  disclosures  normally included in the  Company's  annual
consolidated financial statements have been condensed or  omitted.
The  interim consolidated financial statements, in the opinion  of
management,  reflect all adjustments (consisting  only  of  normal
recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of the  results
for the interim periods ended March 31, 1999 and 1998.

    The  results  of  operations for the interim periods  are  not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected
for  the  entire fiscal year.  It is suggested that these  interim
consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with  the
audited  consolidated  financial statements  for  the  year  ended
December  31,  1998, which are contained in the  Company's  Annual
Report  on  Form  10-K  filed  with the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission on March 11, 1999.

4.  Litigation

  In December 1997, NewFrame Corporation Ltd. (''NewFrame'') filed
suit  against the Company in the United States District Court  for
the  District  of Massachusetts.  The suit contains a  variety  of
allegations  relating to the Company's use of NewFrame's  software
developments,  including various contract  claims  and  breach  of
fiduciary  duty, and seeks monetary damages relating primarily  to
lost  future  profits.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss  the
complaint,  which  was  granted in part.  The  parties  reached  a
negotiated resolution of this matter in April 1999.

   In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation (''STK'') filed
suit  against the Company in the United States District Court  for
the  Northern District of California alleging that the Company was
infringing  a patent covering virtual tape and seeking preliminary
and  permanent injunctions and unspecified damages. The  Company's
response raised as an affirmative defense that EMC was licensed to
promote  the  use of, market, sell and make virtual tape  products
pursuant  to a patent license agreement between EMC and STK  dated
April 11, 1996 (the ''License Agreement''). After a trial held  in
August  1998, the court ruled that EMC is licensed to promote  the
use  of,  market, sell and make virtual tape products pursuant  to
the License Agreement. The Court found that STK's suit was without
foundation and awarded costs to EMC. In October 1998, STK filed an
appeal of the Court's ruling.

   The  Company is a party to other litigation which it  considers
routine and incidental to its business. Management does not expect
the  results  of  any of these actions to have a material  adverse
effect  on  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  or
financial condition.

5.  Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement

     In  June  1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
(''FASB'') issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  No.
133,   "Accounting   for   Derivative  Instruments   and   Hedging
Activities"  ("SFAS 133").  SFAS 133 is effective for  all  fiscal
quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.   SFAS
133  requires that all derivative instruments be recorded  on  the
balance  sheet at their fair value.  Changes in the fair value  of
derivatives are recorded each period in either current earnings or
accumulated  other  comprehensive income/(expense),  depending  on
whether  a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction
and,  if  it  is,  the type of hedge transaction.  For  fair-value
hedge transactions in which the Company is hedging changes in fair
value  of an asset, liability or firm commitment, changes  in  the
fair  value of the derivative instrument will generally be  offset
in the income statement by changes in the fair value of the hedged
item.   For cash-flow hedge transactions, in which the Company  is
hedging  the variability of cash flows related to a variable  rate
asset, liability or a forecasted transaction, changes in the  fair
value of the derivative instrument will be reported in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(expense).  The gains and losses on the
derivative  instrument  that  are reported  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(expense) will be reclassified as earnings in
the  periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability  of
the cash flows of the hedged item.  The ineffective portion of all
hedges will be recognized in current earnings.

    The  Company adopted SFAS 133 on January 1, 1999.  As a result
of  this  adoption, all derivatives are recognized on the  balance
sheet  at  fair  value.   The Company uses  derivatives  to  hedge
foreign  currency  cash flows on a continuing  basis  for  periods
consistent with its net asset and forecasted exposures. Since  the
Company  is using foreign exchange derivative contracts  to  hedge
foreign  exchange  exposures, the changes  in  the  value  of  the
derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair
value or cash flows of the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of
the   derivatives   is  recognized  in  current  earnings,   which
represented  an  immaterial amount in the first quarter  of  1999.
The ineffective portion of the derivatives is primarily related to
option  premiums  and discounts or premiums on forward  contracts.
All derivative contracts generally mature within six months.

    The Company hedges its net asset (balance sheet) position with
forward   exchange  contracts.   Since  these  derivatives   hedge
existing  net  assets that are denominated in foreign  currencies,
the  contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133.
The  changes  in fair value from these contracts as  well  as  the
underlying exposures are generally offsetting, and are recorded in
other income/expense on the income statement.

   The Company uses forward exchange and option contracts to hedge
a  portion of its forecasted transactions.  These derivatives  are
designated  as cash-flow hedges, and changes in their  fair  value
are  carried  in  accumulated other comprehensive income/(expense)
until  the  underlying  forecasted transaction  occurs.  Once  the
underlying  forecasted  transaction is realized,  the  appropriate
gain  or  loss  from the derivative designated as a hedge  of  the
transaction  is reclassified from accumulated other  comprehensive
income/(expense) to the income statement, in revenue and  expense,
as   appropriate.    In   the  event  the  underlying   forecasted
transaction  does  not occur, the amount recorded  in  accumulated
other  comprehensive income/(expense) will be reclassified to  the
other  income/expense line of the income statement  in  the  then-
current period.

    As  a result of adoption of SFAS 133, the Company recorded  an
unrealized   gain  of  $340  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(expense)  to  recognize  the  fair  value  of   derivative
instruments  that are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments.
In  addition,  net  realized  losses of  $2,720  from  derivatives
designated as cash-flow hedging instruments have been recorded  in
accumulated  other  comprehensive income/(expense).   The  Company
recorded  in  revenue  and  expense as appropriate,  approximately
$3,450  in  net  gains  from cash flow  hedges  related  to  items
forecasted for the first quarter of 1999.  The amount that will be
reclassified from other accumulated comprehensive income/(expense)
to   earnings  over  the  next  twelve  months  is  a  charge   of
approximately  $2,380.  The Company did not record any  cumulative
adjustment  to earnings from derivatives designated as fair  value
hedges,  as  these hedges were previously carried at  fair  value,
with all changes in fair value recorded to the income statement.

    As  permitted with the adoption of SFAS133, the  Company  also
reclassified $602,575 of held-to-maturity securities as "available
for  sale."   This  reclassification  resulted  in  an  immaterial
adjustment    recorded   to   accumulated   other    comprehensive
income/(expense)  to reflect the difference between  the  carrying
cost  and  market value of these securities.  The  net  unrealized
loss  on  available  for sale securities at  March  31,  1999  was
$2,705.

        (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)


  The  Company's  Board of Directors approved a two-for-one  stock
split  in the form of a 100% stock dividend on February 24,  1999.
Implementation  of  the  stock split was  subject  to  stockholder
approval  of  an  increase in the number of shares  of  authorized
common  stock to 3,000,000,000 shares, which approval was received
at  the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  The stock split
will be payable on or about May 28, 1999 to stockholders of record
as  of the close of business on May 14, 1999.  Because stockholder
approval  was pending as of the end of the first quarter of  1999,
financial information contained elsewhere in this document has not
been adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.
  
  Earnings  per share amounts, after giving retroactive effect  to
the  two-for-one stock split, are presented below for all  of  the
per  share amounts disclosed in the financial statements  and  the
notes to the financial statements.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and  Results  of  Operations should be read  in  conjunction  with
''Factors  That May Affect Future Results'' set forth on  page  16
and  in  EMC's other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.

All  dollar  amounts in this Management's Discussion and  Analysis
are in millions.

Results of Operations - First Quarter of 1999 compared to First
Quarter of 1998

 Revenues

   Total  revenues  for the first quarter of  1999  were  $1,128.0
compared  to $828.4 for the first quarter of 1998, an increase  of
$299.6 or 36%.

   Enterprise  systems revenues from products  sold  directly  and
through  resellers  and original equipment manufacturers  ("OEMs")
were  $861.1 in the first quarter of 1999, compared to  $698.8  in
the  first  quarter of 1998, an increase of $162.3  or  23%.   The
increase  was  due  to continued strong demand for  the  Company's
Symmetrix series of products.  These products address the  growing
demand  for enterprise-wide storage solutions, allowing  users  to
move,  store  and  protect mission critical information  in  UNIX,
Windows NT and mainframe environments.

   Enterprise  software revenues from products sold  directly  and
through  resellers and OEMs were $155.4 in the  first  quarter  of
1999  compared to $66.0 in the first quarter of 1998, an  increase
of $89.4 or 136%.  The increase in software revenues was primarily
due  to  increased  licenses  of enterprise  storage  software  on
Symmetrix  systems both newly shipped and already  installed,  and
the successful introduction of new and enhanced software products.

  Revenues from products sold by McDATA Corporation, primarily the
ESCON Director series of products, were $39.0 in the first quarter
of  1999,  compared  to  $41.2 in the first  quarter  of  1998,  a
decrease  of  $2.2 or 5%, due primarily to the product  transition
from ESCON-based to fibre-channel-based directors.

   Service and rental revenues were $72.4 in the first quarter  of
1999,  compared to $22.4 in the first quarter of 1998, an increase
of  $50.0  or  223%, primarily as a result of the  growth  of  EMC
professional  services  and  the revenues  from  the  professional
services  businesses Groupe MCI and Millennia III, Inc.,  acquired
during the second and third quarters of 1998.
                                 
   In  January 1999, EMC and HP extended their worldwide  reseller
agreement  for another three years.  Revenues under this agreement
were $146.7 and $156.8, or 13% and 19% of total revenues, for  the
first quarters of 1999 and 1998, respectively.  On May 5, 1999, HP
announced  that  it  had  entered into joint  technology  and  OEM
agreements with Hitachi, Limited and Hitachi Data Systems for high-
end enterprise storage systems.

   In  March  1999,  the  Company announced a five-year  strategic
technology and business alliance with IBM.  Under the terms of the
accord, the Company will continue to purchase IBM disk drives  for
incorporation  into  EMC's Symmetrix Enterprise  Storage  systems.
The  alliance  also  provides  for a  broad  patent  cross-license
between the two companies for storage and other technologies.

  Revenues on sales into the North American markets were $704.1 in
the  first quarter of 1999 compared to $481.7 in the first quarter
of  1998,  an  increase  of  $222.4 or 46%.   The  revenue  growth
reflects  continued strong demand for the Company's  products  and
services.

   Revenues  on sales into the markets of Europe, the Middle  East
and  Africa  were $339.6 in the first quarter of 1999 compared  to
$262.1 in the first quarter of 1998, an increase of $77.5 or 30%.

                                  12


<PAGE>


   Revenues  on sales into the markets of the Asia Pacific  region
were  $67.8 in the first quarter of 1999 compared to $77.0 in  the
first quarter of 1998, a decrease of $9.2 or 12%.  The decrease is
principally attributable to the current economic trends  affecting
the Asia Pacific markets.

   Revenues on sales into the markets of Latin America were  $16.5
in the first quarter of 1999 compared to $7.5 in the first quarter
of  1998, an increase of $9.0 or 119%.  The increase was primarily
due  to  the  Company's  efforts to expand its  business  in  this
region.

 Gross Margins

   Gross  margins  increased to 53.2% of  revenues  in  the  first
quarter  of  1999,  compared to 48.0% of  revenues  in  the  first
quarter  of  1998.   This  increase is primarily  attributable  to
increased  licensing of the Company's enterprise  software,  which
has  higher gross margins than sales of enterprise systems.  Other
factors  contributing  to  the  increase  include  the  impact  of
component  cost declines being greater than the impact of  product
price  declines  and  a  trend towards  larger  configurations  of
enterprise  systems.  The Company currently believes that  product
price declines will continue.

 Research and Development

   Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $100.7 and $65.7
in  the first quarters of 1999 and 1998, respectively, an increase
of  $35.0 or 53%.  R&D expenses were 8.9% and 7.9% of revenues  in
the  first quarters of 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The  increase
reflects the Company's ongoing research and development efforts in
a  variety  of  areas,  including EMC Enterprise  Storage  Network
technologies,  enhancements to the Symmetrix family  of  products,
new  and  enhanced enterprise storage software products and  fibre
channel  connectivity.  The Company expects to continue  to  spend
substantial  amounts  for  R&D  for  the  balance  of   1999   and
thereafter.

 Selling, General and Administrative

   Selling,  general  and  administrative ("SG&A")  expenses  were
$224.6  and  $153.5  in  the  first quarters  of  1999  and  1998,
respectively,  an  increase of $71.1 or 46%.  SG&A  expenses  were
19.9%  and  18.5% of revenues in the first quarters  of  1999  and
1998,  respectively.  The dollar increase primarily  reflects  the
Company's  objective  of  building an  infrastructure  to  achieve
broader coverage and greater account depth around the world and to
expand its technical sales organization to support the current and
expected growth in software revenues.

 Investment Income and Interest Expense

   Investment  income  was  $25.6 in the  first  quarter  of  1999
compared with $22.5 in the first quarter of 1998.  Interest income
was earned from investments in cash equivalents and short and long-
term  investments.   Investment  income  increased  in  the  first
quarter  of  1999  primarily  due to higher  cash  and  investment
balances which were derived from operations.

   Interest expense increased to $5.2 in the first quarter of 1999
from $4.7 in the first quarter of 1998.

 Provision for Income Taxes

   The provision for income taxes was $73.6 and $48.7 in the first
quarters  of  1999 and 1998, respectively, which  resulted  in  an
effective  tax  rate of 25.0% in each period.  The  effective  tax
rate  is  mainly  attributable  to  the  realization  of  benefits
associated with the Company's various tax strategies and  benefits
related to offshore manufacturing.

 Financial Condition

   Cash  and  cash equivalents and short and long-term investments
were  $2,275.1  and $2,092.8 at March 31, 1999  and  December  31,
1998,  respectively,  an  increase of $182.3.   Cash  provided  by
operating  activities  for  the first three  months  of  1999  was
$268.6,  generated  primarily  from  net  income.   Cash  used  by
investing activities was $159.9, principally from the purchases of
short  and long-term investments and additions to property,  plant
and  equipment.  Cash provided by financing activities  was  $2.1,
principally  from the issuance of common stock from  stock  option
exercises, offset by payments of short and long-term obligations.

   At March 31, 1999, the Company had available for use its credit
line  of $50.0 and may elect to borrow at any time.  Based on  its
current  operating and capital expenditure forecasts, the  Company
believes that the combination of funds currently available,  funds
generated from operations and its available line of credit will be
adequate to finance its ongoing operations.

 Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement

    In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS 133.  SFAS 133 is effective for
all  fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June  15,
1999.   SFAS  133  requires  that all  derivative  instruments  be
recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.  Changes in the
fair  value  of  derivatives are recorded each  period  in  either
current    earnings    or    accumulated    other    comprehensive
income/(expense), depending on whether a derivative is  designated
as  part  of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of  hedge
transaction.   For  fair-value hedge  transactions  in  which  the
Company is hedging changes in fair value of an asset, liability or
firm  commitment,  changes in the fair  value  of  the  derivative
instrument  will  generally be offset in the income  statement  by
changes in the fair value of the hedged item.  For cash-flow hedge
transactions,  in which the Company is hedging the variability  of
cash  flows  related  to  a variable rate asset,  liability  or  a
forecasted  transaction,  changes  in  the  fair  value   of   the
derivative  instrument  will  be  reported  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income/(expense).  The  gains  and  losses  on  the
derivative  instrument  that  are reported  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(expense) will be reclassified as earnings in
the  periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability  of
the cash flows of the hedged item.  The ineffective portion of all
hedges  will  be  recognized  in current  earnings.   The  Company
adopted SFAS 133 on January 1, 1999.  (See Note 5 to the Company's
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.)


 Year 2000 Issues

   The  information  provided  below  constitutes  a  ''Year  2000
Readiness  Disclosure''  under  the  Year  2000  Information   and
Readiness Disclosure Act.

    Certain   computer  hardware  and  software   is   unable   to
appropriately  interpret the upcoming calendar  year  2000.  These
systems  and software refer to years in terms of their  final  two
digits  only and may interpret the year 2000 as the year  1900  in
error. Therefore, they will need to be modified prior to the  year
2000 in order to remain functional. The Company has established  a
Year  2000  program  that  involves assessing  the  Company's  key
hardware  and  software, assessing Year 2000 compliance  by  third
parties  with  which  the  Company has  a  material  relationship,
assessing  Year  2000  compliance of the Company's  products,  and
modifying  and  testing  hardware and software  in  the  Company's
internal systems and products, where necessary.

   The  Company  has completed an assessment of the  hardware  and
software  in  its  core  business  information  systems  and   has
substantially completed the necessary modifications.  The  Company
has  also completed an assessment of the hardware and software  in
other information systems used in its operations and has completed
a  majority  of  the necessary modifications.   In  addition,  the
Company  has completed an assessment of the hardware and  software
used  in  its  business  that is not supported  by  the  Company's
information  system  department.   A  majority  of  the  necessary
modifications  have  also been completed  for  such  hardware  and
software.

                                  14


<PAGE>


   The  Company has contacted key vendors and suppliers and  other
third  parties  whose systems failures could  potentially  have  a
significant  impact on the Company's operations. The  Company  has
received certifications of Year 2000 compliance from many  of  its
key  vendors and suppliers. The Company continues to make progress
in receiving certifications of Year 2000 compliance from other key
vendors and suppliers and in assessing questionnaire responses and
related information from such third parties.

   The Company has designed and tested the current versions of its
Symmetrix series of products and the current versions of its other
products  to  be  Year  2000  compliant.  Some  of  the  Company's
customers are running earlier versions of its Symmetrix series  of
products  and  other products that have not been tested  for  Year
2000  compliance. The Company has made upgrades available for  the
older versions of its Symmetrix series of products and for certain
other  of  its older products so that such products will  test  as
Year 2000 compliant.

   The  Company  currently  anticipates that  the  assessment  and
remediation  phases of its Year 2000 conversion  program  will  be
substantially complete by the middle of 1999, although the testing
phase  and  the contingency planning phase, if any, will  continue
extensively throughout 1999. The Company does not anticipate  that
the  total cost of such program will have a material effect on its
business, results of operations or financial condition.

   The  most reasonably likely worst case scenarios regarding  the
Year  2000  issue would include a hardware failure, the corruption
or  loss  of  data contained in the Company's internal information
systems,  a failure affecting the Company's key vendors, suppliers
or  customers, the failure of infrastructure services provided  by
government   agencies  or  other  third  parties,   and   customer
dissatisfaction  related  to  the  performance  of  the  Company's
products.

   The  Company  continues to assess the  need  for  a  Year  2000
contingency plan. However, the Company anticipates that  its  Year
2000 conversion program will be completed far enough in advance of
January  1,  2000 so as to formulate a contingency  plan  at  such
time,  if necessary. The Company expects its contingency plan,  if
developed,  would  include,  among other  things,  manual  ''work-
arounds''  for  hardware  and  software  failures,  as   well   as
substitution of systems, if required.

   Further information about the Company's Year 2000 readiness  is
available       at       the      Company's       website       at
http://www.emc.com/challenges/supplmts/complnc/y2k_comp.htm.

   There  can  be  no assurance that conversion of  the  Company's
hardware  and software will be successful, that key third  parties
will  have  successful  conversion programs,  that  the  Company's
products  do  not contain undetected errors or defects  associated
with  Year 2000 date functions, or that other factors relating  to
Year  2000  compliance, including but not limited  to  litigation,
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations or financial condition.


 Euro Conversion

   On  January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries  of
the  European  Union  established fixed conversion  rates  between
their  existing  sovereign currencies and the Euro.  The  Euro  is
currently  the common legal currency in such countries.  The  Euro
trades  on  currency  exchanges  and  is  available  for  non-cash
transactions.  The  participating countries are issuing  sovereign
debt  exclusively  in  Euros, and have  redenominated  outstanding
sovereign  debt.  The participating countries  no  longer  control
their  own  monetary  policies by directing  independent  interest
rates  for the legacy currencies. Instead, the authority to direct
monetary  policy,  including money supply  and  official  interest
rates for the Euro, is exercised by the European Central Bank.

    The  legacy  currencies  will  remain  legal  tender  in   the
participating  countries  as denominations  of  the  Euro  between
January  1, 1999 and January 1, 2002 ( the ''transition period'').
During  the transition period, public and private parties may  pay
for  goods and services using either the Euro or the participating
country's  legacy currency on a ''no compulsion, no  prohibition''
basis.  However, conversion rates are no longer computed  directly
from one legacy currency to another. Instead, a triangular process
is applied whereby an amount denominated in one legacy currency is
first  converted  into  the  Euro. The resultant  Euro-denominated
amount is then converted into the third legacy currency.


                                  15

<PAGE>


    The  Company  has  developed  and  implemented  the  necessary
modifications for the technical adaptation of its internal IT  and
other  systems  to accommodate Euro-denominated transactions.  The
Company  is continuing to assess certain business implications  of
conversion  to  the  Euro,  including the  long  term  competitive
implications of the conversion and the impact on market risk  with
respect  to  financial instruments.  Management is also continuing
to  evaluate  other  impacts of this conversion  on  the  Company,
including the potential actions which may or may not be  taken  by
the Company's competitors and suppliers.


 Factors That May Affect Future Results

   This  Quarterly  Report  on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking

                         OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings

  In December 1997, NewFrame Corporation Ltd. (''NewFrame'') filed
suit  against the Company in the United States District Court  for
the  District  of Massachusetts. The suit contains  a  variety  of
allegations  relating to the Company's use of NewFrame's  software
developments,  including various contract  claims  and  breach  of
fiduciary  duty, and seeks monetary damages relating primarily  to
lost  future  profits.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss  the
complaint,  which  was  granted in part.  The  parties  reached  a
negotiated resolution of this matter in April 1999.

   In January 1998, Storage Technology Corporation (''STK'') filed
suit  against the Company in the United States District Court  for
the  Northern District of California alleging that the Company was
infringing  a patent covering virtual tape and seeking preliminary
and  permanent injunctions and unspecified damages. The  Company's
response raised as an affirmative defense that EMC was licensed to
promote  the  use of, market, sell and make virtual tape  products
pursuant  to a patent license agreement between EMC and STK  dated
April 11, 1996 (the ''License Agreement''). After a trial held  in
August  1998, the court ruled that EMC is licensed to promote  the
use  of,  market, sell and make virtual tape products pursuant  to
the License Agreement. The Court found that STK's suit was without
foundation and awarded costs to EMC. In October 1998, STK filed an
appeal of the Court's ruling.

   The  Company is a party to other litigation which it  considers
routine and incidental to its business. Management does not expect
the  results  of  any of these actions to have a material  adverse
effect  on  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  or
financial condition.
