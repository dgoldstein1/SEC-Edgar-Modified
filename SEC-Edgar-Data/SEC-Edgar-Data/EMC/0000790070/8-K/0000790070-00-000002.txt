Item 5.  Other Events.

     On February 15, 2000, the Registrant announced that on March
15, 2000 (the "Redemption Date"), it will redeem all of its
outstanding 3 1/4% convertible subordinated notes due 2002 (the
"Notes").  The aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes as
of February 9, 2000 was $460,269,000.  The Registrant will pay
the redemption price of 101.3% per note on March 15, 2000 for
notes not converted on or prior to March 15, 2000.  Accrued and
unpaid interest will be paid on March 15, 2000 to noteholders of
record on March 1, 2000.

     The Notes are convertible into shares of the Registrant's
common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), at
any time on or prior to the Redemption Date at a conversion price
of $11.3275 per share.  As long as the market price of the
Registrant's Common Stock is greater than $11.48 per share,
holders of Notes will, upon conversion, receive shares of the
Registrant's Common Stock having a market value greater than the
amount of cash receivable upon redemption of the Notes.  On
February 14, 2000, the closing price of the Registrant's Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $115.0625 per share.
