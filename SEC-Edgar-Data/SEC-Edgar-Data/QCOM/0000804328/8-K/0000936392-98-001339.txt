ITEM 2.    ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

         On September 23, 1998, QUALCOMM Incorporated ("QUALCOMM" or the
"Company") completed the spin-off and distribution (the "Distribution") to its
stockholders of shares of Leap Wireless International, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Leap"). As part of the Distribution, effective immediately after
the close of market trading on September 23, 1998, record holders of QUALCOMM
common stock on September 11, 1998 received a dividend of one share of common
stock of Leap for every four shares of common stock of QUALCOMM held by them as
of that date. Regular public trading of Leap shares under the ticker symbol
"LWIN" began on September 24, 1998, at which time QUALCOMM common stock traded
ex-dividend.

         In connection with the Distribution, QUALCOMM transferred to Leap
QUALCOMM's joint venture and equity interests in the following domestic and
international emerging terrestrial-based wireless telecommunications operating
companies: Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Metrosvyaz Limited
(Russia) and Orrengrove Investments Limited (Russia), ChileSat Telefonia
Personal, S.A. (Chile), Chase Telecommunications, Inc. (United States), OzPhone
Pty. Ltd. (Australia), and certain other development-stage businesses. QUALCOMM
and Leap have also agreed that, if certain events occur within eighteen months
after the Distribution, QUALCOMM will transfer to Leap certain assets and
liabilities related to Telesystems of Ukraine, a wireless telecommunications
company in Ukraine. In connection with the Distribution, QUALCOMM also
transferred to Leap $10.0 million cash and certain indebtedness of the operating
companies owed to QUALCOMM in the amount of approximately $113.0 million,
approximately $30.8 million of which is indebtedness under certain convertible
notes, as well as certain miscellaneous assets. QUALCOMM has also made a
substantial funding commitment to Leap in the form of a $265.0 million secured
credit facility. The aggregate net tangible book value of the assets transferred
by QUALCOMM to Leap in connection with the Distribution was $260.5 million.

         Leap has agreed to assume certain of QUALCOMM's other obligations to
manage operations of and finance costs relating to ongoing build-outs of the
wireless telecommunications systems being deployed by such operating companies,
including approximately $73.8 million of anticipated funding obligations to
certain of the operating companies, other than equipment financing obligations,
as well as certain miscellaneous liabilities. There can be no assurance that
Leap will fulfill or perform such obligations sufficiently or at all. QUALCOMM
will continue to be a supplier of CDMA equipment and is expected to provide
significant vendor financing to Leap's wireless telecommunications businesses
and ventures.

         As a result of the Distribution, QUALCOMM and Leap will operate as
independent publicly traded companies, with no common officers or directors. In
connection with the Distribution, however, Leap issued to QUALCOMM a warrant to
purchase 5,500,000 shares of Leap common stock at a purchase price equal to the
average of the last sales price per share of the Leap common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market for each of the five consecutive trading days beginning with and
including the date of the Distribution, or $6.10625 per share. In addition,
QUALCOMM and Leap will continue to have a relationship as a result of the
following agreements that they entered into in connection with the Distribution:



                                       2

         SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT. Pursuant to the Separation and
Distribution Agreement, QUALCOMM agreed to transfer to Leap the assets described
above, and Leap agreed to assume the obligations described above. QUALCOMM and
Leap also agreed that, if certain events occur within eighteen months after the
Distribution, QUALCOMM will transfer to Leap certain assets and liabilities
related to Telesystems of Ukraine.

         Leap also agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that,
until January 1, 2004, it will deploy, subject to certain specified limited
exceptions, only wireless terrestrial systems using technology and systems known
as cdmaOne.

         In addition, Leap agreed that, until January 1, 2004, it will, subject
to certain specified limited exceptions, invest only in companies using cdmaOne
systems, in connection with terrestrial wireless activities. Pursuant to the
Separation and Distribution Agreement and subject to certain exceptions,
QUALCOMM will have a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any patent rights
developed by Leap or any of Leap's affiliates. In addition, pursuant to the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, Leap will grant to QUALCOMM a right of
first refusal for a period of three years with respect to proposed transfers by
Leap of its interests in joint ventures and equity interests, subject to
pre-existing rights of other investors. Leap also agreed to take an active role
in the management of companies with which it has joint venture or equity
interests, consistent with its own business needs and applicable laws,
contractual arrangements and other requirements. Finally, the agreement includes
provisions prohibiting each party from soliciting the employees of the other for
three years.

         CREDIT FACILITY. Leap entered into a secured credit facility with
QUALCOMM. The credit facility consists of two sub-facilities. The first
sub-facility enables Leap to borrow up to $35.2 million from QUALCOMM, subject
to the terms thereof. The proceeds from this sub-facility may be used by Leap
solely to meet the normal working capital and operating expenses of Leap,
including salaries and overhead, but excluding, among other things, strategic
capital investments in wireless operators, substantial acquisitions of capital
equipment, and/or the acquisition of telecommunications licenses. The other
sub-facility enables Leap to borrow up to $229.8 million from QUALCOMM, subject
to the terms thereof. The proceeds from this second sub-facility may be used by
Leap solely to make certain identified portfolio investments.

         Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will be due and payable
approximately eight years following the Distribution Date. QUALCOMM will have a
first priority security interest in, subject to some exceptions, substantially
all of the assets of Leap for so long as any amounts are outstanding under the
Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will bear interest
at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.25% per annum. Interest will be payable
quarterly beginning September 30, 2001; and prior to such time, accrued interest
shall be added to the principal amount outstanding.

         MASTER AGREEMENT REGARDING EQUIPMENT PROCUREMENT. The Master Agreement
Regarding Equipment Procurement sets forth certain obligations of Leap and
QUALCOMM with respect to the purchase and sale of certain terrestrial-based
cdmaOne infrastructure and subscriber equipment.

         INTERIM SERVICES AGREEMENT. The Interim Services Agreement governs the
provision by QUALCOMM to Leap, on an interim basis, of certain services (which
may include voice telecommunications and data transmission, 



                                       3
<PAGE>   4

accounting, financial management, tax, payroll, stockholder and public
relations, legal, human resources administration, procurement, real estate
management and other administrative functions), each as mutually agreed to and
on the terms set forth therein. Leap has agreed to pay QUALCOMM the hourly rate
of the QUALCOMM employees performing such services, plus associated general and
administrative overhead (which shall be deemed to equal an additional 150% of
the hourly rate of the employees) and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses.
These interim services are not expected to extend beyond one year following the
date of the Distribution.

         EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AGREEMENT. Pursuant to the Employee Benefits
Agreement, Leap assumed and agreed to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge
certain liabilities to, or relating to, former employees of QUALCOMM or its
affiliates who are now employed by Leap. In addition, Leap was obligated to
grant (in connection with the Distribution) options to purchase shares of Leap
common stock to certain holders of options to purchase shares of QUALCOMM Common
Stock.

         TAX AGREEMENT. The Tax Agreement generally will require QUALCOMM to
pay, and indemnify Leap against, all United States federal, state, local and
foreign taxes relating to the businesses conducted by QUALCOMM or its
subsidiaries for any taxable period, other than the following taxes which will
be paid by Leap and against which Leap will indemnify QUALCOMM: (i) all United
States federal, state, local and foreign taxes relating to Leap and its U.S.
subsidiaries for periods after the Distribution; (ii) all United States federal,
state, local and foreign taxes relating to Leap's non-U.S. subsidiaries or any
predecessor or successor thereof for all periods before and after the
Distribution (other than with respect to certain restructuring transactions
incident to the Distribution); and (iii) all United States federal, state, local
and foreign taxes arising out of certain actions taken by, or in respect of,
Leap or any of its subsidiaries that cause adverse tax consequences to QUALCOMM,
Leap or their respective subsidiaries with respect to the Distribution or the
transactions related thereto; provided, however, that under certain limited
circumstances Leap's indemnification obligation described in this subparagraph
(iii) may be reduced.

         CONVERSION AGREEMENT. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, Leap agreed
to issue shares of Leap common stock to holders of QUALCOMM's Trust Convertible
Preferred Securities upon the conversion of such securities and to, at all
times, have reserved and keep available, solely for issuance and delivery upon
such conversion, all Leap common stock issuable from time to time upon such
conversion.

         A number of Leap's senior management members were members of QUALCOMM's
senior management and joined Leap from QUALCOMM in connection with the formation
of Leap, including Harvey P. White, Leap's President, Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman of the Board and formerly Vice Chairman of the Board of QUALCOMM;
Thomas J. Bernard, Leap's Executive Vice President and formerly Senior Vice
President of QUALCOMM; and James E. Hoffmann, Leap's Senior Vice President and
General Counsel and formerly Vice President, Legal Counsel of QUALCOMM.

           QUALCOMM COMPLETES SPIN-OFF OF LEAP WIRELESS INTERNATIONAL

SAN DIEGO - September 23, 1998 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today
announced that it has completed the spin-off and distribution to its
stockholders of shares of Leap Wireless International, Inc. (NASDAQ: LWIN). As
part of the distribution, effective immediately after the close of market
trading on September 23, 1998, record holders of QUALCOMM common stock on
September 11, 1998 will receive a dividend of one (1) share of common stock of
Leap Wireless for every four (4) shares of common stock of QUALCOMM held by them
as of that date. Regular public trading of Leap Wireless shares under the ticker
symbol "LWIN" will begin as of September 24, 1998, at which time QUALCOMM common
stock will trade ex-dividend.

The strategy of Leap Wireless will be to invest in wireless consortia with
partners that offer financial resources, spectrum or familiarity with the local
market to facilitate deployment. Leap Wireless currently owns, manages, supports
and operates joint venture and equity interests in Pegaso Telecomunicaciones,
S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Metrosyvaz Limited (Russia) and Orrengrove Investments
Limited (Russia), ChileSat Telefonia Personal, S.A. (Chile), Chase
Telecommunications, Inc. (United States), OzPhone Pty. Ltd. (Australia), and
certain other development-stage businesses.

"In emerging markets, the need for rapidly expanding telecommunications
infrastructure is not a luxury item, but a fundamental need, and wireless is the
fastest and most cost-effective way to meet the demand," said Harvey P. White,
chairman and CEO of Leap Wireless. "We have chosen to focus on CDMA because we
believe that it is the best technology to provide the capacity and quality to
meet customer demand. In addition, by using CDMA, we will not have to sacrifice
quality for mobility. We will be able to provide high quality voice and data
services that just happen to be mobile."

Mr. White was a co-founder of QUALCOMM who served as its president until just
prior to the distribution.

Headquartered in San Diego, QUALCOMM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses
and operates advanced communications systems and products based on its
proprietary digital wireless technologies. The Company's primary product areas
are the OmniTRACS(R) system (a geostationery satellite-based, mobile
communications system providing two-way data and position reporting services),
CDMA wireless communications systems and products and, in conjunction with
others, the development of the Globalstar(TM) low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite
communications system. Other Company products include Eudora Pro(R) electronic
mail software, ASIC products, and communications equipment and systems for
