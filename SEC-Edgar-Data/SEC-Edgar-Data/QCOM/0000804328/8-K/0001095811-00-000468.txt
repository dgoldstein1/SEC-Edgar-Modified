ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

        On February 21, 2000 (the "Closing Date"), QUALCOMM Incorporated
("QUALCOMM") and QUALCOMM Personal Electronics sold certain assets related to
their terrestrial-based wireless CDMA consumer phone business (the "Assets") to
Kyocera Wireless Corp. ("KWC"), formerly known as KII Acquisition Company,
pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 22, 1999 among
QUALCOMM, KWC and Kyocera International, Inc., as amended by that certain First
Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2000 (as
amended, the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). QUALCOMM received $216,144,412 in cash
on February 22, 2000 and will receive an additional $19,363,176, plus interest
from February 22, 2000, in cash on consummation of that aspect of the sale
relating to certain foreign business operations and assets (the "Second Closing
Date"). The Second Closing Date is expected to occur in March 2000. Initial
consideration for the Assets will total $235,507,588, provided however, that the
total consideration to be paid for the Assets will be based on a final
determination made after the Closing Date of the value of the net assets
actually sold.

        A description of the transaction is set forth in the Press Release
issued by QUALCOMM dated February 22, 2000, a copy of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit 99.1.

    NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION



(a)      The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet give
         retroactive effect to the sale of certain assets related to QUALCOMM's
         terrestrial-based wireless CDMA consumer phone business to Kyocera
         Wireless Corp. ("KWC") as if the sale had occurred as of December 26,
         1999. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
         income give retroactive effect as if the sale had occurred as of the
         beginning of the periods represented. The Company estimates that
         additional charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to the
         disposition of the terrestrial-based wireless CDMA phone business will
         total approximately $50 million. The additional charges will primarily
         relate to KWC's right under the agreement to exclude certain properties
         and equipment and employee termination charges. Such charges are not
         considered in these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
         financial statements.

(b)      Reflects the initial cash proceeds to be received by QUALCOMM. Total
         consideration will be based on a final determination of net assets as
         of the closing date.

(c)      Reflects inventories, net of reserves, to be sold to KWC.

(d)      Reflects property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, to be
         sold to KWC.

(e)      Reflects accrued liabilities to be assumed by KWC, primarily comprised
         of warranty reserves and accrued cooperative advertising.

(f)      Reflects revenues related to the terrestrial-based wireless CDMA
         consumer phone business to be assumed by KWC, including $19 million in
         sales by QUALCOMM Personal Electronics ("QPE") to Sony Electronics Inc.
         ("Sony Electronics"), offset by royalty revenue from third parties and
         billings to KWC for services provided by QUALCOMM employees as a result
         of the sale. QPE, a joint venture general partnership formed by
         QUALCOMM and Sony Electronics, manufactured the terrestrial-based
         wireless CDMA consumer phones sold by QUALCOMM. Sony Electronics' 49%
         interest in QPE is presented as a minority interest in these unaudited
         pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.

(g)      Reflects cost of revenues related to the terrestrial-based wireless
         CDMA consumer phone business to be assumed by KWC, offset by the cost
         of revenues related to services provided by QUALCOMM employees as a
         result of the sale.

(h)      Reflects research and development expenses related to the
         terrestrial-based wireless CDMA consumer phone business to be assumed
         by KWC.

(i)      Reflects selling, general and administrative expenses related to the
         terrestrial-based wireless CDMA consumer phone business to be assumed
         by KWC.

(j)      Reflects nonrecurring charges primarily related to the estimated
         difference between the carrying value of property and equipment and the
         consideration to be received from KWC, less costs to sell.

(k)      Reflects interest expense incurred by QPE in connection with the
         terrestrial-based wireless CDMA consumer phone business to be assumed
         by KWC.

(l)      Reflects Sony Electronics' minority interest in the earnings of QPE.

(m)      Pro forma adjustments have been tax effected at QUALCOMM's annual
         effective tax rate, expected to be 38% for fiscal 2000. QUALCOMM's
         annual effective tax rate was 35% for fiscal 1999.

(n)      QUALCOMM effected a four-for-one stock split in December 1999. Pro
         forma net earnings per common share for the year ended September 30,
         1999 are presented giving retroactive effect to the stock split.

                connection with (a) the negotiation and documentation of that
                aspect of the sale of Assets by QUALCOMM do Brasil Ltda. ("QdB")
                to Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) which the parties

                Assets") in a separate transaction, the terms and conditions of
                which are not yet finalized. Accordingly, the parties hereby
                agree that for purposes of the Closing under the Purchase
                Agreement, the Brazil Assets shall constitute Excluded Assets
                which will not be sold and purchased pursuant to the Purchase
                Agreement; provided, however, all provisions of the Purchase
                Agreement which by their terms would otherwise be applicable to
                the sale and purchase of the Brazil Assets but for this
                exclusion shall apply mutatis mutandis. The parties further
                agree that $19,363,176, representing the attributable purchase
                price (based on the methodology set forth in Section 2.7 of the
                Purchase Agreement, and subject to adjustment as provided
                therein) for the Brazil Assets (the "Brazil Purchase Price"),
                shall be deducted from the aggregate Purchase Price paid by
                Purchaser at Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
                shall still assume, pursuant to the Assumption Agreement, the
                Assumed Liabilities relating to that part of the Business which
                is conducted by QdB (the "Brazil Liabilities"). Notwithstanding
                anything to the contrary set forth in any documentation relating
                to the sale and purchase of the Brazil Assets (the "Brazil
                Purchase Documents"), in the event that QdB and Purchaser (or an
                Affiliate of Purchaser) do subsequently consummate a sale and
                purchase of the Brazil Assets, the provisions of the Purchase
                Agreement (other than the specific provision referred to above)
                shall apply equally to the Brazil Assets and the Brazil
                Liabilities, as if such Assets and Liabilities were sold,
                purchased, transferred and assumed under the Purchase Agreement
                (including but not limited to the provisions in the Purchase
                Agreement relating to representations, warranties, covenants and
                agreements respecting Assets and Assumed Liabilities, and the
                provisions of Section 2.7, Section 2.8, Article 4, Section 5.15,
                Article 8 and Article 10). In the event of any conflict between
                the Purchase Agreement, as amended pursuant to this Amendment,
                and any Brazil Purchase Documents, the terms and provisions of
                the Purchase Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, shall
                govern. The parties agree to exercise reasonable best efforts to
                consummate the purchase and sale of the Brazil Assets pursuant
                to the Brazil Purchase Documents on or before February 25, 2000.
                Payment of the Brazil Purchase Price shall be accompanied with a
                payment of interest, calculated using the interest rate publicly
                announced by Citibank, N.A. as its "reference rate," as such
                rate may change from time to time (calculated using a year of
                366 days), for each calendar day that occurs after February 21,
                2000 until such day as the Brazil Assets are sold and purchased
                pursuant to the Brazil Purchase Documents.

        (k)     CONFIDENTIALITY MATTERS. Section 2.1(a)(xii) of the Purchase
                Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following
                parenthetical at the end of such

                Section: "(including, without limitation, all rights of the
                Seller against any employee of the Business with respect to
                confidentiality and/or disclosure of Subscriber Business
                Intellectual Property, whether pursuant to an agreement or
                applicable law)."

        (l)     LICENSE. Section 5.7(a) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby
                amended by inserting the words "support, have supported," after
                the words "have made,".

        SECTION 3. AMENDMENT OF DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE. Attached hereto as Exhibit
A are amendments to specified sections of the Disclosure Schedule, which
Disclosure Schedule shall be and is hereby amended to incorporate such
amendments.

        SECTION 4. EFFECT OF AMENDMENT. Except as and to the extent expressly
modified by this Amendment, the Purchase Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule
shall remain in full force and effect in all respects. In the event of a
conflict between this Amendment and the Purchase Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedule, this Amendment shall govern. Upon the effectiveness of this Amendment,
each reference in the Purchase Agreement to "this Agreement," "hereunder,"
"herein," or words of like import, and each reference to the Purchase Agreement
in any Ancillary Agreement, Purchaser Document or Selling Party Document shall
mean and refer to the Purchase Agreement, as amended by this Amendment.

        SECTION 5. COUNTERPARTS. This Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

        SECTION 6. GOVERNING LAW. This Amendment shall be governed by the laws
of the State of California.
