Item 2:     Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

      On November 16, 1998, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as
of October 15, 1998 among Symantec Corporation ("Symantec"), Oak Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Symantec
("Purchaser"), and Quarterdeck Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Quarterdeck"), Symantec completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock of Quarterdeck (the "Shares") and accepted for payment
all shares tendered pursuant to the offer. The consideration paid by Symantec in
the tender offer was $0.52 per share net to the seller in cash, without interest
thereon, subject to reduction for any applicable federal backup or other
withholding taxes.

effected pursuant to Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law by the

by Purchaser, other than shares which are held by stockholders who have not
voted in favor of the merger or consented thereto in writing and who have
demanded appraisal of such shares in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law, were automatically canceled and converted into the right to
receive $0.52 per share net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon,
subject to reduction for any applicable federal backup or other withholding
taxes.
