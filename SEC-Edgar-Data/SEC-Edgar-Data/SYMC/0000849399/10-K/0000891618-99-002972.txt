INTRODUCTION.

Symantec is a world leader in utility software for business and personal
computing. Symantec products and solutions make users productive and keep their
computers safe and reliable anywhere and anytime.

Our predecessor, C&E Software, Inc., a California corporation and its operating
subsidiary, Symantec Corporation, a California corporation, were formed in
September 1983 and March 1982, respectively. We were incorporated in Delaware in
April 1988 in connection with the September 1988 reincorporation and combination
of our predecessor and its operating subsidiary into a single Delaware
corporation.

Since our initial public offering on June 23, 1989, we have completed
acquisitions of 19 businesses. During fiscal 1999, we completed our acquisition
of:

     o  Quarterdeck Corporation in the March 1999 quarter;

     o  Intel Corporation's anti-virus business during the September 1998
        quarter;

     o  Binary Research Limited's operations in the June 1998 quarter; and

     o  International Business Machine's anti-virus business also in the June
        1998 quarter;

We accounted for each of these four acquisitions as a purchase and, accordingly,
we have included the operating results of these businesses in our consolidated
financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition. See Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Other companies that we have acquired during the past five years include:

     o  Fast Track, Inc., on May 28, 1996;

     o  Delrina Corporation, on November 22, 1995;

     o  Intec Systems Corporation, on August 31, 1994;

     o  Central Point Software, Inc., on June 1, 1994; and

     o  SLR Systems, Inc., on May 31, 1994.

We acquired Peter Norton Computing, Inc. on August 31, 1990 and continue to use
the Norton brand name for products subsequently developed and marketed by us. We
accounted for each of these five acquisitions as poolings of interests.
Accordingly, we have restated all financial information to reflect the combined
operations of these companies and Symantec, with the exception of Fast Track,
Intec and SLR, each of which had results of operations that were not material to
our consolidated financial statements.

During fiscal 1997, in a move to focus our product offerings on specific
customer needs, we sold our electronic forms product line, acquired as part of
the Delrina acquisition, to JetForm Corporation and sold our network
administration technologies to the Hewlett-Packard Company. See further
discussion in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7:
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of
and for the periods ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended April 2, 1999, April 3, 1998 and





                                       1

March 28, 1997, respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended April 2, 1999
and March 28, 1997 each comprised 52 weeks of operations and the fiscal
accounting year ended April 3, 1998 comprised 53 weeks of operations.

of their life cycles. Net revenues from this segment were less than 1% of our
net revenues in fiscal 1999 and 1% and 9% of our net revenues for fiscal 1998
and 1997, respectively.

SALES AND MARKETING, INTERNATIONAL SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT.

We market our products worldwide utilizing a multi-channel strategy of direct
and indirect sales through independent software distributors, major retail
chains and resellers.

SALES AND MARKETING

We sell our products to individuals and corporate users primarily through
distributors and resellers. Our products are available to customers through
channels that include: distributors, retail, mail order, corporate resellers,
value added resellers, original equipment manufacturers, partnerships, education
and consulting. We also sell product upgrades and some of our products through
the use of direct mail and over the Internet. We sell corporate site licenses
through our distribution and corporate reseller channels.

We maintain distribution relationships with major independent distributors.
These distributors stock our products for redistribution to independent dealers,
consultants and other resellers. We also maintain relationships with major
retailers, while marketing to these retailers through independent distributors.
Our sales force works closely with our major distributor and reseller accounts
to manage the flow of orders, inventory levels and sell-through to customers. We
also work closely with them to manage promotions and other selling activities.

Our agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be
terminated by either party without cause. These distributors are not within our
control and are not obligated to purchase products from us. These distributors
also represent other vendors' product lines. For information with respect to
customers that represent more than 10% of our revenues, see Note 19 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Our return policy allows distributors, subject to various limitations, to return
purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future
purchases. End users may return products through dealers and distributors for a
full refund, within a reasonable period from the date of purchase. Retailers may
return older versions of products. Various distributors and resellers have
different return policies that may negatively impact the level of products that
are returned to us. Product returns occur when we introduce upgrades and new
versions of products or when distributors order too much product. In addition,
competitive factors often require us to offer rights of return for products that
distributors or retail stores are unable to sell.





                                       5
<PAGE>   8

Our marketing activities include:

     o  advertising in trade, technical and business publications;

     o  on-line advertising;

     o  public relations;

     o  cooperative marketing with distributors, resellers and dealers;

     o  direct mailings to existing and prospective end users; and

     o  participation in trade and computer shows.

We typically offer two types of rebate programs: volume incentive rebates and
rebates to end users. Volume incentive rebates are made available to our
distributors and resellers. The distributor or reseller earns a rebate based
upon their purchases and their sale of products to end users. Volume incentive
rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded. From time to time, we also make
rebates available to end users of various products acquired through major
retailers. End user rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded.

INTERNATIONAL REVENUES
International revenues, or revenues outside of North America, represented
approximately 37%, 34% and 30% of our net revenues for fiscal 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively.

The majority of our net revenues from various European regions are derived from
sales by affiliates of our major United States distributors. In other countries,
we sell our products through authorized distributors. In some countries, these
distributors are restricted to specified territories. We typically adapt
products for local markets. We adapt products by translating the documentation
and software, where necessary, and preparing marketing programs for each local
market.

We have marketing offices in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech
Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden,
Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. These local
offices facilitate our marketing and distribution in international markets. Our
international operations are subject to various risks common to international
operations, including:

     o  government regulations;

     o  import restrictions;

     o  currency fluctuations;

     o  repatriation restrictions; and

     o  in some jurisdictions, reduced protection for our copyrights and
        trademarks.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT
Our product support program provides a wide variety of free and fee-based
technical support services to our customers. We provide customers with free
support via electronic and automated services as well as 30 to 90 days free
telephone support for selected products. In August 1996, we introduced
LiveUpdate, which provides online access to application bug fixes and/or patches
for most of our currently marketed and developed products. In addition, we offer
both domestic individual users and domestic corporate customers a variety of
fee-based options designed to meet their technical support requirements. We
revise these fee-based support programs from time to time as customer
requirements change and as market trends dictate. Fee-based technical support
services did not generate material revenues in any fiscal year presented and are
not expected to generate material revenues in the near future.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PARTNERSHIPS AND ACQUISITIONS.

We use a multiple product sourcing strategy that includes, as necessary:

     o  internal development;

     o  licensing from third parties; and

     o  acquisitions of technologies, product lines or companies.

We develop software products that are designed to operate on a variety of
operating systems. We typically develop new products and enhancements of
existing products through our business units. Each unit is responsible for
design, development, documentation and quality assurance.





                                       6
<PAGE>   9

Independent contractors are used for aspects of the product development process.
In addition, elements of some of our products are licensed from third-party
developers.

We use strategic acquisitions, as necessary, to provide certain technology,
people and products for our overall product strategy. We have completed a number
of acquisitions and dispositions of technologies, companies and products and may
acquire and dispose of other technologies, companies and products in the future.
As discussed in the Introduction to this Item, during fiscal 1999, we acquired
Quarterdeck, Intel's and IBM's anti-virus businesses, and Binary's operations.
For further discussion, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in this Form 10-K.

COMPETITION.

The microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to
rapid changes in technology. It is influenced by the strategic direction of
major microcomputer hardware manufacturers and operating system providers. Our
competitiveness depends on our ability to enhance existing products and to offer
successful new products on a timely basis. We have limited resources and must
restrict product development efforts to a relatively small number of projects.

Examples of key competitors for products of our Security and Assistance unit
include:

     o  VirusScan and Dr. Solomon Anti-Virus Tool-Kit from Network Associates,
        Inoculan from Computer Associates International, Inc., Trend Micro,
        Inc.'s InterScan VirusWall and PC-cillin Corp. Edition, which compete
        with our Norton AntiVirus product;

     o  Virex and McAfee VirusScan from Network Associates, which compete with
        our Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh product;

     o  Uninstaller from Network Associates and WinDelete from IMSI Corporation,
        which compete with our Norton CleanSweep product;

     o  Drive Image Pro from PowerQuest Corporation, RapiDeploy from Altiris,
        Inc. and Micro House International's ImageCast IC3, which compete with
        our Norton Ghost product;

     o  McAfee Office from Network Associates, which competes with our Norton
        SystemWorks product;

     o  McAfee First Aid 2000 and McAfee Nuts & Bolts from Network Associates,
        Mijenix Corporation's Fix-It Utilities 99, TechTool PRO from MicroMat,
        Inc. and Executive Software International, Inc.'s Diskeeper, which
        compete with our Norton Utilities product;

     o  PC Clinic from Network Associates and Updates.com from Updates.com,
        which compete with our Norton Web Services product;

     o  TransCentury Office from Platinum Technology IP, Inc., Greenwich Mean
        Time's Check 2000 Client Server and WRQ, Inc.'s Express 2000 Software
        Manager, which compete with our Norton 2000 Corporate Edition product;
        and

     o  Greenwich Mean Time's Check 2000, McAfee 2000 Toolbox from Network
        Associates and Intelliquis' IntelliFix 2000, which compete with our
        Norton 2000 product for the consumer.

Examples of key competitors for products of our Remote Productivity Solutions
unit include:

     o  Contact managers, such as GoldMine from GoldMine Software Corporation
        and Maximizer from Multiactive Software, Inc. and less directly,
        personal information managers, such as Organizer from IBM's Lotus
        division, Outlook from Microsoft Corporation and Sidekick 99 from
        Starfish Software, Inc., which compete with our ACT! product;

     o  DynamicAccess from 3Com Corporation and NetSwitcher from NetSwitcher,
        which compete with our Norton Mobile Essentials product;

     o  pcANYWHERE competes with LapLink from Traveling Software, Inc., ReachOut
        from Stac Software, Inc., Carbon Copy from Compaq Computer Corporation
        and Timbuktu from Netopia, Inc.

     o  HotFax MessageCenter by Smith Micro Software, Inc., Communicate! PRO and
        Communicate! by 01Communique, which compete with our TalkWorks PRO
        product; and

     o  HotFax MessageCenter from Smith Micro Software and 01Communique's
        Communicate! products in the broader fax and voice messaging market,
        which compete with our WinFax PRO product.





                                       7
<PAGE>   10

Examples of key competitors for products of our Internet Tools unit include:

     o  JBuilder Client/Server from Inprise Corporation, VisualAge for Java
        Enterprise from IBM and PowerJ from Sybase, Inc., which compete with our
        Symantec Visual Cafe (Database Edition) and Symantec Visual Cafe
        (Enterprise Suite) products;

     o  Microsoft's Visual J++, Inprise's JBuilder Professional, IBM's VisualAge
        for Java Professional, SuperCede by SuperCede Inc. and Sun Microsystems,
        Inc.'s Java WorkShop, which compete with our Symantec Visual Cafe
        (Professional Edition) product; and

     o  Microsoft's Visual J++, Inprise's JBuilder Professional and IBM's
        VisualAge for Java Standard, which compete with our Symantec Visual Cafe
        (Standard Edition) product.

Price competition is sometimes intense with some products in the microcomputer
business software market. We expect price competition to continue to increase
and become even more significant in the future, which may reduce our profit
margins.

We also face competition from a number of other products that offer levels of
functionality different from those offered by our products or that were designed
for a somewhat different group of end users than those targeted by us. Operating
system vendors such as Microsoft have added features to new versions of their
products that provide some of the same functions traditionally offered in our
products. Microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities in Windows 95 and
Windows 98 and we believe this trend will continue. While we plan to continue to
improve our products with a view toward providing enhanced functionality over
that provided in current and future operating systems, these efforts may be
unsuccessful and any improved products may not be commercially accepted by
users. We will also continue to attempt to work with operating system vendors in
an effort to make our products compatible with those operating systems. At the
same time, we intend to differentiate our utility products from features
included in operating systems. However, our efforts may be unsuccessful.

The demand for some of our products, including those currently under
development, may decrease, if, among other reasons:

     o  Microsoft includes additional product features in future releases of
        Windows;

     o  hardware vendors incorporate additional server-based network management
        and security tools into network operating systems; or

     o  competitors license certain of their products to Microsoft or original
        equipment manufacturers for inclusion in their operating systems or
        products.

In addition, we compete with other microcomputer software companies for access
to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail
level and in corporate accounts. We also compete with other software companies
to acquire products or companies and to publish software developed by third
parties.

Many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing
and technological resources than we do. We believe that competition in the
industry will continue to intensify as most major software companies expand
their product lines into additional product categories.

MANUFACTURING.

Our product development organization produces a set of master CD-ROMs or
diskettes and documentation for each product that are then duplicated and
packaged into products by the manufacturing organization. All of our domestic
manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by an outside contractor under
the supervision of our manufacturing organization. Domestic purchasing of all
raw materials is done by Symantec personnel in our Cupertino, California
facility. The manufacturing steps that are subcontracted to outside
organizations include the duplication of diskettes and replication of CD-ROMs,
printing of documentation materials and assembly of the final packages. We
perform diskette duplication and assembly of the final package in our Dublin,
Ireland manufacturing facility for most products distributed outside of the
United States and Canada. All of our international CD-ROM replication is
performed by outside contractors in Dublin, Ireland.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

We regard our software as proprietary. We attempt to protect our software
technology by relying on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and
trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. Litigation may be





                                       8
<PAGE>   11

necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect trade secrets
or trademarks or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
of others. Furthermore, other parties have asserted and may, in the future,
assert infringement claims against us. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. These claims and any resultant
litigation, may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights. Litigation,
even litigation that is not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and
diversion of resources and management attention.

EMPLOYEES.

As of March 31, 1999, we employed approximately 2,400 people, including 1,300 in
sales, marketing and related staff activities, 600 in product development and
500 in management, manufacturing, administration and finance. None of our
employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work
stoppages. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Competition in
recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense. We believe that our
future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly
skilled management, marketing and technical personnel. We believe that we must
provide personnel with a competitive compensation package, which necessitates
the continued availability of stock options and shares to be issued under our
employee stock option and purchase plans and requires ongoing shareholder
approval of such incentive programs.

ITEM 6:    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

The following selected financial data is qualified in its entirety by and should
be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere herein. During fiscal 1999, we acquired
Quarterdeck, Intel's and IBM's anti-virus businesses and the operations of
Binary. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form
10-K. Each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and,
accordingly, the operating results of these businesses have been included in our
consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.
We did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1997, we
acquired Fast Track, Inc. in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Since the results of operations of Fast Track were not material to
our consolidated financial statements, amounts prior to the date of acquisition
were not restated to reflect the combined operations of the companies. In fiscal
1996, we acquired Delrina Corporation. In fiscal 1995, we acquired Intec Systems
Corporation, Central Point Software, Inc. and SLR Systems, Inc. The fiscal 1996
and 1995 acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interests. We have not
paid cash dividends on our stock in the last three years.

ITEM 7:    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual
results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
factors include, among others things, those risk factors set forth in this
section and elsewhere in this report. We identify forward-looking statements by
words such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue"
or similar terms that refer to the future. We cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements.

OVERVIEW

Symantec is a world leader in utility software for business and personal
computing. Symantec products and solutions make users productive and keep their
computers safe and reliable anywhere and anytime. Founded in 1982, we have
offices in 26 countries worldwide. During the last three fiscal years, we
completed the following acquisitions:

In November 1998 we completed a tender offer for the common stock of
Quarterdeck, obtaining 63% of the outstanding shares. In March 1999, Quarterdeck
shareholders approved the acquisition by Symantec of 100% of the outstanding
shares of Quarterdeck. The acquisition of Quarterdeck was accounted for as a
purchase and was paid for with cash. We recorded intangible assets of developed
software, tradename, customer base, goodwill, workforce in place and in-process
research and development for the respective purchases. We wrote off the
in-process research and development acquired. We are amortizing the value of the
workforce in place over 2 years. We are amortizing the value of the remaining
intangibles, developed software, tradename, customer base and goodwill over 5
years. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form
10-K.

In September 1998 we entered into an agreement with Intel to acquire its
anti-virus business and to license its systems management technology. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and was paid for with cash. We
recorded intangible assets of developed software, customer base and in-process
research and development as of the date of the acquisition. We wrote off the
in-process research and development acquired. We are amortizing the value of the
customer base and developed software over 5 years. See Note 3 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

In June 1998 we acquired the operations of Binary. The acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase and was paid for with cash. We recorded intangible assets of
developed software, workforce in place and in-process research and development
as of the date of the acquisition. We wrote off the in-process research and
development acquired. We are amortizing the value of the workforce in place and
developed software over 4 years. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

In May 1998 we entered into an agreement with IBM to acquire its immune system
technology and related anti-virus patents. The acquisition was accounted for as
a purchase and was paid for with cash. We recorded intangible assets of prepaid
research and development, customer base, goodwill and in-process research and
development. We wrote-off the in-process research and development as of the date
of the purchase. We are amortizing the value of prepaid research and development
over 1 year. We are amortizing the value of both the goodwill and customer base
over 5 years. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
this Form 10-K.

We did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1997, we
acquired Fast Track in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. In
conjunction with our acquisition of Fast Track, we issued 600,000 shares of our
common stock. The results of operations of Fast Track were not material to our
consolidated financial statements and we did not restate amounts prior to the
date of acquisition to reflect the combined operations of the companies.

On January 6, 1999, we received a comment letter from the Securities and
Exchange Commission with respect to our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1998 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1998. The
comment letter contained questions related to accounting for certain
acquisitions, including questions related to the write-off of associated
in-process research and development costs. We re-evaluated the Binary and IBM
transactions





                                       14
<PAGE>   17

and the related in-process research and development costs as well as the other
questions raised in the comment letter. As a result, final operating results for
the quarters ended June, September and December 1998 and the related
year-to-date amounts were restated for the adjustments made to our acquisitions
of Binary and IBM's anti-virus business. In addition, we have reclassified our
financial results related to the sales of our electronic forms product line to
JetForm Corporation and our network administration technologies to
Hewlett-Packard Corporation from revenue to income, net of expense, from sale of
technologies and product lines. Although there was no impact to our net income,
we have restated our fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 financials to reflect these
reclassifications from revenue to non-operating income.

The following table sets forth each item from our consolidated statements of
operations as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the

NET REVENUES.
Net revenues increased 11% from $533 million in fiscal 1998 to $593 million in
fiscal 1999. Net revenues increased 18% from $453 million in fiscal 1997 to $533
million in fiscal 1998. The increase in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998
was largely due to increased sales to our corporate customers, introductions of
new products and increased sales outside of North America. The increase in
fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997 was largely due to sales of Windows 95
and Windows NT versions of our principal products, as well as introduction of
new products and growth in sales outside of North America.

BUSINESS UNITS. During fiscal 1999 and 1998, we experienced increased net
revenues over the prior fiscal year from our Security and Assistance, Remote
Productivity Solutions and Internet Tools segments, while our Corporate Sunset
segment had declining revenues.





                                       15
<PAGE>   18

Our Security and Assistance business unit represented approximately 57%, 54% and
50% of total net revenues for fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Increased net revenues for this business unit in fiscal 1999 were primarily due
to sales of Norton AntiVirus. New product releases of Norton SystemWorks and
Norton Ghost also contributed to the fiscal 1999 net revenue increase. These
year over year increases were partly offset by reductions in net revenues for
Norton Utilities. Increased net revenues for this business unit in fiscal 1998
as compared to fiscal 1997 were primarily due to sales of Windows 95, Windows NT
and Macintosh versions of Norton Utilities, as well as the multi-platform
workstations/servers version of Norton AntiVirus. New product releases of Norton
CrashGuard Deluxe and Norton Uninstall contributed to the fiscal 1998 net
revenue increase.

Our Remote Productivity Solutions business unit represented approximately 39%,
41% and 37% of total net revenues for fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Despite the reduced percentage of revenue from this business unit, absolute net
revenues for this business unit increased in fiscal 1999 over fiscal 1998. This
increase was primarily due to increased sales of pcANYWHERE. Increased net
revenues for this business unit in fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997 were
primarily due to increased sales of WinFax PRO for Windows 95, pcANYWHERE and
ACT!

Our Internet Tools business unit represented approximately 4% of total net
revenues in each of the fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997. This business unit's
net revenues in absolute dollars increased in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal
1998, and also increased in fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997. The
increases in both comparative years were due to increased sales of our Visual
Cafe Database and Professional Editions.

Our Corporate Sunset segment's revenues are generated from sales of products
that are nearing the end of their life cycles. Net revenues from this segment
were less than 1% of net revenues for fiscal 1999 and 1% and 9% of our net
revenues for fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively.

During fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, the financial impact of product price
reductions for certain of our principal products was more than offset by the
increase in the volume of products sold, resulting in increased net revenues.

INTERNATIONAL. Net revenues from international sales, or revenues outside of
North America, were $219 million and $179 million and represented 37% and 34% of
net revenues in fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase was largely due
to stronger sales to Europe and Japan. Net revenues from international sales
increased by $42 million in fiscal 1998, from $137 million in fiscal 1997. This
increase in net revenues was the result of our penetration of new and emerging
markets in Latin America and Asia/Pacific, as well as increased sales in Europe.
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 did not
materially affect annual revenue.

PRODUCT RETURNS. We estimate and maintain reserves for product returns. Product
returns principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete
products which are offset by orders of equal or greater value for the current
versions of the products. The mix of products returned from the
distributors/resellers as compared to products sold to the
distributors/resellers does not impact the gross margins, as Symantec's gross
margins are consistent across its various product families. Changes in the level
of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by
a change in the level of gross revenue. As a result, the product returns
provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period
presented.

GROSS MARGIN.
Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
consists primarily of manufacturing expenses, costs for producing manuals,
packaging costs, royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and
amortization and write-off of capitalized software.

Gross margin was 84% of net revenues in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 and 82% in
fiscal 1997. Factors contributing to an increase in gross margin percentage
during fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997 include reduction of direct
material costs, which were accomplished by shifting product media from more
expensive diskettes to lower priced CD-ROMs and reductions in the size of bound
manuals, accomplished through a shift in documentation for our principal
products from paper manuals to electronic manuals. Additional cost reductions
occurred in manufacturing overhead costs due to improved economies of scale and
reductions in capitalized software amortization and write-offs as discussed
below.

PURCHASED PRODUCT RIGHTS AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE. As indicated in the overview,
during fiscal 1999 we acquired Quarterdeck, Intel's anti-virus business and
Binary's operations, as a result of these transactions we recorded purchased
product rights and technology of approximately $8 million, $11 million and $17
million, respectively. See





                                       16
<PAGE>   19

Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. During
fiscal 1998, software development costs did not materially affect us.

Amortization of purchased product rights and capitalized software totaled
approximately $11 million, $1 million and $2 million in fiscal 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The increase in fiscal 1999 from fiscal 1998 is primarily
due to additional amortization related to developed technologies acquired from
Intel's anti-virus business, Binary and Quarterdeck from the date of
acquisition. The amortization will occur over the next 3 to 5 years. See Note 4
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.
We charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred.
Research and development expenses remained flat at 17% for fiscal 1999 compared
to fiscal 1998 as a percentage of net revenues and represented 20% of total
company net revenues in fiscal 1997. The decrease in research and development
expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal 1998 from fiscal 1997 largely
resulted from our decision to cease development of certain software products no
longer actively marketed by us.

Research and development expenses increased 11% to $102 million in fiscal 1999
from $91 million in fiscal 1998 and increased 3% in fiscal 1998 from $89 million
in fiscal 1997. The increase in both years was a result of increased spending on
new product development.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES.
Sales and marketing expenses were 48% as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal
1999, and remained flat at 49% as a percentage of net revenues for both fiscal
1998 and 1997. The sales and marketing expenses were approximately $286 million,
$261 million and $221 million in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. This
absolute increase in sales and marketing dollars for fiscal 1999 over fiscal
1998 is primarily due to increased headcount, as well as increased spending in
advertising and promotional expenses. The increase in sales and marketing
expenses in fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997 is primarily related to
increased international sales and marketing.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.
As indicated in the overview, in fiscal 1999, we acquired IBM's and Intel's
anti-virus businesses, Binary's operations and Quarterdeck. The following table
outlines the value of the intangible assets recorded in connection with these
acquisitions:

</TABLE>

We wrote-off approximately $28 million in in-process research and development
associated with the IBM, Binary, Intel and Quarterdeck purchases. These
write-offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached
technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses. We are using the
acquired in-process research and development associated with these acquisitions
to create new anti-virus products and enhanced management and administrative
capabilities to be integrated into our suite of anti-virus offerings and other
corporate products over the next two years. This in-process technology will also
be used to create new Uninstall and Disk Cloning products.

The efforts required to develop the purchased in-process technology principally
relate to the completion of all planning, designing, development and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be
produced to meet its design specifications including features, functions and
performance. We expect the acquired in-process technology to be developed into
commercially feasible products. However, there are no assurances that this will
occur. If we fail to complete these products in their entirety, or in a timely
manner, we may not continue to attract new users, we may be unable to retain our
existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired.





                                       17
<PAGE>   20

We determined the fair value of the in-process technology for each of the
purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects,
including the cost to complete the in-process technologies and future revenues
to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We discounted the resulting
cash flows back to their net present values. We based the net cash flows from
such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of
revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

IBM. The in-process technology acquired in the IBM purchase primarily consisted
of the IBM immune system technology and related anti-virus patents. This
technology is designed to detect previously unknown viruses, analyze them and
distribute a cure, all automatically and faster than existing methods. We intend
to integrate this technology into our suite of anti-virus products and engage in
considerable amount of infrastructure enhancement required for its deployment
throughout 1999.

We assumed that revenue attributable to this in-process technology would
increase substantially during the first year and then decrease at rates of 35%
to 14% during the remaining three years of the four year projection. We
projected annual revenues to range from approximately $17 million to $8 million
over the term of the projection.
We based these projections on:

     o  penetration into IBM's and our existing installed base of customers;

     o  anticipated growth rates of the anti-virus markets;

     o  an accelerated growth of new customers during the first year of
        delivering immune system technology; and

     o  the estimated life of the underlying technologies.

Based on our historical experience with similar products, we estimated marketing
and sales expenses for the in-process technology to be 40% as a percentage of
revenue throughout the valuation period. Based on our historical general and
administrative expenses, we estimated general and administrative expenses to be
7% throughout the period of analysis.

We assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges
would be approximately $4 million during the first year. We assumed that it
would decrease at annual rates ranging from 35% to 14% during the remaining
periods, resulting in annual operating profits ranging between approximately $4
million and $2 million. We estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological
feasibility of in-process technologies from IBM as of the date of the agreement
to total approximately $2 million. We estimated the in-process technology to be
approximately 78% complete at that time. We projected the introduction of
acquired in-process technologies in early/mid 1999 and now expect the
introduction to take place in the second half of 1999.

We used a discount rate of 30% for valuing the in-process technology from IBM,
which we believe to reflect the risk associated with the completion of these
research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to
be generated subsequent to their completion. This discount rate is higher than
our weighted average cost of capital of 17% due to the fact that the technology
had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation.

The assumptions and projections discussed for the immune system and related
anti-virus technology acquired from IBM were made based on information available
at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results, which
could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the
risk factors set forth in this Form 10-K.

BINARY. The in-process technology acquired in the Binary acquisition primarily
consisted of disk cloning technologies associated with Ghost, the flagship
product of Binary. Ghost software is designed to create a complete image of a
hard drive in the form of a single file that can be copied to another computer
connected via a network.

We assumed that revenue attributable to Binary's in-process technology will
increase in the first three years of the five year projection period at annual
rates ranging from 1108% to 88% and then decrease at rates of 3% to 74% over the
remaining periods as other technologies enter the marketplace. We projected
annual revenues to range from approximately $1 million to $14 million over the
projected period. We based these estimates on:

     o  aggregate growth rates for the business as a whole;

     o  individual product revenues;

     o  anticipated product development cycles; and

     o  the life of the underlying technology.





                                       18
<PAGE>   21

We estimated marketing and sales expenses for the in-process technology to be
31% as a percentage of revenue throughout the valuation period. Based on our
historical general and administrative expenses, we estimated general and
administrative expenses to be 7% throughout the period of analysis.

We projected operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to
increase from less than $1 million during the first year to approximately $7
million during the third year. We projected that operating profits would then
decrease from 4% to 74% during the remaining two years, resulting in profits of
approximately $7 million and $2 million. Because we assumed that most product
development costs would be incurred in the first year, reducing operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years, we anticipate operating
profit to increase faster than revenue in the early years.

We estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of
in-process technologies from Binary as of the date of the acquisition to total
approximately $2 million. We estimated the in-process technology to be
approximately 50% complete at that time. We projected the introduction of
acquired in-process technologies in early/mid 1999 and this has been completed.

We used a discount rate of 30% for valuing the in-process technologies from
Binary, which we believe to reflect the risk associated with the completion of
these research and development projects and the estimated future economic
benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion. This discount rate is
higher than our weighted average cost of capital of 17% due to the fact that the
technology had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the
valuation.

The assumptions and projections discussed for the disk cloning technologies
acquired from Binary were made based on information available at the time and
should not be taken as indications of actual results, which could vary
materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors
set forth in this Form 10-K.

INTEL. The in-process technology acquired in the Intel purchase consists of the
LANDesk anti-virus technology which resides in the LANDesk virus protect product
line, LDVP. The LDVP product offers centrally managed virus protection to
computer networks. We intend to initially sell the next version of LDVP software
on a standalone basis. We anticipate that during 1999 this technology will be
integrated into our suite of corporate anti-virus offerings, in addition to
future corporate products.

We assumed revenue attributable to Intel's in-process technology to be
approximately $12 million during the first year, increasing to approximately $13
million during the second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from
35% to 77% during the remaining three years of the five year projection as other
technologies enter the marketplace. We projected annual revenues to range from
approximately $13 million to $1 million over the projected period. We based
these estimates on:

     o  revenue estimates of the acquired LDVP business;

     o  aggregate growth rates for the anti-virus business as a whole;

     o  anticipated revenue to be earned from future corporate product
        offerings;

     o  anticipated product development cycles; and

     o  the life of the underlying technology.

Based on our historical experience with similar products, we estimated marketing
and sales expenses for the in-process technology to be 43% as a percentage of
revenue throughout the valuation period. Based on our historical general and
administrative expenses, we estimated general and administrative expenses to be
8% throughout the period of analysis.

We assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to
be approximately $5 million during the first year, increasing by 7% during the
second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from 34% to 77% during
the remaining periods, resulting in annual operating profits ranging between
approximately $5 million and less than $1 million. We assumed a growth rate for
operating profits, which are slightly higher than revenue projections, when
projecting the operating profit during the early years. The higher growth rate
is attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above as the technology is
integrated more deeply into our product offerings, while research costs remain
constant.





                                       19
<PAGE>   22

We estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of
in-process technologies from Intel as of the date of the product being delivered
to us to total approximately $1 million. We estimated the in-process technology
to be 88.1% complete at that time. We projected the introduction of acquired
in-process technologies in early/mid 1999 and this has been completed.

We used a discount rate of 30% for valuing the in-process technology from Intel,
which we believe reflected the risk associated with the completion of these
research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to
be generated subsequent to their completion. This discount rate is higher than
our weighted average cost of capital of 17% due to the fact that the technology
had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation.

The assumptions and projections discussed for the LANDesk anti-virus technology
acquired from Intel were made based on information available at the time and
should not be taken as indications of actual results, which could vary
materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors
set forth in this Form 10-K.

QUARTERDECK. The in-process technology acquired in our acquisition of
Quarterdeck consisted of projects related to Quarterdeck's CleanSweep product
line. The CleanSweep product line is designed to enhance the performance of the
Windows operating system by finding and removing outdated, unnecessary, or
unwanted files, applications and system components, thereby freeing up disk
space.

The following discussion relates to our purchase of a 63% interest in November
1998:

We assumed revenue attributable to the in-process technology to be approximately
$24 million during the first year and then declining at annual rates of 5% to
65% during the remaining periods of the six year projection period as other
technologies are released into the marketplace. We projected annual revenues to
range from approximately $24 million to $3 million over the projected period. We
based these projections on:

     o  aggregate revenue estimates for the business as a whole;

     o  anticipated revenue derived from being able to increase our penetration
        in the uninstaller market;

     o  anticipated growth rates in the utilities suites markets;

     o  anticipated product development cycles; and

     o  the life of the underlying technology.

Based on indications from similar companies, we estimated overall sales,
marketing and general and administrative expenses to be 30% throughout the
valuation period.

We assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to
be approximately $11 million during the first year, increasing by 1% during the
second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from 17% to 69% during
the remaining periods, resulting in annual operating profits ranging between
approximately $11 million and $1 million. Because we assumed that most product
development costs would be incurred in the first year, reducing operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years, operating profit in early
years increases as revenue declines.

We estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility as of the
date of acquisition for Quarterdeck in-process technologies to total
approximately $1 million. We estimated the in-process technology to be 80%
complete as of the date of the acquisition. We projected the introduction of
acquired in-process technologies in early/mid 1999 and this is now expected to
take place in the second half of 1999.

We used a discount rate of 20% for valuing the in-process technology from
Quarterdeck, which we believe reflected the risk associated with the completion
of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic
benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion. This discount rate
reflects a premium above that of the risk associated with the acquired developed
technology and is higher than our weighted average cost of capital.

The following discussion relates to our purchase of the remaining 37% interest
in March 1999:

We assumed revenue attributable to the in-process technology to be approximately
$9 million during the first year, increasing to approximately $23 million during
the second year and then declining at annual rates of 14% to 45% during the
remaining periods of the six year projection period as other technologies are
released into the marketplace. We projected annual revenues to range from $9
million to $23 million over the projected period. We based these projections on:





                                       20
<PAGE>   23

     o  aggregate revenue estimates for the business as a whole;

     o  anticipated revenue derived from being able to increase our penetration
        in the uninstaller market;

     o  anticipated growth rates in the utilities suites markets;

     o  anticipated product development cycles; and

     o  the life of the underlying technology.

Based on indications from similar companies, we estimated overall sales,
marketing and general and administrative expenses to be 30% throughout the
valuation period.

We assumed operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to
be approximately $4 million during the first year, increasing by 208% during the
second year and then declining at annual rates ranging from 14% to 45% during
the remaining periods, resulting in annual operating profits ranging between
approximately $7 million and $2 million. Because we assumed that most product
development costs would be incurred in the first year, reducing operating
expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years, operating profit in early
years increases as revenue declines.

We estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility as of the
date of acquisition for Quarterdeck in-process technologies to total
approximately $1 million. We estimated the in-process technology to be 20%
complete as of the date of the acquisition. We project introduction of acquired
in-process technologies in mid/late 1999. The percent completion is
significantly lower than the percent completion of the previous purchase due to
significant changes in product features, R&D investment levels and introduction
dates.

We used a discount rate of 20% for valuing the in-process technology from
Quarterdeck, which we believe reflected the risk associated with the completion
of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic
benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion. This discount rate
reflects a premium above that of the risk associated with the acquired developed
technology and is higher than our weighted average cost of capital.

The assumptions and projections discussed for the projects related to
Quarterdeck's CleanSweep product line were made based on information available
at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results, which
could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the
risk factors set forth in this Form 10-K.

There was no in-process research and development expenses in fiscal 1998. In
fiscal 1997, Symantec entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain
software technologies to enable Web Authoring for the Mac OS environment. The
terms of the purchase agreement provided that Symantec pay $3 million upon the
signing of the agreement and the delivery of the then in-process, pre-beta
software technologies to Symantec. At the time of this purchase, no revenues had
been derived from any of the technologies acquired and revenues were not
anticipated from these technologies until calendar 1997. In accordance with FAS
86, we utilized a working model of the desktop software product (essentially a
beta version of the product) as its point of technological feasibility for
desktop products because a detailed program does not exist. Symantec had
consistently utilized this point in a desktop product's development life cycle
for purposes of the capitalization of software. In accordance with the
requirements of SFAS 86, we evaluated the purchased software for technological
feasibility and determined that a detailed program design did not exist.
Accordingly, we accounted for the cost of the purchased computer software the
same as the costs incurred to develop such software internally. Additionally,
these software technologies had no alternate future use beyond the continuing
development efforts of the Web Authoring product. Accordingly, the Company
expensed the cost of these software technologies and recorded an approximately
$3 million charge for the write-off of in-process research and development in
fiscal 1997.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.
General and administrative expenses were 6% of net revenues in fiscal 1999 and
7% of net revenues for both fiscal 1998 and 1997. General and administrative
expenses decreased by 6% to $36 million in fiscal 1999 from $38 million in
fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1998, general and administrative expenses increased by
12% from $34 million in fiscal 1997.





                                       21
<PAGE>   24

General and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 1999 as compared to
fiscal 1998. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in our information
system costs. General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 1998 as
compared to fiscal 1997 at a rate proportionate to net revenue growth. This
increase was the result of increased personnel expenses associated with the
growth of the Company.

LITIGATION JUDGMENT.
Litigation expenses that related to a judgment by a Canadian court on a
decade-old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of
Delrina Corporation totaled approximately $6 million for fiscal 1999. See Note
16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES.
During the September quarter of fiscal 1999, we implemented a plan to
restructure certain of our operations, which included outsourcing our domestic
manufacturing operations. We recorded approximately $4 million of employee
severance and outplacement expenses to reduce the workforce by approximately 5%
in both domestic and international operations. We recorded approximately $1
million for excess facilities and equipment from the abandonment of our
manufacturing facility lease. As of March 31, 1999, these activities were
substantially completed. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Form 10-K.

There were no acquisition, restructuring and other expenses incurred in fiscal
1998.

In fiscal 1997, we recorded total acquisition charges of approximately $1
million in connection with the acquisition of Fast Track. We also recorded a
charge of approximately $3 million for costs related to the restructuring of
certain domestic and international sales and research and development
operations, certain legal settlements and other expenses. Other charges recorded
in fiscal 1997 included approximately $2 million in connection with the
write-off of an equity investment. See Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form
10-K.

Remaining acquisition, restructuring and other expense accruals as of March 31,
1999 were approximately $4 million.

INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).
Interest income was approximately $14 million, $13 million and $7 million in
fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Interest income increased 3% in fiscal
1999 over fiscal 1998. This increase was primarily due to higher average
invested cash balances, gains on the sale of investments and interest income
received from income tax refunds. Interest income increased 83% in fiscal 1998
over fiscal 1997. This increase was due to higher average invested cash
balances.

Interest expense was approximately $2 million in 1999 and $1 million in both
fiscal 1998 and 1997. The interest expense was principally related to our
convertible subordinated debentures, which were converted in February 1999 and
Quarterdeck's subordinated notes, that were paid off in March 1999. See Note 6
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Other income (expense) is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains
and losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency
exchange gains and losses accounted for approximately $2 million in income in
1999, which primarily resulted from the payoff of an intercompany loan. In
fiscal 1998 there was less than $1 million in expense and in 1997 there was
approximately $2 million in expense.

INCOME, NET OF EXPENSE, FROM SALE OF TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCT LINES. Income from
sale of technologies and product lines was approximately $41 million, $45
million and $9 million for the fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
This income is related to the sale of our electronic forms product line to
JetForm Corporation and our network administration technologies to
Hewlett-Packard, both of which took place in fiscal 1997. For fiscal 1997 the
income is net of expenses related to the sale of these technologies and product
lines, which is comprised of approximately $8 million for the write-off of
purchased intangibles and developed software costs and approximately $3 million
in legal , accounting and other expenses. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

INCOME TAXES.
Our effective tax rate on income before income taxes for fiscal 1999, excluding
charges for acquired in-process research and development expenses, was 32%. Our
effective tax rate was 24% and 14% for fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively. Our
1999 income tax rate of 32% is lower than the U.S. federal and state combined
statutory rate of





                                       22
<PAGE>   25

40% primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate for our Irish operations. The
effective tax rate for fiscal 1998 and 1997 was lower due to the utilization of
previously unbenefitted losses and credits.

Our tax provision for fiscal 1999 consists of two items: 1) a $35 million tax
provision (or 32% effective tax rate) on income before income taxes of $110
million, which excludes a $27 million charge for acquired in-process research
and development expenses and 2) a $2 million tax benefit on the $27 million
charge for in-process research and development. We have established a valuation
allowance for the portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to the acquired
in-process research and development expenses that is not expected to be realized
within five years.

Realization of the $28 million of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our
ability to generate sufficient future U.S. taxable income. Based on our forecast
of U.S. earnings, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will
realize this asset. The net deferred tax asset includes a valuation allowance of
approximately $30 million. Approximately $21 million of the valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets is attributable to unbenefitted stock option deductions,
the benefit of which we will credit to equity when realized. Approximately $7
million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to
the charge for acquired in-process research and development expenses, the
benefit of which we do not expect to realize within five years. The remaining $2
million of the valuation allowance represents net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards of various acquired companies that are limited by separate return
limitations under the "change of ownership" rules of Internal Revenue Code
Section 382.

We project our effective tax rate to be 32% in fiscal 2000. This rate is lower
than the expected U.S. federal and state combined statutory rate of 40% due
primarily to a lower tax rate from our Irish operations. However, this
projection is subject to change due to fluctuations in and the geographic
allocation of earnings. See Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Fluctuations in Quarterly
Operating Results; Foreign Operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments
decreased approximately $63 million to $197 million at the end of fiscal 1999
from $260 million at the end of fiscal 1998. This decrease was largely due to
the acquisitions of Quarterdeck, Binary and Intel's and IBM's anti-virus
businesses and the repurchase of approximately 3 million shares of our stock
during the September and December quarters.

Quarterdeck had issued $25 million of 6% convertible senior subordinated notes,
or Notes, due in 2001. These Notes were issued to an institutional investor in a
private placement pursuant to the terms of a Note Agreement dated March 1, 1996.
These Notes were paid in full on March 30, 1999.

In addition to cash, short-term investments and long-term investments of $197
million, we have approximately $71 million of restricted investments related to
collateral requirements under lease agreements entered into by us during fiscal
1997 and 1999. In accordance with the lease terms, these funds are not available
to meet operating cash requirements. In addition, we are obligated to comply
with certain financial covenants. Future acquisitions may cause us to be in
violation of these financial covenants.

Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $124 million and was
comprised of our net income of approximately $50 million, plus non-cash related
expenses of $57 million and a net increase in assets and liabilities of $17
million.

Net trade accounts receivable increased $11 million to approximately $76 million
and to 39 days sales outstanding at March 31, 1999 from approximately $65
million and 38 days sales outstanding at March 31, 1998.

On June 9, 1998, the Board of Directors of Symantec authorized the repurchase of
up to 5% of our outstanding common stock before December 31, 1998. The
repurchased shares were used for employee stock purchase programs and option
grants. We completed the repurchase as of October 31, 1998, repurchasing
approximately 3 million shares for approximately $56 million at prices ranging
from $13.10 to $27.21 per share.

As of March 31, 1999, we were in compliance with all covenants under our bank
line of credit agreement. There were no borrowings under this line and we had
less than $1 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this line.
Future acquisitions may cause us to be in violation of the line of credit
covenants. However, we believe that if the line of credit was canceled or
amounts were not available under the line, there would not be a material adverse
impact on the liquidity or capital resources of the Company.

If we were to sustain significant losses, we could be required to reduce
operating expenses, which could result in:

     o  product delays;

     o  reassessment of acquisition opportunities, which could negatively impact
        our growth objectives; and/or

     o  the requirement to pursue further financing options.

We believe that existing cash and short-term investments and cash generated from
operating results will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In October 1997 and March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
("AcSEC") issued Statements of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue
Recognition," and SOP 98-4, "Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition," respectively, which provide guidance on
applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on
software transactions and were effective for Symantec beginning with the June
30, 1998 quarter. In December 1998, AcSEC issued SOP 98-9, which amends certain
provisions of SOP 97-2 and extends the deferral of the application of certain
passages of SOP 97-2 provided by SOP 98-4 until the beginning of Symantec's
fiscal 2000. Symantec early adopted SOP 98-9 for its financial statements and
related disclosures beginning in the March 1999 quarter. SOP 98-9 did not have a
material affect on our results.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities" which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities. SFAS No. 133 will be effective for Symantec at the beginning of the
June 2000 quarter for both annual and interim reporting periods. Symantec is
evaluating the potential impact of this accounting pronouncement on required
disclosures and accounting practices.

AcSec issued its SOP 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed
For or Obtained for Internal-Use, under which, qualifying computer software
costs incurred during the application development stage are required to be
capitalized and amortized to expense over the software's estimated useful life.
Symantec adopted SOP 98-1 for its financial statements and related disclosures
in fiscal 1999. SOP 98-1 did not materially affect our results.

BUSINESS RISK FACTORS

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual
results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
factors include, among others things, those risk factors set forth in this
section and elsewhere in this report. We identify forward-looking statements by
words such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue"
or similar terms that refer to the future. We cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements.

OUR EARNINGS AND STOCK PRICE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. Due to the
factors noted below, our earnings and stock price have been and may continue to
be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. We have
previously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected
by securities analysts and investors, which have had an immediate and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. This may
occur again in the future.

OUR INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND WE WILL NEED TO
ADAPT OUR DEVELOPMENT TO THESE CHANGES. We participate in a highly dynamic
industry characterized by rapid change and uncertainty related to new and
emerging technologies and markets. The recent trend toward server-based
applications in networks and applications distributed over the Internet could
have a material adverse affect on sales of our products. Future technology or
market changes may cause certain of our products to become obsolete more quickly
than expected.

The use of a Web browser, running on either a PC or network computer, to access
client/server systems is emerging as an alternative to traditional desktop
access through operating systems that are resident on personal computers. If the
functionality associated with this type of system access reduce the need for our
products, our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely
affected.





                                       24
<PAGE>   27

THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND WE EXPECT THAT
COMPETITION WILL CONTINUE AND MAY INCREASE. The microcomputer software market is
intensely competitive and is subject to rapid changes in technology. It is
influenced by the strategic direction of major microcomputer hardware
manufacturers and operating system providers. Our competitiveness depends on our
ability to enhance existing products and to offer successful new products on a
timely basis. We have limited resources and must restrict product development
efforts to a relatively small number of projects. See Item 1:
Business-Competition, for examples of key competitors for our products in each
of our business units.

Many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing
and technological resources than we do. We believe that competition in the
industry will continue to intensify as most major software companies expand
their product lines into additional product categories.

INTRODUCTION OF NEW OPERATING SYSTEMS MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR
FINANCIAL RESULTS AND STOCK price. The release and subsequent customer
acceptance of current or enhanced operating systems are particularly important
events that increase the uncertainty and volatility of our results. If we are
unable to successfully and timely develop products that operate under existing
or new operating systems, or if pending or actual releases of the new operating
systems delay the purchase of our products, our future net revenues and
operating results could be materially adversely affected.

Microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities into Windows 95, including:

     o  telecommunications capabilities;

     o  facsimile capabilities, which were later dropped from Windows 98; and

     o  data recovery utilities.

Microsoft has included additional product features in Windows 98, including:

     o  enhanced disk repair;

     o  disk defragmentation;

     o  system file maintenance;

     o  ISDN support; and

     o  PPTP virtual private networking.

Inclusions of features such as these and any additional features by Microsoft in
new versions of Windows, including Windows 2000 and Windows 98 Second Edition,
may decrease the demand for certain of our products, including those currently
under development and products specifically intended for Windows 2000.

Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system was introduced during the June 1998
quarter and Windows 98 Second Edition is anticipated to be introduced at the end
of 1999. We believe that weak retail software sales during the June and
September 1998 quarters compared to the March 1998 quarter may have been due, in
part, to the release of Windows 98 at the end of the June 1998 quarter. Our
ability to generate revenue from many of our current products and products
currently under development could be less than anticipated in future periods due
to reported incompatibilities by end-users and delays in the purchase of our
products as end-users first deploy Windows 98 and Windows 98 Second Edition. In
addition, we may face declining sales following Microsoft's introduction of
Windows 2000, which was formerly known as Windows NT 5.0, currently scheduled
for the end of 1999.

Our financial results and our stock price declined significantly within
approximately 6 months after the releases of Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows
98, which in some cases also caused the additional requirement for hardware
upgrades, resulting in shifts in customer spending from software to hardware. We
could face adverse financial results and additional stock price declines
following future releases of operating systems.

Additionally, as hardware vendors incorporate additional server-based network
management and security tools into network operating systems, the demand may
decrease for some of our products, including those currently under development.
Moreover, functionality previously provided only by software may be incorporated
directly into hardware, potentially reducing demand for our products.
Furthermore, our competitors may license certain of their products to Microsoft
and OEMs for inclusion with their operating systems, add-on products or
hardware, which may also reduce the demand for certain of our products.





                                       25
<PAGE>   28

Shifts in customer spending from software to hardware as the result of
technological advancements in hardware or price reductions of hardware have in
the past and may in the future, result in reduced revenues which have had and
would have a material adverse affect on operating results.

THE TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE
EFFECTIVELY. Consolidation in the software industry continues to occur, with
competing companies merging or acquiring other companies in order to capture
market share or expand product lines. As this consolidation occurs, the nature
of the market may change as a result of fewer players dominating particular
markets, potentially providing consumers with fewer choices. Also, some of these
companies offer a broader range of products than Symantec, ranging from desktop
to enterprise solutions. We may not be able to compete effectively against these
competitors. Any of these changes may have a significant adverse effect on our
future revenues and operating results.

Furthermore, we use strategic acquisitions, as necessary, to acquire technology,
people and products for our overall product strategy. We have completed a number
of acquisitions and dispositions of technologies, companies and products and may
acquire and dispose of other technologies, companies and products in the future.
The trend toward consolidation in our industry may result in increased
competition in acquiring these technologies, people or products, resulting in
increase acquisition costs or the inability to acquire the desired technologies,
people or products.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY ADAPT TO CHANGES IN THE DYNAMIC TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT OF
THE INTERNET IN A TIMELY MANNER. Critical issues concerning the commercial use
of the Internet, including security, reliability, cost, ease of use,
accessibility, quality of service or potential tax or other government
regulation, remain unresolved and may affect the use of the Internet as a medium
to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of
our products. If we are unsuccessful in timely assimilating changes in the
Internet environment into our business operations and product development
efforts, our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely
affected.

WE FACE INTENSE PRICE BASED COMPETITION FOR SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. Price
competition is often intense in the microcomputer software market, especially
for utility and anti-virus products. Many of our competitors have significantly
reduced the price of utility and anti-virus products. Price competition may
continue to increase and become even more significant in the future, resulting
in reduced profit margins. If competitive pressures in the industry continue to
increase in regards to utility and anti-virus products, we may be required to
reduce prices and/or increase our spending on sales, marketing and research and
development of these products as a percentage of net revenues, resulting in
lower profit margins. These actions may be insufficient to offset the impact of
price competition on our business and net revenues, and may result in reduced
revenue, income and available cash.

THE TRANSITION TO INTEGRATED SUITES OF UTILITIES MAY RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES.
Symantec and our competitors now provide integrated suites of utility products.
The price of integrated utility suites is significantly less than the total
price of stand-alone products that are included in these utility suites when
sold separately. As a result of the shift to integrated utility suites, price
competition is intense and we have experienced cannibalization of our
stand-alone products that are included within the suite. As a result, there may
be a negative impact on our revenues and operating income from selling
integrated utility suites rather than individual products, as the lower price of
integrated utility suites may not be offset by increases in the total volume of
utility suites sold. Additionally, our products may not compete effectively with
competitors' products or integrated utility suites introduced in the future.

OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS. While
our diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net
revenues, these fluctuations have occurred and may occur in the future.
Fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors, including:

     o  the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of
        our products and product upgrades;

     o  the introduction of competitive products by existing or new competitors;

     o  reduced demand for any given product;

     o  seasonality in the end-of-period buying patterns of foreign and domestic
        software markets; and

     o  the market's transition between operating systems.

A significant proportion of our revenues are generated during the last month of
the quarter. Most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the
end of the fiscal quarter. In addition, many corporate customers negotiate site
licenses near the end of each quarter. In part, this is because these two groups
are able, or believe that they are able, to negotiate lower prices and more
favorable terms. Our reliance on a large proportion of revenue occurring at the
end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that
occur at the end of the quarter results in





                                       26
<PAGE>   29

increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues. Due to this end-of-period
buying pattern, forecasts may not be achieved, either because expected sales do
not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less
favorable to us. In addition, these factors increase the chances that our
results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts.

ABSENCE OF BACKLOG MAY IMPACT OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate with
relatively little backlog. Therefore, if near-term demand for our products
weakens in a given quarter, there could be an immediate, material reduction in
net revenues, which would likely result in a significant and precipitous drop in
our stock price. We have not experienced any difficulties in acquiring material
or delays in production of our software and related documentation and packaging.
We normally ship products within one week after receiving an order and do not
consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance. However,
shortages may occur in the future.

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL. A large portion of our
sales are made through the retail distribution channel, which is subject to
events that create unpredictable fluctuations in consumer demand. Our retail
distribution customers also carry our competitors' products. These retail
distributors may have limited capital to invest in inventory. Their decisions to
purchase our products are partly a function of pricing, terms and special
promotions offered by us and our competitors, over which we have no control and
which we cannot predict.

Our agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be
terminated by the distributors or by us without cause. Some distributors and
resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past. Distributors that
account for a significant portion of our sales may experience financial
difficulties in the future. When our distributors have experienced financial
difficulties in the past, we have successfully moved these inventories to other
distributors. However, we may not be able to do so in the future. If these
distributors do experience financial difficulties and we are unable to move
their inventories to other distributors, we may experience reduced sales or
increased write-offs, which would adversely affect our operating results.

WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN UTILIZING NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. We currently
offer a broad range of products and services over the Internet. We may not be
able to effectively adapt our existing, or adopt new, methods of distributing
our software products utilizing the rapidly evolving Internet and related
technologies. The adoption of new channels may adversely impact existing
channels and/or product pricing, which may reduce our future revenues and
profitability.

CHANNEL FILL MAY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES. Our pattern of net revenues and
earnings may be affected by "channel fill." Distributors may fill their
distribution channels in anticipation of price increases, sales promotions or
incentives. Distributors, dealers and end users often delay purchases, cancel
orders or return products in anticipation of the availability of the new version
or new product. As a result, distributor inventories may decrease between the
date we announce a new version or new product and the date of release. Channels
may also become filled simply because the distributors do not sell their
inventories to retail distribution or retailers to end users as anticipated. If
sales to retailers or end-users do not occur at a sufficient rate, distributors
will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases
in order to reduce their inventories.

The impact of channel fill is somewhat mitigated by our deferral of revenue
associated with distributor and reseller inventories estimated to be in excess
of appropriate levels. However, net revenues may still be materially affected
favorably or adversely by the effects of channel fill, particularly in periods
where a large number of new products are simultaneously introduced.

PRODUCT RETURNS MAY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES. Product returns can occur when we
introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or
retailers have excess inventories. Our return policy allows distributors,
subject to various limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new
products or for credit towards future purchases. End users may return our
products through dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the
date of purchase for a full refund. In addition, retailers may return older
versions of our products. We estimate and maintain reserves for product returns.
However, future returns could exceed the reserves we have established, which
could have a material adverse affect on our operating results.

OUR INCREASED SALES OF SITE LICENSES MAY INCREASE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL
RESULTS AND COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. We sell corporate site licenses through
the distribution channel and through corporate resellers. We are increasingly
emphasizing sales to corporations and small businesses through volume licensing
agreements. These licensing arrangements tend to involve a longer sales cycle
than sales through other distribution channels, require greater investment of
resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and can sometimes result
in lower operating





                                       27
<PAGE>   30

margins. The timing of the execution of volume licenses, or their nonrenewal or
renegotiation by large customers, could cause our results of operations to vary
significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact
on our results of operations. In addition, if the corporate marketplace grows
and becomes a larger component of the overall marketplace, we may not be
successful in expanding our corporate segment to take advantage of this growth.

WE OFTEN DEPEND ON JOINT BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. We have
entered into various development or joint business arrangements for the purpose
of developing new software products and enhancements to existing software
products as well as creating a presence in new markets. We may continue this
strategy in the future. Depending on the nature of each such arrangement, the
development, distribution, sale or marketing of the resulting product may be
controlled either by us or by our business partner. The products that result
from joint business arrangements may not be technologically successful, may not
achieve market acceptance and/or may not be able to compete with products either
currently in the market or introduced in the future.

WE DEPEND ON DISTRIBUTION BY VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE
VENDORS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES. We distribute some of our
products through value-added resellers and independent software vendors under
arrangements through which our products are included with these resellers' and
vendors' hardware products prior to sale by them through retail channels. These
licensing agreements are generally non-exclusive and do not require these
resellers or vendors to make minimum purchases. If we are unsuccessful in
maintaining our current relationships and securing license agreements with
additional value-added resellers and independent software vendors, or if these
resellers and vendors are unsuccessful in selling their products, our future net
revenues and operating results may be adversely affected.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS. We have completed a
number of acquisitions including four acquisitions in fiscal 1999 and may
acquire other companies and technology in the future. Acquisitions involve a
number of special risks, including:

     o  difficulties of integrating the operations of the acquired companies in
        an efficient and timely manner;

     o  diversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations;

     o  potential disruption of our existing businesses;

     o  difficulties in successfully incorporating acquired technologies with
        our existing products;

     o  difficulties of integration, training, retention and motivation of key
        employees of the acquired company;

     o  the burden of presenting a unified corporate image; and

     o  obstacles to the integration of acquired products, research and
        development and sales efforts.

In addition, because the employees of acquired companies have frequently
remained in their existing geographically diverse locations, we have not
achieved certain economies of scale that we might otherwise have realized.
Further economies of scale may not be realized in the future.

We may need to secure financing to pay for future acquisitions. Acquisition
financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We typically incur
significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions. Future acquisitions
may have a significant adverse impact on our future profitability and financial
resources.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. We transact a significant
portion of our revenues, manufacturing costs and operating expenses outside of
the United States, often in foreign currencies. As a result, our operating
results may be materially and adversely affected by:

     o  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

     o  increases in duty rates;

     o  exchange or price controls or other repatriation restrictions on foreign
        currencies;

     o  political and economic instability;

     o  government regulations;

     o  import restrictions;

     o  economic volatility; and

     o  reduced protection for the Company's copyrights and trademarks in
        certain jurisdictions.

We utilize natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency transaction
exposure. We also hedge certain residual balance sheet positions through the use
of one-month forward contracts. These strategies may be ineffective in the
future. We may be unsuccessful in accurately forecasting transaction gains or
losses. We expect an increase of our





                                       28
<PAGE>   31

activities that are not denominated in U.S. dollars in the future. If there are
continued fluctuations in the currency markets, our revenues could be materially
and adversely affected.

INCREASED UTILIZATION AND COSTS OF OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES MAY ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. Technical support costs comprise a significant
portion of our operating costs and expenses as with many companies in the
software industry. We base our technical support levels, in a large part, on
projections of future sales levels. Over the short term, we may be unable to
respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services. We also may be
unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in
support services provided by competitors. While we perform extensive quality
control review over the technical support services provided by our corporate
personnel and, to a lesser extent, over the support services outsourced to
third-party vendors, customers may be dissatisfied with these services. If we
have not satisfied our customers technical support needs, future product and
upgrade sales to these customers may be reduced.

THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE UNCERTAIN. We believe
that we will need to make significant research and development expenditures to
remain competitive. While we perform extensive usability and beta testing of new
products, the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future
may not be technologically successful. If they are not technologically
successful, our resulting products may not achieve market acceptance and our
products may not compete effectively with products of our competitors currently
in the market or introduced in the future.

THE LENGTH OF THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLE IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. The length
of our product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally
expected. Although such delays have undoubtedly had a material adverse affect on
our business and because we are unable to predict the amount of net revenues
that would have been obtained had the original development expectations been
met, we are unable to quantify the magnitude of net revenues that were deferred
or lost as a result of any particular delay. We are likely to experience delays
in future product development. These delays could have a material adverse affect
on the amount and timing of future revenues. Due to the inherent uncertainties
of software development projects, we do not generally disclose or announce the
specific expected shipment dates of our product introductions.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADJUST EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN REVENUES. As with many
companies in the software industry, our employee and facility related
expenditures comprise a significant portion of our operating expenses. We base
our expense levels, in a large part, on projections of future revenue levels.
Due to the fixed nature of these expenses over the short term, if revenue levels
fall below expectations, our operating results are likely to be significantly
adversely affected.

WE MUST MANAGE AND RESTRUCTURE OUR EXPANDING OPERATIONS EFFECTIVELY. We
continually evaluate our product and corporate strategy. We have in the past
undertaken and will in the future undertake organizational changes and/or
product and marketing strategy modifications. These changes and modifications
are designed to:

     o  maximize market penetration;

     o  maximize use of limited corporate resources;

     o  develop new products; and

     o  develop new product channels.

These organizational changes increase the risk that objectives will not be met
due to the allocation of valuable limited resources to implement changes.
Further, due to the uncertain nature of any of these undertakings, these efforts
may not be successful and the Company may not realize any benefit from these
efforts.

WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL WHILE COMPETITION FOR PERSONNEL IN OUR
INDUSTRY IS INTENSE. We believe that our future success will depend in part on
our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and
technical personnel. Competition in recruiting personnel in the software
industry is intense. We may be unable to attract or retain our key employees or
to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees. We have from
time to time in the past experienced and we expect in the future to experience
difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled employees with appropriate
qualifications. To accomplish this, we believe that we must provide personnel
with a competitive compensation package, including stock options, which requires
ongoing stockholder approval.

WE DEPEND ON OUR INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE DISRUPTED. Our
order entry and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed. If our
communications between these centers are disrupted, particularly at the end of a
fiscal quarter, we will suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a
resulting adverse impact on our





                                       29
<PAGE>   32

operating results. If communications and Internet connectivity are disrupted,
disruptions in communications and Internet connectivity may also cause delays in
customer access to our Internet-based services or product sales. A business
disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in
service by communications carriers and may cause delays in product development
that could adversely impact our future net revenues.

WE RELY ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. We regard our software
as proprietary and underlying technology as proprietary. We seek to protect our
proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and
copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws. However, we do not employ
technology to prevent copying of our products. Despite our precautionary
measures, third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and
use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar
technology independently. All of our products are protected by copyright and we
have a number of patents and patent applications pending. We may not achieve the
desired protection from, and third parties may design around, our patents. In
addition, existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection.
Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of
protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the United States. Any legal
action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive
and may distract management from day-to-day operations.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION WHICH COULD, AND ANY FUTURE LITIGATION MAY, AFFECT
OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. From time to time, we may be subject to claims that we
have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, that our products are
not Year 2000 compliant or other product liability claims, or other claims
incidental to our business. We are involved in a number of judicial and
administrative proceedings incidental to our business. For a more complete
discussion of our current litigation, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We intend to defend and/or pursue all of
these lawsuits vigorously. We may suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more
of the cases. We do not expect the final resolution of these lawsuits to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, individually or in the
aggregate. However, depending on the amount and timing of unfavorable
resolutions of these lawsuits, our future results of operations or cash flows
could be materially adversely affected in a particular period.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION
We believe that software developers will become increasingly subject to claims
of intellectual property infringement as the number of software products in the
industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap. In
addition, an increasing number of patents are being issued that may apply to
software. Allegations of patent infringement are becoming increasingly common in
the software industry. We are unable to ascertain all possible patent
infringement claims because:

     o  new patents are being issued continually;

     o  the subject of patent applications is confidential until a patent is
        issued; and

     o  when a patent has been issued, the potential applicability of the patent
        to a particular software product is not apparent.

We have been involved in disputes claiming patent infringement in the past and
are currently involved in a number of patent disputes and litigation. We believe
we, like other companies that obtain some of their products through publishing
agreements or acquisitions, face potentially greater risks of infringement
claims since we have less direct control over the development of those products.
Although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, they are
expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from
day-to-day operations. If a third party alleges that we have infringed their
intellectual property rights, we may choose to litigate the claim and/or seek an
appropriate license from the third party. If we engage in litigation and the
third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is
not available on reasonable terms, our business, operating results and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected.

YEAR 2000 - PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION
We believe the software products that we currently develop and actively market
are Year 2000 compliant for significantly all functionality. However, these
products could contain errors or defects related to the Year 2000. In addition,
earlier versions of our products, those that are not the most currently released
or are not currently being developed, may not be Year 2000 compliant. We have
sold some of our older product lines, which are not being actively developed and
updated. These older products are also not necessarily Year 2000 compliant and
will no longer be sold after June 29, 1999.





                                       30
<PAGE>   33

We are currently party to a lawsuit related to the alleged inability of
pre-version 4.0 Norton AntiVirus products to function properly in respect to
Year 2000. We believe that this lawsuit has no merit and we intend to defend
against this claim vigorously. We do not expect the final resolution of this
lawsuit to have a material adverse affect on the results of operations and
financial condition of the Company. However, depending on the amount and timing
of an unfavorable resolution of this lawsuit, our future results of operations
or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period.

SOFTWARE DEFECTS AND PRODUCT LIABILITY
Software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first
introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. For example, in
the past, our anti-virus software products have incorrectly detected viruses
that do not exist. We have not experienced any material adverse effects
resulting from any of these defects or errors to date and we test our products
prior to release. Nonetheless, defects and errors could be found in current
versions of our products, future upgrades to current products or newly developed
and released products. Software defects could result in delays in market
acceptance or unexpected reprogramming costs, which could materially adversely
affect our operating results. Most of our license agreements with customers
contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability
claims. It is possible, however, that these provisions limiting our liability
may not be valid as a result of federal, state, local or foreign laws or
ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions. A successful product liability
claim could have a material adverse affect on Symantec's business, operating
results and financial condition.

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND WEB SITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTENTIONAL DISRUPTION.
While we have not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to
impede the performance of the our products, such viruses could be created and
deployed against our products in the future. Similarly, experienced computer
programmers, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the
security of our web site from time to time. A hacker who penetrates our network
or web site could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions
of our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and
resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by virus creators
and hackers.

THE CONVERSION OF THE EUROPEAN CURRENCIES TO THE EURO MAY IMPACT OUR FOREIGN
EXCHANGE HEDGING PROGRAM. On January 1, 1999, the euro became the common
currency of 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union. The national
currencies of these 11 countries will coexist with the euro at fixed exchange
rates through December 31, 2001. Euro denominated bills and coins will be
introduced on January 1, 2002 and, by July 1, 2002, the national currencies will
no longer be legal tender.

We established a euro task force to address the business implications of the
euro. The task force implemented changes to our system and processes in order to
be euro-ready on January 1, 1999. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the
euro and expect to make further changes to accommodate doing business in the
euro.

We expect that the euro will dictate changes in our foreign exchange hedging
program. These changes may lead to increased fluctuations in foreign currency
hedging results. Based on current information, we do not believe that the euro
will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER
BEHAVIOR RESULTING FROM YEAR 2000 PREPARATION. With the emerging requirements on
Year 2000 compliance and functionality, many enterprise customers may use their
Information Technology budgets in 1999 to focus on Year 2000 issues. In
addition, our customer's Information Technology organizations may be unwilling
to deploy new software until after the Year 2000 in order to reduce the
complexity of any changes in their systems required by any actual Year 2000
failures. Either of these factors could reduce sales of our products and could
have an adverse affect on revenues.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE DISRUPTION OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR
2000. We have completed a major evaluation of our internal applications, systems
and databases. We are modifying or replacing portions of our hardware and
associated software to enable our operational systems and networks to function
properly with respect to dates leading up to January 1, 2000 and thereafter. We
continue to evaluate interfaces between our systems and third-party systems,
such as those of key suppliers, distributors and financial institutions, for
Year 2000 functionality. In addition, the systems of other companies with which
we do business may not address Year 2000 problems on a timely basis. We expect
the process of evaluating third-party Year 2000 compliance to be an ongoing
process. We are





                                       31
<PAGE>   34

evaluating Year 2000 exposures of our key suppliers, as well as our buildings
and related facilities. We expect that the costs to complete the Year 2000
project to be approximately $2 million and will be expensed as incurred.

Our Year 2000 Project is divided into several phases:

     Assessment - where the vulnerability of the hardware, software, process or
     service element is identified.

     Planning - where corrective action is determined for each vulnerable
     element.

     Remediation and Unit Test - where the corrective action is taken and
     initial testing is performed.

     Limited System Test - where related elements are tested together, using
     dates in the vulnerable range and any necessary follow-up remediation is
     completed.

We track the progress of the Year 2000 on a sub-project level. The following
table is a summary of the completion status and currently expected completion
date of each phase for each sub-project. The expected completion dates are
subject to the risks and uncertainties of locating and correcting errors in
complex computer systems. The actual dates on which we complete each phase may
vary significantly. Some sub-project completion dates have shifted since our
last 10-Q filing. We have realized that our principal software vendor will be
providing delayed Year 2000 patches throughout 1999. These patches need to be
tested before installing them into our environment. In order to optimize the
usage of our special test environment and people resources, we have
conservatively extended our Limited Systems Test phase. Again, we realized that
some of our primary hardware vendors would continue to supply delayed Year 2000
fixes through 1999 and therefore we will need to prepare accordingly. Building
and related facilities dates were modified to address the resources involved in
the physical move of our World Headquarters in the latter half of 1999. We
believe that these conservative date modifications will not impair our ability
to remain in business before, throughout and beyond the transition into the new
millenium. Periodic updates regarding the Year 2000 status are provided to both
the Executive Staff and Board of Directors.

If our electric power or telephone services are interrupted for significant
periods, some of our facilities might be unable to operate. We maintain business
recovery plans for our major locations to provide for an orderly response to
various disaster scenarios. We are reviewing and augmenting these plans to
provide contingency plans for potential internal and external Year 2000 related
problems. We have scheduled completion of the analysis and the associated
contingency plans for September 1999.

We believe that, following our conversion to new software and modifications of
existing computer hardware and software, we will not suffer significant
operational problems with our computer systems due to the Year 2000. However, if
we are unable to complete remaining modifications and conversions in a timely
manner, Year 2000 noncompliance might materially adversely impact our
operations. Because testing of the Year 2000 functionality of our systems must
occur in a simulated environment, we are unable to test fully all Year 2000
interfaces and capabilities prior to the Year 2000.

We have not deferred any other information systems projects as a result of our
focus on Year 2000 compliance issues. We believe that our exposure from Year
2000 issues is not material to our business as a whole. However, if certain key
suppliers or distributors should suffer business interruptions due to Year 2000
problems, we could be forced to delay product shipments.

ITEM 7A:   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates because of the
low levels of marketable securities on our balance sheet. We do not undertake
any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not
a party to any interest rate risk management transactions. We do not purchase or
hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY. As of March 31, 1999, the fair market value of our
financial instruments with exposure to interest risk was approximately $249
million. Sensitivity analysis for a six-month horizon was performed on our
floating rate and fixed rate financial investments and floating rate
liabilities. Parallel shifts in the yield curve of both +/-50 basis point
(+/-10% of our weighted average interest rate) would result in fair market
values for investments of approximately $255 million as well as with a 50 basis
point increase and 50 basis point decrease in interest rates. Fair market values
of floating rate financial obligations would increase by less than $1 million
for a 50 basis point rise and decrease by less than $1 million with a 50 basis
point decrease in interest rates.

EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY.
We conduct business in 31 international currencies through our worldwide
operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program, utilizing
foreign currency forward exchange contracts, or forward contracts, of one fiscal
month duration to hedge various foreign currency transaction exposures. Under
this program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are
offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts to mitigate the risk of
material foreign currency transaction losses. We do not use forward contracts
for trading purposes. At the end of each fiscal month, all foreign currency
assets and liabilities are revalued using the month end spot rate of the
maturing forward contracts and the realized gains and losses are recorded and
included in net income as a component of other income (expense).

We believe that the use of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce
the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets. We
employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial
instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

We use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact market risk exposure may have
on the fair market values of our financial instruments. The financial
instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of our foreign
currency assets and liabilities and all derivative instruments, principally
forward contracts.

The sensitivity analysis assesses the risk of loss in fair market values from
the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange
rates and interest rates yield curves on market sensitive instruments over a six
month horizon. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption
that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of
changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency.

As of March 31, 1999, the net fair value liability of our financial instruments
with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately $86 million. A 10%
movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.
dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments
by approximately $8 million or an increase in the fair value of our financial
instruments by approximately $9 million.

This quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign
exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact
of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and
firm commitments.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Symantec Corporation


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Symantec
Corporation as of March 31, 1999 and 1998 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 1999. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Symantec
Corporation at March 31, 1999 and 1998 and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Business
Symantec is a world leader in utility software for business and personal
computing. Our products and solutions make users productive and keep their
computers safe and reliable anywhere and anytime. Founded in 1982, we have
offices in 26 countries worldwide.

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Symantec Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Basis of Presentation
During the March 1999 quarter, we acquired Quarterdeck. During the September
1998 quarter, we acquired Intel's anti-virus business. During the June 1998
quarter, we acquired IBM's anti-virus business and Binary's operations. See Note
3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Each of these
acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating
results have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the
respective dates of acquisition.

During fiscal 1998, no companies were acquired by Symantec. During fiscal 1997
and 1996, we acquired Delrina Corporation and Fast Track, Inc. in transactions
accounted for as poolings of interests. All financial information has been
restated to reflect the combined operations of Symantec and the acquired
entities. The results of operations of Fast Track were not material to our
consolidated financial statements and therefore, amounts prior to the year of
acquisition were not combined with Symantec's financial statements.

On January 6, 1999, we received a comment letter from the Securities and
Exchange Commission with respect to our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1998 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1998. The
comment letter contained questions related to accounting for certain
acquisitions, including questions related to the write-off of associated
in-process research and development costs. We re-evaluated the Binary and IBM
transactions and the related in-process research and development costs as well
as the other questions raised in the comment letter. As a result, final
operating results for the quarters ended June, September and December 1998 and
the related year-to-date amounts were restated for the adjustments made to our
acquisitions of Binary and IBM's anti-virus business. In addition, we have
reclassified our financial results related to the sales of our electronic forms
product line to JetForm Corporation and our network administration technologies
to Hewlett-Packard Corporation from revenue to income, net of expense, from sale
of technologies and product lines. Although there was no impact to our net
income, we have restated our fiscal 1998 and 1997 financials to reflect these
reclassifications from revenue to non-operating income.

Symantec has a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as
of and for the periods ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended April 2, 1999, April 3, 1998 and March 28, 1997,
respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended April 2, 1999 and March 28, 1997
each comprised 52 weeks of operations and the fiscal accounting year ended April
3, 1998 comprised 53 weeks of operations.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using
the exchange rate on the balance sheet dates. The cumulative translation
adjustments resulting from this process are shown separately as a component of
stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated using average
exchange rates prevailing during the year. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the determination of net income.

Revenue Recognition
Under Statement of Positions (SOP) 97-2 as modified by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, we
recognize revenue upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of
software to the customer, determination that there are no significant
post-delivery obligations and collection of a fixed or determinable license fee
is considered probable.





                                       52
<PAGE>   55

SYMANTEC CORPORATION
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED



We defer revenue relating to all distribution and reseller channel inventory in
excess of defined inventory levels in these channels. We offer the right of
return of its products under various policies. We estimate and maintain reserves
for product returns. Under SOP 97-2, we recognize revenue upon shipment when no
significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the receivable, net of
provisions for estimated returns, is probable.

Revenues related to significant post-contract support agreements (generally
product maintenance agreements) are deferred and recognized over the period of
the agreements. The estimated cost for providing insignificant post-contract
support (generally telephone support) is accrued at the time of the sale and is
included in sales and marketing expense.

Royalty revenues are recognized as earned unless collection of such revenues is
not assured. When collection is not assured, revenues are recognized as payments
are received.

Cash Equivalents, Investments and Restricted Investments
Symantec considers investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an
original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. All of our cash
equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and restricted
investments are classified as available-for-sale as of the balance sheet dates.
These securities are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and
losses are included in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and
declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in interest
income. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification
method.

Derivative Financial Instruments
Symantec utilizes natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency exposures and
hedges certain residual exposures through the use of one-month foreign exchange
forward contracts. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with
financial institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange risks associated
with certain balance sheet positions. Gains and losses on the contracts are
included in other income (loss) in the period as gains and losses on the
underlying transactions are recognized and generally offset. The fair value of
foreign currency exchange forward contracts approximates cost due to the short
maturity periods.

Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally
determined using currently adjusted standards, which approximate actual cost on
a first-in, first-out basis.

Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally the shorter of the lease term or three to seven years.

Purchased product rights and capitalized software
Purchased product rights, technologies and capitalized software are comprised of
acquired software ("product rights") and are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years.

Goodwill
Goodwill is created through acquisitions and is stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally four to five years.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Net Income Per Share
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 128,
"Accounting for Earnings Per Share," ("SFAS 128"). SFAS 128 replaced the
calculation of primary and fully diluted net income per share with basic and
diluted net income per share.

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during





                                       53
<PAGE>   56

SYMANTEC CORPORATION

the periods. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares
during the periods. Diluted earnings per share includes the assumed conversion
of all of the outstanding convertible subordinated debentures and assumed
exercising of options, if dilutive in the period.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
Symantec's product revenues are concentrated in the personal computer software
industry, which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant
technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or the emergence
of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies, could adversely
affect operating results. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue and
net income is derived from international sales and independent agents and
distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies,
changes in local regulatory or economic conditions, piracy or nonperformance by
independent agents or distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of short-term and long-term investments,
restricted investments and trade accounts receivable. Our investment portfolio
is diversified and consists of investment grade securities. Symantec is exposed
to credit risks in the event of default by these institutions to the extent of
the amount recorded on the balance sheet. The credit risk in our trade accounts
receivable is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process,
reasonably short collection terms and the geographical dispersion of sales
transactions. We generally do not require collateral and maintain reserves for
potential credit losses and such losses have been within management's
expectations.

Legal Expenses
Symantec accrues estimated legal expenses for lawsuits only when both of the
conditions of SFAS No. 5 are met. Costs for external attorney fees are accrued
when the likelihood of the incurrence of the related costs are probable and
management has the ability to estimate such costs. If both of these conditions
are not met, management records the related legal expenses when incurred. This
policy has been consistently applied for all periods presented. The material
assumptions used to estimate the amount of legal expenses include:

     o  The monthly legal expense incurred by our external attorneys on the
        particular case being evaluated;

     o  Communication between Symantec and our external attorneys on the
        expected duration of the lawsuit and the estimated expenses during that
        time;

     o  Management's intentions regarding these lawsuits, e.g. to defend
        vigorously, take to trial, minimum amounts within the estimated range
        for which we would be willing to settle if settlement discussions were
        to occur;

     o  Deductible amounts under our insurance policies; and

     o  Past experiences with similar lawsuits.

Amounts accrued by Symantec are not discounted.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 1997 and March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
("AcSEC") issued SOP 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," and SOP 98-4,
"Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition," respectively, which provide guidance on applying generally
accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions
and were effective for Symantec beginning with the June 30, 1998 quarter. In
December 1998, AcSEC issued SOP 98-9, which amends certain provisions of SOP
97-2 and extends the deferral of the application of certain passages of SOP 97-2
provided by SOP 98-4 until the beginning of Symantec's fiscal 2000. Symantec
early adopted SOP 98-9 for its financial statements and related disclosures
beginning in the March 1999 quarter. SOP98-9 did not have a material affect on
our results.

The FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities.
SFAS No. 133 will be effective for Symantec at the beginning of the June 2000
quarter for both annual and interim reporting periods. Symantec is evaluating
the potential impact of this accounting pronouncement on required disclosures
and accounting practices.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED



AcSec issued its SOP 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed
For or Obtained for Internal-Use, under which, qualifying computer software
costs incurred during the application development stage are required to be
capitalized and amortized to expense over the software's estimated useful life.
Symantec adopted SOP 98-1 for its financial statements and related disclosures
in fiscal 1999. SOP 98-1 did not materially affect our results.

Reclassifications
Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation format with no impact on net income. All financial
information has been restated to conform to this presentation.

NOTE 3.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Effective May 18, 1998, we entered into a Master Agreement with IBM to acquire
rights to IBM's digital immune technology. In addition, we assumed the majority
of IBM's license arrangements with customers of IBM anti-virus products. In
return for the various rights we acquired from IBM, we agreed to pay $16 million
in installments over a specified period as well as pay royalties on revenues
received by us from distribution of immune-enabled Symantec products and immune
services provided by us using the digital immune technology. The royalties are
subject to specified maximums and vary by time periods with ultimate termination
of royalties as of a specified date. We also entered into a patent
cross-licensing agreement under which the parties licensed to each other their
respective patent portfolios. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase.
As of March 31, 1999, we paid IBM $8 million in cash with the remaining $8
million payable in two equal installments in August 1999 and November 1999. In
addition, we assumed liabilities of $3 million and incurred additional expenses
of approximately $1 million as part of the transaction. Under the transaction,
we recorded approximately $7 million for in-process research and development,
$12 million for goodwill and $1 million for certain prepaid research and
development and other assets. A valuation specialist used our management's
estimates to establish the amount of in-process research and development.
Goodwill will be amortized over 5 years. As of March 31, 1999, we incurred
approximately $2 million in goodwill amortization expense related to this asset.

On June 24, 1998, we purchased the operations of Binary, an Auckland, New
Zealand based company, for approximately $28 million, which included
approximately $1 million of acquisition related costs. The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase. Under the transaction, we recorded approximately $7
million for in-process research and development and $17 million for capitalized
software technology, with the remaining $4 million of the purchase price
allocated to goodwill, net tangible and intangible assets. A valuation
specialist used our management's estimates to establish the amount of in-process
research and development. The capitalized software, goodwill and intangibles are
being amortized over a 4 year period. As of March 31, 1999, we incurred
approximately $4 million of amortization expense related to these assets.

On September 28, 1998, we entered into an agreement whereby we purchased Intel
Corporation's anti-virus business for approximately $17 million. We also
licensed Intel's systems management technology. Intel will promote Norton
AntiVirus through its worldwide reseller channels. As of March 31, 1999, we had
paid approximately $12 million under the agreement. The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase. Under the transaction, we recorded approximately $5
million for in-process research and development, $11 million for capitalized
software technology and $1 million for certain intangible assets. A valuation
specialist used our management's estimates to establish the amount of in-process
research and development. The capitalized software and intangibles are being
amortized over a 5 year period. As of March 31, 1999, we incurred approximately
$1 million of amortization expense related to these assets.

On October 15, 1998, we signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire
Quarterdeck. On November 17, 1998, we completed our tender offer for the common
stock of Quarterdeck acquiring an approximately 63% interest. On March 29, 1999,
we acquired Quarterdeck's remaining shares through a cash merger at the tender
offer price of $0.52 per share in accordance with the definitive merger
agreement. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Under the
transaction, we recorded approximately $8 million of acquired in-process
research and development, $8 million of capitalized software technology, $66
million of goodwill and $3 million of other intangibles. A valuation specialist
used our management's estimates to establish the amount of in-process research
and development. As of March 31, 1999, we had incurred less than $1 million of
capitalized software amortization expense and approximately $3 million of
goodwill amortization expense related to this acquisition. The amounts related
to workforce in place is being amortized over 2 years. The capitalized software,
goodwill and other intangibles will be amortized over a 5 year period. In
addition, Quarterdeck had issued $25 million of 6% convertible senior
subordinated notes, due in 2001, to an institutional investor in a private
placement pursuant to the terms of a Note Agreement dated March 1, 1996. The
Notes were paid in full without any premium on March 30, 1999.

Symantec did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 1998. During fiscal
1997, we acquired Fast Track, Inc. in a transaction accounted for as a pooling
of interests. In conjunction with Fast Track, we issued 600,000 shares of
Symantec stock on May 28, 1996, the date of acquisition. As the results of
operations of Fast Track were not material to our consolidated financial
statements, amounts prior to the date of acquisition were not restated to
reflect the combined operations of the companies.

PRO FORMA. The following unaudited pro forma results of operations for fiscal
1999 and 1998 are as if the acquisition of Binary and Quarterdeck had occurred
at the beginning of each period presented. The pro forma information excludes
approximately $15 million of in-process research and development. The pro forma

NOTE 4.  PURCHASE PRODUCT RIGHTS AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

During fiscal 1999 we recorded approximately $46 million of purchased product
rights and technology and capitalized software, primarily related to our
acquisitions of Binary, Intel's anti-virus business and Quarterdeck. See Note 3
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Amortization of purchased product rights and capitalized software expense
totaled approximately $11 million in fiscal 1999 and $1 million in fiscal 1998.
The increase for fiscal 1999 over fiscal 1998 is primarily due to additional
amortization related to the purchase of Intel's anti-virus business and the
acquisitions of Binary and Quarterdeck. The amortization will occur over the
next 3 to 5 years. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
this Form 10-K.

In fiscal 1998, capitalization of certain software development costs in
accordance with SFAS No. 86 did not materially affect us.

In fiscal 1997, Symantec capitalized approximately $8 million of software
development costs, primarily related to network administration technology, which
was sold to Hewlett-Packard in March 1997, resulting in the write off of
approximately $7 million of unamortized costs during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1997. See Note 13 of Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Amortization expense for capitalized software development costs was
approximately $3 million in fiscal 1997.

Prior to fiscal 1997, capitalization of certain software development costs in

capitalized by Delrina prior to its acquisition by Symantec in fiscal 1996. The
related amortization expense was approximately $6 million in fiscal 1996.

NOTE 5.  CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Available-For-Sale Investments and Trading Investments
All cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and
restricted investments have been classified as available-for-sale securities,
except for $ 0.5 million of trading securities. During fiscal 1999, we
maintained a trading asset portfolio to generate returns that offset changes in
certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The trading
assets, which consist of marketable equity securities and have a fair value of
approximately $0.5 million, have been included in the available-for-sale tabular
disclosure, due to immateriality.

As of March 31, 1999 and 1998, the estimated fair value of the cash equivalents,
short-term investments and long-term investments consisted of the following:

Our available-for-sale restricted investments relate to certain collateral
requirements for lease agreements associated with our corporate facilities in
Cupertino, California. Fair values of the restricted investments approximate
cost due to one or more of the following: the short-term maturities of the
investments, absence of changes in underlying interest rates or the absence of
changes in security credit ratings.

Unrealized gains (losses) on all available-for-sale securities are reported as a
component of stockholders' equity and are not material.

During the period covered by the financial statements, we did not used any
derivative instrument for trading

purposes. Symantec utilizes some natural hedging to mitigate the Company's
foreign currency exposures and the Company hedges certain residual exposures
through the use of one-month foreign exchange forward contracts. We enter into
foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions primarily to
protect against currency exchange risks associated with certain balance sheet
positions. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts are based on
quoted market prices. At March 31, 1999, outstanding forward exchange contracts
had a notional amount of approximately $100 million, all of which mature in 35
days or less. The net liability of forward contracts was a notional amount of
approximately $9 million at March 31, 1999. The fair value of foreign currency
exchange forward contracts approximates cost due to the short maturity periods
and the minimal fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hedge
its translation risk.


NOTE 6.  CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

On April 2, 1993, Symantec issued convertible subordinated debentures totaling
$25 million. The debentures bore interest at 7.75% payable semiannually and were
convertible into Symantec common stock at $12 per share at the option of the
investor. The debentures were due in three equal annual installments beginning
in 1999 and were redeemable at the option of the investors in the event of a
change in control of Symantec or the sale of all or substantially all of its
assets. At our option, we could redeem the notes at any time with 30 to 60 days
notice; however, we would have incurred a prepayment penalty for early
redemption. The holders were entitled to certain registration rights relating to
the shares of common stock resulting from the conversion of the debentures. We
reserved 2,083,333 shares of common stock to be issued upon conversion of these
debentures. The debentures limited the payment of cash dividends and the
repurchase of capital stock to a total of $10 million plus 25% of cumulative net
income subsequent to April 2, 1993.

On April 26, 1995, convertible subordinated debentures totaling $10 million were
converted into 833,333 shares of Symantec common stock, leaving 1,250,000 shares
of common stock reserved for future conversion as of March 31, 1997.

During October 1997, convertible subordinated debentures totaling $0.7 million
were converted into 59,666 shares of Symantec common stock, leaving 1,190,332
shares of common stock reserved for future conversions as of March 31, 1998.

During February 1999, the holders of Symantec's convertible subordinated
debentures converted the entire remaining $14.3 million principal amount into
1,190,332 shares of Symantec common stock. The conversion of these shares of
common stock were issued in a transaction which was exempt from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933.

Symantec's acquired subsidiary, Quarterdeck, had issued 6% convertible senior
subordinated notes totaling $25 million, due in 2001, to an institutional
investor in a private placement pursuant to the terms of a Note Agreement dated
March 1, 1996. These Notes were paid in full on March 30, 1999.

NOTE 7.  LINE OF CREDIT

Symantec has a $10 million bank line of credit, which expires in May 2000. The
line of credit is available for general corporate purposes and bears interest at
the banks' reference (prime) interest rate, the U.S. offshore rate plus 1.25%, a
CD rate plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 1.25%, at our discretion, which was 7.75% at
March 31, 1999. As of March 31, 1999, we are in compliance with all covenants
under this credit agreement and there were no borrowings and less than $1
million in standby letters of credit outstanding under this line. Future
acquisitions by Symantec may cause us to be in violation of the line of credit
covenants. However, we believe that if the line of credit were canceled or
amounts were not available under the line, there would not be a material adverse
impact on the financial results, liquidity or capital resources of the Company.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED



In fiscal 1997, we entered into lease agreements for two existing office
buildings, City Center One (CC1) and World Headquarters (WHQ), land and one
office building under construction in Cupertino, California, City Center Five
(CC5). In fiscal 1999, the landlord exchanged CC5 for another building, City
Center Two (CC2) in Cupertino, California and committed to sell WHQ. Once the
appropriate leasehold improvements are made to CC2, we will vacate WHQ and move
into CC2 and be relieved of the lease liability associated with WHQ. Lease
payments are based on the three-month LIBOR in effect at the beginning of each
fiscal quarter. Symantec has the right to acquire the related properties at any
time during the seven-year lease period. If, at the end of the lease term we do
not renew the lease, purchase the property under lease or arrange a third party
purchase, then we will be obligated to the lessor for a guaranteed residual
amount equal to a specified percentage of the lessor's purchase price of the
property. We would also be obligated to the lessor for all or some portion of
this amount if the price paid by the third party is below the guaranteed
residual amount. The guaranteed residual payment on the lease agreements for the
two existing office buildings totals approximately $42 million. The guaranteed
residual payment on the lease agreements for CC2 and the associated leaseholds
under construction was approximately $28 million at March 31, 1999. As security
against these guaranteed residual payments, we are required to maintain a
corresponding investment in U.S. Treasury securities with maturities not to
exceed three years. Symantec is restricted in its use of these investments per
the terms of the lease agreement. At March 31, 1999, the investments total
approximately $71 million and are classified as non-current restricted
investments within the financial statements.

We currently occupy a portion of these office buildings and have assumed the
right to sub-lease income provided by the other tenants. The sub-lease
agreements have terms expiring in August 1999 through February 2001.

Realization of the approximately $28 million of net deferred tax asset that is
reflected in the financial statements is dependent upon our ability to generate
sufficient future U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S.
earnings.

Approximately $21 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is
attributable to unbenefitted stock option deductions, the benefit of which will
be credited to equity when realized. Approximately $7 million of the valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets is attributable to the charge for acquired
in-process research and development expenses, the benefit of which is not
expected to be realized within five years. The remaining $2 million of the
valuation allowance represents net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
of various acquired companies that are limited by separate return limitations
and under the "change of ownership" rules of Internal Revenue Code Section 382.
The change in the valuation allowance for the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997 was a net increase of approximately $5 million and net decreases of
approximately $15 million and $5 million, respectively.

Pretax income from international operations was approximately $64 million, $65
million and $25 million for the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

No provision has been made for federal or state income taxes on unremitted
earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries (cumulative $90 million at March
31, 1999) since Symantec plans to indefinitely reinvest all such earnings. At
March 31, 1999, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately $23 million.


NOTE 11.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

401(k) Plan
Symantec maintains a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of its domestic
employees. The plan allows employees to contribute up to 15% of their pretax
salary up to the maximum dollar limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Code. Symantec matches 100% of the first $500 of employees' contributions and
then 50% of the employee's contribution up to 6% of the employees' eligible
compensation. Company contributions under the plan were approximately $2 million
for each of the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In October 1989, we established the 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("89
Plan") and a total of approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock had been
reserved for issuance under this plan. Subject to certain limitations, our
employees may purchase, through payroll deductions of 2% to 10% of compensation,
shares of common stock

at a price per share that is the lesser of 85% of the fair market value as of
the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period. As of
March 31, 1999, approximately 2.8 million shares had been issued and
approximately 0.6 million shares had remained available under the 89 Plan.

On September 17, 1998, Symantec stockholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "98 Plan"). The terms of the 98 Plan are substantially
similar to the terms of the 89 Plan for which it supersedes and makes available
500,000 shares. As of March 31, 1999, no shares had been issued under the 98
Plan.

Stock Award Plans
During fiscal 1996, we registered 400,000 shares to be issued under the terms of
the 1994 Patent Incentive Plan. The purpose of this plan is to increase
awareness of the importance of patents to our business and to provide employees
with incentives to pursue patent protection for new technologies that may be
valuable to Symantec. Our executive officers are not eligible for awards under
the 1994 Patent Incentive Plan. As of March 31, 1999, a total of 21,351 shares
had been issued under this plan.

In March 1998, the Board of Directors approved the terms of the 1998 Star Award
Bonus Plan, under which Symantec may grant up to 5,000 shares of common stock to
employees who perform exceptionally in a given quarter. Directors and executive
officers are not eligible to receive awards under this plan. Stock awards under
this plan are recorded as compensation expense at the time of issuance. The
Board of Directors reserved 20,000 shares of common stock for issuance under
this plan. As of March 31, 1999, a total of 1,300 shares had been issued under
this plan.

Stock Option Plans
Symantec maintains stock option plans pursuant to which an aggregate total of
approximately 22.3 million shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance as incentive and nonqualified stock options to employees, officers,
directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors to the Company (or
of any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company as the Board of Directors
or committee may determine). The purpose of these plans are to attract, retain
and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are
important to our success by offering them an opportunity to participate in the
Symantec's future performance through awards of stock options and stock bonuses.
Under the terms of these plans, the option exercise price may not be less than
100% of the fair market value on the date of grant, the options have a maximum
term of ten years and generally vest over a four-year period.

On May 14, 1996, Symantec stockholders approved the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan
and a total of approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock had been
reserved for issuance under this plan. On September 17, 1998, stockholders
approved an amendment to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by
approximately 2.3 million to 9.0 million shares. As of March 31, 1999 a total of
7.8 million had been issued under this plan.

These options will expire if not exercised by specific dates ranging from April
1999 to March 2009. Prices for options exercised during the three-year period
ended March 31, 1999 ranged from $1.00 to $26.91.

We elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," in accounting for our employee stock options because, as discussed
below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires the use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under
APB No. 25, because the exercise price of our employee stock options generally
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be determined as if we had
accounted for our employee stock options (including shares issued under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, collectively called "options") granted subsequent
to March 31, 1995 under the fair value method of that statement. The fair value
of options granted in fiscal 1998 and 1999 reported below has been estimated at
the date of grant using Black-Scholes option pricing model assuming no expected
dividends and the following weighted average assumptions:

</TABLE>

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
our options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of management, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of
its options.

The weighted-average estimated fair values of employee stock options for fiscal
1999 and 1998 were $12.56 and $13.44 per share, respectively. The
weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock purchase rights granted
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal 1999 and 1998 were $10.47
and $14.71, respectively.

NOTE 12.  COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

On April 29, 1997, the Board of Directors of Symantec, the Board, authorized the
repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of Symantec common stock by June 13, 1997.
As of June 13, 1997, management completed the repurchase of 500,000 shares at
prices ranging from $16.57 to $17.00 per share. Authorization to repurchase the
remaining 500,000 shares expired as of March 31, 1998.

On November 24, 1997, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 500,000
shares of Symantec common stock. As of December 4, 1997, management completed
the repurchase of 500,000 shares at prices ranging from $25.25 to $26.81 per
share.

On June 9, 1998, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 5% of Symantec's
outstanding common stock before December 31, 1998. The Company completed the
repurchase as of October 30, 1998, repurchasing a total of 2.875 million shares
at prices ranging from $13.10 to $27.21, for an aggregate amount of
approximately $56 million.

On March 22, 1999, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $75 million of
the Company's common stock. As of June 15, 1999, the Company has repurchased
1,000,000 shares at prices ranging from $17.90 to $19.87, for an aggregate
amount of approximately $19 million.

NOTE 13.  SALE OF TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCT RIGHTS

During September 1996, Symantec sold its electronic forms software product line
and related tangible assets to JetForm for approximately $100 million, payable
over four years in quarterly installments through the June 2000 quarter. During
February 1998, the purchase agreement was amended to accelerate certain
quarterly payments during the remaining payment term in exchange for a reduction
in the total sale price to approximately $93 million. During June 1998, the
purchase agreement was amended once again to modify certain payments, however,
the total sales price remained at $93 million. JetForm has the option to tender
payment in either cash or in registered JetForm common stock, within a
contractually defined quantity threshold. Due to the uncertainty regarding the
ultimate collectibility of these installments, we are recognizing the related
revenue as payments are due and collectibility is assured from JetForm. We
recognized income of approximately $34 million, $24 million and $18 million from
JetForm during fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

In March 1997, Symantec sold its network administration technologies and related
tangible assets to Hewlett-Packard, resulting in the receipt of approximately $1
million of revenue and a $2 million research and development reimbursement in
fiscal 1997. Additionally, a two-year quarterly royalty payment stream, not to
exceed a present value of $27 million as of March 1997, commenced in fiscal
1998, which was solely contingent on future sales of certain Hewlett-Packard
products. Due to the uncertainty regarding the amounts upon which these
royalties will be determined, Symantec recognized these amounts as they were
received from Hewlett-Packard. We recognized income of approximately $7 million
and $22 million from Hewlett-Packard during fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Royalty payments from Hewlett-Packard ended during the December 1998 quarter.

In connection with the sale to Hewlett-Packard during fiscal 1997, Symantec
wrote off approximately $7 million of

accounting and other costs associated with the transaction.

</TABLE>

On September 29, 1998, Symantec's CEO announced a reduction in work force and
the outsourcing of Symantec's domestic short-run manufacturing, product
distribution and return teams which resulted in the closure and vacancy of the
Sunnyvale, California site in February 1999 and the termination of related
employees. The exit plan associated with the reduction in work force and
facility closure specifically identified all the significant actions, including:

     o  the number and categories of individuals who would not continue
        employment with Symantec;

     o  the termination dates and severance packages for each terminating
        employee;

     o  the planned date we would vacate the Sunnyvale, California building
        which was under an existing operating lease; and

     o  the excess equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements to
        be disposed of.

Details of the restructuring charge are as follows:

</TABLE>

Employee severance and out-placement was primarily comprised of severance
packages for employees who were to be terminated as a result of the
restructuring. As part of the restructuring plan, we specifically identified
those individuals who would not continue employment with Symantec. The severance
periods ranged from one to six months. Symantec's Human Resource Department met
with each terminating employee and presented them with their termination date
and severance package. The total cost of the severance packages was accrued and
included in restructuring charge after the identified employees had their
severance packages communicated to them. Additionally, Symantec accrued
estimated costs associated with outplacement services to be provided to
terminating employees as these costs have no future economic benefit to us. The
remaining accrual at March 31, 1999 was for outstanding severance and
outplacement costs .

Excess facilities and equipment included remaining lease payments associated
with building leases for the Sunnyvale, California site subsequent to the
planned abandonment date. The cash outlays for the lease are to be made over the
remaining term of the lease. In addition, Symantec reserved for the write-off of
the site-specific equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements that
would no longer be utilized. The accrual at March 31, 1999 relates to the
remaining lease payments, which will be paid over the remaining lease term
subsequent to the abandonment of the facility.

No acquisition, restructuring and other expenses were incurred during fiscal
1998.

During fiscal 1997, Symantec recorded charges of approximately $2 million in
connection with the write-off of an equity investment in a privately held
company. Additionally, during fiscal 1997, we recorded a charge of approximately
$3 million for centralization and restructuring costs, which is outlined below.

</TABLE>

In June and September 1996, Executive Management approved and committed Symantec
to close the Bedford, Massachusetts and St. Louis, Missouri facilities. The
facility closures were part of the Company's plan to consolidate certain
research and development activities. These exit plans specifically identified
the following significant actions to complete the closures:

     o  the number and categories of individuals who would not continue
        employment with Symantec;

     o  the termination date and severance package for each terminating
        employee;

     o  the date the Bedford and St. Louis facilities would be vacated; and

     o  the excess equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements to
        be disposed of.

Employee severance and out-placement expenses were primarily comprised of
severance packages for employees who were to be terminated as a result of the
closure of the Bedford and St. Louis sites. The severance reserve was computed
based on an estimated severance compensation, benefits and related employer
payroll taxes. The severance periods ranged from one to six months. Prior to
amounts being accrued, Symantec's Human Resource Department met with each
terminating employee and presented them with their termination date and
severance package. Additionally, Symantec accrued estimated costs associated
with out-placement services provided to terminating employees as these costs had
no future economic benefit to the Company. The actual cash outlays for these
accrued expenses were made during the terminated employees' severance period.

The remaining accrual is a result of the following:

     o  Certain employees who were identified for termination found employment
        at other Symantec locations and therefore were not eligible to receive
        the severance packages. At the time of the site closures, Symantec had
        determined that these individuals would not find employment elsewhere
        within the Company.

     o  Symantec determined that most employees had not availed themselves of
        the out-placement services offered by the Company at the time of their
        termination.

Excess facilities and equipment included remaining lease payments associated
with the building leases for the Bedford and St. Louis sites. The cash outlays
for these leases were made over the remaining lives of the leases. The Company
expensed to operations lease rental costs until the time the facilities were
vacated. In addition, Symantec reserved for the write-off of excess equipment,
furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements which would not be utilized. Such
equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements were either not
utilized or were scrapped.

Legal and other primarily included Symantec's legal expenses related to the site
closures and the settlement of a lawsuit. These costs and expenses were incurred
in the period of the restructuring charge.

As of March 31, 1999, total accrued cash related to acquisition and
restructuring expenses were approximately $4 million and included $1 million for
excess facilities and equipment and $3 million for other acquisition related
expenses.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 1997, 1,250,000 shares of convertible
subordinated debentures and $708,000 of interest expense were excluded from the
computation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been
anti-dilutive.

NOTE 16.  LITIGATION

On March 18, 1996, a class action complaint was filed by the law firm of
Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach in Superior Court of the State of
California, County of Santa Clara, against the Company and several of its
current and former officers and directors. The complaint alleges that Symantec
insiders inflated the stock price and then sold stock based on inside
information that sales were not going to meet analysts' expectations. The
complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The complaint has been refiled
twice in state court, most recently on January 13, 1997, following Symantec's
demurrers directed to previous complaints. The parties are currently conducting
discovery. On January 7, 1997, the same plaintiffs filed a complaint in the
United States District Court, Northern District of California, based on the same
facts as the state court complaint, for violation of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The district court dismissed that complaint and plaintiffs served an
amended complaint in April 1998. Symantec's motion to dismiss the new federal
complaint was granted in part, substantially narrowing the complaint. Symantec
believes that neither the state court complaint nor the federal court complaint
has any merit and will vigorously defend itself against both complaints.

On April 23, 1997, Symantec filed a lawsuit against McAfee Associates, Inc.,
which pursuant to a merger has become Network Associates, Inc. ("Network
Associates"), in the United States District Court, Northern District of
California, for copyright infringement and unfair competition. On October 6,
1997, the court found that Symantec had demonstrated a likelihood of success on
the merits of certain copyright claims and issued a preliminary injunction (i)
prohibiting Network Associates from infringing Symantec's rights in specified
materials by marketing, selling, transferring or directly or indirectly copying
into any new Network Associates product or new version of an existing product
that has Symantec code, (ii) requiring Network Associates to notify distributors
who are still selling versions of PC Medic 97 that have Symantec's code to tell
customers that they should upgrade to versions that do not contain Symantec code
and (iii) requiring Network Associates to provide Symantec and the court with a
sample of the notice to be used. On October 17, 1997, Symantec amended its
complaint to include additional claims for copyright infringement and
misappropriation of trade secrets, based on additional evidence

found in the discovery process. On April 1, 1998, Symantec amended its complaint
to add claims for misappropriation of trade secrets, RICO (Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act) and related claims based on additional evidence
uncovered in the litigation. Following motions by Network Associates, the court
dismissed Symantec's unfair competition and trade secret claims regarding the
copyrighted code and its RICO and interference claims. On October 22, 1998, the
court consolidated this case with the case against Network Associates and the
case brought by CyberMedia, both of which are described below.

On September 4, 1998, Symantec filed a new lawsuit against Network Associates in
the United States District Court, Northern District of California, for copyright
infringement, trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition. Symantec
continues to investigate the extent to which Network Associates may have
misappropriated Symantec's intellectual property and plans to aggressively
pursue its remedies under this lawsuit, which include both injunctive relief and
monetary damages.

On September 15, 1997, Hilgraeve Corporation ("Hilgraeve") filed a lawsuit in
the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, against
Symantec, alleging that unspecified Symantec products infringe a patent owned by
Hilgraeve. The lawsuit requests damages, injunctive relief and costs and
attorney fees. Symantec believes this claim has no merit and intends to defend
the action vigorously.

On February 4, 1998, CyberMedia, Inc. ("CyberMedia,"), which in September 1998
was acquired by Network Associates, filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, against Symantec, ZebraSoft
Inc. and others, alleging that Symantec's Norton Uninstall Deluxe infringes
CyberMedia's copyright and asserting related state law claims. The suit requests
damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys fees. In May 1998, CyberMedia
filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction prohibiting sale or development
of the challenged code, which preliminary injunction was granted with respect to
Symantec's domestic activities in September 1998. Subsequently, Symantec ceased
selling the Norton Uninstall Deluxe product. Symantec intends to defend the
action vigorously.

On February 19, 1998, a class action complaint was filed by the Milberg, Weiss,
Bershad, Hynes & Lerach law firm in Santa Clara County Superior Court, on behalf
of a class of purchasers of pre-version 4.0 Norton AntiVirus products. A similar
complaint was filed in the same court on March 6, 1998 by an Oregon law firm.
Those actions were consolidated and a consolidated amended complaint was filed
in late October 1998. The complaint originally purported to assert claims for
breach of implied warranty, fraud, unfair business practices and violation of
California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act, among others, arising from the alleged
inability of earlier versions of Norton AntiVirus to function properly after the
year 2000; all but the unfair business practice claims have been dismissed
following Symantec's demurrer. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and
injunctive relief. Symantec believes that these actions have no merit and
intends to defend itself vigorously.

In July 1998, the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) ruled that
Symantec should pay a total of approximately $6.8 million for damages and legal
costs to Triolet Systems, Inc. and Brian Duncombe in a decade-old copyright
action, for damages arising from the grant of a preliminary injunction against
the defendant. The damages were awarded following the court's ruling that
evidence presented later in the case showed the injunction was not warranted.
Symantec inherited the case through its 1995 acquisition of Delrina Corporation,
which was the plaintiff in this lawsuit. Symantec has appealed the decision.
Symantec recorded a charge of $5.8 million in June 1998 representing the
unaccrued portion of the judgment plus costs.

In March 1997, a class action complaint was filed against Quarterdeck in San
Diego County Superior Court. The case was later transferred to and is currently
pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The complaint, purportedly on
behalf of a class of purchasers of Quarterdeck's MagnaRAM2 product, seeks
damages and injunctive relief under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and
Business and Professions Code sections beginning with 17200 and 17500. Symantec
believes these claims to be without merit and intends to defend itself
vigorously.

In October 1997, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the District of Utah on behalf of PowerQuest Corporation against Quarterdeck.
The complaint alleges that Quarterdeck's partitioning software (included in
Partition-It and Partition-It Extra Strength) violates a patent held by
PowerQuest. In January 1998, PowerQuest obtained a second patent relating to
partitioning and has amended its complaint to allege infringement of that patent
as well. The plaintiff seeks an injunction against distribution of Partition-It
and Partition-It Extra Strength and monetary damages. Symantec believes this
action has no merit and intends to defend the lawsuit

vigorously.

On July 30, 1998, a class action complaint was filed against Quarterdeck in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, on behalf of a
purported class of purchasers of Procomm Plus version 4.0 for Windows product
(the "Product"). The complaint purported to assert claims for breach of warranty
and violation of New York's Consumer Protection From Deceptive Acts and
Practices Act arising from the Product's inability to process dates containing
the year 2000. The complaint was dismissed and the court entered judgment in
Quarterdeck's favor in April 1999.

Over the past few years, it has become common for software companies, including
Symantec, to receive claims of patent infringement. Symantec is currently
evaluating claims of patent infringement asserted by several parties, with
respect to certain of the Company's products. While the Company believes that it
has valid defenses to these claims, the outcome of any related litigation or
negotiation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future results
of operations or cash flows.

Symantec is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. The Company intends to defend all of the
aforementioned pending lawsuits vigorously and although adverse decisions (or
settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, the final resolution of
these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a
material adverse affect on the financial condition of the Company, although it
is not possible to estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these
cases. Depending, however, on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution
of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's future results of
operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular
period. The Company has accrued certain estimated legal fees and expenses
related to certain of these matters; however, actual amounts may differ
materially from those estimated amounts.

The legal expenses accrued by the Company are deemed probable because the
lawsuits have been filed, management has determined its plans of action with
regards to the cases and accordingly knows that it will incur legal expenses
related to the particular lawsuit. Utilizing the assumptions noted in the
accounting policy, management is able to estimate a minimum amount of legal fees
to be incurred in these lawsuits.

The total amount of legal expenses accrued as of the respective year ends and
the amounts expensed for the years ended are reflected below:

Balance as of March 31, 1999         $7.2 million    Amount expensed in 1999    $10.1 million
</TABLE>

NOTE 17.  LEASE BUILDINGS

In fiscal 1997, Symantec entered into lease agreements for two existing office
buildings (Cupertino City Center One, or CC1, and World HeadQuarters, or WHQ),
one parcel of land and one office building under construction (Cupertino City
Center Five, or CC5) in Cupertino, California. During fiscal 1999 Symantec's
landlord, exchanged CC5 for another leased building (Cupertino City Center Two,
or CC2) located in Cupertino, California and committed to sell WHQ to an
unrelated third party on or before November 1, 1999, thus relieving Symantec of
its responsibility for its lease of WHQ. Symantec will move both personnel and
equipment into CC2 once certain tenant improvements are completed, which is
currently scheduled to occur before November 1, 1999. In connection with these
leases, Symantec is required to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in
U.S. Treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three years. In
accordance with the lease terms, these funds are not available to meet operating
cash requirements. In addition, we are obligated to comply with certain
financial covenants. Future acquisitions may cause us to be in violation of
these financial covenants.

NOTE 18.  ADOPTION OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

On August 11, 1998, Symantec's Board of Directors, the Board, adopted a
stockholder rights plan designed to ensure orderly consideration of any future
unsolicited acquisition attempt to ensure fair value of the Company for its
stockholders.

In connection with the plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred
share purchase right for each share of Symantec's common stock outstanding on
August 21, 1998 (the "Record Date"). The Board further directed the





                                       71
<PAGE>   74

SYMANTEC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED



issuance of one such right with respect to each share of Symantec's common stock
that is issued after the Record Date, except in certain circumstances. The
rights will expire on August 12, 2008.

The rights are initially attached to Symantec's common stock and will not trade
separately. If a person or a group (an "Acquiring Person") acquires 20% or more
of the Company's common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender offer
for 20% or more of Symantec's common stock, the rights will be distributed and
will thereafter trade separately from the common stock. Each right will be
exercisable for 1/1000th of a share of a newly designated Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $150.00. The preferred
stock has been structured so that the value of 1/1000th of a share of such
preferred stock will approximate the value of one share of common stock. Upon a
person becoming an Acquiring Person, holders of the rights (other than the
Acquiring Person) will have the right to acquire shares of Symantec's common
stock at a substantially discounted price.

If a person becomes an Acquiring Person and Symantec is acquired in a merger or
other business combination, or 50% or more of its assets are sold to an
Acquiring Person, the holder of rights (other than the Acquiring Person) will
have the right to receive shares of common stock of the acquiring corporation at
a substantially discounted price. After a person has become an Acquiring Person,
the Board, at its option, require the exchange of outstanding rights (other than
those held by the Acquiring Person) for common stock at an exchange ratio of one
share of Symantec's common stock per right.

The Board may redeem outstanding rights at any time prior to a person becoming
an Acquiring Person at a price of $0.001 per right. Prior to such time, the
terms of the rights may be amended by the Board. In addition, the Board also
amended Symantec's bylaws to: permit only the Chairman, President or the Board
to call a special meeting of the stockholders; require that the Board be given
prior notice of a stockholder proposal to take action by written consent so that
a record date for such action can be established; require advance notice to the
Board of stockholder-sponsored proposals for consideration at annual meetings
and for stockholder nominations for the election of directors; permit the Board
to meet on one- rather than two-day advance notice; and conform the bylaws to
applicable provisions of Delaware law regarding the inspection of elections at
stockholder meetings.


NOTE 19.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

Symantec markets its products in North America and international countries
primarily through retail and distribution channels.

Symantec's reportable segments are significant strategic business units that
offer different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. We have
four reportable segments: Remote Productivity Solutions, Security and
Assistance, Internet Tools and Corporate Sunset. The Remote Productivity
Solutions business unit focuses on helping Information Technology organizations
reduce the expense of supporting remote workers. This business unit focuses on
corporate helpdesk and support organizations' need to more efficiently handle
the additional work required to support mobile workers, telecommuters and remote
offices. The Security and Assistance business unit is dedicated to being
indispensable in customers' daily use of computers by increasing productivity
and keeping computers safe and reliable. The Internet Tools business unit
includes products providing an easy to use Java development environment. The
Corporate Sunset segment includes revenues from products nearing the end of
their life cycle.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. Symantec's business units are
aligned by discrete products. There are no intersegment sales. Symantec's Chief
Executive Officer and his staff evaluate performance based on profit or loss
from operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses,
foreign exchange gains and losses and miscellaneous other income and expenses.
Non-segment items included all general and administrative expenses and charges
that are one-time in nature, such as in-process research and development,
judgment settlements and restructuring and other expenses, and are not allocated
to the business units. Assets and liabilities are not discretely reviewed by
segment.

NOTE 20.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Symantec adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," beginning with

                (a) With respect to each funding of an Advance, the Lessee shall
        give the Lessor and the Agent prior written notice pursuant to a Funding
        Request substantially in the form of Exhibit A (a "Funding Request"),
        which Funding Request shall be delivered not later than 10:00 a.m., five
        (5) Business Days prior to the proposed Funding Date, specifying: (i)
        the proposed Funding Date, (ii) the amount of Advance requested,(iii) to
        which Properties such Advance is being allocated and the amount
        allocated to each Property. The Agent and the Lessor shall calculate the
        amounts of the Lessor Amounts and the Loans required to fund the
        requested Advance as it relates to each Property. In the event that the
        Lessor and the Lenders are unable to obtain a LIBO Rate (Reserve
        Adjusted) for the period of the Advance requested in any Funding
        Request, the Lessor and the Lenders shall make available Lessor Amounts
        and Loans, as the case may be, at the Alternate Base Rate equal to the
        Advance requested in such Funding Request and (iv) in the case of a
        Construction Advance, requesting that the proceeds of such Construction
        Advance be wire transferred to the accounts and Persons specified
        therein. Such Lessor Amounts and Loans shall accrue Yield or Interest,
        as the case may be, at the Alternate Base Rate until the date on which
        the Lessor and the Lenders shall be able to obtain a LIBO Rate (Reserve
        Adjusted) for the amount of such Advance, at which time such Lessor
        Amounts and Loans shall convert and thereafter accrue Yield and
        Interest, as the case may be, at the LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted);
        provided, however, that no such conversion shall occur unless the Lessee
        shall have submitted an Interest Period Selection Notice in connection
        therewith.

                (b) The proceeds of each Advance shall be used solely to provide
        the Lessee with funds with which to pay or reimburse itself for Property
        Acquisition Costs and Property Improvement Costs.

        SECTION 4.1. Yield.

                (a) The amount of the Lessor Amounts outstanding from time to
        time shall accrue yield ("Yield") at the Yield Rate, calculated using
        the actual number of days elapsed and, when the Yield Rate is based on
        the LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted), a 360-day year basis and, if
        calculated at the Alternate Base Rate, a 360-day year basis if the
        Alternate Base Rate is calculated at the Federal Funds Rate, and a 365-,
        or, if applicable, 366-, day year basis if the Alternate Base Rate is
        calculated at the Prime Rate. If all or any portion of the Lessor
        Amounts, any Yield payable thereon or any other amount payable hereunder
        shall not be paid when due (whether at stated maturity, acceleration
        thereof or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate
        per annum which is equal to the Overdue Rate.

                (b) The Agent shall distribute, in accordance with Article VII,
        the Lessor Basic Rent and all other amounts due with respect to the
        Lessor Amounts paid to the Agent by the Lessee under the Lease from time
        to time.

                (c) During the Base Lease Term, Yield shall accrue on
        outstanding Lessor Amounts and shall be paid on each Scheduled Payment
        Date.

                (d) During the Base Lease Term, the Lessee shall make an
        amortization payment, if any, with respect to the aggregate Lessor
        Amounts, on the date and in the amount(s) set forth in the Master Rent
        Schedule.

                (e) The outstanding aggregate Lessor Amounts shall be repaid in
        full on the Maturity Date.

        SECTION 4.2. Interest on Loans.

                (a) Each Loan shall accrue interest computed and payable in
        accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement.

                (b) The Agent shall distribute, in accordance with the Article
        VII, the Lender Basic Rent and all other amounts due with respect to the
        Loans paid to the Lessor by the Lessee under the Lease from time to
        time.

                        CERTAIN INTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES

        SECTION 5.1. Nature of Transaction.

                (a) The parties hereto intend that (i) for financial accounting
        purposes with respect to the Lessee, the Lessor will be treated as the
        owner and the lessor of the Properties and the Lessee will be treated as
        the lessee of the Properties and (ii) for all other purposes, including
        federal and all state and local income tax purposes, state real estate
        and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (A) the Lease will be
        treated as a financing arrangement, (B) the Lessor and the Lenders will
        be deemed lenders making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to the
        sum of the Lessor Amounts and the outstanding principal amount of the
        Loans, which loans are secured by the Properties and (C) the Lessee will
        be treated as the owner of the Properties and will be entitled to all
        tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of properties like the
        Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the Lessee acknowledges
        and agrees that neither the Lessor nor any of the Lenders has made any
        representations or warranties to the Lessee concerning the tax,
        accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents and that
        the Lessee has obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting and legal
        advice concerning the Operative Documents as it deems appropriate.

                (b) Specifically, without limiting the generality of clause (a)
        of this Section 5.1, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the
        event of any insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under
        the United States bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency
        laws or statute of the United States of America or any State or
        Commonwealth thereof affecting the Lessee, the

        Lessor, or the Lenders or any collection actions, the transactions
        evidenced by the Operative Documents shall be regarded as loans made by
        the Lessor and the Lenders as unrelated third party lenders of the
        Lessee.

        SECTION 5.2. Amounts Due Under Lease. Anything else herein or elsewhere
to the contrary notwithstanding, it is the intention of the Lessee, the Lessor
and the Lenders that: (i) the amount and timing of installments of Basic Rent
due and payable from time to time from the Lessee under the Lease shall be equal
to the aggregate payments due and payable as interest on the Loans and Yield on
the Lessor Amounts on each Basic Rent Payment Date; (ii) if the Lessee elects
the Purchase Option or becomes obligated to purchase any of the Properties under
the Lease, the Loans, the Lessor Amounts, all interest, Yield and Fees thereon
and all other obligations of the Lessee owing to the Lessor and the Lenders
shall be paid in full by the Lessee; (iii) if the Lessee properly elects the
Remarketing Option, the Lessee shall only be required to pay to the Lessor the
proceeds of the sale of each of the Properties, the Loan Balance and any amounts
due pursuant to Article XIII hereof and Section 20.2 of the Master Lease (which
aggregate amounts may be less than the Lease Balance); and (iv) upon an Event of
Default resulting in an acceleration of the Lessee's obligation to purchase the
Properties under the Lease, the amounts then due and payable by the Lessee under
the Lease shall include all amounts necessary to pay in full the Lease Balance,
plus all other amounts then due from the Lessee to the Participants under the
Operative Documents.

        SECTION 5.3. Purchase of World Headquarters. In the event that the
Purchase Option for World Headquarters is exercised by the Lessee or an assignee
thereof and the purchase price paid therefor is in excess of the Lease Balance
applicable thereto, the Lessee may deliver all or a portion of such excess to
the Lessor and direct the Lessor to apply the amount of such excess to the
partial payment of the outstanding Lease Balance for either or both of City
Center I or City Center II as agreed upon with the Lessor at the time of such
purchase and the Lessor shall comply with such direction.

determination, a "Deficiency Date"), and the Lessee has been given notice of
such deficiency by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Pledge Agreement, then, within two Business Days of such Deficiency Date,
the Lessee shall deposit with the Collateral Agent such Additional Collateral
("Deficiency Collateral") so as to cause the fair market value, as determined by
the Collateral Agent, of Additional Collateral then held by the Collateral Agent
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Pledge Agreement, and after giving
effect to the deposit of such Deficiency Collateral, to be equal to or in excess
of 102.0% of the then outstanding Loan Balance.

        SECTION 6.2. Surplus. If on any day the fair market value of the
Additional Collateral held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to terms and
conditions of the Pledge Agreement shall exceed 102.0% of the then outstanding
Loan Balance, and provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, then the Lessee may request in writing to the Agent and the
Lessor that the Lessor and the Agent cause the Collateral Agent to release to
the Lessee Additional Collateral in an amount such that after giving effect to
such release, the fair market value, as determined by the Collateral Agent of
the remaining Additional Collateral held by the Collateral Agent subject to the
terms and conditions of the Pledge Agreement shall equal or exceed 102.0% of the
then outstanding Loan Balance (such released Additional Collateral, "Surplus
Collateral"). Upon receipt of such notice, and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent and the Lessor promptly shall
cause the Collateral Agent to release such Surplus Collateral to the Lessee;
provided, however, that after giving effect to such release, no Default of Event
of Default shall occur; and provided further, that no release of Surplus
Collateral shall in any way affect the obligations of the Lessee pursuant to
Section 6.1.

        There have not been any nor are there now existing any events or
        conditions that would permit any Plan to be terminated under
        circumstances that would cause the lien provided under Section 4068 of
        ERISA to attach to the Material Assets of the Lessee or its ERISA
        Affiliates. The value of the Plans' benefits guaranteed under Title IV
        of ERISA on the date hereof does not exceed the value of such Plans'

for, and to indemnify, protect, defend, save and keep harmless the Lessor (which
right to indemnify may be assigned by the Lessor to the Lenders), on an After
Tax Basis, from and against, any and all Claims relating to City Center II and
arising during the Interim Term for such Property that may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Lessor (whether because of action or
omission by the Lessor), whether or not the Lessor shall also be indemnified as
to any such Claim by any other Person and whether or not such Claim arises or
accrues prior to the Restructuring Date or after the Expiration Date, in any way
relating to or arising out of any of the circumstances described in clauses (i)
through (vii) of Section 13.1(b) below, where such Claims relate to the action
or omission of the Lessee or its Affiliates while located, on, in possession of,
controlling or acting or failing to act with respect to such Property or arise
from fraud, misapplication of funds, illegal acts or willful misconduct of the
Lessee or its Affiliates. The Lessee acknowledges and agrees in this connection
that (x) such Property (other than City Center II which shall not be in the
exclusive control of the Lessee until March 5, 1999) is in its exclusive control
and possession during the Interim Term therefor, (y) it is responsible as
Construction Agent for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors and agents
and (z) it has agreed to maintain such Property free from injury or mishap to
third persons.

        (b) Basic Term. The Lessee agrees, whether or not any of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, to assume liability for,
and to indemnify, protect, defend, save and keep harmless each Indemnitee, on an
After Tax Basis, from and against, any and all Claims that may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitee (whether because of action or
omission by such Indemnitee or otherwise), whether or not such Indemnitee shall
also be indemnified as to any such Claim by any other Person and whether or not
such Claim arises or accrues prior to the Acquisition Date or after the
Expiration Date, in any way relating to or arising out of:

                (i) any of the Operative Documents or any of the transactions
        contemplated thereby, and any amendment, modification or waiver in
        respect thereof;

        Master Lease), return or other disposition of all or any part or any
        interest in the Properties or the imposition of any Lien (or incurring
        of any liability to refund or pay over any amount as a result of any
        Lien) thereon, including, without limitation: (1) Claims or penalties
        arising from any violation of law or in tort (strict liability or
        otherwise), (2) latent or other defects, whether or not discoverable,
        (3) any Claim based upon a violation or alleged violation of the terms
        of any restriction, easement, condition or covenant or other matter
        affecting title to the Properties, (4) the making of any Modifications
        in violation of any standards imposed by any insurance policies required
        to be maintained by Lessee pursuant to the Lease which are in effect at
        any time with respect to the Properties or any part thereof, (5) any
        Claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement, and (6) Claims

        Property or any plans to widen, modify or realign any street or highway
        adjacent to any of the Properties, or any Claim for utility "tap-in"
        fees;

                (iv) the breach by the Lessee of any covenant, representation or
        warranty made by it or deemed made by it in any Operative Document or

        Properties, the Improvements, any Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent, title

        Property or by reason of labor or materials furnished or claimed to have
        been furnished to the Lessee, or any of its contractors or agents or by
        reason of the financing of any personalty or equipment purchased or
        leased by the Lessee or Modifications constructed by the Lessee, except
        Lessor Liens and Liens in favor of the Lender or the Lessor; or

                (vii) subject to the accuracy of any Participant's
        representation set forth in Section 8.1(a), as to such Participant, the
        transactions contemplated by the Lease or by any other Operative
        Document, in respect of the application of Parts 4 and 5 of Subtitle B
        of Title I of ERISA and any prohibited transaction described in Section
        4975(c) of the Code;

        Notwithstanding Section 13.1 (a) or 13.1(b) the Lessee shall not be
required to indemnify any Indemnitee under this Section 13.1 for any of the
following: (1) any Claim to the extent resulting from the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of such Indemnitee or any member of its Indemnitee Group (it
being understood that the Lessee shall be required to indemnify an Indemnitee
even if the ordinary (but not gross) negligence of such Indemnitee caused or
contributed to such Claim) or the breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant of such Indemnitee set forth in any Operative Document, (2) any Claim
resulting from Lessor Liens which the Lessor is, or the Lenders are responsible
for discharging under the Operative Documents, (3) any Claim to the extent
attributable to acts or events occurring after the Expiration Date or the return
or remarketing of any Property so long as the Lessor or the Lenders are not
exercising remedies against the Lessee in respect of the Operative Documents,
and (4) any Claim arising from a breach or alleged breach by the Lenders or the
Lessor of any agreement entered into in connection with the assignment or
participation of any Loan or Lessor Amount. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the indemnity provided for herein shall survive the expiration or
termination of and shall be separate and independent from any remedy under the
Lease or any other Operative Document. Without limiting the express rights of
any Indemnitee under this Section 13.1, this Section 13.1 shall be construed as
an indemnity only and not a guaranty of residual value of the Properties or as a
guaranty of the Notes.

        SECTION 13.2. End of Term Indemnity.

                (a) If the Lessee elects the Remarketing Option and there would,
        after giving effect to the proposed remarketing transactions, be a
        Shortfall Amount, then prior to the Expiration Date and as a condition
        to the

        Lessee's right to complete the remarketing of the Properties pursuant to
        Section 20.1 of the Master Lease, the Lessee shall cause to be delivered
        to the Lessor at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the
        Expiration Date, at the Lessee's sole cost and expense, a report from
        the Appraiser in form and substance satisfactory to the Participants
        (the "End of the Term Report") which shall state the appraiser's
        conclusions as to the reason for any decline in the Fair Market Sales
        Value of the applicable Property from that anticipated for such date in
        the Appraisal delivered on the Acquisition Date/Restructuring Date.

                (b) If the Lessee elects the Remarketing Option, then on or
        prior to the Expiration Date the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor an
        amount (not to exceed the Shortfall Amount) equal to the portion of the
        Shortfall Amount that the End of the Term Report demonstrates was the
        result of a decline in the Fair Market Sales Value of the applicable
        Property due to

                        (i) any rebuilding of the applicable Properties or any
                part thereof by the Lessee (except in connection with a
                Casualty, unless such rebuilding failed to restore the Property
                as required under the Lease), or any failure to restore a
                Property after a Condemnation where the proceeds derived
                therefrom were made available to the Lessee for restoration, or

                        (ii) the existence of any Hazardous Activity, Hazardous
                Materials or Environmental Violations, the indemnity for which
                shall not exceed the cost of the remediation thereof, or

                        (iii) any restoration or rebuilding carried out by the
                Lessee, or

                        (iv) any condemnation of any portion of any of the
                applicable Properties pursuant to Article XIV of the Master
                Lease, or

                        (v) any use of any of the applicable Properties or any
                part thereof by the Lessee or any sublessee other than as
                contemplated by the applicable Appraisal, or

                        (vi) any grant, release, dedication, transfer,
                annexation or amendment made pursuant to Section 11.2 of the
                Master Lease, or

                        (vii) the failure of the Lessor to have good and
                marketable title to any of the applicable Properties free and
                clear of all Liens (excluding Permitted Liens), or

                        (viii) the existence of any sublease relating to any of
                the applicable Properties that shall survive the Expiration
                Date.

        SECTION 13.3. Environmental Indemnity. Without limitation of the other
provisions of this Article XIII, the Lessee hereby agrees to indemnify, hold
harmless and defend each Indemnitee from and against any and all claims
(including without limitation third party claims for personal injury or real or
personal property damage), losses (including but not limited to, to the extent
the Lease Balance has not been fully paid, any loss of value of the Property
related thereto), damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, charges,
administrative and judicial proceedings (including informal proceedings) and
orders, judgments, remedial action, requirements, enforcement actions of any
kind, and all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith (including but not limited to reasonable and documented
attorneys' and/or paralegals' fees and expenses), including, but not limited to,
all costs incurred in connection with any investigation or monitoring of site
conditions or any clean-up, remedial, removal or restoration work by any
federal, state or local government agency, arising in whole or in part, out of

                (a) the presence on or under any of the Properties of any
        Hazardous Materials, or any releases or discharges of any Hazardous
        Materials on, under, from or onto any of the Properties,

                (b) any activity, including, without limitation, construction,
        carried on or undertaken on or off any of the Properties, and whether by
        the Lessee or any predecessor in title or any employees, agents,
        contractors or subcontractors of the Lessee or any predecessor in title,
        or any other Persons (including such Indemnitee), in connection with the
        handling, treatment, removal, storage, decontamination, clean-up,
        transport or disposal of any Hazardous Materials that at any time are
        located or present on or under or that at any time migrate, flow,
        percolate, diffuse or in any way move onto or under any of the
        Properties,

                (c) loss of or damage to any property or the environment
        (including, without limitation, clean-up costs, response costs,
        remediation and removal costs, cost of corrective action, costs of
        financial assurance, fines

        and penalties and natural resource damages), or death or injury to any
        Person, and all expenses associated with the protection of wildlife,
        aquatic species, vegetation, flora and fauna, and any mitigative action
        required by or under Hazardous Materials Laws,

                (d) any claim concerning lack of compliance with Hazardous
        Materials Laws, or any act or omission causing an environmental
        condition that requires remediation or would allow any Governmental
        Authority to record a Lien on the land records, or

                (e) any residual contamination on or under any of the Land, or
        affecting any natural resources, and to any contamination of any
        property or natural resources arising in connection with the generation,
        use, handling, storage, transport or disposal of any such Hazardous
        Materials, and irrespective of whether any of such activities were or
        will be undertaken in accordance with applicable laws, regulations,
        codes and ordinances;

provided, however, the Lessee shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee
under this Section 13.3 for (1) any Claim to the extent resulting from the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee or (2) any Claim to
the extent attributable to acts or events occurring after the expiration of the
Term or the return or remarketing of any such Property so long as the Lessor and
the Lenders are not exercising remedies against the Lessee in respect of the
Operative Documents. It is expressly understood and agreed that the indemnity
provided for herein shall survive the expiration or termination of and shall be
separate and independent from any remedy under the Lease or any other Operative
Document.

        SECTION 13.4. Proceedings in Respect of Claims. With respect to any
amount that the Lessee is requested by an Indemnitee to pay by reason of Section
13.1 or 13.3, such Indemnitee shall, if so requested by the Lessee and prior to
any payment, submit such additional information to the Lessee as the Lessee may
reasonably request and which is in the possession of such Indemnitee to
substantiate properly the requested payment.

        In case any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against any
Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall notify the Lessee of the commencement thereof,
and the Lessee shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, and, to the
extent that the Lessee desires to, assume and control the defense thereof;
provided, however, that the Lessee shall have acknowledged in writing its
obligation to fully indemnify such Indemnitee in



                                      -46-
<PAGE>   48
                                                         Participation Agreement


respect of such action, suit or proceeding, and, the Lessee shall keep such
Indemnitee fully apprised of the status of such action, suit or proceeding and
shall provide such Indemnitee with all information with respect to such action,
suit or proceeding as such Indemnitee shall reasonably request, and provided,
further, that the Lessee shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense
of any such action, suit or proceeding if and to the extent that, (A) in the
reasonable opinion of such Indemnitee, (x) such action, suit or proceeding
involves any risk of imposition of criminal liability or will involve a risk of
the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than a
Permitted Lien) on any Property or any part thereof unless, in the case of civil
liability, the Lessee shall have posted a bond or other security satisfactory to
the relevant Indemnitees in respect to such risk or (y) the control of such
action, suit or proceeding would involve an actual or potential conflict of
interest, (B) such proceeding involves Claims not fully indemnified by the
Lessee which the Lessee and the Indemnitee have been unable to sever from the
indemnified claim(s), or (C) a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. The Indemnitee will join in the Lessee's efforts to sever such
action. The Indemnitee may participate in a reasonable manner at its own expense
and with its own counsel in any proceeding conducted by the Lessee in accordance
with the foregoing. The Lessee shall not enter into any settlement or other
compromise with respect to any Claim which is entitled to be indemnified under
Section 13.1 or 13.3 without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in the case of a money settlement not
involving an admission of liability of such Indemnitee.

        Each Indemnitee shall at the expense of the Lessee supply the Lessee
with such information and documents reasonably requested by the Lessee as are
necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or
proceeding to the extent permitted by Section 13.1 or 13.3. Unless an Event of
Default under the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing, no Indemnitee
shall enter into any settlement or other compromise with respect to any Claim
which is entitled to be indemnified under Section 13.1 or 13.3 without the prior
written consent of the Lessee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless such Indemnitee waives its right to be indemnified under Section 13.1 or
13.3 with respect to such Claim.

        Upon payment in full of any Claim by the Lessee pursuant to Section 13.1
or 13.3 to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, the Lessee, without any further
action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee may have
relating thereto (other than claims in respect of insurance policies maintained


                                      -47-

by such Indemnitee at its own expense), and such Indemnitee shall execute such
instruments of assignment and conveyance, evidence of claims and payment and
such other documents, instruments and agreements as may be necessary to preserve
any such claims and otherwise cooperate with the Lessee and give such further
assurances as are necessary or advisable to enable the Lessee vigorously to
pursue such claims.

        Any amount payable to an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.3
shall be paid to such Indemnitee promptly upon receipt of a written demand
therefor from such Indemnitee, accompanied by a written statement describing in
reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the computation of the amount
so payable.

        SECTION 13.5. General Tax Indemnity.

                (a) Indemnification. The Lessee shall pay and assume liability
        for, and does hereby agree to indemnify, protect and defend the
        applicable Property and all Tax Indemnitees, and hold them harmless
        against, all Impositions on an After Tax Basis.

                (b) Contests. If any claim shall be made against any Tax
        Indemnitee or if any proceeding shall be commenced against any Tax
        Indemnitee (including a written notice of such proceeding) for any
        Imposition as to which the Lessee may have an indemnity obligation
        pursuant to this Section 13.5, or if any Tax Indemnitee shall determine
        that any Imposition to which the Lessee may have an indemnity obligation
        pursuant to this Section 13.5 may be payable, such Tax Indemnitee shall
        promptly (and in any event, within 30 days) notify the Lessee in writing
        (provided that failure to so notify the Lessee within 30 days shall not
        alter such Tax Indemnitee's rights under this Section 13.5 except to the
        extent such failure precludes or materially adversely affects the
        ability to conduct a contest of any indemnified Taxes) and shall not
        take any action with respect to such claim, proceeding or Imposition
        without the written consent of the Lessee (such consent not to be
        unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed) for 30 days after the
        receipt of such notice by the Lessee; provided, however, that in the
        case of any such claim or proceeding, if such Tax Indemnitee shall be
        required by law or regulation to take action prior to the end of such
        30-day period, such Tax Indemnitee shall in such notice to the Lessee,
        so inform the Lessee, and such Tax Indemnitee shall not take any action
        with respect to such claim, proceeding or Imposition without the consent
        of the Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
        unreasonably delayed) for 10 days after the

        receipt of such notice by the Lessee unless such Tax Indemnitee shall be
        required by law or regulation to take action prior to the end of such
        10-day period.

                The Lessee shall be entitled for a period of 30 days from
        receipt of such notice from such Tax Indemnitee (or such shorter period
        as such Tax Indemnitee has notified the Lessee is required by law or
        regulation for such Tax Indemnitee to commence such contest), to request
        in writing that such Tax Indemnitee contest the imposition of such Tax,
        at the Lessee's expense. If (x) such contest can be pursued in the name
        of the Lessee and independently from any other proceeding involving a
        Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee for which the Lessee has not agreed
        to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee, (y) such contest must be pursued in
        the name of such Tax Indemnitee, but can be pursued independently from
        any other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee
        for which the Lessee has not agreed to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee or
        (z) such Tax Indemnitee so requests, then the Lessee shall be permitted
        to control the contest of such claim, provided that in the case of a
        contest described in clause (y), if such Tax Indemnitee determines
        reasonably and in good faith that such contest by the Lessee could have
        a material adverse impact on the business or operations of such Tax
        Indemnitee and provides a written explanation to the Lessee of such
        determination, such Tax Indemnitee may elect to control or reassert
        control of the contest, and provided, that by taking control of the
        contest, the Lessee acknowledges that it is responsible for the
        Imposition ultimately determined to be due by reason of such claim, and
        provided, further, that in determining the application of clauses (x)
        and (y) of the preceding sentence, each Tax Indemnitee shall take any
        and all reasonable steps to segregate claims for any Taxes for which the
        Lessee indemnifies hereunder from Taxes for which the Lessee is not
        obligated to indemnify hereunder, so that the Lessee can control the
        contest of the former. In all other claims requested to be contested by
        the Lessee, such Tax Indemnitee shall control the contest of such claim,
        acting through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Lessee. In no event
        shall the Lessee be permitted to contest (or such Tax Indemnitee
        required to contest) any claim, (A) if such Tax Indemnitee provides the
        Lessee with a legal opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the
        Lessee that such action, suit or proceeding involves a risk of
        imposition of criminal liability or will involve a material risk of the
        sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than a
        Permitted Lien) on any Property or any part of any thereof unless the
        Lessee shall have posted and maintained a bond or other security
        satisfactory to the relevant Tax Indemnitee in respect to such risk, (B)
        if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing unless the Lessee
        shall have posted and maintained a bond or other security

        satisfactory to the relevant Tax Indemnitee in respect of the Taxes
        subject to such claim and any and all expenses for which the Lessee is
        responsible hereunder reasonably foreseeable in connection with the
        contest of such claim, (C) unless the Lessee shall have agreed to pay
        and shall pay, to such Tax Indemnitee on demand all reasonable
        out-of-pocket costs, losses and expenses that such Tax Indemnitee may
        incur in connection with contesting such Imposition including all
        reasonable legal, accounting and investigatory fees and disbursements,
        or (D) if such contest shall involve the payment of the Tax prior to the
        contest, unless the Lessee shall provide to such Tax Indemnitee an
        interest-free advance in an amount equal to the Imposition that the
        Indemnitee is required to pay (with no additional net after-tax costs to
        such Tax Indemnitee). In addition for Tax Indemnitee controlled contests
        and claims contested in the name of such Tax Indemnitee in a public
        forum, no contest shall be required: (A) unless the amount of the
        potential indemnity (taking into account all similar or logically
        related claims that have been or could be raised in any audit involving
        such Tax Indemnitee with respect to any period for which the Lessee may
        be liable to pay an indemnity under this Section 13.5(b)) exceeds
        $75,000 or (B) unless, if requested by such Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee
        shall have provided to such Tax Indemnitee an opinion of counsel
        selected by the Lessee (which may be in-house counsel) (except, in the
        case of income taxes indemnified hereunder which shall be an opinion of
        independent tax counsel selected by such Tax Indemnitee and reasonably
        acceptable to the Lessee) that a reasonable basis exists to contest such
        claim. In no event shall a Tax Indemnitee be required to appeal an
        adverse judicial determination to the United States Supreme Court.

                The party conducting the contest shall consult in good faith
        with the other party and its counsel with respect to the contest of such
        claim for Taxes (or claim for refund) but the decisions regarding what
        actions to be taken shall be made by the controlling party in its sole
        judgement, provided, however, that if such Tax Indemnitee is the
        controlling party and the Lessee recommends the acceptance of a
        settlement offer made by the relevant Governmental Authority and such
        Tax Indemnitee rejects such settlement offer then the amount for which
        the Lessee will be required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee with
        respect to the Taxes subject to such offer shall not exceed the amount
        which it would have owed if such

        settlement offer had been accepted. In addition, the controlling party
        shall keep the noncontrolling party reasonably informed as to the
        progress of the contest, and shall provide the noncontrolling party with
        a copy of (or appropriate excerpts from) any reports or claims issued by
        the relevant auditing agents or taxing authority to the controlling
        party thereof, in connection with such claim or the contest thereof.

                Each Tax Indemnitee shall at the Lessee's expense supply the
        Lessee with such information and documents reasonably requested by the
        Lessee as are necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in
        any action, suit or proceeding to the extent permitted by this Section
        13.5(b). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13.5(b) to the
        contrary, no Tax Indemnitee shall enter into any settlement or other
        compromise or fail to appeal an adverse ruling with respect to any claim
        which is entitled to be indemnified under this Section 13.5 (and with
        respect to which contest is required under this Section 13.5(b)) without
        the prior written consent of the Lessee, unless such Tax Indemnitee
        waives its right to be indemnified under this Section 13.5 with respect
        to such claim.

                Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, a Tax
        Indemnitee will not be required to contest (and the Lessee shall not be
        permitted to contest) a claim with respect to the imposition of any Tax
        if such Tax Indemnitee shall waive its right to indemnification from
        Lessee under this Section 13.5 with respect to such claim (and any claim
        with respect to such year or any other taxable year the contest of which
        is materially adversely affected as a result of such waiver).

                (c) Reimbursement for Tax Savings. If (x) a Tax Indemnitee or
        any Affiliate thereof realizes a deduction, offset, credit or refund of
        any Taxes or any other savings or benefit as a result of any indemnity
        paid by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 13.5 or (y) by reason of the
        incurrence or imposition of any Tax (or the circumstances or event
        giving rise thereto) for which a Tax Indemnitee is indemnified hereunder
        or any payment made to or for the account of such Tax Indemnitee by the
        Lessee pursuant to this Section 13.5 or any payment made by a Tax
        Indemnitee to the Lessee by reason of this Section 13.5(c), such Tax
        Indemnitee at any time actually realizes a reduction in any Taxes for
        which the Lessee is not required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee
        pursuant to this Section 13.5 which reduction in Taxes was not taken
        into account in computing such payment by the Lessee to or for the



                                      -51-

                                                         Participation Agreement


        account of such Tax Indemnitee or by such Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee,
        then such Tax Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Lessee (xx) the
        amount of such deduction, offset, credit, refund, or other savings or
        benefit together with the amount of any interest received by such Tax
        Indemnitee on account of such deduction, offset, credit, refund or other
        savings or benefit or (yy) an amount equal to such reduction in Taxes,
        as the case may be, in either case together with an amount equal to any
        reduced Taxes payable by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of such
        payment; provided that no such payment shall be made so long as a
        Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing but
        shall be paid promptly after cure of such Default or Event of Default.
        Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to take such actions as the Lessee may
        reasonably request (provided in the good faith judgment of such Tax
        Indemnitee, such actions would not result in a material adverse effect
        on such Tax Indemnitee for which such Tax Indemnitee is not entitled to
        indemnification from the Lessee) and to otherwise act in good faith to
        claim such refunds and other available Tax benefits, and take such other
        actions as may be reasonable to minimize any payment due from the Lessee
        pursuant to this Section 13.5 and to maximize the amount of any Tax
        savings available to it. The disallowance or reduction of any credit,
        refund or other tax savings with respect to which a Tax Indemnitee has
        made a payment to the Lessee under this Section 13.5(c) shall be treated
        as a Tax for which the Lessee is obligated to indemnify such Tax
        Indemnitee hereunder without regard to the exclusions set forth in the
        definition of Impositions except the exclusions set forth in (iv), (v),
        (vi), (vii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xiv) and (xvi).

                (d) Payments. Any Imposition indemnifiable under this Section
        13.5 shall be paid directly when due to the applicable taxing authority
        if direct payment is practicable and permitted. If direct payment to the
        applicable taxing authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made,
        any amount payable to a Tax Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.5 shall be
        paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written demand therefor
        from such Tax Indemnitee accompanied by a written statement describing
        in reasonable detail the amount so payable, but not before two Business
        Days prior to the date that the relevant Taxes are due. Any payments
        made pursuant to this Section 13.5 shall be made directly to such Tax
        Indemnitee entitled thereto or the Lessee, as the case may be, in
        immediately available funds at such bank or to such account as specified
        by the payee in written directions to the payor, or, if no such
        direction shall have been given,



                                      -52-
<PAGE>   54

        by check of the payor payable to the order of the payee by certified
        mail, postage prepaid at its address as set forth in Schedule II hereto.
        Upon the request of any Tax Indemnitee with respect to a Tax that the
        Lessee is required to pay, the Lessee shall furnish to such Tax
        Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of a receipt for the
        Lessee's payment of such Tax or such other evidence of payment as is
        reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee.

                (e) Reports. In the case of any report, return or statement
        required to be filed with respect to any Taxes that are subject to
        indemnification under this Section 13.5 and of which the Lessee has
        knowledge, the Lessee shall promptly notify such Tax Indemnitee of such
        requirement and, at the Lessee's expense (i) if the Lessee is permitted
        (unless otherwise requested by such Tax Indemnitee) by Applicable Law,
        timely file such report, return or statement in its own name or (ii) if
        such report, return or statement is required to be in the name of or
        filed by such Tax Indemnitee or such Tax Indemnitee otherwise requests
        that such report, return or statement for filing by such Tax Indemnitee
        in such manner as shall be satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee and send
        the same to such Tax Indemnitee for filing no later than 15 days prior
        to the due date therefor. In any case in which such Tax Indemnitee will
        file any such report, return or statement, the Lessee shall, upon
        written request of such Tax Indemnitee, provide such Tax Indemnitee with
        such information as is reasonably necessary to allow such Tax Indemnitee
        to file such report, return or statement.

                (f) Verification. At the Lessee's request, the amount of any
        indemnity payment by the Lessee or any payment by a Tax Indemnitee to
        the Lessee pursuant to this Section 13.5 shall be verified and certified
        by an independent public accounting firm mutually acceptable to the
        Lessee and such Tax Indemnitee. The costs of such verification shall be
        borne by the Lessee unless such verification shall result in an
        adjustment in the Lessee's favor of the lesser of (i) $10,000, and (ii)
        5 percent of the payment as computed by such Tax Indemnitee, in which
        case such fee shall be paid by such Tax Indemnitee. In no event shall
        the Lessee have the right to review such Tax Indemnitee's tax returns or
        receive any other confidential information from such Tax Indemnitee in
        connection with such verification. Any information provided to such
        accountants by any Person shall be and remain the exclusive property of
        such Person and shall be deemed by the parties to be (and the
        accountants will confirm in writing that they will treat such
        information as) the



                                      -53-
<PAGE>   55
                                                         Participation Agreement


        private, proprietary and confidential property of such Person, and no
        Person other than such Person and the accountants shall be entitled
        thereto and all such materials shall be returned to such Person. Such
        accounting firm shall be requested to make its determination within 30
        days of the Lessee's request for verifications and the computations of
        the accounting firm shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
        Lessee and such Tax Indemnitee. The parties agree that the sole
        responsibility of the independent public accounting firm shall be to
        verify the amount of a payment pursuant to this Master Lease and that
        matters of interpretation of this Master Lease are not within the scope
        of the independent accounting firm's responsibilities.

                (g) Tax Ownership. Each Tax Indemnitee represents and warrants
        that it will not, prior to the termination of the Master Lease, claim
        ownership of (or any tax benefits, including depreciation, with respect
        to) any Property for any income tax purposes, it being understood that
        the Lessee is and will remain the owner of the applicable Property for
        such income tax purposes until the termination of the Master Lease. If,
        notwithstanding the income tax intentions of the parties as set forth
        herein, any Tax Indemnitee actually receives any income tax deductions,
        reductions in income tax or other income tax benefit as a result of any
        claim for, or recharacterization requiring such party to take, any tax
        benefits attributable to ownership of any Property for income tax
        purposes, such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee, together with an
        amount equal to any reduced Taxes payable by such Tax Indemnitee as a
        result of such payment, the amount of such income tax savings actually
        realized by such Tax Indemnitee (less the amount of any anticipated
        increase in income tax which such Tax Indemnitee determines is currently
        payable as a result of such claim or recharacterization), provided that
        the Lessee shall agree to reimburse such Tax Indemnitee for any
        subsequent increase in such Tax Indemnitee's income taxes resulting from
        such claim or recharacterization not taken into account in the payment
        made to the Lessee, up to the net amount paid to the Lessee by each Tax
        Indemnitee. The parties agree that this Section 13.5(g) is intended to
        require a payment to the Lessee if and only if each Tax Indemnitee shall
        have actually received an unanticipated tax savings with respect to any
        Property that would not have been received if each Tax Indemnitee had
        advanced funds to the Lessee in the form of a loan secured by such
        Property in an amount equal to the applicable Property Cost. Nothing in
        this Section 13.5(g) shall be construed to require each Tax Indemnitee
        to take



                                      -54-
<PAGE>   56

        any affirmative action to realize any tax savings if in its good faith
        reasonable judgment such action may have a material adverse affect on
        each Tax Indemnitee.

        SECTION 13.6. Indemnity Payments in Addition to Lease Obligations. The
Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Lessee's obligations to make indemnity
payments under this Article XIII are separate from, in addition to, and do not
reduce, the Lessee's obligation to pay under the Lease that portion of the Lease
Balance constituting the Loan Balance.

        SECTION 13.7. LIBO Rate Lending Unlawful. If, on or after the date
hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change
therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Participant (or
its Funding Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall
make it unlawful or impossible for any Participant (or its Funding Office) to
make, maintain or fund Loans or Lessor Amounts, as applicable, and such
Participant shall so notify the Lessee, whereupon until such Participant
notifies the Lessee that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist, the obligation to make Loans or Lessor Amounts, as applicable,
shall be suspended. Such Participant, with the consent of the Lessee (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), will designate a different Funding
Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will
not, in the judgment of such Participant, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Participant. If such notice is given (i) each Lessee shall be entitled upon its
request to a reasonable explanation of the factors underlying such notice and
(ii) each Advance then outstanding shall begin to bear interest at the Alternate
Base Rate either (a) on the last day of the then current Interest Period
applicable thereto, if such Participant may lawfully continue to maintain and
fund such Advance to such day or (b) immediately, if such Participant shall
determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Advance to
such day.

        SECTION 13.8. Deposits Unavailable. If any of the Participants shall
have determined that

                (i) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant
        Interest Period are not available to the Participant in its relevant
        market; or

                (ii) by reason of circumstances affecting the Participant's
        relevant market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the
        interest rate or Yield, as the case



                                      -55-

        may be, applicable to such Participant's Loans or Lessor Amounts,

then, upon notice from such Participant to the Lessee and the other
Participants, (i) the obligations of the Participants to make Loans or Lessor
Amounts, as the case may be, shall be suspended and (ii) each outstanding Loan
or Lessor Amount, as the case may be, shall begin to bear interest or accrue
Yield at the Alternate Base Rate on the last day of the then current Interest
Period applicable thereto.

        SECTION 13.9. Increased Costs, etc.

                (a) In the event that the adoption of any applicable law, rule
        or regulation, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
        application thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
        comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
        thereof or compliance by any Participant with any request or directive
        after the date hereof (whether or not having the force of law) of any
        such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

                        (i) does or shall subject any Participant to any
                additional tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to the
                Operative Documents or any Loan or Lessor Amount, as applicable,
                made by it, or change the basis or the applicable rate of
                taxation of payments to such Participant of principal, interest
                or any other amount payable hereunder (except for the imposition
                of or change in any tax on or measured by or with respect to the
                overall gross or net income, or gross or net receipts
                (including, without limitation, any minimum taxes, income or
                capital gains taxes, or taxes on, or measured by or with respect
                to or in the nature of capital, net worth, excess profits, items
                of tax preference, capital stock, business privilege or doing
                business or any other similar taxes) of such Participant (other
                than any such tax imposed by means of withholding and
                specifically excluding income taxes merely collected by means of
                withholding) or any tax imposed in lieu thereof);

                        (ii) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
                reserve, special deposit, insurance assessment, compulsory loan
                or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or
                other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans
                by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of
                funds by, any office of such Participant which are not otherwise
                included in



                                      -56-
<PAGE>   58

                determination of the rate of interest on Loan or Lessor Amount,
                as applicable, hereunder; or

                        (iii) does or shall impose on such Participant any other
                condition;

        and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
        Participant of making or maintaining Loan or Lessor Amount, as
        applicable, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder, then in any
        such case, the Lessee shall promptly pay to such Participant, upon
        demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Participant
        for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable which such
        Participant deems to be material as determined by such Participant with
        respect to Loan or Lessor Amount, as applicable.

                (b) If any Participant shall have determined that, after the
        date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation
        regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the
        interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
        central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
        administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital
        adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
        central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
        reducing the rate of return on capital of such Participant (or any
        entity directly or indirectly controlling such Participant) as a
        consequence of such Participant's obligations under the Operative
        Documents to a level below that which such Participant (or any entity
        directly or indirectly controlling such Participant) could have achieved
        but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking into
        consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
        amount deemed by such Participant to be material, then from time to
        time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Participant, the
        Lessee shall pay to such Participant such additional amount or amounts
        as will compensate such Participant (or its Parent) for such reduction.

                (c) Each Participant will promptly notify the Lessee of any
        event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which
        will entitle such Participant to compensation pursuant to this Section
        and will, if practicable, with the consent of the Lessee (which consent
        shall not unreasonably be withheld), designate a different Funding
        Office or take any other reasonable action if such designation or action
        will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and
        will not, in the

        reasonable judgment of such Participant, be otherwise disadvantageous to
        such Participant. A certificate of such Participant claiming
        compensation under this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail
        its computation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
        hereunder shall be presumed correct in the absence of demonstrable
        error. In determining such amount, such Participant may use any
        reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

                (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) of this
        Section 13.9, the Lessee shall only be obligated to compensate such
        Participant for any amount arising or accruing both:

                        (i) during (A) any time or period commencing (x) in the
                case of subsection (a), not earlier than the first day of any
                Interest Period in effect on the date which, and (y) in the case
                of subsection (b), not earlier than the date on which such
                Participant notifies the Lessee that it proposes to demand such
                compensation and identifies to the Lessee the statute,
                regulation or other basis upon which the claimed compensation is
                or will be based and (B) any time or period during which,
                because of the retroactive application of such statute,
                regulation or other basis, such Participant did not know that
                such amount would arise or accrue; and

                        (ii) within six months prior to any demand therefor,
                accompanied by a certificate of such Participant claiming
                compensation and setting forth in reasonable detail its
                computation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
                hereunder.

        SECTION 13.10. Funding Losses. If any payment of principal amount of any
Loan or Lessor Amount is made on any day other than the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto, the Lessee shall reimburse the party claiming
reimbursement therefor within fifteen (15) days after demand for any resulting
loss or expense incurred by it, including (without limitation) any loss incurred
in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but
excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or conversion or
failure to borrow or prepay, provided that the such party shall have delivered
to the Lessee a certificate as to the amount of such loss or expense, which
certificate shall be presumed correct in the absence of demonstrable error. Such
party will, at the request of the Lessee, furnish such

additional information concerning the determination of such loss as the Lessee
may reasonably request.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        SECTION 14.1. Survival of Agreements. The representations, warranties,
covenants, indemnities and agreements of the parties provided for in the
Operative Documents, and the parties' obligations under any and all thereof,
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Participation Agreement, the
transfer of any Property to the Lessor, any disposition of any interest of the
Lessor in any Property or any Improvements and the payment of the Notes and any
disposition thereof and shall be and continue in effect notwithstanding any
investigation made by any party and the fact that any party may waive compliance
with any of the other terms, provisions or conditions of any of the Operative
Documents. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or in other Operative

        SECTION 14.2. No Broker, etc. Each of the parties hereto represents to

adviser, except Lund Financial Corporation to act on its behalf in connection
with this Participation Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, nor

by any other Person so to act. Any party who is in breach of this representation
shall indemnify and hold the other parties harmless from and against any
liability arising out of such breach of this representation.

        SECTION 14.4. Counterparts. This Participation Agreement may be executed

        SECTION 14.5. Amendments.

                (a) The provisions of this Participation Agreement may from time
        to time be amended, modified or waived, provided, however, that such
        amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and consented to by the
        Lessee and the Required Participants; provided, further, however, that
        no amendment or waiver of any provision relating to payment or
        performance of an obligation owed to any Participant shall be effective
        against such Participant unless it has been consented to in writing by
        such Participant.

                (b) Neither any Operative Document nor any of the terms thereof
        may be terminated (except upon payment in full of the Lease Balance or
        effective exercise and consummation of the Remarketing Option in
        accordance with Article XX of the Master Lease and payment in full of
        all amounts due in accordance therewith), amended, supplemented, waived
        or modified without the written agreement or consent of each party
        thereto and, regardless of whether the Lenders and the Lessor are
        parties thereto, the Required Participants.

        SECTION 14.6. Headings, etc. The Table of Contents and headings of the
various Articles and Sections of this Participation Agreement are for

STATE OF CALIFORNIA (EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT-OF-LAW OR CHOICE- OF-LAW RULES WHICH
MIGHT LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERNAL LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) AS
TO ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

        SECTION 14.9. Severability. Any provision of this Participation
Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

        SECTION 14.10. Liability Limited. (a) The parties hereto agree that
except as specifically set forth herein or in any other Operative Document,
Lessor shall have no personal liability whatsoever to the Lessee or any
Participant or their respective successors and assigns for any claim based on or
in respect hereof or any of the other Operative Documents or arising in any way
from the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and the recourse shall be
solely had against the Lessor's interest in any Property; provided, however,
that Lessor shall be liable in its individual capacity (a) for its own willful
misconduct or gross negligence (or negligence in the handling of funds), (b)
breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under the
Operative Documents, or (c) for any Tax based on or measured by any fees,
commission or compensation received by it for acting as the Lessor as
contemplated by the Operative Documents. It is understood and agreed that,
except as provided in the preceding sentence: (i) Lessor shall have no personal
liability under any of the Operative Documents as a result of acting pursuant to
and consistent with any of the Operative Documents; (ii) all obligations of
Lessor to the Lessee are solely nonrecourse obligations except to the extent
that it has received payment from others; and (iii) all such personal liability
of Lessor is expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as
consideration for, the execution and delivery of the Operative Documents by
Lessor.

        (b) No Participant shall have any obligation to any other Participant or
to the Lessee, the Lessor or the Lenders with respect to transactions
contemplated by the Operative Documents, except those obligations of such
Participant expressly set forth in the Operative Documents or except as set
forth in the instruments delivered in connection therewith, and no Participant
shall be liable for performance by any other party hereto of such other party's
obligations under the Operative Documents except as otherwise so set forth.

        SECTION 14.11. Further Assurances. The parties hereto shall promptly
cause to be taken, executed, acknowledged or delivered, at the sole expense of
the Lessee, all such further acts, conveyances, documents and assurances as the
other parties may from time to time reasonably request in order to carry out and
preserve the security interests and liens (and the priority thereof) intended to
be created pursuant to this Participation Agreement, the other Operative
Documents, and the transactions thereunder (including, without limitation, the
preparation, execution and filing of any and all Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements and other filings or registrations which the parties hereto
may from time to time request to be filed or effected); provided, however, that
the Lessee shall not be required to pay expenses pursuant to this Section to the
extent arising from a breach or alleged breach by the Lenders or the Lessor of
any agreement entered into in connection with the assignment or participation of
any Loan or Lessor Amount. The Lessee, at its own expense and without need of
any prior request from any other party, shall take such action as may be
necessary (including any action specified in the preceding sentence), or as so
requested, in order to maintain and protect all security interests provided for
hereunder or under any other Operative Document.

        SECTION 14.12. Submission to Jurisdiction. The Lessee hereby submits to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any United States District Court located in the
State of California for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or
relating to the Operative Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Lessee irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding
brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

        SECTION 14.13. Setoff. The Lenders and the Lessor shall, upon the
occurrence of any Lease Event of Default, have the right to appropriate and
apply to the payment of the Lessee's obligations under the Lease as security for
the payment of such obligations, any and all balances, credits, deposits,
accounts or moneys of the Lessee then or thereafter maintained with any Lender
or Lessor. The rights of the Lenders and the Lessor under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff under
applicable law or otherwise) which such Person may have.

        SECTION 14.14. Replacement of Lender. If a Lender fails to fund its
share of the Loans, and such failure is not based on a right granted thereto
under the Operative Documents, then the Lessee shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to

require such Lender to assign and delegate in accordance with Section 12.1 all
of such Lender's total Loans and Commitment to any of the Lenders or to any
other financial institution selected by Lessee that, in each case, is willing to
accept such assignment and delegation and if no such Lender or financial
institution will accept such assignment and delegation, the Lessee shall (in
addition to any other right Lessee may have at law or in equity) have the right
to prepay all outstanding amounts with respect to such Lender and terminate such
Lender's Commitment.

        SECTION 14.15. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HERETO VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH,
THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF
ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY AGREE THAT THEY WILL NOT
SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LITIGATION WITH ANY OTHER LITIGATION IN WHICH A
JURY TRIAL HAS NOT OR CANNOT BE WAIVED. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 14.15
HAVE BEEN FULLY NEGOTIATED BY THE PARTIES HERETO AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO
EXCEPTIONS. THE LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FULL AND
SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROVISION (AND EACH OTHER PROVISION OF EACH
OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY) AND THAT THIS PROVISION IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS ENTERING INTO THIS PARTICIPATION
AGREEMENT AND EACH SUCH OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT.

                                 PAYMENT OF RENT

        3.1. Rent.

                (a) During the Base Lease Term for each Property, the Lessee
        shall pay Basic Rent on each Basic Rent Payment Date, on the date
        required under Section 20.1(k) in connection with the Lessee's exercise
        of the Remarketing Option and on any date on which this Master Lease
        shall terminate with respect to any or all Properties.

                (b) The Lessee's inability or failure to take possession of all
        or any portion of any Property when delivered by the Lessor, nor the
        Lessor's inability or failure to deliver all or any portions of this
        Property to the Lessee where attributable to any act or omission of the
        Lessee or any act or omission of the Lessor, or for any other reason

        pay Rent for such Property in accordance with the terms of this Master

        3.2. Payment of Rent. Rent shall be paid absolutely net to the Lessor,
so that this Master Lease shall yield to the Lessor the full amount thereof,
without setoff, deduction or reduction.

        3.3. Supplemental Rent. The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor or the Person
entitled thereto any and all Supplemental Rent promptly as the same shall become
due and payable, and if the Lessee fails to pay any Supplemental Rent, the
Lessor shall have all rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or by law
or equity or otherwise in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. The Lessee shall
pay to the Lessor, as Supplemental Rent, among other things, on demand, to the
extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, interest at the applicable
Overdue Rate on any installment of Basic Rent not paid when due for the period
for which the same shall be overdue and on any payment of Supplemental Rent not
paid when due or demanded by the Lessor for the period from the due date or the
date of any such demand, as the case may be, until the same shall be paid. The
expiration or other termination of the Lessee's obligations to pay Basic Rent
hereunder shall not limit or modify the obligations of the Lessee with respect
to Supplemental Rent. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this Master Lease,
in the event of any failure on the part of the Lessee to pay and discharge any
Supplemental Rent as and when due, the Lessee shall also promptly pay and
discharge any fine, penalty, interest or cost which may be assessed or added
under any agreement with a third party for nonpayment or late payment of such
Supplemental Rent, all of which shall also constitute Supplemental Rent.

        3.4. Method of Payment. Each payment of Rent shall be made by the Lessee
to the Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., San Francisco, California time to the Agent's
account specified on Schedule II to the Participation Agreement in funds
consisting of lawful currency of the United States of America which shall be
immediately available on the scheduled date when such payment shall be due,
unless such scheduled date shall not be a Business Day, in which case such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. Payments received
after 12:00 p.m., San Francisco time on the date due shall for the purpose of
Section 16.1 hereof be deemed received on such day; provided, however, that for
the purposes of the second sentence of Section 3.3 hereof, such payments shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and, unless the Agent is
otherwise able to invest or employ such funds on the date received, subject to
interest at the Overdue Rate as provided in such Section 3.3.

and quietly have, hold and enjoy each Property for the Lease Term, free of any
claim or other action by the Lessor or anyone claiming by, through or under the
Lessor (other than the Lessee) with respect to any matters arising from and
after the applicable Acquisition Date. Such right of quiet enjoyment is
independent of, and shall not affect the Lessor's rights otherwise to initiate
legal action to enforce, the obligations of the Lessee under this Master Lease.

        4.2. Right to Inspect. During the Lease Term, the Lessee shall upon
reasonable notice from the Lessor (except that no notice shall be required if a
Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), permit the Lessor and
its authorized representatives to inspect any Property subject to this Master
Lease during normal business hours, provided that such inspections shall not
unreasonably interfere with the Lessee's business operations at such Property.

        5.1. Net Lease. This Master Lease shall constitute a net lease. Any
present or future law to the contrary notwithstanding, this Master Lease shall
not terminate, nor shall the Lessee be entitled to any abatement, suspension,
deferment, reduction, setoff, counterclaim, or defense with respect to the Rent,
nor shall the obligations of the Lessee hereunder be affected (except as
expressly herein permitted and by performance of the obligations in connection
therewith) by reason of: (i) any defect in the condition, merchantability,
design, construction, quality or fitness for use of any Property or any part
thereof, or the failure of any Property to comply with all Requirements of Law
and Property Legal Requirements, including any inability to occupy or use any
such Property by reason of such non-compliance; (ii) any damage to, removal,
abandonment, salvage, loss, contamination of or Release from, scrapping or

waiver, extension, indulgence or other action or omission or breach in respect
of any obligation or liability of or by the Lessor or any Participant; (vi) any
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution,
liquidation or other like proceedings relating to the Lessee, the Lessor, any
Participant or any other Person, or any action taken with respect to this Master

any other Person, or by any court, in any such proceeding; (vii) any claim that

any Property; (viii) any failure on the part of the Lessor to perform or comply
with any of the terms of this Master Lease (other than performance by Lessor of
its obligations set forth in Section 2.1 hereof), of any other Operative
Document or of any other agreement; (ix) any invalidity or unenforceability or
illegality or disaffirmance of this Master Lease against or by the Lessee or any
provision hereof or any of the other Operative Documents or any provision of any
thereof; (x) the impossibility or illegality of performance by the Lessee, the
Lessor or both; (xi) any action by any court, administrative agency or other
Governmental Authority; (xii) any restriction, prevention or curtailment of or
interference with the construction on or any use of any Property or any part
thereof; or (xiii) any other cause or circumstances whether similar or
dissimilar to the foregoing and whether or not the Lessee shall have notice or
knowledge of any of the foregoing. The Lessee's agreement in the preceding
sentence shall not affect any claim, action or right the Lessee may have against
the Lessor or any Participant. The parties intend that the obligations of the
Lessee hereunder shall be covenants and agreements that are separate and
independent from any obligations of the Lessor hereunder or under any other
Operative Documents and the obligations of the Lessee shall continue unaffected
unless such obligations shall have been modified or terminated in accordance
with an express provision of this Master Lease.

        5.2. No Termination or Abatement. The Lessee shall remain obligated
under this Master Lease in accordance with its terms and shall not take any
action to terminate, rescind or avoid this Master Lease (except as provided
herein), notwithstanding any action for bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution, or other proceeding affecting the Lessor or any
Participant, or any action with respect to this Master Lease which may be taken
by any trustee, receiver or liquidator of the Lessor or any Participant or by
any court with respect to the Lessor or any Participant. The Lessee hereby
waives all right (i) to terminate or surrender this Master Lease (except as
provided herein) or (ii) to avail itself of any abatement,

suspension, deferment, reduction, setoff, counterclaim or defense with respect

                (i) except for any Modification required to be made pursuant to
        a Requirement of Law or Property Legal Requirement (a "Required
        Modification"), no Modification shall adversely affect the value or
        useful life of such Property or any part thereof from that which existed

        been given if no response from the Lessor to the request for consent is
        received by the Lessee within ten (10) days of the date of such request,
        with respect to any alterations that shall Materially affect any
        structural element of any Improvements.

property belonging to the Lessee or third parties and may remove the same at any
time during the Lease Term, subject, however, to the terms of Section 9.1(a);
provided, however, that such trade fixtures, machinery, equipment, inventory or
other property do not impair the value or useful life of the applicable
Property; provided, further, however, that the Lessee shall keep and maintain at

or otherwise paid for (directly or indirectly) by the Lessor or any Participant
pursuant to the Participation Agreement.

any Modification to any Property to exceed $250,000.00, the Lessee shall deliver
to the Lessor a brief written narrative of the work to be performed in
connection with such Modification prior to making such Modification.

                (b) Nothing contained in this Master Lease shall be construed as
        constituting the consent or request of the Lessor, expressed or implied,
        to or for the performance by any contractor, mechanic, laborer,
        materialman, supplier or vendor of any labor or services or for the
        furnishing of any materials for any construction, alteration, addition,
        repair or demolition of or to any Property or any part thereof. NOTICE
        IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT NONE OF THE LESSOR OR THE LENDERS IS OR SHALL BE
        LIABLE FOR ANY LABOR, SERVICES OR MATERIALS FURNISHED OR TO BE FURNISHED
        TO THE LESSEE, OR TO ANYONE HOLDING A PROPERTY OR ANY PART THEREOF
        THROUGH OR UNDER THE LESSEE, AND THAT NO MECHANIC'S OR OTHER LIENS FOR
        ANY SUCH LABOR, SERVICES OR MATERIALS SHALL ATTACH TO OR AFFECT THE

the provisions of Articles VII, IX and X and Section 8.3 the Lessor hereby
consents in each instance to the following actions by the Lessee, in the name
and stead of the Lessor, but at the Lessee's sole cost and expense: (a) the
granting of easements, licenses, rights-of-way and other rights and privileges
in the nature of easements reasonably necessary or desirable for the use,
repair, or maintenance of any Property as herein provided; (b) the release of
existing easements or other rights in the nature of easements which are for the
benefit of any Property; and (c) the execution of amendments to any covenants
and restrictions affecting any Property; provided, however, that in each case
(i) such grant, release, dedication, transfer or amendment does not materially
impair the value or remaining useful life of the applicable Property, (ii) such
grant, release, dedication, transfer or amendment that in the Lessee's judgment
is reasonably necessary in connection with the use, maintenance, alteration or
improvement of the applicable Property, (iii) such grant, release, dedication,
transfer or amendment will not cause the applicable Property or any portion
thereof to fail to comply with the provisions of this Master Lease or any other
Operative Documents and all Property Legal Requirements (including, without
limitation, all applicable zoning, planning, building and subdivision
ordinances, all applicable restrictive covenants and all applicable
architectural approval requirements); (iv) all governmental consents or
approvals required prior to such grant, release, dedication,

transfer, annexation or amendment have been obtained, and all filings required
prior to such action have been made; (v) the Lessee shall remain obligated under
this Master Lease and under any instrument executed by the Lessee consenting to
the assignment of the Lessor's interest in this Master Lease as security for
indebtedness, in each such case in accordance with their terms, as though such
grant, release, dedication, transfer or amendment had not been effected and (vi)
the Lessee shall pay and perform any obligations of the Lessor under such grant,
release, dedication, transfer or amendment. The Lessor acknowledges the Lessee's
right to finance and to secure under the Uniform Commercial Code, inventory,
furnishings, furniture, equipment, machinery, leasehold improvements and other
personal property located at the Properties other than Equipment, and Lessor
agrees to execute Lessor waiver forms and release of Lessor's Liens in favor of
any purchase money seller, lessor or lender which has financed or may finance in

and expense, execute and deliver any instruments necessary or appropriate to
confirm any such grant, release, dedication, transfer, annexation or amendment

attorney (coupled with an interest) to execute the types of documents,
instruments and agreement referred to in this Section 11.2. In addition, Lessor
covenants to cooperate and to execute promptly any documents requested by Lessee
under this Section 11.2.

                               PERMITTED CONTESTS

        12.1. Permitted Contests in Respect of Applicable Law. If, to the extent
and for so long as (a) a test, challenge, appeal or proceeding for review of any
Applicable Law relating to any Property shall be prosecuted diligently and in
good faith in appropriate proceedings by the Lessee or (b) compliance with such
Applicable Law shall have been excused or exempted by a valid nonconforming use,
variance permit, waiver, extension or forbearance, the Lessee shall not be
required to comply with such Applicable Law but only if and so long as any such
test, challenge, appeal, proceeding, waiver, extension, forbearance or
noncompliance shall not, in the reasonable opinion of the Lessor and the Agent,
involve (A) any risk of criminal liability being imposed on the Lessor or any
Lender or (B) any risk of

(1) foreclosure, forfeiture or loss of such Property, or sale of any Property or
any material part thereof, or nonpayment of Rent (2) civil liability being
imposed on the Lessor, any Lender, or such Property, or (3) enjoinment of, or
interference with, the use, possession or disposition of such Property in any
material respect.

        The Lessor will not be required to join in any proceedings pursuant to
this Section 12.1 unless a provision of any Applicable Law requires that such
proceedings be brought by or in the name of the Lessor; and in that event the
Lessor will join in the proceedings or permit them or any part thereof to be
brought in its name if and so long as (i) the Lessee has not elected the
Remarketing Option and (ii) the Lessee pays all related expenses and indemnifies
the Lessor and the Participants with respect to such proceedings.

                                    INSURANCE

        13.1. Public Liability and Workers' Compensation Insurance.

                (a) During the Lease Term, the Lessee shall procure and carry,
        at the Lessee's sole cost and expense, commercial general liability
        insurance for claims for injuries or death sustained by persons or
        damage to property while on the Properties and such other public
        liability coverages as are ordinarily procured by the Lessee or its
        Affiliates who own or operate similar properties, but in any case shall
        provide liability coverage of at least combined single limit for bodily
        injury or property damage, $5,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate. Such
        insurance shall be on terms and in amounts that are no less favorable
        than insurance maintained by the Lessee or such Affiliates with respect
        to similar properties that they own and that are in accordance with
        normal industry practice. The policy shall be endorsed to name the
        Lessor as additional insured. The policy shall also specifically provide
        that the policy shall be considered primary insurance which shall apply
        to any loss or claim before any contribution by any insurance which the
        Lessor may have in force.

                (b) The Lessee shall in the construction of any Modifications
        and the operation of the Properties, comply with the applicable workers'
        compensation laws.

        13.2. Hazard and Other Insurance. During the Lease Term, the Lessee
shall keep, or cause to be kept, such Property insured against loss or damage by
fire, and other risks on terms and in amounts that are no less favorable than
insurance covering other similar properties owned by the Lessee or its
Affiliates and that are in accordance with normal industry practices, but at
least an amount sufficient to cover the replacement cost of the Improvements.
During the construction of any Improvements the Lessee shall also maintain or
cause to be maintained builders' risk insurance. All insurance proceeds in
respect of any loss or occurrence for which the proceeds related thereto are (i)
less than or equal to $500,000.00, in the absence of the occurrence and
continuance of an Event of Default, shall be adjusted by and paid to the Lessee
for application toward the reconstruction, repair or refurbishment of the
applicable Property and (ii) greater than $500,000.00, shall be adjusted by and
held by the Lessor for application in accordance with Article XIV.

        13.3. Insurance Coverage.

                (a) The Lessee shall furnish the Lessor and the Agent with
        certificates showing the insurance required under Sections 13.1 and 13.2
        to be in effect and naming the Lessor as additional insured with respect
        to liability coverage (excluding worker's compensation insurance),
        naming the Lessor and the Lessee as their interests may appear with
        respect to property coverage and naming the Lessor as loss payee with
        respect to property coverage and showing the mortgagee endorsement
        required by Section 13.3(c) with respect to such coverage. All such
        insurance shall be at the cost and expense of the Lessee. Such
        certificates shall include a provision for no less than thirty (30)
        days' advance written notice by the insurer to the Lessor in the event
        of cancellation or reduction of such insurance.

                (b) The Lessee agrees that the insurance policy or policies
        required by Sections 13.2 shall include an appropriate clause pursuant
        to which such policy shall provide that it will not be invalidated
        should the Lessee waive, in writing, prior to a loss, any or all rights
        of recovery against any party for losses covered by such policy, and
        that the insurance in favor of the Lessor and its rights under and
        interests in said policies shall not be invalidated or reduced by any
        act or omission (including breach of warranty) or negligence of the
        Lessee or any other Person having any interest in any Property other
        than the Lessor. The Lessee hereby waives any and all such rights
        against the Lessor to the extent of payments made under such policies.

                (c) All such insurance shall be written by reputable insurance
        companies that are financially sound and solvent and otherwise
        reasonably appropriate considering the amount and type of insurance
        being provided by such companies. Any insurance company selected by the
        Lessee which is rated in Best's Insurance Guide or any successor thereto
        (or if there be none, an organization having a similar national
        reputation) shall have a general policyholder rating of "A" and a
        financial rating of at least "VIII" or be otherwise acceptable to the
        Lessor. All insurance policies required by Section 13.2 shall include a
        standard form mortgagee endorsement in favor of the Lessor.

                (d) The Lessor shall not carry separate insurance concurrent in
        kind or form or contributing in the event of loss with any insurance
        required under this Article XIII except that the Lessor may, at the
        Lessor's expense, carry separate liability insurance so long as (i) the
        Lessee's insurance is designated as primary and in no event excess or
        contributory to any insurance the Lessor may have in force which would
        apply to a loss covered under the Lessee's policy and (ii) each such
        insurance policy will not cause the Lessee's insurance required under
        this Article XIII to be subject to a coinsurance exception of any kind.

                (e) The Lessee shall pay as they become due all premiums for the
        insurance required by Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, and shall renew or
        replace each policy prior to the expiration date thereof. Throughout the
        Lease Term, at the time each of the Lessee's insurance policies is
        renewed (but in no event less frequently than once each year), the
        Lessee shall deliver to the Lessor and the Agent certificates of
        insurance evidencing that all insurance required by this Article XIII is
        being maintained by the Lessee and is in effect.

        14.1. Casualty and Condemnation.

                (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article XIV, if all or a
        portion of any Property is damaged or destroyed in whole or in part by a
        Casualty or if the use, access, occupancy, easement rights or title to
        any Property or any part thereof, is the subject of a Condemnation, then

                        (i) in the case of a Casualty, (x) any insurance
                proceeds less than $500,000 payable with respect to such
                Casualty shall be paid directly to the Lessee, or if received by
                the Lessor, shall be paid over to such Lessee for the
                reconstruction, refurbishment and repair of such Property, and
                (y) any insurance proceeds in excess of $500,000 payable with
                respect to such Casualty shall be paid to the Lessor to be
                applied by disbursement to the Lessee to the restoration of such
                Property, and

                        (ii) in the case of a Condemnation (that is not a
                Significant Condemnation) of any part of any Land (not including
                the applicable Improvements), any award or compensation relating
                thereto shall be paid to the Lessee and in the case of a
                Significant Condemnation such award or compensation shall be
                paid to the Lessor to be applied in the Lessee's reasonable
                discretion to the restoration of such Property or toward the
                payment of the applicable Lease Balance;

        provided, however, that, in each case, if a Lease Event of Default shall
        have occurred and be continuing, such award, compensation or insurance
        proceeds shall be paid directly to the Lessor or, if received by the
        Lessee, shall be held in trust for the Lessor and the Lenders, and shall
        be paid over by the Lessee to the Lessor to be distributed in accordance
        with the Article VII of the Participation Agreement. All amounts held by
        the Lessor, or the Lenders when a Lease Event of Default exists
        hereunder on account of any award, compensation or insurance proceeds
        either paid directly to the Lessor or the Lenders or turned over to the
        Lessor or the Lenders shall at the option of the Lessor either be (i)
        paid to the Lessee for the repair of damage caused by such Casualty or

        of the Lessor and the Lessee in and to any such award, compensation or
        insurance payment.

                (c) If the Lessor or the Lessee shall receive notice of a
        Casualty or of an actual, pending or threatened Condemnation of any
        Property or any interest therein, the Lessor or the Lessee, as the case
        may be, shall give notice thereof to the other and to the Lenders
        promptly after the receipt of such notice.

                (d) If pursuant to this Section 14.1 and Section 15.1 this
        Master Lease shall continue in full force and effect following a
        Casualty or Condemnation with respect to any Property, the Lessee shall,
        at its sole cost and expense (and, without limitation, if any award,
        compensation or insurance payment is not sufficient to restore such
        Property in accordance with this clause (d), or is not covered by
        insurance as in the case of Casualty caused by earthquake, the Lessee
        shall pay the shortfall), promptly and diligently repair any damage to
        such Property caused by such Casualty or Condemnation in conformity with
        the requirements of Sections 9.1 and 10.1 (as modified to give effect to
        any subsequent Modifications, any Condemnation affecting such Property
        and all applicable Property Legal Requirements) so as to restore such
        Property to at least the same condition, operation, function and value
        as existed immediately prior to such Casualty or Condemnation with such
        Modification as the Lessee may elect in accordance with Section 10.1. In
        such event, title to such Property shall remain with the Lessor subject
        to the terms of this Master Lease. Upon completion of such restoration,
        the Lessee shall furnish the Lessor an architect's certificate of
        substantial completion and a Responsible Employee's Certificate
        confirming that such restoration has been completed pursuant to this
        Master Lease.

                (e) In no event shall a Casualty or Condemnation affect the
        Lessee's obligations to pay Rent pursuant to Section 3.1 or to perform
        its obligations and pay any amounts due on the Expiration Date or
        pursuant to Articles XVIII and XXI.

                (f) Any Excess Casualty/Condemnation Proceeds received by the
        Lessor or the Lenders in respect of a Casualty or Condemnation shall be
        turned over to the Lessee.

        14.2. Environmental Matters. Promptly upon the Lessee's knowledge of the
existence of an Environmental Violation with respect to any Property, the Lessee
shall notify the Lessor in

writing of such Environmental Violation. If the Lessor elects not to terminate
this Master Lease with respect to such Property pursuant to Section 15.1, at the
Lessee's sole cost and expense, the Lessee shall promptly and diligently
commence any response, clean up, remedial or other action necessary to remove,
clean up or remediate the Environmental Violation in accordance with the terms
of Section 8.3 (including the last sentence thereof). The Lessee shall, upon
completion of remedial action by the Lessee, cause to be prepared by an
environmental consultant reasonably acceptable to the Lessor a report describing
the Environmental Violation and the actions taken by the Lessee (or its agents)
in response to such Environmental Violation, and a statement by the consultant
that the Environmental Violation has been remedied in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Hazardous Materials Laws. Each such Environmental
Violation shall be remedied prior to the Expiration Date unless each Property
with respect to which an Environmental Violation has occurred but has not been
remedied has been purchased by the Lessee in accordance with Section 18.1 or
18.2. Nothing in this Article XIV shall reduce or limit the Lessee's obligations
under Sections 13.1, 13.2 or 13.3 of the Participation Agreement.

        14.3. Notice of Environmental Matters. Promptly, but in any event within
sixty (60) Business Days from the date the Lessee has actual knowledge thereof,
the Lessee shall provide to the Lessor written notice of any pending or
threatened claim, action or proceeding involving any Hazardous Materials Laws or
any Release on or in connection with any Property. All such notices shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, action or proceeding and
the Lessee's proposed response thereto. In addition, the Lessee shall provide to
the Lessor, within sixty (60) Business Days of receipt, copies of all written
communications with any Governmental Authority relating to any Environmental
Violation in connection with any Property. The Lessee shall also promptly
provide such detailed reports of any such material environmental claims as may
reasonably be requested by the Lessor or the Lenders. In the event that the
Lessor receives written notice of any pending or threatened claim, action or
proceeding involving any Hazardous Materials Laws or any Release on or in
connection with any Property, the Lessor shall promptly give notice thereof to
the Lessee.

        terminate this Master Lease as to any Property or all of the Properties
        as of the date specified in such notice; however, (i) no reletting,
        reentry or taking of possession of any Property (or any portion thereof)
        by the Lessor will be construed as an election on the Lessor's part to
        terminate this Master Lease unless a written notice of such intention is
        given to the Lessee, (ii) notwithstanding any reletting, reentry or
        taking of possession, the Lessor may at any time thereafter elect to
        terminate this Master Lease for a continuing Lease Event of Default and
        (iii) no act or thing done by the Lessor or any of its agents,
        representatives or employees and no agreement accepting a surrender of
        the Properties shall be valid unless the same be made in writing and
        executed by the Lessor;

                (b) The Lessor may (i) demand that the Lessee, and the Lessee
        shall upon the written demand of the Lessor, return any Property
        promptly to the Lessor in the manner and condition required by, and
        otherwise in accordance with all of the provisions of, Articles VII and

        end of the Lease Term, and the Lessor shall not be liable for the
        reimbursement of the Lessee for any costs and expenses incurred by the
        Lessee in connection therewith and (ii) without prejudice to any other
        remedy which the Lessor may have for possession of any Property, and to
        the extent and in the manner permitted by Applicable Law, enter upon

        Lessee) such Property or any part thereof and expel or remove the Lessee
        and any other Person who may be occupying such Property, by summary
        proceedings or otherwise, all without liability to the Lessee for or by
        reason of such entry or taking of possession, whether for the
        restoration of damage to property caused by such taking or otherwise
        and, in addition to the Lessor's other damages, the Lessee shall be
        responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the Lessor and/or the

        public sale free and clear of any rights of the Lessee and without any
        duty to account to the Lessee with respect to such action or inaction or
        any proceeds (except that Excess Proceeds are payable to and shall be
        paid to the Lessee) with respect thereto (except to the extent required

        hereunder for periods commencing after the date of such sale shall be
        terminated or proportionately reduced, as the case may be; and (ii) if
        the Lessor shall so elect, demand that the Lessee pay to the Lessor, and
        the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, on the date of such sale, as
        liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty (the
        parties agreeing that the Lessor's actual damages would be difficult to
        predict, but the aforementioned liquidated damages represent a
        reasonable approximation of such amount) or (in lieu of Basic Rent due
        for periods commencing on or after the Payment Date coinciding with such
        date of sale (or, if the sale date is not a Basic Rent Payment Date, the
        Basic Rent Payment Date next preceding the date of such sale)), an
        amount equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Lease Balance
        calculated as of such Basic Rent Payment Date (including all Rent due
        and unpaid to and including such Basic Rent Payment Date and), over (2)
        the net proceeds of such sale (that is, after deducting all costs and
        expenses incurred by the Lessor incident to such conveyance, including,
        without limitation, repossession costs, brokerage commissions,
        prorations, transfer taxes, fees and expenses for counsel, title
        insurance fees, survey costs, recording fees, and any repair costs);
        plus (B) interest at the Overdue Rate on the foregoing amount from such
        Basic Rent Payment Date until the date of payment;

                (d) The Lessor may, at its option, elect not to terminate this
        Master Lease with respect to any Property or all of the Properties and
        continue to collect all Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, and all other
        amounts due the Lessor (together with all costs of collection) and
        enforce the Lessee's obligations under this Master Lease as and when the
        same become due, or are to be performed, and at the option of the
        Lessor, upon any abandonment of any Property by the Lessee or re-entry
        of same by the Lessor, the Lessor may, in its sole and absolute

        necessary repairs in order to relet such Property, and relet such
        Property or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may be for a
        long term extending beyond the Lease Term of

        this Master Lease) and at such rental or rentals and upon such other
        terms and conditions as the Lessor in its reasonable discretion may deem
        advisable; and upon each such reletting all rentals actually received by
        the Lessor from such reletting shall be applied to the Lessee's
        obligations hereunder and the other Operative Documents in such order,
        proportion and priority as the Lessor may elect in the Lessor's sole and
        absolute discretion. If such rentals received from such reletting during
        any period are less than the Rent with respect to such Property to be
        paid during that period by the Lessee hereunder, the Lessee shall pay
        any deficiency, as calculated by the Lessor, to the Lessor on the next
        Basic Rent Payment Date;

                (e) Unless all of the Properties have been sold in their
        entirety, the Lessor may, whether or not the Lessor shall have exercised
        or shall thereafter at any time exercise any of its rights under clause
        (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 16.2 with respect to any Properties or
        any portions thereof, demand, by written notice to the Lessee specifying
        a date (a "Termination Date") not earlier than twenty (20) days after
        the date of such notice, that the Lessee purchase, on such Termination
        Date, all unsold Properties and all unsold portions of Properties in
        accordance with the provisions of Article XXI and Section 18.2;

                (f) The Lessor may exercise any other right or remedy that may
        be available to it under Applicable Law, or proceed by appropriate court
        action (legal or equitable) to enforce the terms hereof or to recover
        damages for the breach hereof. Separate suits may be brought to collect
        any such damages for any period(s), and such suits shall not in any
        manner prejudice the Lessor's right to collect any such damages for any
        subsequent period(s), or the Lessor may defer any such suit until after
        the expiration of the Lease Term, in which event such suit shall be
        deemed not to have accrued until the expiration of the Lease Term;

                (g) The Lessor may retain and apply against the Lease Balance
        all sums which the Lessor would, absent such Lease Event of Default, be
        required to pay to, or turn over to, the Lessee pursuant to the terms of
        this Master Lease;

                (h) If a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
        continuing, the Lessor, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, as a
        matter of right and with notice to the Lessee, shall have the right to
        apply to any court having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or
        receivers of any

        Property, and the Lessee hereby irrevocably consents to any such
        appointment. Any such receiver(s) shall have all of the usual powers and
        duties of receivers in like or similar cases and all of the powers and
        duties of the Lessor in case of entry, and shall continue as such and
        exercise such powers until the date of confirmation of the sale of such
        Property unless such receivership is sooner terminated;

                (i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Lessee hereby
        waives the benefit of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension,
        reinstatement and redemption laws now or hereafter in force and all
        rights of marshalling in the event of any sale of any Property or any
        interest therein;

                (j) The Lessor shall be entitled to enforce payment of the
        indebtedness and performance of the obligations secured hereby and to
        exercise all rights and powers under this instrument or under any of the
        other Operative Documents or other agreement or any laws now or
        hereafter in force, notwithstanding some or all of the obligations
        secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise secured, whether by
        mortgage, security agreement, pledge, lien, assignment or otherwise.
        Neither the acceptance of this instrument nor its enforcement, shall
        prejudice or in any manner affect the Lessor's right to realize upon or
        enforce any other security now or hereafter held by the Lessor, it being
        agreed that the Lessor shall be entitled to enforce this instrument and
        any other security now or hereafter held by the Lessor in such order and
        manner as the Lessor may determine in its absolute discretion. No remedy
        herein conferred upon or reserved to the Lessor is intended to be
        exclusive of any other remedy herein or by law provided or permitted,
        but each shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other
        remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity
        or by statute. Every power or remedy given by any of the Operative
        Documents to the Lessor or to which it may otherwise be entitled, may be
        exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time and as often
        as may be deemed expedient by the Lessor. In no event shall the Lessor,
        in the exercise of the remedies provided in this instrument (including,
        without limitation, in connection with the assignment of rents to
        Lessor, or the appointment of a receiver and the entry of such receiver
        onto all or any part of the Properties), be deemed a "mortgagee in
        possession," and the Lessor shall not in any way be made liable for any
        act, either of commission or omission, in connection with the exercise
        of such remedies.

If, pursuant to the exercise by the Lessor of its remedies pursuant to this
Section 16.2, the Lease Balance and all other amounts due and owing from the
Lessee under this Master Lease and the other Operative Documents have been paid
in full, then the Lessor shall remit to the Lessee any excess amounts received
by the Lessor.

                (k) Foreclosure; Power of Sale. Lessee hereby grants to First
        American Title Guaranty Company, as trustee (together with all successor
        trustees, the "Trustee"), IN TRUST, WITH POWER OF SALE, all of Lessee's
        right, title and interest in and to the Properties and, upon the
        occurrence of a Lease Event of Default, Lessor shall have the power and
        authority, after proper notice and lapse of such time as may be required
        by law, to cause Trustee to sell any Property or the Properties by
        notifying Trustee of that election and depositing with Trustee this
        instrument and receipts and evidence of expenditures made and secured
        hereby as Trustee may reasonably require. Upon receipt of any such
        notice from Lessor, Trustee shall cause to be recorded, published and
        delivered to Lessee such Notice of Default and Election to Sell as is
        then required by applicable statutory authority and by this instrument,
        which notice shall set forth, among other things, the nature of the
        breach(es) or default(s), the action(s) required to effect a cure
        thereof and the time period within which that cure may be effected. If
        no cure is effected within the statutory time limits following
        recordation of the Notice of Default and Election to Sell and after
        Notice of Sale has been given as required by the above-referenced
        statutes, Trustee may without further notice or demand sell and convey
        any Property or the Properties in accordance with the above-referenced
        statutes. Each Property may be sold as a whole or in separate lots,
        parcels or items and in such order as Lessor may direct, at public
        auction to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of the United
        States payable at the time of sale. Trustee shall deliver to such
        purchaser(s) a good and sufficient deed or deeds conveying the property
        so sold, but without any covenant or warranty express or implied. The
        recitals in such deed of any matter or fact shall be conclusive proof of
        the truthfulness thereof. Any Person, including Lessee, Trustee or
        Lessor, may purchase at any sale. After deducting all costs, fees and
        expenses of Lessor and Trustee, including costs of evidence of title in
        connection with any sale, Lessor shall apply the proceeds of sale, in
        the following order of priority, to payment of the following
        (collectively, the "Obligations"): (i) first, all amounts expended by or
        for the account of Lessor under the

                                                                    Master Lease


        terms hereof and not then repaid, with accrued interest at the Overdue
        Rate; and (ii) second, all other amounts then due and owing hereunder
        including, without limitation, all Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, the
        full amount of the Lease Balance as of the date of sale as if this Lease
        had been terminated with respect to all of the Properties then subject
        to this Lease under Section 18.1, and all other amounts then payable by
        Lessee under this Lease and the other Operative Documents, with Lessor
        having the right to apply the proceeds of sale to the amounts described
        above in this clause (ii) in such order, proportion and priority as
        Lessor may elect in its sole and absolute discretion. To the extent
        permitted by applicable statutes, Trustee may postpone the sale of all
        or any portion of any Property or the Properties by public announcement
        at the time and place of sale, and from time to time thereafter may
        again postpone that sale by public announcement or subsequently noticed
        sale, and without further notice may make such sale at the time fixed at
        the last postponement or may, in its discretion, give a new notice of
        sale. A sale of less than all of any Property or the Properties or any
        defective or irregular sale made hereunder shall not exhaust the power
        of sale provided for herein, and subsequent sales may be made hereunder
        until all of the Obligations have been satisfied or all the Properties
        have been sold, without defect or irregularity. No action of Lessor or
        Trustee based upon the provisions contained herein or contained in the
        applicable statutes, including, without limitation, the giving of the
        Notice of Default and Election to Sell or the Notice of Sale, shall
        constitute an election of remedies which would preclude Lessor from
        pursuing judicial foreclosure before a completed sale pursuant to the
        power of sale contained herein. Lessor shall have the right, with the
        irrevocable consent of Lessee hereby given and evidenced by the
        execution of this instrument, to obtain appointment of a receiver by any
        court of competent jurisdiction without further notice to Lessee, which
        receiver shall be authorized and empowered to enter upon and take
        possession of any Property or the Properties, including all personal
        property used upon or in connection with the real property herein
        conveyed, to let any Property or the Properties, to receive all the
        rents, issues and profits, if any, which may be due or become due in
        respect to the leasing of any Property or the Properties to another
        party ("Property Rents"), and apply the Property Rents after payment of
        all necessary charges and expenses to reduction of the Obligations in
        such order, proportion and priority as Lessor may elect. At the option
        of Lessor, the receiver shall accomplish entry and taking possession of
        any Property or the Properties by

        actual entry and possession or by notice to Lessee. The receiver so
        appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be empowered to
        issue receiver's certificates for funds advanced by Lessor for the
        purpose of protecting the value of any Property or the Properties as
        security for the Obligations. The amounts evidenced by receiver's
        certificates shall bear interest at the Overdue Rate and may be added to
        the Obligations if the Lessee or a junior lienholder purchases any
        Property or the Properties at the trustee's sale. Trustee or any
        successor acting hereunder may resign and thereupon be discharged of the
        trusts hereunder upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lessor.
        Regardless of whether Trustee resigns, Lessor may, from time to time,
        substitute a successor or successors to any Trustee named herein or
        acting hereunder in accordance with any statutory procedure for such
        substitution; or if Lessor, in its sole and absolute discretion, so
        elects, and if permitted by law, Lessor may substitute such successors
        or successors by recording, in the office of the recorder of the county
        or counties where such Property is located, a document executed by
        Lessor and containing the name of the original Lessee and Lessor
        hereunder, the book and page where this instrument (or a memorandum
        hereof) is recorded (and/or instrument number, as applicable) and the
        name of the new Trustee, which instrument shall be conclusive proof of
        proper substitution of such successor Trustee or Trustees, who shall,
        without conveyance from the predecessor Trustee, succeed to the rights,
        powers and duties hereunder. It is acknowledged that A POWER OF SALE HAS
        BEEN GRANTED IN THIS INSTRUMENT; A POWER OF SALE MAY ALLOW LESSOR TO
        TAKE THE PROPERTIES AND SELL THEM WITHOUT GOING TO COURT IN A
        FORECLOSURE ACTION UPON DEFAULT BY LESSEE UNDER THIS INSTRUMENT.

        Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Lessor acknowledges that upon
the occurrence and continuance of a Lease Event of Default solely under clause
(e) of Section 16.1, the Lessor's remedies for such default shall be limited to
recovery of the Loan Balance by liquidation of the Additional Collateral or
through other appropriate means.

        16.3. Waiver of Certain Rights. If this Master Lease shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 16.2, the Lessee waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, (a) any notice of re-entry or the institution of legal proceedings to
obtain re-entry or possession; (b) any right of redemption, re-entry or
repossession; (c) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force exempting
property from liability for rent or for debt or limiting the Lessor with respect
to the election of remedies; and

(d) any other rights which might otherwise limit or modify any of the Lessor's
rights or remedies under this Article XVI.

                             LESSOR'S RIGHT TO CURE

        17.1. The Lessor's Right to Cure the Lessee's Lease Defaults. The
Lessor, without waiving or releasing any obligation or Lease Event of Default,
may (but shall be under no obligation to) remedy any Lease Event of Default for
the account and at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee, including the
failure by the Lessee to maintain the insurance required by Article XIII, and
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and notwithstanding any right of
quiet enjoyment in favor of the Lessee, enter upon any Property for such purpose
and take all such action thereon as may be necessary or appropriate therefor. No
such entry shall be deemed an eviction of the Lessee. All reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses so incurred (including fees and expenses of
counsel), together with interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date on
which such sums or expenses are paid by the Lessor, shall be paid by the Lessee
to the Lessor as Supplemental Rent.


                                  ARTICLE XVIII
                               PURCHASE PROVISIONS

        18.1. Purchase of All or Some of the Properties. Subject to the
conditions contained herein, and without limitation of the Lessee's purchase
obligation pursuant to Section 18.2, the Lessee shall have the irrevocable
option on any Business Day to purchase all or some of the Properties subject to
this Master Lease at a price equal to the Lease Balance for such Properties on
the date of such purchase relating to such Property. The Lessee's exercise of
its option pursuant to this Section 18.1 shall be subject to the following
conditions:

                (i) the Lessee shall have delivered a Purchase Notice to the
        Lessor not less than thirty (30) days prior to such purchase, specifying
        the date of such purchase;

                (ii) the Lessee shall not have given notice of its intention to
        exercise the Remarketing Option.

If the Lessee exercises its option pursuant to this Section 18.1 then, upon the
Lessor's receipt of all amounts due in connection therewith, including Break
Costs, if any, the Lessor shall transfer to the Lessee or its designee all of
the Lessor's right,

title and interest in and to the applicable Properties in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 21.1(a), such transfer to be effective as of the
date specified in the Purchase Notice. The Lessee may designate, in a notice
given to the Lessor not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the closing of
such purchase (time being of the essence), the transferee or transferees to whom
the conveyance shall be made (if other than to the Lessee), in which case such
conveyance shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein) be made
to such designee; provided, however, that such designation of a transferee or
transferees shall not cause the Lessee to be released, fully or partially, from
any of its obligations under this Master Lease, including, without limitation,
the obligation to pay the Lessor the Lease Balance on such Expiration Date.

        18.2. Expiration Date Purchase Obligation; Change of Control Purchase
Obligation. (a) Unless (i) the Lessee shall have properly exercised its option
pursuant to Section 18.1 and purchased the Properties pursuant thereto, or (ii)
the Lessee shall have properly exercised the Remarketing Option and shall have
fulfilled all of the conditions of clauses (a) through (l) of Section 20.1
hereof and the Lessor shall have sold its interest in all of the Properties
pursuant thereto, then, subject to the terms, conditions and provisions set
forth in this Article, and in accordance with the terms of Section 21.1(a), the
Lessee shall purchase from the Lessor, and the Lessor shall convey to the
Lessee, on the Expiration Date all of the Lessor's interest in all of the
Properties for an amount equal to the Lease Balance.

        (b) In the event that a Change of Control shall have occurred the Lessor
may, within two Business Days of receipt of written notice from the Lessee of
such occurrence, demand that the Lessee purchase from the Lessor all of the
Properties for an amount equal to the Lease Balance and the Lessee shall
purchase the Properties as provided herein. Such purchase shall occur no later
than the earlier of (x) the Expiration Date or (y) the next scheduled Basic Rent
Payment Date, provided such date is no earlier than 30 days after the Lessor
issues its purchase demand, and be effected as provided in Section 21.1(a).

        (c) The Lessee may designate, in a notice given to the Lessor not less
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the closing of such purchase (time being of
the essence), the transferee or transferees to whom the conveyance shall be made
(if other than to the Lessee), in which case such conveyance shall (subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein) be made to such designee; provided,
however, that such designation of a transferee or transferees shall not cause
the Lessee to be

released, fully or partially, from any of its obligations under this Master
Lease, including, without limitation, the obligation to pay the Lessor the Lease
Balance on such Expiration Date or designated purchase date, as the case may be.

        18.3. Exchange of Properties. So long as no Lease Default or Lease Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessor shall, subject to
receipt of an Exchange Request and satisfaction of all the conditions set forth
in Article II of the Participation Agreement, release the Property subject to
Lease Supplement No. 3 from the Lease and convey such Property to the party
designated by the Lessee in accordance with Section 21.1(a) hereof, accept
conveyance of City Center II from such party and enter into Lease Supplement No.
4 with the Lessee pursuant to the Participation Agreement and from and after
such conveyances City Center II shall be subject to this Lease.

                                  RENEWAL TERMS

        19.1. Renewal. Prior to the final Expiration Date, the parties hereto
may agree to renew this Master Lease for one or more additional terms upon terms
and conditions to be mutually agreed upon; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall be construed as a commitment by either party to renew this Master
Lease beyond the Expiration Date.


                                   ARTICLE XX
                               REMARKETING OPTION

        20.1. Option to Remarket. Subject to the fulfillment of each of the
conditions set forth in this Section 20.1, the Lessee shall have the option (the
"Remarketing Option") to market and complete the sale of all of the Properties
for the Lessor.

        The Lessee's effective exercise and consummation of the Remarketing
Option shall be subject to the due and timely fulfillment of each of the
following provisions as to each of the Properties as of the dates set forth
below.

                (a) Not later than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to
        the Expiration Date, the Lessee shall give to the Lessor written notice
        of the Lessee's exercise of the Remarketing Option, which exercise shall
        be irrevocable. Failure by the Lessee to give timely notice shall be
        deemed to be an election by the Lessee, without further act thereby, of
        its Purchase Option for all of the Properties.

                (b) Not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to
        the Expiration Date, the Lessee shall deliver to the Lessor an
        Environmental Audit for each of the Properties. Such Environmental Audit
        shall be prepared by an environmental consultant selected by the Lessor
        in the Lessor's reasonable discretion and shall contain conclusions
        reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor as to the environmental status of
        the Properties. If any such Environmental Audit indicates any
        exceptions, the Lessee shall have also delivered prior to the Expiration
        Date a Phase Two environmental assessment by such environmental
        consultant and a written statement by such environmental consultant
        indicating that all such exceptions have been remedied in compliance
        with Applicable Law.

                (c) The Lessee shall have completed all Modifications,
        restoration and rebuilding of the affected Properties pursuant to
        Sections 10.1 and 14.1 (as the case may be) and shall have fulfilled all
        of the conditions and requirements in connection therewith pursuant to
        said Sections, in each case prior to the date on which the Lessor
        receives the Lessee's notice of the Lessee's intention to exercise the
        Remarketing Option (time being of the essence), regardless of whether
        the same shall be within the Lessee's control. The Lessee shall have
        also paid the cost of all Modifications commenced prior to the
        Expiration Date. The Lessee shall not have been excused pursuant to
        Section 12.1 from complying with any Applicable Law that involved the
        extension of the ultimate imposition of such Applicable Law beyond the
        Expiration of the Term. Any Permitted Property Liens (other than Lessor
        Liens) on any Property that were contested by the Lessee shall have been
        removed.

                (d) During the Marketing Period, the Lessee shall, as
        nonexclusive agent for the Lessor, use its best efforts to sell the
        Lessor's interest in the Properties and will attempt to obtain the
        highest purchase price therefor and for not less than the Fair Market
        Sales Value. The Lessee will be responsible for hiring brokers and
        making the Properties available for inspection by prospective
        purchasers. The Lessee shall promptly upon request permit inspection of
        any Property and any maintenance records relating to any Property by the
        Lessor, any Participant and any potential purchasers, and shall
        otherwise do all things necessary to sell and deliver possession of the
        Properties to any purchaser. All such marketing of the Properties shall
        be at the Lessee's sole expense. The Lessee shall allow the Lessor and
        any potential qualified purchaser

        reasonable access to the Properties for the purpose of inspecting the
        same.

                (e) The Lessee shall procure bids from one or more bona fide
        prospective purchasers and shall deliver to the Lessor and the
        Participants not less than ninety (90) days prior to the Expiration Date
        a binding written unconditional (except as set forth below), irrevocable
        offer by such purchaser or purchasers offering the highest bid to
        purchase the Properties. No such purchaser shall be the Lessee or any
        Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Lessee. The written offer must specify
        the Expiration Date as the closing date unless the Lessor and the
        Participants shall otherwise agree in their sole discretion.

                (f) The Lessee shall submit all bids to the Lessor and the
        Participants, and the Lessor will have the right to submit any one or
        more bids. Any sale by the Lessee shall be for the highest cash bid
        submitted to the Lessor. The determination of the highest bid shall be
        made by the Lessor prior to the end of the Marketing Period, but in any
        event, the Lessor shall have no obligation to approve any bid for any
        Property unless each highest bid plus an amount that may be paid by the
        Lessee in its sole and absolute discretion (in addition to its
        obligations under Section 20.1(i)), together with such bid, equals or
        exceeds the Property Balance. All bids shall be on an all-cash basis
        unless the Lessor and the Participants shall otherwise agree in their
        sole discretion.

                (g) The Lessee shall have obtained, at its cost and expense, all
        required governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and shall
        have made all filings as required by Applicable Law in order to carry
        out and complete the transfer of each of the Properties. As to the
        Lessor, any such sale shall be made on an "as is, with all faults" basis
        without representation or warranty by the Lessor other than the absence
        of Lessor Liens. Any agreement as to such sale shall be made subject to
        the Lessor's rights hereunder.

                (h) As between the Lessor and the Lessee the Lessee shall pay
        directly, and not from the sale proceeds, all prorations, credits, costs
        and expenses of the sale of the Properties, whether incurred by the
        Lessor or the Lessee, including without limitation, the cost of all
        title insurance, surveys, environmental reports, appraisals, transfer
        taxes, the Lessor's reasonable attorneys' fees,

        the Lessee's attorneys' fees, commissions, escrow fees, recording fees,
        and all applicable documentary and other transfer taxes.

                (i) The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on or prior to the
        Expiration Date (or in the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Person
        entitled thereto) an amount equal to the Loan Balance plus all accrued
        and unpaid Rent (including Supplemental Rent, if any) and all other
        amounts hereunder which have accrued or will accrue prior to or as of
        the Expiration Date, in the type of funds specified in Section 3.4
        hereof.

                (j) The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on or prior to the
        Expiration Date the amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to
        Section 13.2 of the Participation Agreement.

                (k) The purchase of all of the Properties shall be consummated
        on the Expiration Date and the gross proceeds (the "Gross Remarketing
        Proceeds") of the sale of the Properties (less any marketing, closing or
        other costs, prorations or commissions) shall be paid directly to the
        Lessor; provided, however, that if the sum of (x) the Gross Remarketing
        Proceeds from such sale plus (y) the Loan Balance received by the Lessor
        exceeds the Lease Balance as of such date, then the excess shall be paid
        to the Lessee on the Expiration Date.

        If the Lessee effectively elects the Remarketing Option and no sale of
any Property is consummated prior to the end of the Marketing Period, Lessee may
exercise its purchase option pursuant to Section 18.2 or Lessee shall, in
addition to making the payment required pursuant to Section 20.1(i) above, at
its own cost and expense, do each of the following:

                (i) execute and deliver to Lessor and the Lessor's title
        insurance company an affidavit as to the absence of any Liens (other
        than Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (i), (viii) or
        (x)), and shall execute and deliver to the Lessor a statement of
        termination of this Master Lease to the extent relating to such
        Property;

                (ii) on the Expiration Date, transfer possession of such
        Property to the Lessor or any Person designated by the Lessor, by
        surrendering the same into the possession of the Lessor or such Person,
        as the case may be, in the condition required by this Section 20.1 and
        in compliance with Applicable Law; and

                (iii) for a period of up to one year after the Expiration Date,
        cooperate reasonably with the Lessor and/or any Person designated by the
        Lessor to receive such Property, which cooperation shall include
        reasonable efforts with respect to the following, all of which the
        Lessee shall do on or before the Expiration Date for such Property or as
        soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable: providing copies of all
        books and records regarding the maintenance and ownership of such
        Property and all know-how, data and technical information relating
        thereto, providing a current copy of the applicable Plans and
        Specifications, granting or assigning all assignable licenses necessary
        for the operation and maintenance of such Property and cooperating
        reasonably in seeking and obtaining all necessary Governmental Action.
        The obligations of the Lessee under this paragraph shall survive the
        expiration or termination of this Master Lease.

        Except as expressly set forth herein, the Lessee shall have no right,
power or authority to bind the Lessor in connection with any proposed sale of
any Property.

        If one or more of the foregoing provisions shall not be fulfilled as of
the date set forth above with respect to any Property, then the Lessor shall
declare by written notice to the Lessee the Remarketing Option to be null and
void (whether or not it has been theretofore exercised by the Lessee) as to all
of the Properties, in which event all of the Lessee's rights under this Section
20.1 shall immediately terminate and the Lessee shall be obligated to purchase
all of the Properties pursuant to Section 18.2 on the Expiration Date.

        20.2. Certain Obligations Continue. During the Marketing Period, the
obligation of the Lessee to pay Rent with respect to each Property (including
the installment of Rent due on the Expiration Date) shall continue undiminished
until payment in full of the Loan Balance and all other amounts due to the
Lessor with respect to the Properties under the Operative Documents to which the
Lessee is a party. The Lessor shall have the right, but shall be under no duty,
to solicit bids, to inquire into the efforts of the Lessee to obtain bids or
otherwise to take action in connection with any such sale, other than as
expressly provided in this Article XX.

                conformity with local custom and free and clear of the Lien of
                the Lessor Deed of Trust and any Lessor Liens;

                        (ii) such Property or Properties shall be conveyed to

        Lessor Liens and the lien of the Lessor Mortgage, in good condition (as
        modified by Modifications permitted by this Master Lease), ordinary wear

        23.1. Acceptance of Surrender. No surrender to the Lessor of this Master
Lease or of all or any of the Properties or of any part of any thereof or of any
interest therein shall be valid or effective unless agreed to and accepted in

obligations under the Loan Agreement and termination of the Commitments, the
Lenders, and no act by the Lessor or the Lenders or any representative or agent
of the Lessor or the Lenders, other than a written acceptance, shall constitute
an acceptance of any such surrender.


                                  ARTICLE XXIV
                               NO MERGER OF TITLE

        24.1. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of this Master Lease
or of the leasehold estate created hereby by reason of the fact that the same
Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part,

this Master Lease or such leasehold estate, (b) the fee or groundleasehold
estate in any Property, except as may expressly be stated in a written

                              INTENT OF THE PARTIES

        25.1. Ownership of the Properties. (a) The parties hereto intend that
(i) for financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, the Lessor
will be treated as the owner and the lessor of the Properties and the Lessee
will be treated as the lessee of the Properties and (ii) for all other purposes,
including federal and all state and local income tax purposes, state real estate
and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (A) this Lease will be treated as a
financing arrangement, (B) the Lessor and the Lenders will be deemed lenders
making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to the sum of the Lessor Amount
and the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and (C) the Lessee will be
treated as the owner of the Properties and will be entitled to all tax benefits
ordinarily available to an owner of properties like the Properties for such tax
purposes.

Nevertheless, the Lessee acknowledges and agrees that neither the Lessor nor any
of the Lenders has made any representations or warranties to the Lessee
concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative
Documents and that the Lessee has obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting
and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it deems appropriate.

        (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that this Lease grants a
security interest and mortgage, as the case may be, on the Properties to the
Lessor to secure Lessee's performance under and payment of all amounts under
this Lease and the other Operative Documents.


                                  ARTICLE XXVI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        26.1. Survival; Severability; Etc. Anything contained in this Master
Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, all claims against and liabilities of the
Lessee or the Lessor arising from events commencing prior to the expiration or
earlier termination of this Master Lease shall survive such expiration or
earlier termination for a period of one year except as to indemnification which
shall continue to survive; provided that any such right shall be exercised
within 54 years from the date hereof. If any term or provision of this Master
Lease or any application thereof shall be declared invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Master Lease and any other application of such term or
provision shall not be affected thereby. If any right or option of the Lessee
provided in this Master Lease, including any right or option described in
Article XIV, XV, XVIII or XX, would, in the absence of the limitation imposed by
this sentence, be invalid or unenforceable as being in violation of the rule
against perpetuities or any other rule of law relating to the vesting of an
interest in or the suspension of the power of alienation of property, then such
right or option shall be exercisable only during the period which shall end
twenty-one (21) years after the date of death of the last survivor of the
descendants of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the former President of the United States,
Henry Ford, the deceased automobile manufacturer, and John D. Rockefeller, the
founder of the Standard Oil Company, known to be alive on the date of the
execution, acknowledgment and delivery of this Master Lease.

        26.2. Amendments and Modifications. Subject to the requirements,
restrictions and conditions set forth in the Participation Agreement, neither
this Master Lease nor any provision hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or
terminated

except by an instrument in writing in recordable form signed by the Lessor and
the Lessee.

        26.3. No Waiver. No failure by the Lessor or the Lessee to insist upon
the strict performance of any term hereof or to exercise any right, power or
remedy upon a default hereunder, and no acceptance of full or partial payment of
Rent during the continuance of any such default, shall constitute a waiver of
any such default or of any such term. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no
waiver of any default shall affect or alter this Master Lease, and this Master
Lease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then
existing or subsequent default.

        26.4. Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and directed to the address
described in, and deemed received in accordance with the provisions of, Section
14.3 of the Participation Agreement.

Master Lease shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

        26.7. Counterparts. This Master Lease may be executed in any number of

        26.9. Limitations on Recourse. The parties hereto agree that except as
specifically set forth in this Lease or in any other Operative Document, Lessor
shall have no personal liability whatsoever to the Lessee or its respective
successors and assigns for any claim based on or in respect of this Master Lease
or any of the other Operative Documents or arising in any way from the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and the recourse shall be solely had
against the Lessor's interest in the Property; provided, however, that Lessor
shall be liable in its

negligence in the handling of funds), (b) breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants under the Operative Documents, or (c) for any Tax based

agreed that, except as provided in the preceding sentence: (i) Lessor shall have
no personal liability under any of the Operative Documents as a result of acting
pursuant to and consistent with any of the Operative Documents; (ii) all
obligations of Lessor to the Lessee are solely nonrecourse obligations except to
the extent that it has received payment from others; and (iii) all such personal
liability of Lessor is expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as
consideration for, the execution and delivery of the Operative Documents by
Lessor.

marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the signature
page thereof and containing the receipt thereof of The Sumitomo Bank, Limited,
San Francisco Branch, as Agent for the Lenders therefor on or following the
signature page thereof shall be the Original Executed Counterpart of this Master
Lease (the "Original Executed Counterpart"). To the extent that this Master

                          AMENDED AND RESTATED GUARANTY


        THIS GUARANTY (this "Guaranty") dated as of February 9, 1999 is made by
SYMANTEC CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), in favor of the
various financial institutions as are or may from time to time become Lenders
under the Loan Agreement (together with their respective successors and assigns,
the "Lenders") and THE SUMITOMO BANK, LIMITED, SAN FRANCISCO BRANCH as agent (in
such capacity, the "Agent") for the Lenders (the Lenders, the Agent and their
respective successors and assigns, collectively, the "Lender Parties").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:

        WHEREAS, pursuant to a Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof (together with all amendments and other modifications, if any,
from time to time thereafter made thereto, the "Loan Agreement"), among Sumitomo
Bank Leasing and Finance, Inc., (the "Lessor") the Lenders and the Agent, the
Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to extend
Loans to the Lessor;

        WHEREAS, as a condition to the occurrence of the Documentation Date
under the Amended and Restated Participation Agreement dated as of the date
hereof (together with all amendments and other modifications, if any, from time
to time thereafter made thereto, the "Participation Agreement"), among the
Guarantor, the Lessor, the Lenders and the Agent, the Guarantor is required to
execute and deliver this Guaranty in favor of the Lenders;

        WHEREAS, the Guarantor has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance of this Guaranty; and

        WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the Guarantor to execute this
Guaranty inasmuch as the Guarantor will derive substantial benefits from the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Agreement;

        NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration the receipt of which
is hereby acknowledged, and in order to induce the Lenders to enter into the
Loan Agreement, the Guarantor agrees, for the benefit of Lenders, as follows:

                                                                        Guaranty


                                    ARTICLE I

                                   DEFINITIONS

        SECTION 1.1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined in this Guaranty have the respective meanings specified in Appendix A
hereto; and the rules of interpretation set forth in Appendix A hereto shall
apply to this Guaranty.


                                   ARTICLE II

                               GUARANTY PROVISIONS

        SECTION 2.1. Guaranty of Lessor Obligations. The Guarantor acknowledges
that it is in Guarantor's best interests to execute this Guaranty as Guarantor
will derive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the loans provided by
the Lenders to the Lessor. Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees and promises to pay to Agent, or order, on demand in lawful money of
the United States of America, any obligations of the Lessor to make payments
under the Loan Agreement as a result of a Lease Event of Default ("Lessor
Obligations"). The Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the Lessor Obligations
have been increased pursuant to Master Amendment No. 1 and Master Amendment No.
2 and that the guaranty hereunder extends to such Lessor Obligations.


        SECTION 2.2. Independent Obligations. Guarantor's obligations hereunder
are independent of the obligations of Lessor, any other guarantor or any other
person, and Agent may enforce any of its rights hereunder independently of any
other right or remedy that Agent may at any time hold with respect to the Lessor
Obligations or any security or other guaranty therefor. This Guaranty is a
guaranty of payment when due and not of collection. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Agent may bring a separate action against Guarantor
without first proceeding against Lessor, any other guarantor, any other person
or any security held by Agent, and regardless of whether Lessor, any other
guarantor or any other person is joined in any such action. Guarantor's
liability hereunder shall at all times remain effective with respect to the full
amount of the Lessor Obligations, notwithstanding any limitations on the
liability of Lessor to Agent contained in the Loan Agreement or elsewhere.
Agent's rights hereunder shall not be exhausted by any action taken by Agent
until all Lessor Obligations have been fully paid and performed. The liability
of Guarantor hereunder shall be reinstated and revived, and the rights of Agent
shall

continue,  with  respect to any amount at any time paid on account of the Lessor
Obligations  which  shall  thereafter  be required to be restored or returned by
Agent upon the bankruptcy,  insolvency or  reorganization  of Lessor,  any other
guarantor or any other person,  or otherwise,  all as though such amount had not
been paid.

        SECTION 2.3. Authority to Modify Lessor Obligations. Guarantor
authorizes Agent, at any time and from time to time without notice and without
affecting the liability of Guarantor hereunder, to:

                (a) alter the terms of all or any part of the Lessor Obligations
        and any security and guaranties therefor including without limitation
        modification of times for payment and rates of interest;

                (b) accept new or additional instruments, documents, agreements,
        security or guaranties in connection with all or any part of the Lessor
        Obligations;

                (c) accept partial payments on the Lessor Obligations;

                (d) waive, release, reconvey, terminate, abandon, subordinate,
        exchange, substitute, transfer, compound, compromise, liquidate and
        enforce all or any part of the Lessor Obligations and any security or
        guaranties therefor, and apply any such security and direct the order or
        manner of sale thereof (and bid and purchase at any such sale), as Agent

                part of the Loan Agreement or the Lessor Obligations, or any
                security or other guaranty for the Lessor Obligations or the

                        (ii) any act or omission of Lessor or any other person

                of Lessor or any other person or any of the Lessor Obligations
                or any security therefor; or

                        (iii) any disability or any other defense of Lessor or
                any other person with respect to the Lessor Obligations, whether

                insolvency or debtor-relief proceeding, or from any other cause;

                (c) any right (whether now or hereafter existing) to require

        security now or hereafter held by Lessor with respect to the Lessor

                (f) all suretyship defenses and rights of every nature otherwise
        available under California law and the laws of any other jurisdiction,
        including without limitation all defenses arising under Sections 2787
        through 2855, inclusive, and Sections 2899 and 3433 of the California
        Civil Code and any successor provisions of those Sections; and

                (g) all other rights and defenses the assertion or exercise of
        which would in any way diminish the liability of Guarantor hereunder.

        SECTION 2.6. Deed of Trust on Real Property; Additional Waivers.

                (a) Guarantor authorizes Agent, at its sole option, without
        notice or demand and without affecting the liability of Guarantor
        hereunder, to release and reconvey (with or without the receipt of any
        consideration) any lien against any or all real or personal property
        security for the Loan Agreement, to foreclose any or all deeds of trust,
        mortgages, security agreements or other instruments or agreements by
        judicial or nonjudicial sale, and to exercise any other remedy against
        Lessor, any security or any other guarantor, all without affecting the
        liability of Guarantor hereunder.

                (b) Guarantor waives any defenses or benefits that may be
        derived from California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580b,
        580d or 726, or comparable provisions of the laws of the State of
        California or any other jurisdiction, and all other suretyship defenses
        it would otherwise have under California law or the laws of any other
        jurisdiction. Guarantor waives any right to receive notice of any
        judicial or nonjudicial sale or foreclosure of any real property, and
        the failure of Guarantor to receive such notice shall not impair or
        affect Guarantor's liability hereunder.

                (c) Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an
        election of remedies by Agent, even though that election of remedies,
        such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a
        guaranteed obligation, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of subrogation
        and reimbursement against Lessor or any other principal by operation of
        Section 580d of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.

                (d) Guarantor acknowledges that it has, in this Guaranty, waived
        any and all rights of subrogation and

                obligations by reason of an election of remedies by Agent; and

                        (ii) any rights or defenses Guarantor may have by reason
                of protection afforded to Lessor or any other principal with
                respect to the obligation so guaranteed pursuant to the
                antideficiency or other laws of the State of California limiting
                or discharging Lessor's indebtedness, including, without
                limitation, Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California
                Code of Civil Procedure.

        SECTION 2.7. Reasonableness and Effect of Waivers. Guarantor warrants

circumstances, the waivers are reasonable and not contrary to public policy or
law. If any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law

      SECTION II.4 Valuation; Deficiency or Surplus.

            (a) The Collateral Agent shall determine the fair market value of
      the Additional Collateral held as Collateral daily during the Term in
      accordance with its customary practices and procedures with respect to
      similar property. Each such valuation by the Collateral Agent shall be
      binding on the Participants, the Agent and the Lessee, absent manifest
      error. In the event that any such valuation shall indicate that such fair
      market value of the Collateral shall be less than 102.0% of the then
      outstanding Loan Balance, the Collateral Agent shall give written notice
      to each of the Agent, the Lessee and the Lessor of such deficiency.

            (b) In the event that any deficiency in the fair market value of the
      Additional Collateral shall occur as set forth in Section 6.1 of the
      Participation Agreement, Symantec shall take such actions required
      pursuant to such Section. In the event that any surplus in the fair market
      value of the Collateral shall occur as set forth in Section 6.1 of the
      Participation Agreement, the Agent shall direct in writing the Collateral
      Agent to take such actions contemplated by Section 6.2 of the
      Participation Agreement.

      SECTION  II.5  Continuing  Security  Interest.   This  Pledge  Agreement
shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall

            (a) remain in full force and effect  until  payment in full of the
      Loan Balance,

            (b) be binding upon the Pledgors and their successors, transferees
      and assigns, and

            (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Agent
      hereunder, to the benefit of each Lender.

Upon the payment in full of the Loan Balance, the security interest granted
herein shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the
Pledgors. Upon any such termination, the Collateral Agent will, at the sole
expense of Symantec, and upon written instruction of the Agent, deliver to the
respective Pledgors, without any representations, warranties or recourse of any
kind whatsoever, all certificates and instruments representing or evidencing all
Additional Collateral owned by the respective Pledgors, together with all other
Collateral held by the Collateral Agent hereunder and execute and deliver to the
Pledgors such documents as the Pledgors shall reasonably request to evidence
such termination.

      SECTION II.6  Security  Interest  Absolute.  All rights of the Agent and
the security interests granted to the Agent hereunder,  and all obligations of
the Pledgors hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of

            (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Pledge Agreement
      or any other Operative Document,

            (b) the failure of any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to
      enforce any right or remedy against the Lessee, the Lessor or any other
      Person under the provisions of any Operative Document or otherwise,

            (c) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
      other term of, all or any of obligations under the Operative Documents or
      any other extension, compromise or renewal of any such obligation,

            (d) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of any such
      obligations under the Operative Documents for any reason, including any
      claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall
      not be subject to (and the Pledgors hereby waive any right to or claim of)
      any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever
      by reason of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity,
      compromise, unenforceability of, or any other event or occurrence
      affecting, the Lessee, the Lessor or otherwise,

            (e) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other modification of,
      or any consent to or departure from, any of the terms of the any Operative
      Document,

            (f) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or non-perfection of
      any collateral (including the Collateral), or any amendment to or waiver
      or release of or addition to or consent to departure from any guaranty,
      for any of the obligations under the Operative Documents, or

            (g) any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a
      defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the Lessee,
      the Lessor or any other Person.

      SECTION II.7 Waiver of Subrogation. Each of the Pledgors hereby
irrevocably waives any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter
acquire against the Lessee, the Lessor or any other Person that arise from the
existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Pledgors' obligations
under this Pledge Agreement or any other Operative Document, including any right
of

                                                                Pledge Agreement

subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, or indemnification, any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Lenders against the Lessee, the Lessor
or any other Person or any collateral which the Agent now has or hereafter
acquires, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under
contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from the
Lessee, the Lessor or any other Person, directly or indirectly, in cash or other
property or by set-off or in any manner, payment or security on account of such
claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to either Pledgor in
violation of the preceding sentence and the Loan Balance shall not have been
paid in cash in full, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such
Pledgor for the benefit of, and held in trust for, the Lenders, and shall
forthwith be paid to the Lenders to be credited and applied to satisfy the Loan
Balance, whether then matured or unmatured. Each of the Pledgors acknowledges
that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing
arrangements contemplated by the Pledge Agreement and that the waiver set forth
in this Section is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      SECTION III.1 Warranties, etc. Each of the Pledgors represents and
warrants for itself unto the Agent and each Lender, at the date of each pledge
and delivery hereunder by such Pledgors to the Collateral Agent of any
Collateral pledged by the Pledgor pursuant to this Pledge Agreement as follows:

            (a) Ownership, No Liens, etc. It is the legal and beneficial owner
      of, and has good and valid title to (and has full right and authority to
      pledge and assign) the Collateral pledged of such pledgor, free and clear
      of all Liens, security interests, options, or other charges or
      encumbrances, except any Lien or security interest granted pursuant hereto
      in favor of the Agent.

            (b) Valid Security Interest. The delivery of the Collateral to the
      Collateral Agent is effective to create a valid, perfected, first priority
      security interest in such Collateral and all proceeds thereof, securing
      the Loan Balance. No filing or other action will be necessary to perfect
      or protect such security interest.

            (c) Authorization, Approval, etc. No authorization, approval, or
      other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental
      authority, regulatory body or any other

      Person is required either

                  (i) for the pledge by such Pledgor of any Collateral pursuant
            to this Pledge Agreement or for the execution, delivery, and
            performance of this Pledge Agreement by such Pledgor, or

                  (ii) for the exercise by the Agent of any of the rights
            provided for in this Pledge Agreement, or, except as may be required
            in connection with a disposition of Additional Collateral by laws
            affecting the offering and sale of securities generally, the
            remedies in respect of the Collateral pursuant to this Pledge
            Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    COVENANTS

      SECTION IV.1 Certain Covenants. Each Pledgor covenants and agrees that, so
long as any portion of the Loan Balance shall remain unpaid:

            (a) except as permitted by the Operative Documents, it will not
      sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or encumber in any other manner the
      Collateral owned by it (except in favor of the Agent hereunder);

            (b) Such Pledgor will warrant and defend the right and title herein
      granted unto the Agent in and to the Collateral (and all right, title, and
      interest represented by the Collateral) against the claims and demands of
      all Persons whomsoever;

            (c) at any time, and from time to time, at the expense of Symantec,
      such Pledgor will promptly execute and deliver all further instruments,
      and take all further action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that
      the Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any
      security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable
      the Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with
      respect to any Collateral.

                                                                Pledge Agreement

                                    ARTICLE V

                                    THE AGENT

      SECTION V.1 Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each of the Pledgors hereby
irrevocably appoints the Agent as such Pledgor's attorney-in-fact, with full
authority in the place and stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor
or otherwise, from time to time upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default, to take any action and to execute any instrument which
the Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this
Pledge Agreement, including without limitation:

            (a) to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise, receive
      and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under
      or in respect of any of the Collateral;

            (b) to receive, endorse, and collect any drafts or other
      instruments, documents and chattel paper, in connection with clause (a)
      above; and

            (c) to file any claims or take any action or institute any
      proceedings which the Agent may deem necessary or desirable for the
      collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of
      the Agent with respect to any of the Collateral.

Each of the Pledgors hereby acknowledges, consents and agrees that the power of
attorney granted pursuant to this Section is irrevocable and coupled with an
interest.

      SECTION V.2 Agent May Perform. If either Pledgor fails to perform any
agreement contained herein, the Agent may itself perform, or cause performance
of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Agent incurred in connection
therewith shall be payable by the Pledgors pursuant to Section 6.5.

      SECTION V.3 No Duty. (a) The powers conferred on the Agent and Collateral
Agent hereunder are solely to protect the interests of the Lenders in the
Collateral and shall not impose any duty on them to exercise any such powers.
Except (i) as set forth in Section 2.4, and (ii) for reasonable care of any
Collateral in its possession by the Collateral Agent and the accounting by the
Collateral Agent or the Agent for moneys actually received by it hereunder,
neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty as to any
Collateral or responsibility for

            (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls,

                                                                Pledge Agreement

      conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to
      any Pledged Property, whether or not the Agent or the Collateral Agent has
      or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or

            (ii) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior
      parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.

      (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Collateral Agent shall
have no duties, obligations or responsibilities except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement or as may be directed in writing by the Agent. The Collateral
Agent shall have no liability whatsoever for any action taken or omitted by it
or in connection herewith (including by direction, whether oral or written, of
the Agent) unless caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Collateral Agent shall have no fiduciary duty, obligation or responsibility in
respect of any party hereto or any indirect beneficiary of this Agreement or the
Collateral.

      SECTION V.4 Reasonable Care. The Collateral Agent is required to exercise
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the Collateral in its
possession; provided, however, the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the
Collateral, if it takes such action for that purpose as the Pledgor reasonably
requests in writing at times other than upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, but failure of the Collateral Agent to
comply with any such request at any time shall not in itself be used as a factor
in determining whether the Collateral Agent has exercised reasonable care.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    REMEDIES

      SECTION VI.1 Certain Remedies. If any Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing:

            (a) The Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition
      to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to
      it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the
      UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) and also
      may, without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any
      part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of
      the Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
      delivery, and upon such other terms as

                                                                Pledge Agreement

      the Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Pledgor agrees that, to
      the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days'
      prior notice to such Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or
      the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute
      reasonable notification. The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale
      of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Agent
      may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement
      at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further
      notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.

            (b)  The Agent may

                  (i) transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the name
            of the Agent or its nominee, with or without disclosing that such
            Collateral is subject to the lien and security interest hereunder,

                  (ii) notify the parties obligated on any of the Collateral to
            make payment to the Agent of any amount due or to become due
            thereunder,

                  (iii) enforce collection of any of the Collateral by suit or
            otherwise, and surrender, release or exchange all or any part
            thereof, or compromise or extend or renew for any period (whether or
            not longer than the original period) any obligations of any nature
            of any party with respect thereto,

                  (iv) endorse any checks, drafts, or other writings in either
            of the Pledgors' name to allow collection of the Collateral,

                  (v) take control of any proceeds of the Collateral, and

                  (vi) execute (in the name, place and stead of the Pledgors)
            endorsements, assignments, stock powers and other instruments of
            conveyance or transfer with respect to all or any of the Collateral.

      SECTION VI.2 Securities Laws. If the Agent shall exercise its right to
sell all or any of the Collateral on behalf of the Lenders pursuant to Section
6.1, each Pledgor agrees that, upon request of the Agent, such Pledgor will, at
its own expense do or cause to be done all such acts and things as may be
necessary to make such sale of the Collateral owned by the Pledgor or any part
thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law.

      SECTION VI.3 Compliance with Restrictions. Each Pledgor agrees that in any
sale of any of the Collateral owned by such Pledgor whenever an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Agent is hereby authorized to comply
with any limitation or restriction in connection with such sale as it may be
advised by counsel is necessary in order to avoid any violation of applicable
law (including compliance with such procedures as may restrict the number of
prospective bidders and purchasers, require that such prospective bidders and
purchasers have certain qualifications, and restrict such prospective bidders
and purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing
for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or
resale of such Collateral), or in order to obtain any required approval of the
sale or of the purchaser by any governmental regulatory authority or official,
and each Pledgor further agrees that such compliance shall not result in such
sale being considered or deemed not to have been made in a commercially
reasonable manner, nor shall the Agent be liable nor accountable to such Pledgor
for any discount allowed by the reason of the fact that such Collateral is sold
in compliance with any such limitation or restriction.

      SECTION VI.4 Application of Proceeds. All cash proceeds received by the
Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, all
or any part of the Collateral may, in the discretion of the Agent and the
Lessor, be held by the Agent as additional collateral security for, or then or
at any time thereafter be applied in whole or in part by the Agent against, all
or any part of the Loan Balance pro rata in such order as determined pursuant to
Section 7.6 of the Participation Agreement. Any surplus of such cash or cash
proceeds held by the Agent and remaining after payment in full of the Loan
Balance, shall be paid over to the respective Pledgors or to whomsoever may be
lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

      SECTION VI.5 Indemnity and Expenses. Each Pledgor hereby jointly and
severally indemnifies and holds harmless each of the Agent and the Collateral
Agent from and against any and all claims, losses, and liabilities arising out
of or resulting from this Pledge Agreement (including enforcement of this Pledge
Agreement), except the claims, losses, or liabilities of the Agent resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and except the claims,
losses or liabilities of the Collateral Agent, resulting from the Collateral
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as the case may be. Upon demand,
the Pledgors will pay to the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be,
the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of its counsel and of any experts and

agents, which the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may incur
in connection with:

            (a) the administration of this Pledge Agreement, including the
      valuations of Additional Collateral pursuant to Section 2.4;

            (b) the custody, preservation, use, or operation of, or the sale of,
      collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral,
      including pursuant to Section 7.3;

            (c) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Agent or
      Collateral Agent hereunder; or

            (d) the failure by the Pledgors to perform or observe any of the
      provisions hereof.

                                   ARTICLE VII

understood that no such request need be given after the occurrence and during

        Lessor hereby agrees that any action taken by the Lenders (or their

        relying on such action of the Lenders (or such designee) pursuant hereto

        including, without limitation, all rights to recover damages arising out
        of such breach or rejection, all rights to charges payable by the Lessee
        or such trustee or receiver in respect of any Property or any portions

        statute, law or regulation in respect of the Lessee and all rentals and
        other charges outstanding under the Lease as of the date of entry of

        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2, the
assignment contained herein shall in no event include any amounts received by
Agent or Lessor or otherwise paid or payable to Lessor with respect to Yield,

and the Agent will distribute the Rents to the Lenders and the Lessor in

        4. Irrevocability; Supplemental Instruments. The Lessor agrees that this
Assignment and the designation and direction to the Lessee set forth in Sections

                                                    Assignment of Lease and Rent

        5. Validity. The Lessor represents and warrants (on a continuing basis)
and covenants to the Lenders that (a) the Lessor has not assigned or executed
any assignment of, and will not assign or execute any assignment of, the
Lessor's interest in any of the Assigned Leases, in any Contract, in any Rents
or in any other subject matter of this Assignment to anyone other than the
Lenders and any assignment, designation or direction by the Lessor inconsistent
herewith shall be void, and (b) the Lessor has not done any act or executed any
document that impairs the rights of the Lenders to the Leases or the Rents under
this Assignment.

        6. The Lessor Remains Liable. While the assignment made hereby is
present, direct and continuing, it has been made for the purpose of providing
the Lenders with security for the performance of the Lessor's obligations under
the Loan Agreement and the Notes and the execution and delivery hereof shall not
impair or diminish in any way the obligations of the Lessor under the Assigned
Leases, or impose any of such obligations on the Lenders. This Assignment shall
not operate to cause the Lenders (or their designee) to be regarded as a
mortgagee in possession. Neither the Lenders nor their designee shall be
responsible or liable for performing any of the obligations of the Lessor under
any of the Assigned Leases or any Contract, for any waste by the Lessee or
others, for any dangerous or defective conditions of any Property, for
negligence in the management, upkeep, repair or control of any Property or any
other act or omission by any other Person. Nothing contained herein shall
operate or be construed to (a) obligate the Lenders (or their designee) to
assume the obligations of the Lessor under any of the Assigned Leases or any
Contract, to perform any of the terms and conditions contained in any of the
Assigned Leases or any Contract or otherwise to impose any obligation upon the
Lenders with respect to any of the Assigned Leases or any Contract or (b) place
upon the Lenders (or their designee) any responsibility for the operation,
control, care, management or repair of any Property or any part thereof. Subject
at all times to the terms and conditions of this Assignment, the Lessor will at
all times promptly and faithfully perform in all respects, or cause to be
performed in all respects, all of its covenants, conditions and agreements
contained in the Assigned Leases or any Contract now or hereafter existing on
the part of the Lessor to be kept and performed.

        7. Amendments; Lessee's Consent. The Lessor will not enter into any
agreement subordinating, amending, extending or terminating any of the Assigned
Leases except as provided in Section 14.5 of the Participation Agreement, and
any such attempted subordination, amendment, modification, extension or
termination without compliance with such Section 14.5 shall be

<PAGE>   7
                                                    Assignment of Lease and Rent

void. If any of the Assigned Leases or any Contract shall be amended, it shall
continue to be subject to the provisions hereof without the necessity of any
further act by any of the parties hereto. The Lessor and the Lenders hereby
consent to the provisions of Lessee's Consent attached to this Assignment and
agree to be bound thereby.

        8. Termination of this Assignment. This Assignment shall continue in
full force and effect until all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of any
kind now or hereafter due to the Lenders from the Lessor or the Lessee under or
with respect to the Loan Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents, or
which are otherwise secured hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising or
incurred, have been fully paid, performed and satisfied, at which time this
Assignment will terminate.

        9. Ongoing Right to Collect Rents; Receivers. If notwithstanding the
terms of this Assignment, a petition or order for sequestration of rents, or the
appointment of a receiver or some similar judicial action or order is deemed
required under applicable state law to allow the Lenders to continue to collect
the moneys described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) and (c) of this Assignment, then it
is agreed by the Lessor that any proof of claim or similar document filed by the
Lenders in connection with the breach or rejection of any Lease by the lessee
thereunder or the trustee of any lessee under any federal or state insolvency
statute shall for the purpose of perfecting the Lenders' rights conferred in
said paragraphs be deemed to constitute action required under such state law.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Loan Agreement Event of
Default (not existing solely by virtue of a Lease Event of Default), the Lessor
hereby consents to the appointment of a receiver for any or all of the
Properties as a matter of right and without any requirement for notice to the
Lessor and without regard to the solvency of the Lessor or to the collateral
that may be available for the satisfaction of the Notes and all other
obligations under the Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents.

        10. Amendment. This Assignment may not be amended or otherwise modified
except by a writing signed by the Lessor, the Agent and, if required by Section
14.5 of the Participation Agreement, the Lessee, in accordance with the terms of
the Participation Agreement.

        11. Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals and
other instruments under this Assignment shall be made in accordance with the
notice provisions of the Participation Agreement.

        12. Successors and Assigns. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties in this Assignment by the Lessor and the Lenders shall bind, and
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, their respective successors
and assigns, whether or not so expressed.

        13. Severability. If any provision or provisions, or if any portion of
any provision or provisions, in this Assignment is found by a court of law of
competent jurisdiction to be in violation of any local, state or Federal
ordinance, statute, law, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy,
and if such court should declare such portion, provision or provisions to be
illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the
intent of the parties hereto that such portion, provision or provisions shall be
given force to the fullest possible extent that they are legal, valid and
enforceable, that the remainder of this Assignment shall be construed as if such
illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable portion, provision or
provisions were not contained therein, and that the rights, obligations and
interests of the Lessor, the Lenders and the Lessee under the remainder of this
Assignment shall continue in full force and effect.

        14. Governing Law. THIS ASSIGNMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
LESSOR UNDER THIS ASSIGNMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WITHOUT REGARD TO
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

        15. Counterparts. This Assignment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

        16. Conflicts. In the event of any conflicts between the terms and
provisions hereof and the terms and provisions of the other Operative Documents,
the terms and provisions of the other Operative Documents shall be controlling.

        17. Non-Disturbance. So long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Lenders will take no action to disturb the Lessee's
rights to quiet enjoyment of each Property as set forth in Section 4.1 of the
Master Lease.

Appendix A to this Loan Agreement; and the rules of interpretation set forth in
Appendix A to this Loan Agreement shall apply to this Loan Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE II

                    AMOUNT AND TERMS OF LENDERS' COMMITMENTS

        SECTION 2.1. Loan Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and of the Participation Agreement, each Lender severally agrees to make
loans (the "Loans") to the Lessor on each Acquisition Date for the purpose of
enabling the Lessor to acquire the Properties and to pay Property Acquisition
Costs and Property Improvement Costs, in an aggregate principal amount at any
one time outstanding not to exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment. No
amounts paid or prepaid with respect to any Loans may be reborrowed.

        SECTION 2.2. Notes. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by
a promissory note of the Lessor, substantially in the form of Exhibit A (each, a
"Note"), with appropriate insertions as to payee, date and principal amount,
payable to the order of such Lender and in a principal amount equal to the
initial Commitment of such Lender. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record
the date and amount of each Loan made by such Lender, each continuation thereof,
the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal thereof and the
length of each Interest Period with respect thereto, on the schedule annexed to
and constituting a part of its Note, and any such recordation shall constitute
prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded, provided
that the failure to make any such recordation or any error in such recordation
shall not affect the Lessor's obligations hereunder or under such Note. Each
Note shall (i) be dated the date of the initial Acquisition Date, (ii) be stated
to mature on the Maturity Date and (iii) provide for the payment of interest in
accordance with this Loan Agreement.

        SECTION 2.3. Prepayments.

                (a) Voluntary. The Lessor may in connection with a Casualty,
        Condemnation or purchase by the Lessee of a Property at any time and
        from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium
        or penalty (subject to Section 13.10 of the Participation Agreement),
        upon at least three (3) Business Days' written notice to the Agent,
        specifying the date and amount of prepayment and the Land Acquisition
        Costs and/or Property Improvement Costs to which such Loans are
        allocable. Upon receipt of any such notice

<PAGE>   4

                                                                  Loan Agreement


        the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice
        is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable
        on the date specified therein, together with any amounts payable
        pursuant to Article XIII (including without limitation Section 13.6) of
        the Participation Agreement.

                (b) Mandatory. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all amounts
        payable by the Lessee pursuant to Article XV, XVIII or XX of the Master
        Lease shall be used to prepay the Loans and shall be applied to the
        Loans and the Lessor Amounts in the manner set forth in Article VII of
        the Participation.

        SECTION 2.4. Interest Rates and Payment Dates.

                (a) Each Loan shall bear interest for each day during each
        Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the
        LIBO Rate (Reserve Adjusted) determined for such day plus the Loan
        Margin or, at the option of the Lessee, the Alternate Base Rate plus the
        Loan Margin.

                (b) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan,
        (ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any other amount payable
        hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
        acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a
        rate per annum which is equal to the Overdue Rate. Interest accruing
        pursuant to this clause (b) shall be payable from time to time on
        demand.

                (c) During the Base Lease Term, Interest shall accrue on
        outstanding Loans and shall be paid on the Scheduled Payment Date.

                (d) Each prepayment of the Loans shall be accompanied by accrued
        interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid.

        SECTION 2.5. Repayment of Loans.

                (a) During the Base Lease Term the Lessor shall repay the Loans
        with respect to each Property on the dates and in the amount set forth
        in the Master Rent Schedule under the Lease.

                (b) The Loans shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date.

        SECTION 2.6. Computation of Interest.

                (a) If interest on the Loans shall be based on the LIBO Rate
        (Reserve Adjusted), then it shall be calculated on the basis of a
        360-day year and, if based on the Alternate Base Rate, then on a 360-day
        year basis if the Alternate Base Rate is calculated at the Federal Funds
        Rate, and a 365- or, if applicable, 366-, day year basis if the
        Alternate Base Rate is calculated at the Prime Rate, in each case for
        the actual days elapsed. The Agent shall as soon as practicable notify
        the Lessor and the Lenders of each determination of a LIBO Rate. Any
        change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the
        Alternate Base Rate or the LIBOR Reserve Percentage shall become
        effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change
        becomes effective. The Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the
        Lessor and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such
        change in interest rate.

                (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent pursuant

        SECTION 5.2. Remedies.

                (a) Upon the occurrence of any Loan Agreement Event of Default,
        (i) if such event is a Loan Agreement Event of Default specified in
        clause (e) above or a Lease Event of Default specified in Section
        16.1(h) or (i) of the Master Lease, the Commitments of all Lenders shall
        automatically and immediately terminate and the Loans hereunder (with
        accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Loan
        Agreement and the Notes shall immediately become due and payable, and
        (ii) if such event is any other Loan Agreement Event of Default, any or
        all of the following actions may be taken: (x) Lenders holding a
        majority in principal amount of the outstanding Loans ("Required
        Lenders") may, by notice to the Lessor, declare the Loan Commitments to
        be terminated forthwith, whereupon the Loan Commitments shall
        immediately terminate and (y) with the consent of Lenders holding a
        majority of the outstanding Loans, the Agent may, or upon the request of
        Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Loans, the Agent shall, by
        notice to the Lessor, declare all Loans hereunder (with accrued interest
        thereon) and all other amounts owing with respect to the Loans under
        this Loan Agreement and the Notes to be due and payable forthwith,
        whereupon all Loans shall immediately become due and payable (any of the
        foregoing occurrences or actions referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
        above, an "Acceleration"). Except as expressly provided above in this
        Article V, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any

        and at any time thereafter so long as any Loan Agreement Event of
        Default shall be continuing, the Agent shall, upon the written
        instructions of Lenders holding a majority in principal amount of the
        outstanding Loans, exercise any or all of the rights and powers and
        pursue any and all of the remedies available to it hereunder and

        Loan Documents and shall have any and all rights and remedies available
        under the Uniform Commercial Code or any provision of law.

                (c) Upon the occurrence of any Loan Agreement Event of Default
        and at any time thereafter so long as any Loan Agreement Event of
        Default shall be continuing, the Agent shall, upon the written
        instructions of Lenders holding a majority in principal amount of the
        outstanding Loans, proceed to protect and enforce this Loan Agreement,
        the Notes, the Lease and the other Operative Documents by suit or suits
        or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether for the
        specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or in
        execution or aid of any power herein granted, or for foreclosure
        hereunder, or for the appointment of a receiver or receivers for the
        Properties or any Property or for the recovery of judgment for the
        indebtedness secured thereby or for the enforcement of any other proper,
        legal or equitable remedy available under Applicable Law.

        and all accrued and unpaid amounts due hereunder before, after or during
        the exercise of any of the foregoing remedies, including all reasonable
        legal fees and other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent
        or any Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Loan Agreement Event of
        Default or the exercise of remedies with respect thereto.

                (e) With respect to the occurrence and continuance of any Lease
        Default under Section 16.1(a), (b) or (c) of the Master Lease, the
        Lessor agrees that the Agent or any Participant may give notice of such
        Lease Default on behalf of the Lessor to the Lessee. With respect to any
        other Lease Default, the Lessor agrees that the Agent may give notice of
        such Lease Default on behalf of the Lessor to the Lessee. When a Lease
        Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent, at the
        direction of Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Loans, may
        exercise any or all of the remedies of the Lessor under Article XVI of
        the Master Lease, and the Lessor shall exercise such remedies at the
        direction of the Agent. The Lessor shall demand the purchase of
        properties by the Lessee pursuant to Section 16.2(e) of the Master Lease
        at the direction of Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Loans.
        In addition, the Lenders may request that the Agent, and upon direction

        Lease, or if all of the Properties shall be sold in accordance with and
        the Lessee otherwise satisfies each of the obligations and conditions
        set forth at Article XX of the Master Lease, then, upon application of
        such amounts to prepay the Loans pursuant to Article IV and the Agent's
        and the Lenders' receipt of all accrued interest and any other payments
        due and owing from Lessee and/or the Lessor to the Agent and the Lenders

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    THE AGENT

        SECTION 7.1. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints the Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Loan Agreement and the
other Operative Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the
Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
of this Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the
terms of this Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Loan Agreement, the Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or
any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or any other party to the Operative
Documents, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Loan Agreement or any other
Operative Document or otherwise exist against the Agent.

        SECTION 7.2. Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents by or through
agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.

        SECTION 7.3. Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be
(a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such
Person under or in connection with this Loan Agreement or any other Operative
Document (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct or breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
under the Operative Documents) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the
Lenders or any other party to the Operative Documents for any recitals,
statements,

representations or warranties made by the Lessor or the Lessee or any officer
thereof contained in this Loan Agreement or any other Operative Document or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Loan Agreement or
any other Operative Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Loan Agreement or any other
Operative Document or for any failure of the Lessor or the Lessee to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agent shall not be under any obligation
to any Lender or any other party to the Operative Documents to ascertain or to
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained
in, or conditions of, this Loan Agreement or any other Operative Document, or to
inspect the properties, books or records of the Lessor or the Lessee.

        SECTION 7.4. Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Lessor or the Lessee), independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Loan Agreement or any other Operative Document unless it shall
first receive the advice or concurrence of Lenders holding a majority of the
outstanding Loans or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents in accordance with a request of
Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Loans, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

        SECTION 7.5. Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Loan Agreement Default or Loan
Agreement Event of Default hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a
Lender or the Lessor referring to this Loan Agreement, describing such Loan
Agreement Default or Loan Agreement Event of Default and stating that such

notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Lessee. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Loan Agreement
Default or Loan Agreement Event of Default as shall be directed by Lenders
holding a majority of the outstanding Loans; provided, however, that unless and
until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Loan Agreement Default or Loan Agreement Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

        SECTION 7.6. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the Lessor or the Lessee, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Lessor and the Lessee and made its own
decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Loan Agreement. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Loan
Agreement and the other Operative Documents, and to make such investigation as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Lessor and the Lessee.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Lessor or the Lessee which
may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

        SECTION 7.7. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent
in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Lessee and without
limiting the obligation of the Lessee to do so), ratably according to the
percentage each



                                      -12-

                                                                  Loan Agreement


Lender's Commitment bears to the total Commitments of all of the Lenders on the
date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 7.7 (or, if
indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Lenders' Commitments
shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in
accordance with the percentage that each Lender's Commitment bears to the
Commitments of all of the Lenders immediately prior to such date), from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
whatsoever (including without limitation all reasonable fees and disbursements
of any law firm or other external counsel of the Agent, the allocated cost of
internal legal services and all disbursements of internal counsel of the Agent)
which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the
payment of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent
in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Loan Agreement,
any of the other Operative Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of
the foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment
of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this
Section 7.7 shall survive the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

        SECTION 7.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the
Lessor, the Lessee and their Affiliates as though The Sumitomo Bank, Limited,
San Francisco Branch, were not the Agent hereunder and under the other Operative
Documents and without notice to or consent of the Banks. Each Lender
acknowledges that, pursuant to such activities, The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, San

Lessee, the Lessor or their Affiliates (including information that may be
subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Lessee, the Lessor or
their Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to

Sumitomo Bank, Limited, San Francisco Branch, becomes a Lender, the terms
"Lender" and "Lenders" shall include The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, San Francisco
Branch, in its individual capacity.

        SECTION 7.9. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 20
days' notice to the Lenders. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this Loan
Agreement and the other Operative Documents, then Lenders holding a majority of
the outstanding Loans shall appoint a successor agent for Lenders, which
successor agent shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the
United States of America or any State thereof or under the laws of another
country which is doing business in the United States of America and having a
combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $100,000,000 (and if
no Lease Default or Lease Event of Default exists, shall be approved by the
Lessee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)), whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and
the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment
and approval, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Agent or any of the parties to this Loan Agreement or any holders of the Notes.
If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 20
days following a resigning Agent's notice of resignation, the resigning Agent's
resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall
perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as
Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Loans appoint a successor Agent as
provided above. After any retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, all of the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Loan Agreement
and the other Operative Documents.

        SECTION 8.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Lender, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall

or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or

referred to in Section 5.1(e), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any

purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such
portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be
necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or
benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits
is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.

        Improvements is in excess of the Construction Commitment Amount.

        2.7. Insurance.

        (a) Public Liability and Workers' Compensation Insurance. During the
Interim Term with respect to the Property, the Construction Agent shall procure
and carry insurance for the risks insured arising from the acts or omissions of
the Construction Agent while located on, in possession of, or controlling or
acting or failing to act with respect to Land and Improvements subject to Lease
Supplement No. 4. In addition, during the Interim Term with respect to Land and
Improvements subject to Lease Supplement No. 4, the Construction Agent shall, in
the construction of Improvements on Land and Improvements subject to Lease
Supplement No. 4 and the operation of Land and Improvements subject to Lease
Supplement No. 4, comply with all applicable workers' compensation laws. The
Construction Agent acknowledges and agrees in this connection that the Property
is in its control and possession during the Interim Term therefor, it is
responsible as Construction Agent for the acts and omissions of its
subcontractors and agents and that it has agreed to maintain Land and
Improvements subject to Lease Supplement No. 4 free from injury and mishap to
third Persons.

        (b) Hazard and Other Insurance. During the Interim Term with respect to
the Property, the Construction Agent shall also maintain and keep in force a
policy or policies of builder's "all risk" insurance with respect to such
Property, insuring the Lessor's interest in Land and Improvements subject to
Lease Supplement No. 4, including collapse coverage and fire insurance



                                      -6-
<PAGE>   8

with extended coverage, written on a Standard Builder's Risk Completed Value
Form (100% non-reporting), in an amount equal to 100% of the replacement cost
thereof. The premium for such coverage shall be a cost paid with the proceeds of
a Construction Advance. In addition, the reduction in any recovery pursuant to
any deductible applicable to such policy shall be a construction cost paid with
the proceeds of an Advance; provided, however, that the Construction Agent shall
pay to the Lessor an amount equal to the deductible if the conditions precedent
for an Advance cannot be met at the time such deductible amount shall be payable
and, provided, further, that, unless each Participant otherwise agrees, each
insurance policy required pursuant to this clause (b) shall have no deductible.
Amounts otherwise payable by the Lessee to the Lessor with respect to the
Property under the Operative Documents during the Interim Term in respect of an
event covered by such policy shall be reduced by any recovery by the Lessor
under such policy and for the deductible (if any) paid by the Construction
Agent, in each case to the extent relating to the Land and Improvements subject
to Lease Supplement No. 4.

        (c) Deductibles. The insurance required to be obtained by the
Construction Agent under Section 2.7(a) may be subject to deductible amounts and
self-insured retentions as is consistent with the Construction Agent's or its
Affiliates practice for other properties similar to the Land and Improvements
subject to Lease Supplement No. 4 owned or leased by the Construction Agent or
the Affiliates of the Construction Agent, and may be carried under blanket
policies maintained by or on behalf of the Construction Agent so long as such
policies otherwise comply with the provisions of this Section 2.7. The insurance
required to be obtained by the Lessee pursuant to Section 2.7(b) may contain a
deductible amount, but not in excess of $1,000.00, unless each Participant
otherwise agrees and the cost of obtaining all such insurance shall be advanced
to the Construction Agent and constitute part of Property Balance.

        (d) Coverage. All insurance required to be carried by the Construction
Agent pursuant to the requirements of Section 2.7(a) or 2.7(b) shall provide in
the policy or by special endorsement that:

                (i) in the case of insurance required by Section 2.7(a), the
        Lessor and each Lender, are included as additional insureds;

                (ii) the insurer thereunder waives all rights of subrogation
        against the Lessor, and each Lender and waives any right of set-off and
        counterclaim and any other right to deduction whether by attachment or
        otherwise;

                (iii) such insurance shall be primary without right of
        contribution of any other insurance carried by or on behalf



                                      -7-
<PAGE>   9

        of the Lessor or any Lender, and shall provide that no such Person shall
        have any obligation or liability for payment of premiums;

                (iv) the respective interests of the Lessor or any Lender, under
        all insurance policies required hereunder shall not be invalidated by
        any action or inaction of the Lessee or the Construction Agent or any
        other Person (other than, with respect to any such insured, such
        insured) and such insurance shall insure the Lessor or any Lender as
        their interests may appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any
        warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies by the
        Lessee, the Construction Agent or any other Person (other than, with
        respect to any such insured, such insured);

                (v) if the insurers cancel such insurance for any reason
        whatsoever or any materially adverse change is made in policy terms or
        conditions, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of
        premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to
        the Lessor and the Lenders for thirty (30) days after receipt by the
        Lessor and the Lenders, respectively, of written notice from such
        insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse; and

                (vi) with respect to all liability insurance, in as much as the
        policies are written to cover more than one insured, all terms,
        conditions, insuring agreements and endorsements, with the exception of
        the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if there
        were a separate policy covering each insured.

        (e) Adjustment of Losses. Losses, if any, with respect to the Property
under any property damage policies required to be carried under Section 2.7(b)
shall be adjusted with the insurance companies, including the filing of
appropriate proceedings, as follows: (x) so long as no Lease Event of Default or
Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, and provided that the Lessee is required by the Operative Documents,
or has agreed, to repair the damage to the Property, such losses shall be
adjusted by the Lessee, and (y) if any Lease Event of Default or Construction
Agency Agreement Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or if
the Lessee is not required to, and has not agreed, to repair the damage to the
Property, such losses shall be adjusted by the Lessor. The party which shall be
entitled to adjust losses may appear in any proceeding or action to negotiate,
prosecute, adjust or appeal any claim for any award, compensation or insurance
payment on account of any Casualty and shall pay all expenses thereof. At such
party's reasonable request, and at the Construction Agent's sole cost and
expense, the Lessee, the



                                      -8-
<PAGE>   10

Lessor and each Lender, as the case may be, shall participate in any such
proceeding, action, negotiation, prosecution or adjustment. The parties hereto
agree that this Construction Agency Agreement shall control the rights of the
parties hereto in and to any such award, compensation or insurance payment
relating to any Casualty affecting the Property during the Interim Term.

        (f) Application of Insurance Proceeds. All proceeds of insurance
maintained pursuant to Section 2.7(b) on account of any damage to or destruction
of any Property or any part thereof shall be paid over to the Lessor or as it
may direct; provided that if no Lease Event of Default or Construction Agency
Event of Default shall have occurred such funds shall be held by the Lessor in a
segregated account and, so long as the Construction Agent is diligently
repairing the damage to the applicable Property caused by the applicable
Casualty, disbursed to the Construction Agent to effect the repair of the
applicable Property.

        (g) Additional Insurance. Any additional insurance obtained by the
Construction Agent, the Lessor or any Lender shall provide that it shall not
interfere with or in any way limit insurance required to be maintained under
Sections 2.7(a) and 2.7(b) or increase the amount of any premium payable with
respect to any such required insurance. The proceeds of any such additional
insurance will be for the account of the party maintaining such additional
insurance.

        (h) Annual Insurance Report. Prior to the commencement of Construction
and each January 1 thereafter, the Construction Agent shall provide the Lessor
and the Lender an insurance certificate certifying compliance with the insurance
then required to be maintained by the Construction Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.7.

without the consent of the Lessor; provided, however, that the prior written
consent of the Lessor will be required if such revision, amendment or
modification, when taken together with any previous or contemporaneous revision,
amendment or modification to such Plans and Specifications, could reasonably be
expected to: (w) cause the Completion Date for such Property to occur after the
Outside Completion Date for such Property, (x) result in the Improvement Costs
for such Property exceeding the estimated improvement costs, (y) reduce the Fair
Market Sales Value of such Property when completed from the Fair Market Sales
Value of such Property as set forth in the Appraisal of such Property delivered
in connection with the Acquisition Date therefor or (z) cause the Improvements
to vary in any material respect from the assumptions with respect to use,
operation and construction set forth in the Appraisal of such Property delivered
in connection with the Acquisition Date therefor.

        3.3. Casualty, Condemnation and Force Majeure Events. If at any time
prior to the Completion Date for the Property there occurs a Casualty,
Condemnation or a Force Majeure Event with respect to the Property, then, except
as otherwise provided in Article XIV or XVI of the Lease, in each case the
Construction Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the
Construction of the Improvements on such Property in accordance with the Plans
and Specifications therefor and in compliance with the terms hereof, and cause
the Completion Date for such Property to occur on or prior to the Outside
Completion Date for such Property. If the Outside Completion Date is extended by
six or more months as a result of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the
Lessor may terminate the Construction Agent hereunder and engage one or more new
construction agents to complete the Property.

        3.4. Condemnation Proceedings. The Construction Agent hereby agrees that
it shall, within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Construction
Agent shall have notice thereof, give notice to the Lessor and the Lenders of
each action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority with respect to any
actual, pending or threatened Condemnation affecting the Property during the
Interim Term. During the Interim Term, the Lessor and the Lenders shall be
entitled, to the exclusion of the Construction Agent, to negotiate, prosecute,
adjust or appeal any claim for any award, compensation or insurance payment on
account of any Condemnation affecting such Property. The Participants shall
consult with the Lessee in connection with the foregoing, but the Construction
Agent shall have no right to participate in any such negotiation, prosecution,
adjustment or appeal unless the Lessor and the Lenders consent thereto in their
sole discretion.

        3.5. Condemnation Awards. During the Interim Term with respect to the
Property, all awards, compensation and insurance



                                      -10-

payments on account of any Condemnation affecting such Property shall be paid
directly to the Lessor or, if received by the Construction Agent, shall be held
in trust for the Participants and shall promptly be paid over by the Lessee to
Lessor. All amounts held by the Lessor on account of any award, compensation or
insurance payment described in this Section 3.5 shall be distributed by the
Lessor as follows: (i) if the Property can be restored to its pre-Condemnation
or pre-Casualty condition prior to the Expiration Date by application of such
proceeds to the restoration of the Property, such proceeds will be released to
the Construction Agent so long as it offers its obligation to complete
Construction otherwise such proceeds shall be distributed to the Participants as
provided in Section 7.9(b) of the Participation Agreement.

        4.1. Funding of Property Improvements Costs. (a) In connection with and
during the course of the construction of the Subject Improvements, the
Construction Agent may request that the Lessor advance funds for the payment of
Property Improvements Costs, and the Lessor will comply with such request to the

limitations contained in, the Lease. The Construction Agent and the Lessor
acknowledge and agree that the Lessee's right to request funds and the Lessor's
obligation to advance funds for the payment of Property Improvements Costs is
subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Lease and each of the
other Operative Documents.

        (b) The proceeds of any funds made available to the Lessor to pay
Property Improvements Costs shall be made available to the Construction Agent or
its designee(s) in accordance with the Funding Request relating thereto and the
terms of the Lease. The Construction Agent will use such proceeds only to pay
the Property Improvements Costs set forth in the Funding Request relating to
such funds.

        (c) In no event shall the Lessor be required to advance funds for the
payment of Property Improvement Costs in excess of the Construction Commitment
Amount.

        (d) The Construction Agent shall, upon the passing of possession and
control to the Construction Agent, at all times cause to be and remain vested in
the Lessor's ownership of any and all construction materials and equipment not
yet incorporated into the Property for which funds shall have been requested
pursuant to this Article IV, and cause such title to be and remain free of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens.

        clause (a) or (b) above) to be performed or observed by it under this
        Agreement and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30)
        days after the earlier of (i) the date on which the Construction Agent
        shall have knowledge of such failure and (ii) receipt by the
        Construction Agent of a written notice from the Lessor with respect
        thereto; or

        5.2. Survival. The termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1
shall in no event relieve the Construction Agent of its liability and
obligations hereunder which accrued prior to such termination, all of which
shall survive any such termination.

        5.3. Remedies.

                (a) Termination of Commitments; Acceleration of Lease Balance,
        etc. Upon the occurrence and continuance of any Construction Agency

        Commitments shall automatically terminate and the Construction Agent
        shall, subject to Section 5.4, immediately become obligated to pay the
        then outstanding amount of the Lease Balance together with all accrued
        and unpaid Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent, without presentment,
        demand, protest, notice of acceleration or other notice of any kind, all
        of which are hereby expressly waived, anything in this Agreement or any
        other Operative Document to the contrary notwithstanding. After the
        occurrence and continuance of any other Construction Agency Agreement
        Event of Default, the Lessor may by written notice to the Lessee or the
        Construction Agent, immediately (x) terminate all Commitments, (y)
        terminate this Agreement (and upon the giving of such notice, this
        Agreement shall terminate and all rights of the Construction Agent and
        all obligations of the Lessor under this Agreement (as the case may be)
        shall cease) and/or (z) subject to the limitations imposed under Section
        5.4, accelerate the Lease Balance and all other amounts due and owing by
        the Lessee under the Operative Documents and, upon any such notice of
        acceleration, the Lessee shall



                                      -13-
<PAGE>   15

        immediately become obligated to pay the then outstanding amount of the
        Lease Balance together with all accrued and unpaid Basic Rent and
        Supplemental Rent.

        (b) Remedies.

                (i) If (x) a Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default
        shall have occurred and be continuing under Section 5.1(a) or 5.1(c),
        (y) as a result of the Construction Agent's fraudulent or illegal acts
        or omissions or willful misconduct, any other Construction Agency
        Agreement Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or (z)
        any Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default not described in
        clause (x) or (y) shall have occurred and be continuing and the
        Construction Agent shall have failed to relinquish all of its interest
        the Property and convey possession thereof to the Lessor or its designee
        in then, in each case, the Lessor shall have all rights and remedies
        available under the Operative Documents (including under Article XVI of
        the Lease) or available at law, equity or otherwise.

                (ii) If a Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default shall
        have occurred and be continuing under Section 5.1(b), (d) or (e), other
        than as a result of Construction Agent's fraudulent or illegal acts or
        omissions or willful misconduct, the Lessor shall have the right to
        require the Construction Agent to relinquish all of its right, title and
        interest in, to and under the applicable Property to the Lessor and to
        pay to the Lessor the Construction Period Guarantee Amount for the
        Property. Under such circumstances, the Lessee shall, in accordance with
        the procedures set forth in Section 21.1 of the Lease, convey to the
        Lessor all of the Lessee's right, title and interest in, to and under
        the Property free and clear of all Liens (other than Lessor Liens and
        Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (a) of the definition
        thereof) and in compliance with all Hazardous Materials Laws, and
        deliver to the Lessor an affidavit of the Lessee to such effect and
        appropriate statements of termination.

                (c) Remedies Cumulative. No failure to exercise and no delay in
        exercising, on the part of the Lessor, any right, remedy, power or
        privilege under this Agreement or under the other Operative Documents
        shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
        exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement
        preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
        other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers
        and privileges provided in this Agreement and in the other Operative
        Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies,
        powers and privileges provided by law.

                (d) Payment of Costs and Expenses. The Construction Agent shall
        pay upon demand all reasonable costs, expenses, losses, expenditures and
        damages (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred by or
        on behalf of any Participant or the Collateral Agent in connection with
        any Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default.

        5.4. Limitation on Construction Agent's Recourse Liability.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in any other Operative Document to
the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Construction
Agency Agreement Event of Default with respect to the Property described in
clause (b), clause (d) or clause (e) of Section 5.1 (other than as a result of
the Construction Agent's fraudulent or illegal acts or omissions or willful
misconduct), so long as the Construction Agent and Lessee relinquishes all of
its interest in the applicable Property and conveys possession thereof to the
Lessor or its designee free and clear of all Liens (other than Lessor Liens and
Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (a) of the definition thereof in
Appendix A) and in compliance with all Hazardous Materials Laws, accompanied by
an affidavit to each Participant to such effect and appropriate statements of
termination, the aggregate maximum recourse liability of the Construction Agent
with respect to such Property to the Lessor or any Person claiming by, through
or under the Lessor under the Operative Documents, including specifically, the
Lenders, shall be limited to the Construction Period Guarantee Amount. The
Construction Agent nonetheless acknowledges that the Lessor (and Persons
claiming by, through or under the Lessor) shall be entitled to recover from the
Property (including through any reletting and/or sale of such Property or any
portion thereof) the entire outstanding Property Cost of such Property, all
accrued and unpaid interest, Yield and other amounts then due and owing to the
Lessor or any other Person under the Operative Documents and all other costs and
expenses of the Lessor and the Collateral Agent incurred in connection with such
Property (including without limitation, any costs incurred in connection with
the construction of the Improvements and/or any reletting or sale of such
Property or any portion thereof) from and after the date of such return.

        5.5. Construction Agent's Right to Purchase. In the event that a
Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default (other than a Construction Agency
Agreement Event of Default under Section 5.1(c)) or a delay in the construction
of the Property (which delay is in excess of 60 days) with respect to the
Property shall have occurred and be continuing, the Construction Agent may
purchase the applicable Property for a price equal to the Property Balance of
such Property, then outstanding on the date of such purchase plus all accrued
and unpaid Basic Rent plus any Supplemental Rent due and owing by exercising its
Purchase Option



                                      -15-
<PAGE>   17

in accordance with Section 18.1 of the Lease; provided that the Construction
Agent shall have given written notice of its intention to do so within five (5)
days after the occurrence of such Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default
and provided, further, that the Construction Agent shall purchase the applicable
Property and pay all amounts due in connection therewith within fifteen (15)
days after the occurrence of such Construction Agency Agreement Event of
Default. If the Construction Agent elects to halt Construction for more than
sixty (60) days and the Construction Agent does not elect to purchase such
Property the Lessor may: (i) offer to extend the Construction Period, (ii)
terminate the Construction Agency Agreement and complete such Property (upon
completion of such Property the Basic Term shall commence), (iii) require the
Construction Agent to pay to the Lessor the Construction Period Guarantee
Amount, and (iv) sell such Property. With regard to the Lessor's right to sell
an applicable Property hereunder, the Lessor and the Construction Agent
acknowledge and agree that the Lessor shall be entitled to recover up to 100% of
any outstanding Lease Balance with respect to such Property plus all expenses
and cost incurred by the Lessor with regard to such sale, all amounts recovered
in excess of such amount shall be for the account of the Lessee. The Lessee's
purchase of any Property in accordance with this Section 5.5 and in accordance
with Section 18.1 of the Lease shall be deemed to cure the applicable
Construction Agency Agreement Event of Default to the extent relating to such
Property.

"Liabilities"), have been fully paid, performed and satisfied, and all
Commitments have terminated, at which time this Construction Documents
Assignment will terminate. The Secured Party will not exercise any of its rights
hereunder until there shall have occurred and be continuing a Lease Event of
Default.

        For purposes of completing the Construction after any Lease Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Secured Party may, at its
option, further assign its right, title and interest in the Collateral without
the consent of the Assignor, or any contractor or architect.

        This Construction Documents Assignment is a present, perfected and
absolute assignment; provided, however, that the Secured Party shall not have
the right to undertake completion of the Construction or directly to enforce the
provisions of any Construction Contract or any Architect's Agreement until a
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. During the
continuance of any such Event of Default, the Secured Party may, without
affecting any other right or remedy available to it, exercise its rights under
this Construction Documents Assignment as provided herein in any manner
permitted by law. If any notice to the Assignor is required by law, such notice
shall be deemed commercially reasonable if given at least ten (10) days prior to
the date of intended action.

        This Construction Documents Assignment may be effectively waived,
modified, amended or terminated only by a written instrument executed by the
Secured Party and the Lessee. Any waiver by the Secured Party shall be effective
only with respect to the specific instance described therein. Delay or course of
conduct shall not constitute a waiver of any right or remedy of the Secured
Party.

                                PROMISSORY NOTE

Loan Amount: $850,000                                    Cupertino, California
Interest Rate: 5.3%                                      April __, 1999


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, MANSOUR SAFAI ("BORROWER"), residing
at 21789 Villa Oaks Lane, Saratoga, California, hereby promises to pay to the
order of SYMANTEC CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("LENDER"), at its
offices at 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino California, or at such other place or to
such other party as LENDER or the holder of this Note may designate by written
notice to BORROWER, in lawful money of the United States of America, the
principal sum of eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($850,000) with
interest thereon to be paid as set forth below.

          1. Purpose of Loan. The purpose of the loan evidenced by this Note is
to provide purchase money for the acquisition by BORROWER of the Property.

          2. Interest. Interest at a rate of 5.3% per annum will accrue on any
unpaid principal until the principal is paid in full. Interest shall be payable
as follows: all interest accrued prior to April 15, 2001 shall be due and
payable on April 15, 2001; interest due thereafter shall be payable on an annual
basis, the first such payment being due on April 15, 2002 and then on each April
15 thereafter, provided, however, that if such day is not a Business Day, then
on the next succeeding Business Day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if BORROWER
is a full-time employee of LENDER (or any wholly owned subsidiary of LENDER) on
April 15, 2001, or if BORROWER has ceased to be an employee of LENDER under the
circumstances described in 6(d)(i) or 6(d)(ii) below prior to April 15, 2001,
then the payment of interest hereunder shall be forgiven and waived by LENDER.

          3. Principal. The entire principal balance and any accrued interest
shall be due and payable on April 15, 2009; provided, however, that if such day
is not a Business Day then on the next succeeding Business Day, and provided
further that the entire principal balance and any accrued interest shall be due
and payable on April 15, 2004 if BORROWER has ceased to be an employee of
LENDER under the circumstances described in 6(d)(i) or 6(d)(ii) below.

          4. Prepayment. BORROWER may prepay all or any portion of the loan
evidenced by this Note at any time without penalty, fee or acceleration of the
due date of this Note.

          5. Security. Payment of this Note shall be secured by a deed of trust
(the "Deed of Trust"), given by BORROWER, as trustor, for the benefit of LENDER,
as beneficiary, encumbering the principal residence of BORROWER located at 21789
Villa Oaks Lane, Saratoga, California (the "Property"). As a condition precedent
to LENDER'S obligation to make the loan evidenced by this Note, BORROWER shall
provide to LENDER such information as LENDER may reasonably require to ensure
that the Deed of Trust will provide adequate security for the loan. Such
information shall include, but shall not be limited to, a recent appraisal of
the Property, an updated preliminary title report on the Property, and
information regarding the amounts and terms of any other liens encumbering the
Property. In the event that LENDER determines in its reasonable discretion that
the Deed of Trust will not provide adequate security for the loan, BORROWER
shall provide such additional security as LENDER may reasonably require, or
LENDER shall not be obligated to make the loan.

          6. Acceleration of Due Date. The entire unpaid principal balance of
this Note and accrued interest thereon, shall, at the election of LENDER,
become immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any of the following
(an "Event of Default"), irrespective of the payment schedules set forth above:


                                      -1-


<PAGE>   2
                (a)     Any failure on the part of BORROWER to make any payment
under this Note when the same is due;

                (b)     Any failure on the part of BORROWER to perform or
observe any of his obligations under this Note or the Deed of Trust or any other
deed of trust, mortgage or security instrument which secures this Note or
encumbers the Property as and when performance is due;

                (c)     On such date thirty days after BORROWER'S employment
relationship with LENDER or any wholly owned subsidiary of LENDER is terminated
for Cause by LENDER;

                (d)     On such date ninety days after BORROWER'S employment
relationship with LENDER or any wholly owned subsidiary of LENDER is terminated
for any reason by BORROWER; provided, however, that a termination by BORROWER
under the following circumstances shall not be deemed an Event of Default;

                        (i)    Within one year after the acquisition by any one
party of a majority ownership interest in LENDER, or

                        (ii)   Within one year after the sale by LENDER of all
or substantial all of the assets associated with LENDER'S Internet Tools
business unit (the "Sale of I-Tools"),

                (e)     If BORROWER shall sell, transfer, convey or further
encumber the Property or any part thereof, or any interest therein, or shall be
divested of their title or any interest therein, either by any transfer,
conveyance, contract of sale or in any manner or way, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, without the written consent of LENDER which shall not be
unreasonably withheld being first had and obtained; consent to one transaction
under this Paragraph 6(e) shall not constitute a waiver of the right to require
consent to future or successive transactions;

                (f)     If at any time BORROWER shall admit in writing his
inability to pay his debts as they become due, or shall make any assignment for
the benefit of any creditors, or shall file a petition seeking any
reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment or similar release under
any present or future statute, law or regulation, or on the filing or
commencement of any petition, action, case or proceeding, voluntary or
involuntary, under any state or federal law regarding bankruptcy or insolvency.

                7.      Offset to Compensation. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, upon any termination for Cause or BORROWER'S employment with LENDER,
BORROWER hereby authorizes LENDER to offset any unpaid principal balance or
interest due under this Note against any amounts owed by LENDER to BORROWER,
including, but not limited to, any wages, salary, bonuses, accrued vacation or
sick pay, and any other employment or consulting compensation or stock
repurchase payments. LENDER shall promptly notify BORROWER in writing of any
such offset, including an itemization of the amounts offset and the balance, if
any, due and payable pursuant to this Note.

                8.      Collection Costs Borne by BORROWER. BORROWER agrees to
pay the reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable
attorney's fees, incurred by LENDER in any action brought to enforce the terms
of this Note and/or to collect this Note, and any appeal thereof.

                9.      Miscellaneous.

                (a)     No delay or omission on the part of LENDER in exercising
any right under this Note or under the Deed of Trust or any other security
agreement given to secure this Note shall operate as a waiver of such right or
of any other right under this Note.

                (b)     BORROWER expressly waives presentment, protest and
demand, notice to protest, demand and dishonor and nonpayment of this Note and
all other notices of any kind, and expressly



                                      -2-
<PAGE>   3


agrees that this Note, or any payment thereunder, may be extended from time to
time without in any way affecting the liability of BORROWER and endorsers
hereof.

               10.    Late Charge. If payment of principal or interest under
this Note shall not be made within 10 days after the date due, BORROWER agrees
to pay, in addition to the unpaid principal and interest, interest on any such
unpaid amount at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or at the
maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less. BORROWER agrees that the
above-noted calculation represents a fair and reasonable estimate, considering
all of the circumstances existing on the date of this Note, of the costs and
expenses incident to handling and collecting such delinquent payment that will
be sustained by LENDER due to the failure of BORROWER to make timely payment.
The parties further agree that proof of actual damages would be costly and
impracticable. Such charge shall be paid without prejudice to the right of
LENDER to collect any other amounts provided to be paid or to declare a default
under this Note or under the Deed of Trust referred to in this Note or from
exercising any of the other rights and remedies of LENDER.

               11.    Notices Under Other Obligations. BORROWER shall promptly
send to LENDER copies of any notices received by BORROWER from the holder of any
other deed of trust or mortgage encumbering the Property.

               12.    Tax Related Payments by LENDER. During such time that
BORROWER is a full-time employee of LENDER (or any wholly owned subsidiary of
LENDER), LENDER agrees to pay to BORROWER as regular income an amount (in excess
of BORROWER'S salary) to offset any federal, state or local income and
employment taxes due from BORROWER in connection with any interest payment
forgiven or waived by LENDER under Paragraph 2 of this Note. In calculating any
such payment, it shall be assumed that BORROWER is required to pay the maximum
federal, state and local tax rate then in effect.

               13.    Governing Law. The Note shall be governed by the laws of
the State of California and shall be construed in accordance therewith.

               14.    Definitions.

               (a)    Business Day. As used in this Note the term "Business Day"
shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday observed by
employees of the State of California.

               (b)    Cause. As used in this Note the term "Cause" shall mean
(i) an intentional tort committed by BORROWER which causes loss, damage or
injury to the property or reputation of LENDER or its subsidiaries, (ii) any
crime or act of fraud or dishonesty committed by BORROWER against LENDER or its
subsidiaries, (iii) the commission of a felony by BORROWER, (iv)the habitual
neglect of the employment-related duties of BORROWER which is not cured within
ten (10) days after written notice thereof by the President of LENDER, (v) the
disregard by BORROWER of the written employment-related polices of LENDER or its
subsidiaries which causes loss, damage or injury to the property or reputation
of LENDER or its subsidiaries which is not cured with ten(10) days after written
notice of such neglect by the President of LENDER.

               (c)    Principal Residence. As used in this Note the term
"principal residence" shall mean the home in which BORROWER resides on a
continuous basis, or which BORROWER hold himself out as occupying as a principal

<PAGE>   4
          15.  Successors. This Note shall be binding upon BORROWER and the
personal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of BORROWER.

          16.  Severability. If any part of this Note is determined to be
illegal or unenforceable, all other parts shall remain in full force and effect.

          BORROWER has set his hand to this Note effective as of the date set
forth above.

          Dated: April __, 1999.

            7. Offset to Compensation. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
upon any termination for cause of BORROWER'S employment with LENDER, BORROWER
hereby authorizes LENDER to offset any unpaid principal balance or interest due
under this Note against any amounts owed by LENDER to BORROWER, including, but
not limited to, any wages, salary, bonuses, accrued vacation or sick pay, and
any other employment or consulting compensation or stock repurchase payments.
LENDER shall promptly notify BORROWER in writing of any such offset, including
an itemization of the amounts offset and the balance, if any, due and payable
pursuant to this Note.

            8. Collection Costs Borne by BORROWER. BORROWER agrees to pay the
reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by LENDER in any action brought to enforce the terms
of this Note and/or to collect this Note, and any appeal thereof.

            9. Miscellaneous.

            (a) No delay or omission on the part of LENDER in exercising any
right under this Note or under the Deed of Trust or any other security agreement
given to secure this Note shall operate as a waiver of such right or of any
other right under this Note.

            (b) BORROWER expressly waives presentment, protest and demand,
notice to protest, demand and dishonor and nonpayment of this Note and all other
notices of any kind, and expressly agrees that this Note, or any payment
thereunder, may be extended from time to time without in any way affecting the
liability of BORROWER and endorsers hereof.

            10. Late Charge. If payment of principal or interest under this Note
shall not be made within 10 days after the date due, BORROWER agrees to pay, in
addition to the unpaid principal and interest, interest on any such unpaid
amount at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or at the maximum
rate allowed by law, whichever is less. BORROWER agrees that the above-noted
calculation represents a fair and reasonable estimate, considering all of the
circumstances existing on the date of this Note, of the costs and expenses
incident to handling and collecting such delinquent payment that will be
sustained by LENDER due to the failure of BORROWER to make timely payment. The
parties further agree that proof of actual damages would be costly and
impracticable. Such charge shall be paid without prejudice to the right of
LENDER to collect any other amounts provided to be paid or to declare a default
under this Note or under the Deed of Trust referred to in this Note or from
exercising any of the other rights and remedies of LENDER.

            11. Notices Under Other Obligations. BORROWER shall promptly send to
LENDER copies of any notices received by BORROWER from the holder of any other
deed of trust or mortgage encumbering the Property.

            12. Governing Law. The Note shall be governed by the laws of the
State of California and shall be construed in accordance therewith.

            13. Successors. This Note shall be binding upon BORROWER and the
personal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of BORROWER.

            14. Severability. If any part of this Note is determined to be
illegal or unenforceable, all other parts shall remain in full force and effect.

            BORROWER has set his hand to this Note effective as of the date set
forth above.

            Dated: May 15, 1999.

                                   AGREEMENT

     This AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into this 21st day of January
1999 between Gordon E. Eubanks, Jr. ("Mr. Eubanks") and Symantec Corporation, a

Executive Officer, for the recruitment of a successor President and Chief
Executive Officer, and for the transition of management of Symantec to the new

     1.   Resignation. Mr. Eubanks hereby tenders his resignation as President,
Chief Executive Officer and an employee of Symantec, to become effective upon
the earlier of June 30, 1999 or the date a new President and Chief Executive
Officer commences employment with Symantec (the "Retirement Date").

     2.   Employment Period. Mr. Eubanks' employment as President and Chief
Executive Officer of Symantec will continue until the Retirement Date (the
"Employment Period"), subject to the provisions of this Agreement. During the

automobile at Symantec's expense in accordance with its current policies. Mr.
Eubanks understands that Mr. Eubanks will not be entitled to any employment or
other benefits from Symantec other than those expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

     6.   Indemnification. To the extent permitted by law, Symantec will

SYMANTEC CORPORATION CY 1999

PRESIDENT AND CEO VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN

This document defines the Variable Compensation Plan for Symantec's President
and Chief Executive Officer. The objective for CY 1999 is to achieve planned
earnings per share of $1.85 and planned revenue of $768 million. The purpose of
this plan is to provide critical focus on these goals and to provide incentive
compensation upon their attainment.

PLAN SUMMARY

The Target Bonus for this executive position is 100% of annual base salary.

- - Quarterly: The plan includes bonus targets of 12.5% of base salary each
quarter (50% of base salary for the full year). There is no additional pay out
possible for achieving more than 100% of the quarterly metrics.

- - Annual: The annual bonus target is 50% of base salary contingent upon
achievement of overall calendar year revenue growth and EPS results. Achieving
results greater than "planned performance" can yield an additional 50% upside
of base salary.

- - Maximum: The maximum bonus potential of the combined plans is 150% of annual
base salary.

PLAN GUIDELINES FOR CY 1999

1.   The Board of Directors reserves the right to alter or cancel any or all
     such plan for any reason at any time. Any payments made under this plan are
     at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

2.   Participation in the plan for CY 1999 does not guarantee participation in
     future incentive plans. Plan structures and participation will be

                  PRESIDENT AND CEO VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN

Two metrics determine the bonus payment: 1) quarterly PLANNED TOTAL REVENUE
(PTR) and 2) quarterly EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS). The performance targets for
these metrics are stated below. The weighting of each metric is 50%.

A minimum threshold of 80% of EACH target must be exceeded before the quarterly
bonus will be paid for that metric. There is no additional payment for
achieving more than 100% of the quarterly target in the Quarterly Plan.

o  At 80% of the metric target, 0% of the bonus associated with that metric will
   be paid.

o  Between 80% and 100% of the metric targets, the bonus will be calculated on a
   LINEAR basis in relation to the percent of the metric achieved.

Two metrics will determine the annual bonus: 1) REVENUE GROWTH and 2) EARNINGS
PER SHARE for CY 1999. Attainment of each metric will determine 50% of the
annual bonus respectively. In addition, a 50% of base salary upside bonus
potential exists for performance greater than 100% of plan in the Annual Plan.

o  A threshold of 80% must be exceeded for each respective metric before that
   metric's portion of the annual bonus will be paid. There is an additional
   incentive for achieving more than 100% of each metric.

o  Between 80% and 100%, 1% performance equals 5% incentive. Between 100% and
   130%, the bonus will be calculated on a linear basis in relation to the
   percent of the metric achieved (1% performance equals 2.5% incentive).

Mr. John W. Thompson
82 Old Hill Road
Westport, CT 06880

Via Fax: 203-227-4446

                              Employment Agreement

Dear John:

     On behalf of the Board of Directors of Symantec Corporation, I am pleased
to offer you the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Symantec
on the terms set forth below.

     1.   Position. You will be employed by Symantec as its President and Chief
Executive Officer effective commencing upon the date of your resignation from
your current employer (the "Commencement Date"). As such you will have overall
responsibility for the management of Symantec and will report directly to its
Board of Directors. During your term, you will also be appointed to the Board of
Directors and serve as Chairman of the Board. During the term of your
employment, you will be expected to devote your full working time and attention
to the business of Symantec, and you will not render services to any other
business without the prior approval of the Board of Directors or, directly or
indirectly, engage or participate in any business that is competitive in any
manner with the business of Symantec. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may
remain a director of businesses with respect to which you are a director on the
Commencement Date and you may serve on boards of charitable organizations or
own up to 1% of the outstanding equity securities of any corporation whose
stock is listed on a national stock exchange. You will also be expected to
comply with and be bound by the Company's operating policies, procedures and
practices that are from time to time in effect during the term of your
employment.

     2.   Base Salary. Your initial base annual salary will be $600,000,
payable in accordance with Symantec's normal payroll practices with such
payroll deductions and withholdings as are required by law. Your base salary
will be reviewed on an annual basis by the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors and increased from time to time, in the discretion of the Board of
Directors, but in any event such compensation shall not be reduced below
$600,000, during your term of employment.


<PAGE>   2
     3.   Bonus. (a) For the balance of the calendar year 1999, you will be
eligible to receive a prorated portion of a target bonus equal to 100% of your
base annual salary in accordance with Symantec's CY 1999 President and CEO
Variable Compensation Plan ("VCP"), a copy of which is attached to this letter
as Exhibit A. The plan includes (i) quarterly bonus targets of 12.5% of base
annual salary each quarter based on achievement of quarterly metrics for total
revenue and earnings per share and (ii) an annual bonus target of 50% of base
annual salary based on achievement of overall calendar year revenue growth and
EPS results. Achieving results greater than planned performance can yield up to
an additional 50% of base annual salary. Your maximum bonus potential for the
combined quarterly and annual bonus is 150% of base annual salary, prorated for
the portion of the year that you are employed by Symantec. Because you will be
starting during the second quarter of the year, your target bonus of $75,000
for the quarter ending June 30, 1999 will be guaranteed and paid regardless of
whether the quarterly metrics are achieved, and you will receive a guaranteed
annual bonus for calendar year 1999 equal to $75,000 plus one half of the
amount that would have been payable if you had been employed by Symantec for
the full year based on the annual revenue growth and EPS results; it being
understood that if the actual calendar 1999 results for Symantec result in a
higher bonus entitlement for you under the terms of the VCP, you shall be
entitled to the maximum bonus potential otherwise payable to you under the VCP.

          (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the
contrary, you will, during the term of your employment, be provided with the
maximum bonus and incentive opportunity offered to any senior executive of
Symantec and to the extent that any other individual is offered a more
favorable bonus or incentive opportunity (whether in connection with
recruitment or ongoing employment) your incentive and bonus opportunity for the
year in question shall be adjusted retroactively to give effect to such changes.

     4.   Stock Options and Restricted Stock.

          (a)  On the Commencement Date, the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors shall grant you options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of
Symantec common stock at an exercise price equal to its closing price on the
last trading day prior to the Commencement Date. These options will vest and
become exercisable over a five year period, with 200,000 shares vesting and
becoming exercisable on the first anniversary of your employment and the
remaining 800,000 shares vesting and becoming exercisable ratably on a monthly
basis as of the first day of each month over the following four years. Except
as otherwise indicated in this agreement, the vested portion of the options may
be exercised at any time until the earlier of one year after the termination of
your employment or ten years after the grant of such options. A portion of
these stock options will be designated as "incentive stock options" under
Symantec's stock options plan to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
Code (up to $100,000 in aggregate amount exercisable per year), and the balance
of the options will be nonqualified stock options. You should consult a tax
advisor concerning your income tax consequences before exercising any of the
options. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4(a) to the
contrary, upon "Involuntary Termination," "Termination without Cause," or
"Termination for Death or Disability," unvested options and shares of
restricted stock shall immediately vest as provided below. Symantec shall
register the shares issuable under the options and the shares of

                                       2
<PAGE>   3
restricted stock on a Form S-8 registration statement prior to the initial
vesting date for such options and shares and shall keep such registration
statement in effect for the entire period the options and shares remain
outstanding.

          (b)  You will be granted 100,000 shares of restricted common stock on
your first date of employment for a purchase price equal to the par value of
the common stock of $0.01 per share. These shares of restricted stock will vest
over a two-year period, with 50,000 shares vesting on the first anniversary of
your employment and the remaining 50,000 shares vesting on the second
anniversary of your employment. These shares of restricted stock will not be
transferable by you until they are vested. Unvested shares will be subject to
repurchase by Symantec at $0.01 per share upon termination or your employment,
except as otherwise provided below. Unless you elect to be taxed upon receipt
of the restricted stock (by filing a special Section 83(b) election with the
IRS within 30 days), you will be taxed (and subject to income tax withholding)
on the value of the restricted stock as the shares vest. Again, you should
consult a tax advisor concerning the tax consequences.

     5.   Other Benefits. You will be entitled to the following additional
benefits:

          (a)  You will be eligible for the normal vacation, health insurance,
401(k), Employee Stock Purchase Plan and other benefits offered to all Symantec
senior executives of similar rank and status.

          (b)  As President and Chief Executive Officer, you will be eligible
for the following executive benefits: participation in Symantec's Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan, which permits you to defer receipt of up to 50% of
your annual base salary and bonus on a tax deferred basis; a company car or car
allowance in accordance with Symantec's company car policy; reimbursement for
up to $3,000 per year for tax preparation services; reimbursement for up to
$2,000 per year for membership in professional organizations related to
Symantec's business; and reimbursement for up to $1,000 per year for an annual
physical examination.

          (c)  You will be eligible for reimbursement for certain expenses
incurred in connection with your relocation to California as set forth in the
Relocation Agreement attached to this letter as Exhibit B; provided that no
repayment will be required upon an Involuntary Termination, a Termination
without Cause, or a Termination for Death or Disability.

          (d)  Symantec will provide you with a recourse loan in an amount
equal to your existing equity in your Connecticut home on an interest-free
basis for a period of one year in order to assist you in financing your
residence in the Bay Area. This loan shall be secured by a second mortgage on
such new residence. This loan shall be due and payable one year from the date
of such loan (two years from the date of such loan in the case of your
termination of employment, other than a Voluntary Termination or Termination
for Cause, within such one-year period).

     6.   At-Will Employment and Termination. Your employment with Symantec
will be at-will and may be terminated by you or by Symantec at any time for any
reason as follows:

                                       3
<PAGE>   4
          (a) You may terminate your employment upon written notice to the
Board of Directors at any time for "Good Reason," as defined below (an
"Involuntary Termination");

          (b) You may terminate your employment upon written notice to the Board
of Directors at any time in your discretion without Good Reason ("Voluntary
Termination");

          (c) Symantec may terminate your employment upon written notice to you
at any time following a determination by two-thirds (2/3) vote of the entire
Board of Directors that there is "Cause," as defined below, for such termination
("Termination for Cause");

          (d) Symantec may terminate your employment upon written notice to you
at any time in the sole discretion of two-thirds (2/3) of the entire Board of
Directors without a determination that there is Cause for such termination
("Termination without Cause");

          (e) Your employment will automatically terminate upon your death or
upon your disability as determined by the Board of Directors ("Termination for
Death or Disability"); provided that "disability" shall mean your complete
inability to perform your job responsibilities for a period of 180 consecutive
days or 180 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period.

     7.  DEFINITIONS. As used in this agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings:

         (a) "Good Reason" means (i) a material reduction in your duties that is
inconsistent with your position as President and Chief Executive Officer of
Symantec or a change in your reporting relationship such that you no longer
report directly to the Board of Directors; (ii) your no longer being President
and Chief Executive Officer of Symantec or, in the case of a Change in Control,
of the surviving entity or acquiror that results from any Change in Control;
(iii) any reduction in your base annual salary or target quarterly or annual
bonus (other than in connection with a general decrease in the salary or target
bonuses for all officers of Symantec without your consent or material breach by
Symantec of any of its obligations hereunder after providing Symantec with
written notice and an opportunity to cure within seven (7) business days; (iv) a
requirement by Symantec that you relocate your principal office to a facility
more than 50 miles from Symantec's current headquarters; or (v) failure of any
successor to assume this agreement pursuant to Section 13(d) below.

         (b) "Cause" means (i) gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
performance of your duties to Symantec (other than as a result of a disability)
that has resulted or is likely to result in substantial and material damage to
Symantec, after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the
Board of Directors which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board
believes you have not substantially performed your duties and you have been
provided with a reasonable opportunity to cure any alleged gross negligence or
willful misconduct; (ii) commission of any act of fraud with respect to
Symantec; or (iii) conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude
causing material harm to the business and affairs of Symantec. No act or failure
to act by you shall be considered "willful" if done or omitted by you


                                       4

<PAGE>   5
in good faith with reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the
best interest of Symantec.

          (c)  "Change in Control" means (i) any person or entity becoming the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of Symantec representing
forty (40%) percent of the total voting power of all its then outstanding voting
securities, (ii) a merger or consolidation of Symantec in which its voting

liquidation or dissolution of Symantec, or (iv) individuals who, as of the
Commencement Date, constitute the Board of Directors (the "Incumbent Board")

that any individual who becomes a director of Symantec subsequent to the
Commencement Date, whose election, or nomination for election by Symantec
stockholders, was approved by the vote of at least a majority of the directors
then in office shall be deemed a member of the Incumbent Board.

     8.   Separation Benefits. Upon termination of your employment with Symantec
for any reason, you will receive payment for all salary, prorated quarterly
bonus and annual bonus and unpaid vacation accrued to the date of your
termination of employment; your benefits will be continued under Symantec's then
existing benefit plans and policies for so long as provided under the terms of
such plans and policies and as required by applicable law; except as otherwise
provided below, you will have until one year (three months in the case of
Termination for Cause or a Voluntary Termination) after the effective date of
your termination to exercise any stock options that were vested as of the
effective date of your termination; and, except as otherwise provided below, all
unvested shares of restricted stock will be repurchased by Symantec at $0.01 per
share. Under certain circumstances, you will also be entitled to receive
severance benefits as set forth below, but you will not be entitled to any other
compensation, award or damages with respect to your employment or termination.

          (a)  In the event of your Voluntary Termination or Termination for
Cause, you will not be entitled to any cash severance benefits or additional
vesting of shares of restricted stock or options.

          (b)  In the event of your Involuntary Termination or Termination
without Cause, you will be entitled to a single lump sum severance payment equal
to twice your then current annual base salary (less applicable deductions and
withholdings) payable within 30 days after the effective date of your
termination; the vesting of your unvested shares of restricted stock shall be
accelerated in full; the vesting and exercisability of your outstanding options
to purchase Symantec common stock shall be immediately accelerated by two years,
and you will have until one year after the effective date of your termination to
exercise any options that were vested, including those that were accelerated as
of the effective date of your termination. Symantec shall reimburse you for all
COBRA premiums paid by you for the full extension period permitted by law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your Involuntary Termination or Termination
without Cause occurs within twelve months after a Change in Control, the vesting
and exercisability of


                                       5
<PAGE>   6
all your outstanding options to purchase Symantec common stock (or securities of
the surviving entity that are issuable upon exercise of such options following
the Change in Control) will be immediately accelerated in full and you will
have until one year after the effective date of your termination to exercise
such options.

     (c)  In the event of your Termination for Death or Disability, the vesting
of your unvested shares of restricted stock and the vesting and exercisability
of your outstanding options to purchase Symantec common stock shall be
immediately accelerated by two years and your designated beneficiary or, in the
absence of such designation, your estate will be entitled to a single lump sum
death benefit equal to $5,000,000 in accordance with Symantec's life insurance
plan in the case of your death, or you will be entitled to disability payments
of up to $20,000 per month after 180 days of continuous disability in
accordance with Symantec's long term disability plan, and you or your estate
will have until one year after the effective date of your death or disability to
exercise any options that were vested as of the effective date of your
termination, including those that were accelerated as of the effective date of
your death or disability. Symantec agrees to maintain during the course of your
employment insurance and disability coverage on your life in the amounts set
forth above.

     (d)  If your severance and other benefits provided for in this Section 8
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code and, but for this subsection, would be subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then your
severance and other benefits under this Section 8 will be payable, at your
election, either in full or in such lesser amount as would result, after taking
into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999, in your receipt on an after-tax basis of
the greatest amount of severance and other benefits.

     (e)  No payments due you hereunder shall be subject to mitigation or
offset.

     9.   Indemnification Agreement. Upon your commencement of employment with
Symantec, Symantec will enter into its standard form of indemnification
agreement for officers and directors, a copy of which is attached to this letter
as Exhibit C, to indemnify you against certain liabilities you may incur as an
officer or director of Symantec.

    10.   Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement. Upon
your commencement of employment with Symantec, you will be required to sign its
standard form of Employee Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this letter
as Exhibit D, to protect Symantec's confidential information and intellectual
property.

    11.   Nonsolicitation. During the term of your employment with Symantec and
for one year thereafter, you will not, on behalf of yourself or any third
party, solicit or attempt to induce any employee of Symantec to terminate his
or her employment with Symantec.

    12.   Arbitration. The parties agree that any dispute regarding the
interpretation or enforcement of this agreement shall be decided by
confidential, final and binding arbitration

                                       6
<PAGE>   7
conducted by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") under the
then existing JAMS rules rather than by litigation in court, trial by jury,
administrative proceeding or in any other forum.

     13.  Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Authority to Enter into Agreement. Symantec represents that its
Chairman of the Board has due authority to execute and deliver this agreement
on behalf of Symantec.

          (b)  Absence of Conflicts. You represent that upon the Commencement
Date your performance of your duties under this agreement will not breach any
other agreement as to which you are a party.

          (c)  Attorneys Fees. If a legal action or other proceeding is brought
for enforcement of this agreement because of an alleged dispute, breach,
default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this
agreement, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred, both before and after judgment,
in addition to any other relief to which they may be entitled.

          (d)  Successors. This agreement is binding on and may be enforced by
Symantec and its successors and assigns and is binding on and may be enforced
by you and your heirs and legal representatives. Any successor to Symantec or
substantially all of its business (whether by purchase, merger, consolidation
or otherwise) will in advance assume in writing and be bound by all of
Symantec's obligations under this agreement.

          (e)  Notices. Notices under this agreement must be in writing and
will be deemed to have been given when personally delivered or two days after
mailed by U.S. registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and
postage prepaid. Mailed notices to you will be addressed to you at the home
address which you have most recently communicated to Symantec in writing.
Notices to Symantec will be addressed to its General Counsel at Symantec's
corporate headquarters.

          (f)  Waiver. No provision of this agreement will be modified or
waived except in writing signed by you and an officer of Symantec duly
authorized by its Board of Directors. No waiver by either party of any breach
of this agreement by the other party will be considered a waiver of any other
breach of this agreement.

          (g)  Entire Agreement. This agreement, including the attached
exhibits, represents the entire agreement between us concerning the subject
matter of your employment by Symantec and supersedes any agreements prior to
