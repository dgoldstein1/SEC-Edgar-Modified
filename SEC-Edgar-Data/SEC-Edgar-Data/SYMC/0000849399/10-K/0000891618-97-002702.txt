ITEM 1: BUSINESS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
- ---------------------------

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to
risks and uncertainties. There are several important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the
forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion. Readers should
pay particular attention to the risk factors set forth in this section and in
the section of this report entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

GENERAL.
- --------

Symantec Corporation ("Symantec" or the "Company") develops, markets and
supports a diversified line of application and system software products designed
to enhance individual and workgroup productivity. Approximately 80% of
Symantec's net revenues are derived from products that operate on Microsoft
Corporation's ("Microsoft") MS-DOS, Windows, Windows 95 and Windows NT operating
systems for personal computers. Symantec also offers products for use on the
Apple Macintosh, Power Macintosh and IBM OS/2 operating systems.

The Company's predecessor, C&E Software, Inc., a California corporation, and
that predecessor's operating subsidiary, Symantec Corporation, a California
corporation, were formed in September 1983 and March 1982, respectively. The
Company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1988 in connection with the
September 1988 reincorporation of the Company's predecessor and its operating
subsidiary into a single Delaware corporation.

Since Symantec's initial public offering on June 23, 1989, the Company has
completed acquisitions of the following companies:

Fast Track, Inc. ("Fast Track")                         May 28, 1996         Network Management Utilities
Delrina Corporation ("Delrina")                         November 22, 1995    Remote Productivity Solutions
Intec Systems Corporation ("Intec")                     August 31, 1994      Applications
Central Point Software, Inc. ("Central Point")          June 1, 1994         Security and Assistance
SLR Systems, Inc. ("SLR")                               May 31, 1994         Internet Tools
Fifth Generation Systems, Inc. ("Fifth Generation")     October 4, 1993      Security and Assistance
Contact Software International, Inc. ("Contact")        June 2, 1993         Remote Productivity Solutions
Certus International Corporation ("Certus")             November 30, 1992    Security and Assistance
MultiScope, Inc. ("MultiScope")                         September 2, 1992    Internet Tools
The Whitewater Group, Inc. ("Whitewater")               September 2, 1992    Internet Tools
Symantec (UK) Ltd. ("Symantec UK")                      April 3, 1992        Marketing Entity
Zortech Ltd. ("Zortech")                                August 31, 1991      Internet Tools
Dynamic Microprocessor Associates, Inc. ("DMA")         August 30, 1991      Remote Productivity Solutions
Leonard Development Group ("Leonard")                   August 30, 1991      Applications
Peter Norton Computing, Incorporated ("Norton")         August 31, 1990      Security and Assistance
</TABLE>

All of these acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interest.
Accordingly, all financial information has been restated to reflect the combined
operations of these companies and Symantec with the exception of Fast Track,
Intec, SLR, MultiScope and Whitewater, which had results of operations that were
not material to Symantec's consolidated financial statements.

Symantec's business strategy is to satisfy customer needs by developing and
marketing products across multiple operating platforms that make customers
productive and keep their computers safe and reliable - anywhere, anytime.

During fiscal 1997, in a move to focus the Company's product offerings on
customer needs, Symantec sold its FormFlow product line, acquired as part of the
Delrina acquisition, to JetForm Corporation and sold the assets 



                                       1
<PAGE>   4
comprising its networking business unit to the Hewlett-Packard Company. See
further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Symantec has a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as
of and for the periods ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended March 28, 1997, March 29, 1996 and March 31, 1995,
respectively.

SALES, INTERNATIONAL SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT.
- ------------------------------------------------

Symantec markets its products worldwide utilizing a multi-channel strategy of
direct sales and indirect sales through independent software distributors, major
retail chains and resellers.

SALES AND MARKETING
Symantec utilizes both direct and indirect sales forces to encourage end users
to adopt Symantec's products as corporate standards. The direct sales force
focuses primarily on site license sales where a license for multiple
workstations is sold to a customer at a negotiated price. The sales cycle with
respect to site license sales may be lengthy and may be subject to integration
and acceptance by the customer. The Company also employs an indirect sales force
that works closely with its major distributor and reseller accounts to manage
the flow of orders, 



                                       4
<PAGE>   7
inventory levels and sell-through to retail chains as well as promotions and
other selling activities. At March 31, 1997, Symantec had approximately 120
people in its North American direct and indirect sales force.

Symantec maintains distribution relationships with major independent
distributors. These distributors stock Symantec's products in inventory for
redistribution to independent dealers, consultants and other resellers. Symantec
also maintains relationships with major retailers, including CompUSA and Best
Buy. Symantec markets to these retailers through independent distributors.
Additionally, Symantec sells product upgrades and certain of its products to end
users through direct mail campaigns and the Internet.

Approximately 34% of Symantec's net revenues in the year ended March 31, 1997
were derived from Symantec's two largest distributors. Ingram Micro, Inc.
represented 27%, 27% and 22% of Symantec's net revenues in fiscal 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively, while Merisel Americas, Inc. represented 7%, 10% and 11% of
Symantec's net revenues in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Agreements
with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by either
party without cause. Such distributors are not within the control of Symantec,
are not obligated to purchase products and also represent other vendors' product
lines. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Risks - Distribution
Channels.)

Symantec's return policy allows its distributors, subject to certain
limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for
credit towards future purchases. End users may return products through dealers
and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full
refund, and retailers may return older versions of products. Various
distributors and resellers may have different return policies that may
negatively impact the level of products which are returned to Symantec. Product
returns occur when the Company introduces upgrades and new versions of products
or when distributors order too much product. In addition, competitive factors
often require the Company to offer rights of return for products that
distributors or retail stores are unable to sell. (See further discussion in
Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations - Business Risks - Product Returns.)

Symantec's marketing activities include advertising in trade, technical and
business publications, cooperative marketing with distributors, resellers and
dealers, periodic direct mailings to existing and prospective end users and
participation in trade and computer shows. Additionally, the Company typically
offers two types of rebate programs, volume incentive rebates and rebates to end
users. Volume incentive rebates are made available to Symantec's largest
distributors and resellers whereby the distributor or reseller earns a rebate
based upon their purchases or the volume of product they sell to end users.
Volume incentive rebates are accrued when revenue is recorded. The amount of
these rebates as a percentage of net revenues has been consistent for all
periods presented and has not had a material impact on the Company's liquidity.
From time to time, Symantec makes available rebates to end users of various
products who acquired the products through major retailers. End user rebates are
accrued when revenue is recorded.

INTERNATIONAL SALES
International revenues represented approximately 29%, 32% and 31% of Symantec's
net revenues in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. At March 31, 1997,
Symantec had approximately 140 sales, marketing and related personnel in its
international sales organization.

The majority of Symantec's net revenues from certain European regions are
derived from sales by affiliates of Symantec's major United States distributors.
In other countries, Symantec sells its products through authorized distributors.
In some countries, these distributors are restricted to specified territories.
Symantec typically adapts products for local markets, including translating the
documentation and software where necessary, and prepares marketing programs for
each local market.

Symantec has established marketing offices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France,
Germany, Holland, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia,
Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.
These local offices facilitate Symantec's marketing and distribution in
international markets. The Company's international operations are subject to
certain risks common to international operations, such as government
regulations, import restrictions, currency fluctuations, repatriation
restrictions and, in certain jurisdictions, reduced protection for the Company's
copyrights and trademarks. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -

Operations.) Information with respect to international operations and export
sales may be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Part IV, Item 14 of this Form 10-K.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT
Symantec's product support program provides a wide variety of free and fee-based
technical support services to its customers. Symantec provides its customers
with free support via electronic and automated services as well as 90 days free
telephone support for selected products. Symantec accrues the cost of providing
this free support at the time of product sale. In August 1996, Symantec
introduced LiveUpdate, which provides free, instant access to on-line updates,
enhancements, support tips and other useful information for selected products.
In addition, Symantec offers both domestic individual users and domestic
corporate customers a variety of fee-based options designed to meet their
technical support requirements. These fee-based support programs are revised
from time to time as customer requirements change and as market trends dictate.
Fee-based technical support services did not generate material revenues in any
fiscal years presented and are not expected to generate material revenues in the
near future. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Risks -
Rapid Technological Change and Development Risks and Fluctuations in Quarterly
Operating Results.)

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITIONS.
Symantec uses a multiple products sourcing strategy that includes internal
development, acquisitions of product lines or companies and licensing from third
parties. Symantec typically develops new products and enhancements of existing
products in one of its two core product groups (Remote Productivity Solutions
and Security and Assistance) and in selected product areas targeted as emerging
business opportunities. Each group's responsibilities include design,
development, documentation and quality assurance. Independent contractors are
used for certain aspects of the product development process and elements of
certain Company products are licensed from third-party developers.

Symantec uses strategic acquisitions, as necessary, to provide certain
technology, people and products for its overall product strategy. The Company
has completed a number of acquisitions and dispositions of companies and
products and may acquire and dispose other companies and products in the future.
(See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Risks Management of
Expanding Operations.)

The Company is devoting substantial efforts to the development of software
products that are designed to operate on various operating systems. Symantec's
total research and development expenses were approximately $89 million, $95
million and $71 million in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Research
and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. In fiscal
1997, Symantec capitalized approximately $8 million of capitalized software
development costs, primarily related to network administration technology, which
was sold to Hewlett-Packard in March 1997, resulting in the write off of
approximately $7 million of unamortized costs during fiscal 1997. No material
software development costs have been capitalized by the Company in fiscal 1996,
while prior to being acquired by Symantec, Delrina capitalized approximately $6
million in software development costs in fiscal year 1995. (See further
discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Business Risks - Operating System and
Uncertainty of Research and Development Efforts.)

COMPETITION.
The microcomputer software market is intensely competitive and is subject to
rapid changes in both technology and the strategic direction of major
microcomputer hardware manufacturers and operating system providers. The
Company's competitiveness depends on its ability to enhance its existing
products and to offer new products on a timely basis. The Company has limited
resources and must restrict its product development efforts to a relatively
small number of projects. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
Business Risks - Rapid Technological Change and Development Risks.)

Operating system vendors such as Microsoft have added features to new versions
of their products that provide some of the same functionality traditionally
offered in Symantec's products. Symantec believes this trend may continue.
Microsoft may incorporate advanced features in future versions of operating
systems that may decrease the demand for certain of the Company's products,
including those currently under development. A number of software developers
have integrated antivirus capabilities into their Internet products. While
Symantec plans to continue to improve its products with a view toward providing
enhanced functionality over what may be provided in 


                                       6
<PAGE>   9
operating systems, there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful
or that such improved products will be commercially accepted by software users.
Symantec will also attempt to work with operating system vendors in an effort to
make its products compatible with those operating systems, yet differentiate
those utility products from features included in the operating systems. However,
there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful. (See further
discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations Business Risks - Operating System.)

The Company competes with at least one product from many of the major
independent software vendors, including Borland International, Inc.
("Borland"), CyberMedia ("CyberMedia"), Dr Solomon's ("Dr Solomon's"), ELAN
Software Corporation ("ELAN"), International Business Machines Corporation
("IBM"), McAfee Associates, Inc. ("McAfee"), Microcom, Inc. ("Microcom"),
Microsoft, Norton-Lambert Corporation ("Norton-Lambert"), Phoenix
Technologies Ltd. ("Phoenix"), TouchStone Software Corporation
("TouchStone"), Traveling Software, Inc. ("Traveling Software"), Starfish
Software, Inc. ("Starfish") and SofNet, Inc. ("SofNet").

For example, Norton Utilities competes with operating systems, such as
Microsoft's Windows 95 and MSDOS and IBM's DOS, which offer file recovery,
anti-virus and backup features, First Aid from CyberMedia and other products
from various other utilities vendors. Norton AntiVirus competes with PC-cillin
95 from TouchStone, Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit from Dr. Solomon's and
Viruscan from McAfee. Symantec's pcANYWHERE competes mainly with Laplink from
Traveling Software, Carbon Copy from Microcom, Close Up from Norton Lambert and
NetRemote from McAfee. ACT! competes with Lotus Organizer for Windows from IBM,
Outlook from Microsoft, GoldMine from ELAN, Sidekick from Starfish and many
other personal information managers produced by various software developers.
Delrina WinFax PRO competes with products offered by Phoenix, Traveling Software
and SofNet, as well as Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. Cafe mainly
competes with products from Microsoft. In addition, these and other Company
products compete less directly with a number of other products that offer levels
of functionality different from those offered by Symantec's products or that
were designed for a somewhat different group of end users than those targeted by
Symantec.

Symantec also competes with microcomputer hardware manufacturers that develop
their own software products. Further, Symantec competes with other microcomputer
software companies for access to the channels of retail distribution and for the
attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts. Finally,
Symantec competes with other software companies in its efforts to acquire
products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties.
Symantec believes that competition in the industry will continue to intensify as
most major software companies expand their product lines into additional product
categories. Some of the Company's competitors have substantial financial,
marketing and technological resources. (See further discussion in Item 7:
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Business Risks Rapid Technological Change and Development Risks,
Operating System and Distribution Channels.)

MANUFACTURING AND BACKLOG.
Symantec's product development organization produces a set of master diskettes
and documentation for each product. Most of Symantec's domestic manufacturing is
performed by outside contractors under the supervision of Symantec's
manufacturing organization. Purchasing of most raw materials and fulfillment of
most orders is done by Symantec personnel in Symantec's Sunnyvale, California
facility. The manufacturing steps that are subcontracted to outside
organizations include the duplication of diskettes and CD-ROM's, printing of
documentation materials and assembly of the final package. Symantec performs
diskette duplication and assembly of the final package in its Dublin, Ireland
manufacturing facility for most products distributed outside of the United
States, Canada and Latin America.

Symantec has often been able to acquire materials on a volume-discount basis and
has had multiple sources of supply for certain materials. To date, Symantec has
not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of its
software and related documentation and packaging. However, shortages may occur
in the future. For example, shortages of certain materials may occur when
Microsoft introduces new operating systems. (See further discussion in Item 7:
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Business Risks - Supply Risk.)

Symantec normally ships products within one week after receiving an order. Thus,
Symantec does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future
performance.

PRICE COMPETITION.
Price competition is intense in the microcomputer business software market and
is expected to continue to increase and become even more significant in the
future. See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

SEASONALITY.
While Symantec's diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in
quarterly net revenues, these fluctuations have occurred and may occur in the
future. These fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors, including the
timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of Symantec's
products and product upgrades, the introduction of competitive products by
existing or new competitors, reduced demand for any given product, seasonality
in the retail software market in foreign markets, customer end-of-period buying
patterns and the market's transition between operating systems. These factors
may cause significant fluctuations in net revenues and, accordingly, operating
results. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Risks - Fluctuations
in Quarterly Operating Results.)

PRODUCT PROTECTION.
Symantec regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of
copyright, patent and trademark laws and license agreements in an attempt to
protect its rights. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Risks -
Intellectual Property Rights.)

EMPLOYEES.
As of March 31, 1997, Symantec employed approximately 2,000 people, including
1,000 in sales, marketing and related staff activities, 600 in product
development and 400 in management, manufacturing, administration and finance.
None of the employees is represented by a labor union, and Symantec has
experienced no work stoppages. Symantec believes that its employee relations are
good.

Competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense.
Symantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to
recruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and technical personnel.
Symantec believes that it must provide personnel with a competitive compensation
package, which necessitates the continued availability of stock options and
requires ongoing shareholder approval of such option programs. (See further
discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations Business Risks - Employee Risk.)

ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

   The following selected financial data is qualified in its entirety by and
should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. During fiscal 1997,
Symantec acquired Fast Track, Inc. ("Fast Track") in a transaction accounted for
as a pooling of interests. As the results of operations of Fast Track were not
material to Symantec's consolidated financial statements, amounts prior to the
date of acquisition were not restated to reflect the combined operations of the
companies. Additional acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interest include
Delrina Corporation in fiscal 1996, Intec Systems Corporation, Central Point
Software, Inc. and SLR Systems, Inc. in fiscal 1995, Fifth Generation Systems,
Inc. and Contact Software International, Inc. during fiscal 1994, and Certus

NET REVENUES.
Net revenues increased 6% from $445 million in fiscal 1996 to $472 million in
fiscal 1997. Net revenues increased 3% from $431 million in fiscal 1995 to $445
million in fiscal 1996.

PRODUCT GROUPS. During fiscal 1997, the Company experienced increased net
revenues from each of its core product groups: Remote Productivity Solutions and
Security and Assistance. The Remote Productivity Solutions product group is
focused on helping remote professionals remain productive, by addressing
customer needs to access information, applications and data from any location.
The Security and Assistance product group is dedicated to being indispensable to
customers' daily use of computers by increasing productivity and keeping
computers safe and reliable.

The market's acceptance of the Windows95 and Windows NT operating systems, as
well as the further expansion of personal computer sales, enabled Symantec to
experience strong fiscal 1997 sales of its Windows 95 products first introduced
during the last half of fiscal 1996 and Windows NT products introduced in fiscal
1997. The most significant product line sales growth was related to the Norton
AntiVirus products from the Security and Assistance product group and pcANYWHERE
products from the Remote Productivity Solutions product group. During fiscal
1997, the financial impact of product price reductions for Symantec's core
products was more than offset by the increase in the volume of products sold,
resulting in increased net revenues.

Symantec's third business unit is the Emerging Business and Other product group,
which includes products providing an easy to use Java development environment,
as well as revenue streams from the sale of certain of 



                                       13
<PAGE>   16
the Company's software product lines and revenues from products nearing the end
of their life cycles. Fiscal 1997 net revenues for the Emerging Business product
group decreased from fiscal 1996, largely as the result of declining sales from
products which Symantec no longer actively develops or markets. Symantec
expanded its line of Java development tools in fiscal 1997 in response to wider
acceptance of the Java development environment, resulting in an increase in net
revenues for the Java product line during fiscal 1997. The Emerging Business and
Other product group also recorded approximately $6 million of consulting net
revenues in fiscal 1997, resulting from a non-recurring consulting contract
which was completed during the fiscal year.

As a result of the sale of its electronic forms software products and related
tangible assets to JetForm Corporation ("JetForm") for approximately $100
million in fiscal 1997, the Emerging Business and Other product group recognized
revenue of approximately $18 million during the 1997 fiscal year and is
contractually entitled to quarterly revenue payments through the June 2000
quarter. JetForm has the option to tender payment in either cash or in
registered JetForm common stock, within a contractually defined quantity
threshold. Due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate collectibility of these
installments, Symantec is recognizing the related revenue as payments are due
and collectibility is assured from JetForm.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, Symantec also sold the software
products and related tangible assets of its Networking Business Unit to the
Hewlett-Packard Company ("Hewlett-Packard"), resulting in the receipt of
approximately $1 million of revenue and $2 million research and development
expense reimbursement by the Emerging Business and Other product group.
Additionally, over the next two years, Hewlett-Packard is contractually
obligated to pay to Symantec a royalty stream not to exceed the present value of
$27 million, which is contingent upon future sales of certain products by
Hewlett-Packard. Due to the uncertainty regarding the amounts upon which these
royalties will be determined, Symantec is recognizing these amounts as they are
estimable.

During fiscal 1996, the Company experienced increased net revenues from its
Security and Assistance product group, offset in part by decreased revenues from
its Remote Productivity Solutions product group and products which Symantec no
longer actively develops or markets. Symantec experienced an increase in net
revenue from the introduction of several Windows 95 products; however, this
increase was substantially offset by a decrease in net revenues related to
Windows 3.1 and DOS products.

Symantec markets its products through a number of distribution channels,
including retail, site licenses, OEM, direct marketing and upgrades and the
Internet. The retail channel is Symantec's single largest product channel and
comprises approximately 60% of total product revenues.

INTERNATIONAL. Net revenues from international sales were $138 million and $142
million and represented 29% and 32% of total net revenues in fiscal years 1997
and 1996, respectively. The decrease in international net revenue as a
percentage of total net revenue is the result of domestic revenue growth
outpacing international revenue growth during the fiscal year. Additionally,
international revenues for fiscal 1996 includes the one time recognition of
approximately $7 million, previously deferred Central Point revenue. Foreign
exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal 1997 did not materially contribute to
the fluctuation in results from fiscal 1996 to fiscal 1997. Net revenues from
international sales increased by $7 million in fiscal 1996, from $135 million in
fiscal 1995 to $142 million in fiscal 1996. This increase was largely the result
of the one-time recognition in fiscal 1996 of approximately $7 million of
previously deferred Central Point revenue.

PRODUCT RETURNS. The level of actual product returns and related product return
provision are largely a factor of the level of product sell-in (gross revenue)
from normal sales activity and the replacement of obsolete quantities with the
current version of the Company's products. Changes in the levels of product
returns and related product return provision are generally offset by changing
levels of gross revenue and, therefore, do not typically have a material impact
on reported net revenues.

The Company's product return provision typically fluctuate from period to period
based upon the level and timing of product upgrade releases and changes in
product sell-in. The product return provision for fiscal 1997 was higher than
the provision for fiscal 1996 due to increased returns exposure for Windows 95
products due to additional product sell-in during fiscal 1997. The product
return provision for fiscal 1996 was higher than the provision for fiscal 1995,
due to the introduction of Symantec's Windows 95 products during the last three
quarters of fiscal 1996, which had unusually high sell-in volumes.


                                       14
<PAGE>   17
GROSS MARGIN.
Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
consists primarily of manufacturing expenses, costs for producing manuals,
packaging costs, royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and
amortization and write-off of capitalized software.

Prior to fiscal 1997, accounting rules requiring capitalization of certain
software development costs did not materially affect the Company, except for
amounts capitalized by Delrina prior to its acquisition by Symantec in fiscal
1996. Amounts capitalized during fiscal 1997 primarily related to the networking
business unit which was sold to Hewlett-Packard in March 1997, at which time the
amounts were written off.

Amortization of capitalized software, including amortization and the write-off
of both purchased product rights and capitalized software development expenses,
totaled $10 million, $19 million and $13 million for fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Included in the fiscal 1997 total is approximately $7 million of
unamortized capitalized software development expenses and $1 million of
unamortized purchased software product rights related to network administration
technology written off as part of the sale to Hewlett-Packard in March 1997. The
fiscal 1997 write-off of unamortized FormFlow technology sold to JetForm was
immaterial. Amortization expense in fiscal year 1997 was lower than in 1996 due
to capitalized software write-offs in fiscal 1996 related to de-emphasized
products and Delrina Windows 3.1 products. The fiscal 1996 amortization of
capitalized software expense included the aforementioned write-offs, resulting
in the significant increase in expense from fiscal 1995.

Gross margins increased to 80% of net revenues in fiscal 1997 from 75% in fiscal
1996 and from 79% in fiscal 1995. The increase in gross margin percentage in
fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996 was due to the decrease in capitalized
software amortization and write-offs noted above. In addition, revenues, with no
related cost of revenues, from JetForm totaling $18 million and from
Hewlett-Packard totaling $1 million were included in net revenues during fiscal
1997. The decline in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 1996 compared to
fiscal 1995 was due to an increase in the amortization and write-off of
purchased product rights and capitalized software development expenses noted
above and increased inventory reserves related to Delrina products designed to
operate on Windows 3.1 and other products de-emphasized by Symantec during
fiscal 1996. Due to an anticipated reduction in software amortization and the
recognition of the potential future revenue streams from JetForm and
Hewlett-Packard, for which there will be no associated costs, Symantec believes
that the gross margin percentage may increase to approximately 81% to 84% in
fiscal 1998, unless there is a significant change in Symantec's net revenues.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.
Research and development expenses decreased 6% to $89 million or 19% of net
revenues in fiscal 1997 from $95 million or 21% of net revenues in fiscal 1996
and were $71 million or 17% of net revenues in fiscal 1995. The decrease in
research and development expenses in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal 1996 is
due primarily to decreased product development efforts associated with the
Company's decision to cease developing certain software products, and an
increase in capitalized software development costs. In fiscal 1997, Symantec
capitalized approximately $8 million of software development costs, primarily
related to network administration technology, which was subsequently sold to
Hewlett-Packard in March 1997 and resulted in the write off of approximately $7
million in unamortized costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997. In
addition, a $2 million research and development expense reimbursement was
received from Hewlett-Packard in fiscal 1997 under the aforementioned agreement,
which further reduced fiscal 1997 research and development expenses.

The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 1996 as compared to
fiscal 1995 was primarily the result of increased product development efforts
associated with Symantec's and Delrina's development of new products designed to
operate on the Windows 95 operating system.

Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred.
Prior to fiscal 1997, capitalization of certain software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 86 did not materially
affect the Company, except for amounts capitalized by Delrina prior to its
acquisition by Symantec in fiscal 1996. Delrina did not capitalize any software
development costs in fiscal 1996 and capitalized approximately $6 million in
software development costs in fiscal year 1995.



                                       15
<PAGE>   18
SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased 4% to $221 million or 47% of net revenues
in fiscal 1997 from $230 million or 52% of net revenues in fiscal 1996. The
decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal
1996 is due primarily to the elimination of duplicative sales and marketing
expenses as a result of the acquisition of Delrina by Symantec and the
elimination of sales and marketing expenses related to the electronic forms
software products which were sold to JetForm in September 1996. Reductions in
expenditures for products no longer actively marketed by Symantec were offset by
increased spending for new products released during the fiscal year.

Sales and marketing expenses increased to $230 million or 52% of net revenues in
fiscal 1996 from $190 million or 44% of net revenues in fiscal 1995, due to an
increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with the release of
Symantec's Windows 95 products.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.
In fiscal 1997, general and administrative expenses increased by 4% to $34
million or 7% of net revenues from $33 million or 7% of net revenues in fiscal
1996 and from $29 million or 7% of net revenues in fiscal 1995. The increase in
general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 1997 as
compared to fiscal 1996 is primarily the result of management consulting
expenditures, offset by benefits from the elimination of duplicative general and
administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of Delrina by Symantec in
fiscal 1996. The increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute
dollars in fiscal 1996 as compared to fiscal 1995 was principally due to
significant general and administrative expenses incurred by Delrina in the three
month period ended September 30, 1995 and certain legal fees incurred by
Delrina.

ACQUISITION, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSES.
Acquisition Expenses. In connection with the acquisitions completed in fiscal
1997, 1996 and 1995 (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), significant acquisition expenses
have been incurred. These acquisition expenses principally included fees for
legal, accounting and financial advisory services, the write-off of duplicative
capitalized technology, the modification of certain development contracts and
expenses related to the combination of the companies, including the elimination
of duplicative and excess facilities and personnel. These charges approximated
$1 million, $20 million and $10 million in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

Symantec recorded total acquisition charges of approximately $1 million in
fiscal 1997 in connection with the acquisition of Fast Track.

In connection with the acquisition of Delrina in fiscal 1996, Symantec recorded
total acquisition charges of $22 million, which included $9 million for legal,
accounting and financial advisory services, $6 million for the elimination of
duplicative and excess facilities and equipment, $4 million for personnel
severance and outplacement expenses and $3 million for the consolidation and
discontinuance of certain operational activities and other acquisition-related
expenses. Offsetting these costs was a reduction in accrued acquisition,
restructuring and other expenses of $2 million, as actual costs incurred related
to the acquisitions of Central Point and SLR were less than costs previously
accrued by the Company.

In connection with the acquisitions of Central Point and SLR, Symantec recorded
total acquisition charges of $10 million in fiscal 1995. The charges included $4
million for legal, accounting and financial advisory services, $1 million for
the write-off of duplicative product-related expenses and modification of
certain development contracts, $1 million for the elimination of duplicative and
excess facilities, $3 million for personnel severance and outplacement expenses
and $1 million for the consolidation and discontinuance of certain operational
activities and other acquisition-related expenses.

Restructuring Expenses. In fiscal 1997, the Company recorded a charge of $3
million for costs related to the restructuring of certain domestic and
international sales and research and development operations, settlement of the
Carmel lawsuit (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Part IV, Item 14 of this Form 10-K) and other expenses. The restructuring plans
have been completed.

In February 1995, Symantec announced a plan to consolidate certain research and
development activities. This plan was designed to gain greater synergy between
the Company's Third Generation Language and Fourth Generation 



                                       16
<PAGE>   19
Language development groups. During fiscal 1996, the Company completed the
consolidation and recorded $2 million for the relocation costs of moving
equipment and personnel.

Other Expenses. In fiscal 1997, Symantec recorded a $2 million charge in
connection with the write-off of an equity investment and a $3 million charge
for the write-off of certain in-process research and development acquired by the
Company.

In fiscal 1996, Symantec sold the assets of Time Line Solutions Corporation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, to a group comprised of Time Line Solutions
Corporation's management and incurred a $3 million loss on the sale. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company recorded $2 million for estimated
legal fees expected to be incurred in connection with a securities class action
complaint filed in March 1996 and other legal matters (See Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 14 of this Form 10-K).

As of March 31, 1997, total accrued cash related acquisition and restructuring
expenses were $4 million and included less than $1 million for estimated legal
fees and expenses, less than $1 million for the elimination of duplicative and
excess facilities and $3 million for other acquisition related expenses.

INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). Interest income
was $7 million, $8 million and $6 million in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Higher average cash balances during fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal
1996 were offset by lower interest rates on invested cash during the year.
Interest income increased 33% in fiscal 1996 over fiscal 1995 due to higher
average invested cash balances. Interest expense was $1 million, $2 million and
$2 million in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The April 1995
conversion of convertible subordinated debentures totaling $10 million, which
were originally issued in April 1993, for 833,333 shares of Symantec common
stock, resulted in a reduction in interest expense in fiscal 1997 from 1996 and
in fiscal 1996 from 1995. Other income (expense) is primarily comprised of
foreign currency exchange gains and losses from fluctuations in currency
exchange rates.

INCOME TAXES.
The effective income tax provision for fiscal 1997 was 14%, which compares to an
effective income tax benefit of 10% in fiscal 1996 and an effective tax
provision of 25% in fiscal 1995. The 1997 income tax provision of 14% is lower
than the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously
unbenefitted losses.

Realization of the $13 million of net deferred tax asset that is reflected in
the financial statements is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate
sufficient future U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S.
earnings. A valuation allowance of approximately $40 million was provided in the
financial statements. Approximately $22 million of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets is attributable to unbenefitted stock option deductions, the
benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized. Approximately $4
million of the valuation allowance represents net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards of various acquired companies that are limited by separate return
limitations and under the "change of ownership" rules of Internal Revenue Code
Section 382, and the remaining $14 million of the valuation allowance relates to
unbenefitted temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.

Symantec projects the effective tax rate to be 23% in fiscal 1998. This rate is
lower than the expected U. S. federal and state combined statutory rate of 40%
is due to a lower tax rate from the Company's Irish operation and the
utilization of previously unbenefitted losses. However, this projection is
subject to change due to fluctuations in and the geographic allocation of
earnings. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Risks
Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results.)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash, short-term investments and restricted investments increased $79 million to
$208 million at March 31, 1997 from $129 million at March 31, 1996. This
increase was largely due to cash provided from operating activities, net
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sales of common stock under
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and improved cash collections of trade
accounts receivable. Cash provided by operating activities was partially offset
by the reclassification of $47 million to restricted investments, a non-current
asset. The restricted investment balance relates to collateral requirements
under lease agreements entered into by Symantec during the current fiscal year.
Symantec is obligated under lease agreements for two existing office buildings,
one parcel of land and one office building under construction in Cupertino,
California to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in U.S. treasury notes
with maturities not to exceed three years. In accordance with the lease terms,
these 



                                       17
<PAGE>   20
funds would not be available to meet operating cash requirements. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $94 million and was comprised of the
Company's net income of $26 million and non-cash related expenses of $37 million
and a net decrease in assets and liabilities of $31 million.

Trade accounts receivable decreased $11 million from $59 million at March 31,
1996 to $48 million at March 31, 1997 primarily due to improved cash collections
during the year.

On April 29, 1997, the Board of Directors of Symantec authorized the repurchase
of up to 1,000,000 shares of Symantec common stock by June 13, 1997. The shares
will be used for employee stock purchase programs and option grants. As of June
13, 1997, management completed the repurchase of 500,000 shares at prices
ranging from $16.57 to $17.00 per share.

The Company has a $10 million line of credit that expires in March 1998. The
Company was in compliance with the debt covenants at March 31, 1997. At March
31, 1997, there were no borrowings outstanding under this line and there were
less than $1 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this
agreement. Future acquisitions by the Company may cause the Company to be in
violation of the line of credit covenants; however, the Company believes that if
the line of credit were canceled or amounts were not available under the line,
there would not be a material adverse impact on the financial results, liquidity
or capital resources of the Company.

Symantec is obligated under lease agreements for two existing office buildings,
one parcel of land and one office building under construction in Cupertino,
California to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in U.S. treasury notes
with maturities not to exceed three years. In accordance with the lease terms,
these funds would not be available to meet operating cash requirements.

If Symantec were to sustain significant losses, the Company could be required to
reduce operating expenses, which could result in product delays, reassessment of
acquisition opportunities, which could negatively impact the Company's growth
objectives, and/or pursue further financing options. The Company believes
existing cash and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund operations
for the next year. (See further discussion in Item 7: Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Risks -
Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results and Management of Expanding
Operations.)

BUSINESS RISKS
The preceding discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. There are several important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and
percentages and results anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained
in the following discussion.

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT RISKS. The Company participates in a
highly dynamic industry. Future technology or market changes may cause certain
of Symantec's products to become obsolete more quickly than expected and the
trend towards server-based applications in networks and over the Internet could
have a material adverse effect on sales of the Company's products. The impact of
the market's acceptance and adoption rate of Symantec's products may result in
reduced revenues, gross margins and net income, as well as significant increases
in the volatility of Symantec's stock price.

STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. The Company's earnings and stock price have been and may
continue to be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly
basis. Symantec has previously experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings
from levels expected by securities analysts, which has had an immediate and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock.
This may occur again in the future. Additionally, as a significant portion of
the Company's revenues often occur late in the quarter, the Company may not
learn of revenue shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result
in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the
Company's common stock.

PERSONAL COMPUTER AND HARDWARE GROWTH RATES. Fluctuations in customer spending
from software to hardware as the result of technological advancements in
hardware or price reductions of hardware have in the past and may in the future
result in reduced revenues which would have a material adverse effect on
operating results.

FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS. While Symantec's diverse product
line has tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net revenues, these
fluctuations have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future.
These fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors, including the
introduction of competitive products by new competitors, reduced demand for any
given product, seasonality in the retail software market, the market's



                                       18
<PAGE>   21
transition between operating systems, the impact of the Internet and general
economic conditions. These factors may cause significant fluctuations in net
revenues and, accordingly, operating results.

MANAGEMENT OF EXPANDING OPERATIONS. Symantec continually evaluates its product
and corporate strategy and has in the past and will in the future undertake
organizational changes and product and marketing strategy modifications which
are designed to maximize market penetration, maximize use of limited corporate
resources and develop new products and product channels. These organizational
changes increase the risk that objectives will not be met due to the allocation
of valuable resources to implement changes. Further, due to the uncertain nature
of any of these undertakings, there can be no assurance that these efforts will
be successful or that the Company will realize any benefit from these efforts.

Symantec has completed a number of acquisitions and may acquire other companies
in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including the
diversion of management's attention to assimilation of the operations and
personnel of the acquired companies in an efficient and timely manner, the
retention of key employees, the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate
image, the coordination of research and development and sales efforts and the
integration of the acquired products.

The Company has lost certain key employees of acquired companies, and, in some
cases, the assimilation of the operations of acquired companies took longer than
initially had been anticipated by the Company. In addition, because the
employees of acquired companies have frequently remained in their existing,
geographically diverse facilities, the Company has not realized certain
economies of scale that might otherwise have been achieved.

Symantec typically incurs significant expenses in connection with acquisitions,
which have a significant adverse impact on the Company's profitability and
financial resources. These expenses may have a significant adverse impact on the
Company's future profitability and financial resources.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS. A significant portion of Symantec's revenues, manufacturing
costs and marketing is transacted in foreign currencies. As a result, the
Company may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates, as well as increases in duty rates, exchange or price controls
or other restrictions on foreign currencies. The Company's international
operations are subject to certain risks common to international operations, such
as government regulations, import restrictions, currency fluctuations,
repatriation restrictions and, in certain jurisdictions, reduced protection for
the Company's copyrights and trademarks.

PRICE COMPETITION. Price competition is intense in the microcomputer business
software market and is expected to continue to increase and become even more
significant in the future, resulting in reduced profit margins. Should
competitive pressures in the industry continue to increase, Symantec may be
required to reduce software prices and/or increase its spending on sales,
marketing and research and development as a percentage of net revenues,
resulting in lower profit margins. There can be no assurance these changes will
be successful.

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. Approximately 34% of the Company's net revenues in fiscal
1997 were from sales to two large retail distributors. These customers tend to
make the majority of their purchases at the end of the fiscal quarter, in part
because they are able, or believe that they are able, to negotiate lower prices
and more favorable terms. This end-of-period buying pattern means that forecasts
of quarterly and annual financial results are particularly vulnerable to the
risk that they will not be achieved, either because expected sales do not occur
or because they occur at lower prices or on less favorable terms to the Company.
The Company's retail distribution customers also carry the products of
Symantec's competitors. The distributors have limited capital to invest in
inventory, and their decisions to purchase the Company's products is partly a
function of pricing, terms and special promotions offered by Symantec as well as
by its competitors over which the Company has no control and which it cannot
predict.

Agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by
either party without cause. Such distributors are not within the control of
Symantec, are not obligated to purchase products and may also represent
competitors' product lines. There can be no assurance that these distributors
will continue their current relationships with Symantec on the same basis, or
that they will not give higher priority to the sale of other products, which
could include products of competitors. Additionally, certain distributors and
resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past. There can be no
assurance that distributors that account for significant sales of the Company
will not experience financial difficulties in the future. Any such problems
could lead to reduced sales and could adversely affect 


                                       19
<PAGE>   22
operating results of the Company. There can be no assurance that Symantec will
be able to continue to obtain adequate distribution channels for all of its
products in the future.

Due to the rapid change in software distribution technology as demonstrated by
the increase in volume of software distributed through the Internet, there can
be no assurance that Symantec will be able to develop an effective method of
distributing its software products utilizing each of the available distribution
channels or that Symantec will develop distribution channels for those channels
which are ultimately accepted by the marketplace. The presence of new channels
could adversely impact existing channels and/or product pricing, which could
have a material adverse impact on the Company's net revenues and profitability.

The Company operates with relatively little backlog; therefore, if near-term
demand for the Company's products weakens in a given quarter, there could be an
immediate, material adverse effect on net revenues and on the Company's
operating results, which would likely result in a precipitous drop in stock
price.

CHANNEL FILL. The Company's pattern of revenues and earnings may be affected by
"channel fill." Channel fill occurs following the introduction of a new product
as distributors buy significant quantities of the new product in anticipation of
sales of such product. Software upgrades typically result in an increase in net
revenues during the first three to six months following their introduction due
to purchases by existing users, usually at discounted prices, and initial
inventory purchases by Symantec's distributors. Following such purchases, the
rate of distributors' purchases often declines in a material amount, depending
on the rates of purchases by end users or "sell-through." As the desktop
applications market has become more saturated, the sales mix is shifting from
standard retail products to lower priced product upgrades. This trend is likely
to continue.

Channel fill may also occur in anticipation of price increases or in response to
sales promotions or incentives, some of which may be designed to encourage
customers to accelerate purchases that might otherwise occur in later periods.
Channels may also become filled simply because the distributors do not sell
their inventories to retail distribution or end users as anticipated. If
sell-through does not occur at a sufficient rate, distributors will delay
purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases in order
to reduce their inventories. Such order delays or cancellations can cause
material fluctuations in revenues from one quarter to the next. The impact is
somewhat mitigated by the Company's deferral of revenue associated with
inventories estimated to be in excess of appropriate levels in the distribution
channel; however, net revenues may still be materially affected favorably or
adversely by the effects of channel fill.

Between the date Symantec announces a new version or new product and the date of
release, distributors, dealers and end users often delay purchases, cancel
orders or return products in anticipation of the availability of the new version
or new product.

Channel fill did not have a material impact on the Company's revenues in fiscal
1997, 1996 or 1995 but may have a material impact in future periods,
particularly in periods where a large number of new products are simultaneously
introduced.

PRODUCT RETURNS. The Company estimates and maintains reserves for product
returns. Product returns can occur when the Company introduces upgrades and new
versions of products or when distributors have excess inventories. Symantec's
return policy allows its distributors, subject to certain limitations, to return
purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future
purchases. End users may return products through dealers and distributors within
a reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full refund, and retailers
may return older versions of products. Symantec prepares detailed analyses of
historical return rates, as well as taking into consideration upcoming product
upgrades, current market conditions, customer inventory balances and any other
known factors when estimating anticipated returns and maintains reserves for
product returns. Symantec has experienced, and may experience in the future,
significant increases in product returns above historical levels from customers
of acquired companies after an acquisition is completed. The impact of actual
returns on net revenues, net of such provisions, has not had a material effect
on the Company's liquidity as the returns typically result in the issuance of
credit towards future purchases as opposed to cash payments to the distributors.
However, there can be no assurance that future returns will not exceed the
reserves established by the Company or that future returns will not have
material adverse effect on the operating results of the Company.

UNCERTAINTY OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. Symantec believes research and
development expenditures will be necessary in order to remain competitive. While
the Company believes its research and development 



                                       20
<PAGE>   23
expenditures will result in successful product introductions, due to the
uncertainty of software development projects, these expenditures will not
necessarily result in successful product introductions. Uncertainties impacting
the success of software development project introductions include technical
difficulties, market conditions, competitive products and customer acceptance of
new products and operating systems.

The length of Symantec's product development cycle has generally been greater
than Symantec originally expected. Although such delays have undoubtedly had a
material adverse effect on Symantec's business, Symantec is not able to quantify
the magnitude of net revenues that were deferred or lost as a result of any
particular delay because Symantec is not able to predict the amount of net
revenues that would have been obtained had the original development expectations
been met. Delays in future product development are likely to occur and could
have a material adverse effect on the amount and timing of future revenues. Due
to the inherent uncertainties of software development projects, Symantec does
not generally disclose or announce the specific expected shipment date of the
Company's product introductions. While the Company performs extensive usability
and beta testing of new products, there can be no assurance that any products
currently being developed by Symantec will be technologically successful, that
any resulting products will achieve market acceptance or that the Company's
products will be effective in competing with products either currently in the
market or introduced in the future.

OPERATING SYSTEM. The release and subsequent customer acceptance of current or
enhanced operating systems are particularly important events that increase the
uncertainty and increase the volatility of Symantec's results.

Microsoft has incorporated advanced utilities including telecommunications,
facsimile and data recovery utilities in Windows 95 and may include additional
product features in future releases of Windows 95 and Window NT that may
decrease the demand for certain of the Company's products, including those
currently under development.

Should the Company be unable to successfully or timely develop products that
operate under existing or new operating systems, the Company's future net
revenues and operating results would be immediately and significantly adversely
affected. In addition, as the timing of delivery and adoption of many of
Symantec's products is dependent on the adoption rate of these operating
systems, which the Company and securities analysts are unable to predict, the
ability of Symantec and securities analysts to forecast the Company's net
revenues has been and will continue to be adversely impacted. As a result, there
is a heightened risk that net revenues and profits will not be in line with
analysts' expectations in the periods following the introduction of existing or
new operating systems.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Symantec regards its software as proprietary and
relies on a combination of copyright, patent and trademark laws and license
agreements in an attempt to protect its rights. Despite these precautions, it
may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of Symantec's
products or to obtain and use information that Symantec regards as proprietary.
All of Symantec's products are protected by copyright, and Symantec has several
patents and patent applications pending. However, existing patent and copyright
laws afford limited practical protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign
countries do not protect Symantec's proprietary rights in its products to the
same extent as do the laws of the United States. Symantec's products are not
copy protected.

As the number of software products in the industry increases and the
functionality of these products further overlap, Symantec believes that software
developers will become increasingly subject to infringement claims. This risk is
potentially greater for companies, such as Symantec, that obtain certain of
their products through publishing agreements or acquisitions, since they have
less direct control over the development of those products.

In addition, an increasing number of patents are being issued that are
potentially applicable to software, and allegations of patent infringement are
becoming increasingly common in the software industry. It is impossible to
ascertain all possible patent infringement claims because new patents are being
issued continually, the subject of patent applications is confidential until a
patent is issued, and it may not be apparent even from a patent that has already
been issued whether it is potentially applicable to a particular software
product. This increases the risk that Symantec's products may be subject to
claims of patent infringement. Although such claims may ultimately prove to be
without merit, they are time consuming and expensive to defend. Symantec has
been involved in disputes claiming patent infringement in the past, is currently
involved in such disputes and litigation and may be involved in such disputes
and/or litigation in the future. If Symantec is alleged to infringe one or more
patents, it may choose to litigate the claim and/or seek an appropriate license.
If litigation were to commence and a license were not available 


                                       21
<PAGE>   24
on reasonable terms or if another party were found to have a valid patent claim
against Symantec, it could have a material adverse effect on Symantec (See Note
11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

LITIGATION. Symantec is involved in a number of other judicial and
administrative proceedings incidental to its business (See Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company intends to defend and/or pursue
all of these lawsuits vigorously and, although an unfavorable outcome could
occur in one or more of the cases, the final resolution of these lawsuits,
individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial position of the Company. However, depending on the
amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible
that the Company's future results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely effected in a particular period.

SALES AND MARKETING AND SUPPORT INVESTMENTS. Symantec believes substantial sales
and marketing efforts are essential to achieve revenue growth and to maintain
and enhance Symantec's competitive position. There can be no assurance that
these increased sales and marketing efforts will be successful.

BUSINESS DISRUPTION. Much of the Company's administration, sales and marketing,
manufacturing and research and development facilities are located on the west
coast of the United States. Future earthquakes or other natural disasters could
cause a significant disruption to the Company's operations and may cause delays
in product development that could adversely impact future revenues of the
Company.

Order entry and product shipping are geographically separated both domestically
and internationally. A disruption in communications between these facilities,
particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter, would likely result in an
unexpected shortfall in net revenues and could result in an adverse impact on
operating results.

SUPPLY RISK. Symantec has often been able to acquire materials on a
volume-discount basis and has had multiple sources of supply for certain
materials. To date, Symantec has not experienced any material difficulties or
delays in production of its software and related documentation and packaging.
However, shortages may occur in the future. For example, shortages of certain
materials may occur when Microsoft introduces new operating systems.

EMPLOYEE RISK. Competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is
intense. Symantec believes that its future success will depend in part on its
ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and technical
personnel. Symantec believes that it must provide personnel with a competitive
compensation package, which necessitates the continued availability of stock
options and requires ongoing shareholder approval of such option programs.

ITEM 10:    DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT.

Information required by this Item with respect to Directors may be found in the
section captioned "Election of Symantec Directors" appearing in the definitive
Proxy Statement to be delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders to be held on September 18, 1997 (the "Proxy
Statement"). Such information is incorporated herein by reference. Information
required by this Item with respect to compliance with Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may be found in the section
captioned "Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance" appearing in
the Proxy Statement.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Symantec Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Symantec
Corporation as of March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 1997. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and schedule based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements or schedule of Delrina Corporation, which statements reflect net
income constituting 14% of the related 1995 consolidated financial statement
totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to data included for
Delrina Corporation, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Symantec Corporation at March 31, 1997
and 1996, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, based upon our
audits and the report of other auditors, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

Auditors' Report


To the Shareholders of Delrina Corporation

We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Delrina Corporation as at June
30, 1995 and the consolidated statements of operations, retained earnings
(deficit) and changes in financial position for the years ended June 30, 1995
and 1994, all expressed in Canadian dollars. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable
assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.

In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Delrina Corporation as at June 30,
1995 and the results of its operations and the changes in its financial position
for the years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994 in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in Canada.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


Business
Symantec Corporation ("Symantec" or the "Company") develops, markets and
supports a diversified line of application and system software products designed
to enhance individual and workgroup productivity. Symantec's products,
comprising both application software and system software, are currently
organized into the following three major product groups: Remote Productivity
Solutions, Security and Assistance and Emerging Businesses and Other. Customers
consist primarily of corporations, higher education institutions, government
agencies and individual users, which are mainly located in North America, Europe
and Asia/Pacific.

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Symantec Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Symantec" or the
"Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.

Basis of Presentation
During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, Symantec acquired various companies in
transactions accounted for as poolings of interest. Accordingly, all financial
information has been restated to reflect the combined operations of Symantec and
the acquired companies with the exception of Intec Systems Corporation
("Intec"), SLR Systems, Inc. ("SLR") and Fast Track, Inc. ("Fast Track"). The
results of operations of Intec, SLR and Fast Track were not material to
Symantec's consolidated financial statements, and therefore, amounts prior to
the year of acquisition were not combined with Symantec's financial statements.

Symantec has a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as
of and for the periods ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended March 28, 1997, March 29, 1996 and March 31, 1995,
respectively. The fiscal year ending on April 3, 1998 will be comprised of a 53
week period.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. Non-current assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet dates. The
cumulative translation adjustments resulting from this process are shown
separately as a component of stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are
translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net
income (loss).

Revenue Recognition
Symantec recognizes revenue upon shipment when no significant vendor obligations
remain and collection of the receivable, net of provisions for estimated future
returns, is probable. Symantec offers the right of return of its products under
various policies. The Company estimates and maintains reserves for product
returns. Based on returns experienced, the Company's estimates have been
materially accurate.

During fiscal 1997, Symantec sold certain software products and related tangible
assets to JetForm Corporation ("JetForm") and to the Hewlett-Packard Company
("Hewlett-Packard") (see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate collectibility of certain
contractual installment payments from JetForm, Symantec is recognizing the
related revenue as payments are due and collectibility is assured. Due to the
uncertainty regarding the amounts upon which the related Hewlett-Packard
payments are determined, Symantec is recognizing these amounts as revenue as
they are determinable.

Revenues related to significant post-contract support agreements (generally
product maintenance agreements) are deferred and recognized over the period of
the agreements. The estimated cost of providing insignificant post-contract
support (generally telephone support) is accrued at the time of the sale and is
included in sales and marketing expense. Technical support costs included in
sales and marketing expense were $35.1 million, $34.5 million and $28.0 million
in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED


Symantec recognized approximately $3.0 million of North American net revenues in
the March 1995 quarter and $7.2 million of international net revenues in the
June 1995 quarter that had been previously deferred by Central Point in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.48.

Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Investments 
Symantec considers investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an
original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. All of the
Company's cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted investments,
consisting principally of commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. treasury notes
and certificates of deposit, are classified as available-for-sale as of the
balance sheet date. These securities are reported at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value, and therefore, there are no unrealized gains and losses
included in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in
value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in interest income. The
cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally
determined using currently adjusted standards, which approximate actual cost on
a first-in, first-out basis.

Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally the shorter of the lease term or three to seven years.

Capitalized Software
Purchased product rights are comprised of acquired software ("product rights")
and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided
on the greater of the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets, generally three to five years, or on the basis of the ratio
of current revenues to current revenues plus anticipated future revenues. In
fiscal 1997, Symantec wrote off approximately $0.6 million of unamortized
purchased product rights related to its network administration technology, as a
result of the sale of this business unit to Hewlett-Packard in March 1997.

In fiscal 1997, Symantec capitalized approximately $7.7 million of capitalized
software development costs, primarily related to network administration
technology, which was sold to Hewlett-Packard in March 1997, resulting in the
write off of approximately $7.0 million of unamortized costs during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1997 (See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Amortization expense for capitalized software development costs
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 totaled approximately $0.3 million.

Prior to fiscal 1997, capitalization of certain software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 did not
materially affect the Company, except for amounts capitalized by Delrina prior
to its acquisition by Symantec in fiscal 1996. Delrina did not capitalize any
software development costs in fiscal 1996 and capitalized approximately $6.3
million in software development costs in fiscal year 1995, which were
substantially written off in fiscal 1996 as the result of the de-emphasis of
Delrina Windows 3.1 and certain other products. The related amortization expense
was approximately $5.6 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Net Income (Loss) Per Share
Net income (loss) per share is calculated using the treasury stock or the
modified treasury stock method, as applicable, if dilutive. Common stock
equivalents are attributable to outstanding stock options. Fully diluted
earnings per share includes the assumed conversion of all of the outstanding
convertible subordinated debentures.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company's product revenues are concentrated in the personal computer
software industry, which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant
technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or 


                                       40

the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies,
could adversely affect operating results. In addition, a significant portion of
the Company's revenue and net income is derived from international sales and
independent agents and distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against
foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic conditions, piracy
or nonperformance by independent agents or distributors could adversely affect
operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of short-term investments, restricted
investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company's investment portfolio is
diversified and consists of investment grade A-1/P-1 securities. The Company is
exposed to credit risks in the event of default by these institutions to the
extent of the amount recorded on the balance sheet. The credit risk in the
Company's trade accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by the Company's
credit evaluation process, reasonably short collection terms and the
geographical dispersion of sales transactions. The Company generally does not
require collateral and maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and such
losses have been within management's expectations.

Advertising
Advertising expenditures are charged to operations as incurred except for
certain direct mail campaigns which are deferred and amortized over the expected
period of benefit or twelve months, whichever is shorter. Deferred advertising
costs have not been material in all periods presented. Advertising expense for
fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995 was approximately $39.1 million, $43.0 million and
$41.0 million, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of,"
applicable for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1996, did not have a material
effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

Common Stock Repurchase
On April 29, 1997, the Board of Directors of Symantec authorized the repurchase
of up to 1,000,000 shares of Symantec common stock by June 13, 1997. The shares
will be used for employee stock purchase programs and option grants. As of June
13, 1997, management completed the repurchase of 500,000 shares at prices
ranging from $16.57 to $17.00 per share.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 1997, the Finance Accounting Standards Board issued Statement (SFAS)
No. 128, "Earnings per Share", which is required to be adopted on December 31,
1997. At that time, the Company will be required to change the method currently
used to compute earnings per share and to restate all prior periods. The
application of the SFAS 128 new "basic earnings per share" calculation results
in basic earnings per share of $0.48 for the year ended March 31, 1997, basic
loss per share of $0.76 for the year ended March 31, 1996 and basic earnings per
share of $0.68 for the year ended March 31, 1995. The Company does not expect
the new diluted calculation to be materially different to fully diluted earnings
per share.

Reclassifications
Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation format. During fiscal 1997, certain deferred revenue
amounts which were previously classified as accrued liabilities have been
reclassified to accounts receivable. The reclassification amounted to
approximately $19.0 million, $13.0 million, and $3.0 million in fiscal 1997,
1996, and 1995, respectively. All financial information has been restated to
conform to this presentation

NOTE 2.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND PURCHASED PRODUCT RIGHTS

During the three fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, Symantec completed
acquisitions of the following companies:

* Includes Delrina exchangeable stock that is traded on the Toronto Stock
  Exchange. Delrina stockholders received Delrina exchangeable stock in exchange
  for Delrina common shares at a rate of 0.61 per share. Delrina exchangeable
  stock may be converted at any time into Symantec common stock on a one-for-one
  basis at each stockholder's option.

All of these acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interest. In
connection with the acquisitions of the companies listed above, Symantec
incurred significant acquisition expenses (See Note 10). Due to differing year
ends of Symantec and Delrina, financial information for dissimilar fiscal year
ends was combined. Delrina's fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 was combined with
Symantec's fiscal year ended March 31, 1995. Accordingly, Delrina's results of
operations for the quarter ended June 30, 1995 were duplicated in the combined
statements of operations for fiscal 1996 and 1995 and Delrina's net loss for the
quarter ended June 30, 1995 was credited to stockholder's equity. Delrina
reported net revenues of $19.8 million and net loss of $4.8 million in the
quarter ended June 30, 1995. The results of operations of Fast Track were not
material to Symantec's consolidated financial statements, and therefore, amounts
prior to the date of acquisition were not restated to reflect the combined
operations of the companies.


NOTE 3.  CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

All cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted investments have
been classified as available-for-sale securities. As of March 31, 1997 and 1996,
the estimated fair value of the cash equivalents and short-term investments
consisted of the following:

All of the Company's available-for-sale cash equivalent and short-term
investment securities as of March 31, 1997 and 1996 have a contractual maturity
of less than one year. As of March 31, 1997 and 1996, the estimated fair value
of the restricted investments consisted of the following:

                                               =======     =======
</TABLE>

The Company's available-for-sale restricted investments relate to certain
collateral requirements for lease agreements associated with the Symantec's
corporate Cupertino, California facilities and have maturities of three years or
less (See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Fair values of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted
investments approximate cost due to the nature of the investments and/or their
short period to maturity.

During the period covered by the financial statements, the Company has not used
any derivative instrument for trading purposes. Symantec utilizes some natural
hedging to mitigate the Company's transaction exposures and hedges some residual
transaction exposures through the use of one-month foreign exchange forward
contracts. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with
financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks
associated with certain firmly committed transactions. Fair value of foreign
exchange forward contracts are based on quoted market prices. At March 31, 1997,
there was a total notional amount of approximately $46.3 million of outstanding
foreign exchange forward contracts all of which mature in 35 days or less. The
net liability of forward contracts was a notional amount of approximately $45.8
million at March 31, 1997. The fair value of foreign currency exchange forward
contracts approximates cost due to the short maturity periods and the minimal
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not hedge its
translation risk.


NOTE 4.  CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

On April 2, 1993, the Company issued convertible subordinated debentures
totaling $25.0 million. The debentures bear interest at 7.75% payable
semiannually and are convertible into Symantec common stock at $12 per share at
the option of the investor. The debentures are due in three equal annual
installments beginning in 1999 and are redeemable at the option of the investors
in the event of a change in control of Symantec or the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company. Symantec, at its option, may
redeem the notes at any time on 30 to 60 days notice; however, the Company could
incur a prepayment penalty for early redemption. The holders are entitled to
certain registration rights relating to the shares of common stock resulting
from the conversion of the debentures. The Company reserved 2,083,333 shares of
common stock to be issued upon conversion of these debentures. The debentures
limit the payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of capital stock to a
total of $10.0 million plus 25% of cumulative net income subsequent to April 2,
1993.

On April 26, 1995, convertible subordinated debentures totaling $10.0 million
were converted into 833,333 shares of Symantec common stock, leaving 1,250,000
shares of common stock reserved for future conversion as of March 31, 1997.

The estimated fair value of the $15.0 million convertible subordinated
debentures was approximately $17.9 million at March 31, 1997. The estimated fair
value was based on the total shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon
conversion of the debentures at the closing price of the Company's common stock
at March 31, 1997, which exceeded the conversion price of $12 per share, plus
accrued interest.

NOTE 5.  LINE OF CREDIT

The Company has a $10.0 million bank line of credit that expires in March 1998.
The line of credit is available for general corporate purposes and bears
interest at the banks' reference (prime) interest rate (8.50% at March 31,
1997), the U.S. offshore rate plus 1.25%, a CD rate plus 1.25% or London
Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.25%, at the Company's discretion. The
line of credit requires bank approval for the payment of cash dividends.
Borrowings under this line are unsecured and are subject to the Company
maintaining certain financial ratios and profits. The Company was in compliance
with the line of credit covenants as of March 31, 1997. At March 31, 1997, there
was approximately $0.3 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under
this line of credit. There were no borrowings outstanding under this line at
March 31, 1997.


NOTE 6.  COMMITMENTS

Symantec leases all of its facilities and certain equipment under operating
leases that expire at various dates through 2026. The Company currently
subleases some space under various operating leases which will expire at various
dates through 2000.

The future fiscal year minimum operating lease commitments were as follows at
March 31, 1997:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED



In fiscal 1997, Symantec entered into lease agreements for two existing office
buildings, land and one office building under construction in Cupertino,
California. The lease agreements are for seven years and the lease payments per
year total approximately $1.0 million in fiscal 1997, $4.1 million in fiscal
1998 and $4.8 million in fiscal years 1999 through 2004. Lease payments are
based on the three month LIBOR in effect at the beginning of each fiscal
quarter. Symantec has the right to acquire the related properties at any time
during the seven year lease period. If at the end of the lease term Symantec
does not renew the lease, purchase the property under lease or arrange a third
party purchase, then the Company will be obligated to the lessor for a
guaranteed residual amount equal to a specified percentage of the Company's
purchase price of the property. Symantec would also be obligated to the lessor
for all or some portion of this amount if the price paid by the third party is
below the guaranteed residual amount. The guaranteed residual payment on the
lease agreements for the two existing office buildings totals approximately
$38.4 million. The guaranteed residual payment on the lease agreements for the
land and office building under construction was approximately $7.0 million at
March 31, 1997 and will increase to approximately $31.7 million at the
completion of the construction during fiscal year 1999. As security against this
guaranteed residual payment, Symantec is required to maintain a corresponding
investment in U.S. Treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three
years. Symantec is restricted in its use of these investments per the terms of
the lease agreement. The investments total approximately $47.4 million and are
classified as non-current restricted investments within the financial
statements.


The Company currently occupies a portion of these office buildings and has
assumed the right to sub-lease income provided by the other tenants. The
sub-lease agreements have terms expiring in April 1997 through September 2000.

Realization of the $12.8 million of net deferred tax asset that is reflected in
the financial statements is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate
sufficient future U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S.
earnings.

Approximately $22.3 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
is attributable to unbenefitted stock option deductions, the benefit of which
will be credited to equity when realized. Approximately $4.3 million of the
valuation allowance represents net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
of various acquired companies that are limited by separate return limitations
and under the "change of ownership" rules of Internal Revenue Code Section 382
and the remaining $13.7 million of the valuation allowance relates to
unbenefitted temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance for the years ended March
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were a net decrease of $5.4 million and net increases of
$14.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

Pretax income (loss) from international operations was approximately $24.9
million, $(4.1) million and $25.9 million for the years ended March 31, 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively.

At March 31, 1997, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$9.2 million that expire in fiscal 1998 through 2011 and net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $19.3 million that expire in fiscal 1999 through
2012.


NOTE 8.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

401(k) Plan
Symantec maintains a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of its domestic
employees. The plan allows employees to contribute up to 15% of their pretax
salary up to the maximum dollar limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Code. Symantec matches 100% of the first $500 of employees' contributions and
then 50% of the employee's contribution up to 6% of the employees' eligible
compensation. Company contributions under the plan were $2.0 million, $1.5
million and $1.2 million for the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In October 1989, the Company established the 1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP"). Subject to certain limitations, Company employees may purchase,
through payroll deductions of 2 to 10% of compensation, shares of common stock
at a price per share that is the lesser of 85% of the fair market value as of
the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period. On
September 25, 1996, stockholders approved an amendment to the ESPP which
included increasing by 1.4 million to 3.4 million the number of shares reserved
for issuance under the ESPP. As of March 31, 1997, approximately 1.9 million
shares had been issued and 1.5 million shares remain to be issued under the
ESPP.

Stock Option Plans
The Company maintains stock option plans pursuant to which an aggregate total of
approximately 17.4 million shares of Common stock have been reserved for
issuance as incentive and nonqualified stock options to employees, officers,
directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors to the Company (or
of any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company as the Board of Directors
or committee may determine). The purpose of these plans are to attract, retain
and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are
important to the success of the Company by offering them an opportunity to
participate in the Company's future performance through awards of stock options
and stock bonuses. Under the terms of these plans, the option exercise price may
not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant, the options
have a maximum term of ten years and generally vest over a four-year period.

On May 14, 1996, Symantec stockholders approved the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan
(the "96 Plan") which superseded the 1988 Option Plan (the "88 Plan") and made
available approximately 2.7 million shares. On September 25, 1996, stockholders
approved an amendment to the 96 Plan to make available for issuance up to
approximately 1.3 million additional shares representing the number of options
previously granted pursuant to the 88 Plan that had expired, were canceled or
were unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in full.

Stock option and warrant activity was as follows:

These options will expire if not exercised at specific dates ranging from April
1997 to March 2007. Prices for options exercised during the three-year period
ended March 31, 1997 ranged from $0.05 to $24.00.

Stock Award Plan
During fiscal 1996, the Company registered 400,000 shares to be issued under the
terms of the 1994 Patent Incentive Plan (the "94 Patent Plan"). The purpose of
this plan is to increase awareness of the importance of patents to the Company's
business and to provide employees with incentives to pursue patent protection
for new technologies that may be valuable to the Company. The Company's
executive officers are not eligible for awards under the 1994 Patent Incentive
Plan. As of March 31, 1997, approximately 9,000 shares had been issued under
this plan.

Pro Forma Information
The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees," in accounting for its employee stock options because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires the use of option
valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock
options. Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of the Company's employee
stock options generally equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized in the Company's financial
statements.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be determined as if the Company
had accounted for its employee stock options (including shares issued under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, collectively called "options") granted subsequent
to March 31,

1995 under the fair value method of that statement. The fair value of options
granted in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 reported below has been estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model assuming no expected
dividends and the following weighted average assumptions:

During March 1996, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to offer to
each employee with stock options having an exercise price greater than $13.10
(the "Old Options") the opportunity to cancel the affected grants and receive a
new grant for the same number of shares dated March 4, 1996 (the "New Options").
On the date of grant, the New Options have an exercise price equal to $13.10 and
a stock price of $12.63. Under the terms of this stock option cancellation and
regrant, all options began vesting as of the new grant date and no portion of
any regranted options were exercisable until March 4, 1997. Options representing
a total of approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock were canceled and
regranted. The weighted average fair value of these New Options was $14.79. The
President and Chief Executive Officer, the then Executive Vice President,
Worldwide Operations and Chief Financial Officer, the majority of the then
members of the Executive Staff, and all members of the Board of Directors
elected to exclude themselves from this stock option cancellation and regrant.

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company's options have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of management, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair
value of its options.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options for fiscal
year 1997 and 1996 were $7.81 and $10.44 per share, respectively. The
weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock purchase rights granted
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal year 1997 and 1996 were
$7.74 and $18.94, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period (for employee stock
options) and the six-month purchase period (for stock purchases under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan). The Company's pro forma information is as
follows:

The effects on pro forma disclosures of applying SFAS No. 123 are not likely to
be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures of future years.
Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to March 31,
1995, its pro forma effect will not be fully reflected until approximately
fiscal 2000.


NOTE 9.  SALE OF PRODUCT RIGHTS

During September 1996, Symantec sold its electronic forms software products and
related tangible assets to JetForm for approximately $100.0 million, payable
over four years in quarterly installments through the June 2000 quarter. JetForm
has the option to tender payment in either cash or in registered JetForm common
stock, within a contractually defined quantity threshold. Due to the uncertainty
regarding the ultimate collectibility of these installments, Symantec is
recognizing the related revenue as payments are due and collectibility is
assured from JetForm. Symantec recognized revenue of approximately $18.3 million
from JetForm during fiscal 1997.

In March 1997, Symantec also sold the software products and related tangible
assets of its Networking Business Unit to Hewlett-Packard, resulting in the
receipt of approximately $1.0 million of revenue and a $2.0 million research and
development reimbursement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997. Additionally, a
two year quarterly royalty payment stream not to exceed a present value of $27.0
million as of the date of the transaction date will commence beginning in fiscal
1998, which is solely contingent on future sales of certain Hewlett-Packard
products. Due to the uncertainty regarding the amounts upon which these
royalties will be determined, Symantec is recognizing these amounts as they are
estimable. In association with this sale to Hewlett-Packard, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1997, Symantec wrote off approximately $7.0 million of
unamortized software development costs and approximately $0.6 million of
unamortized purchased product rights, as well as incurring approximately $2.0
million of legal, accounting and other costs associated with the transaction.

During fiscal 1997, Symantec recorded a $1.8 million charge in connection with
the write-off of an equity investment in a privately held company and a $3.1
million charge for the write off of certain in-process research and development
costs acquired by the Company. Additionally, during fiscal 1997, the Company
recorded a charge of $3.2 million, which included $2.4 million for personnel
severence and outplacement charges, for costs related to the restructuring of
certain domestic and international sales and research and development
operations, settlement of the Carmel lawsuit (See Note 11 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) and other expenses. The restructuring plans
were substantially completed during fiscal 1997. Symantec recorded total
acquisition charges of $0.6 million in the quarter ended June 30, 1996 in
connection with the acquisition of Fast Track, Inc.

In connection with the acquisition of Delrina (See Note 2 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) in fiscal 1996, Symantec recorded total
acquisition charges of $22.0 million, which included $8.8 million for legal,
accounting and financial advisory services, $6.4 million for the elimination of
duplicative and excess facilities and equipment, $3.7 million for personnel
severance and outplacement expenses and $3.1 million for the consolidation and
discontinuance of certain operational activities and other acquisition-related
expenses.

In November 1995, Symantec sold the assets of Time Line Solutions Corporation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, to a group comprised of Time Line Solution
Corporation's management and incurred a $2.7 million loss on the sale.

During fiscal 1996, Symantec also expensed $1.0 million, which included a loss
on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of a subsidiary and other
expenses.

In February 1995, Symantec announced a plan to consolidate certain research and
development activities. This plan was designed to gain greater synergy between
the Company's Third Generation Language and Fourth Generation Language
development groups. During fiscal 1996, the Company incurred $2.2 million for
the relocation costs of moving equipment and personnel.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company recorded $2.0 million for
estimated legal fees expected to be incurred in connection with a securities
class action complaint filed in March 1996 and other legal expenses (See Note 11
to Consolidated Financial Statements).

In connection with the acquisitions of Central Point and SLR (See Note 2 to
Consolidated Financial Statements), Symantec recorded total acquisition charges
of $9.5 million in fiscal 1995. The charges included $3.2 million for legal,
accounting and financial advisory services, $1.0 million for the write-off of
duplicative product-related expenses and modification of certain development
contracts, $0.9 million for the elimination of duplicative and excess
facilities, $3.1 million for personnel severance and outplacement expenses and
$1.3 million for the consolidation and discontinuance of certain operational
activities and other acquisition related expenses. During fiscal 1996, the
Company recognized a reduction in accrued acquisition, restructuring and other
expenses of $2.3 million as actual costs incurred were less than costs
previously accrued by the Company.

As of March 31, 1997, total accrued cash related acquisition and restructuring
expenses were $3.8 million and included $0.2 million for estimated legal fees
and expenses, $0.4 million for the elimination of duplicative and excess
facilities and $3.2 million for other acquisition related expenses.


NOTE 11.  LITIGATION

On March 18, 1996, a class action complaint was filed by the law firm of
Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach in Superior Court of the State of
California, County of Santa Clara, against the Company and several of its
current and former officers and directors. The complaint alleges that Symantec
insiders inflated the stock price and then sold stock based on inside
information that sales were not going to meet analysts' expectations. The
complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The complaint has been refiled
twice in state court, most recently on January 10, 1997, to reflect changes
brought about by Symantec's demurrer to previous complaints. The same plaintiffs
have further filed, on January 7, 1997, a complaint in federal court based on
the same facts as the state court complaint, for violation of the Securities Act
of 1934. Symantec believes that neither the state court complaint nor the
federal court complaint has any merit and will vigorously defend itself against
both complaints. The Company has accrued certain estimated legal fees and
expenses related to this matter; however, actual amounts may differ materially
from those estimated amounts.

On September 3, 1992, Borland International, Inc. ("Borland") filed a lawsuit in
the Superior Court for Santa Cruz County, California against Symantec, Gordon E.
Eubanks, Jr. (Symantec's President and Chief Executive Officer) and Eugene Wang
(a former Executive Vice President of Symantec and former employee of Borland).
The complaint, as amended, alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair
competition, including breach of contract, interference with prospective
economic advantage and unjust enrichment. Under a confidential joint settlement
agreement entered into as of February 25, 1997, this case was fully settled.

On June 11, 1992, Dynamic Microprocessor Associates, Inc. ("DMA"), a former
wholly-owned subsidiary of Symantec which has since been merged into Symantec,
commenced an action against EKD Computer Sales & Supplies Corporation ("EKD"), a
former licensee of DMA and Thomas Green, a principal of EKD, for copyright
infringement, violations of the Lanham Act, trademark infringement,
misappropriation, deceptive acts and practices, unfair competition and breach of
contract. On July 14, 1992, the Suffolk County, New York sheriff's department
conducted a search of EKD's premises and seized and impounded thousands of
infringing articles. On July 21, 1992, the Court issued a preliminary injunction
against EKD and Mr. Green, enjoining them from manufacturing, marketing,
distributing, copying or purporting to license DMA's pcANYWHERE III or using
DMA's marks. On March 18, 1997, the Magistrate assigned to the action issued a
non-binding Report and Recommendation recommending that summary judgment be
granted in Symantec's/DMA's favor on certain claims and counterclaims. Judge
Block has subsequently approved the recommendation, which has disposed of
certain claims against Symantec.

On April 10, 1997, Trio Systems LLC filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court, Central District of California, against Symantec, for damages,
injunctive and declaratory relief and for the imposition of a constructive trust
claiming copyright infringement, fraud, misrepresentation and breach of
contract, based on Symantec's alleged inclusion, in its Norton Utilities, Norton
Your Eyes Only and pcANYWHERE products, of Trio's C-Index code.

No discovery motions have as yet been filed. Symantec believes these claims have
no merit and intends to defend this action vigorously.

On April 23, 1997, Symantec filed a lawsuit against McAfee Associates in the
United States District Court, Northern District of California, for copyright
infringement and unfair competition. Symantec believes McAfee Associates copied
portions of Symantec's copyrighted software code and unlawfully incorporated
such code into certain of McAfee's products. Symantec plans to aggressively
pursue its remedies under this lawsuit, which include both injunctive relief and
monetary damages.

On May 13, 1997, Trend Micro Incorporated filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, against Symantec Corporation
and McAfee Associates, alleging against Symantec patent infringement by the
Symantec product known as Norton AntiVirus for Internet E-mail Gateways. The
lawsuit requests damages, injunctive relief and costs and attorney fees.
Symantec believes this claim has no merit and intends to defend the action
vigorously.

Symantec is currently evaluating claims of patent infringement asserted by IBM
with respect to certain of the Company's products. While the Company believes
that it has valid defenses to these claims, there can be no assurance that the
outcome of any related litigation or negotiation would not have a material
adverse impact on the Company's future results of operations or cash flows.

Symantec is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. The Company intends to defend all of the
aforementioned pending lawsuits vigorously and although adverse decisions (or
settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, the final resolution of
these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company. However,
depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these
lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's future results of operations or cash
flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period.


NOTE 12.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

                 SYMANTEC CORPORATION DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

                           As Adopted November 7, 1996


         1. Purpose. Symantec Corporation hereby establishes this Symantec
Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the purpose of providing
its eligible employees with a program for deferring compensation that otherwise
would be earned during the period of current employment.

         2. Eligibility. Employees who (i) are executive staff members or in
salary grades S-10, F, or 13 and above, and (ii) earn an annual base salary of
$125,000 or greater ("Eligible Employee") are eligible to participate in the
Plan. Nonresident aliens shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan unless
specifically permitted by the Deferred Compensation Committee (the "Committee").

         3. Election to Defer Compensation.

            (a) An Eligible Employee may elect (i) to defer a flat dollar amount
of such Eligible Employee's base salary for 1996, provided that such dollar
amount does not exceed (A) fifty percent (50%) of the Eligible Employee's base
salary for 1996, or (B) one hundred percent (100%) of any paycheck received by
such Eligible Employee in December 1996 and (ii) to be paid any such base salary
as "Deferred Compensation" by filing the Election Form attached hereto with the
Company on or before November 25, 1996. The minimum amount an Eligible Employee
may elect to defer during December 1996 is $1,000 per paycheck.

            (b) For years after 1996, an Eligible Employee may elect (i) to
defer either a flat dollar amount or a percentage of the Eligible Employee's
semi-monthly base salary, quarterly commissions, and annual or quarterly
bonuses, provided that such amount does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
Eligible Employee's semi-monthly base salary, quarterly commissions, and
quarterly or annual bonuses in any calendar year, and (ii) to be paid any such
base salary, commissions, and bonus as "Deferred Compensation" by filing the
Election Form attached hereto with the Company as follows: at any time prior to
(A) December 15, or any other date as set by the Committee, of the year
preceding any calendar year for which the semi-monthly base salary, 



                                       1
<PAGE>   2


quarterly commission and annual bonus is earned, or (B) the 15th day of the
month, or any other date as set by the Committee, prior to the beginning of any
quarter in which any quarterly bonus, quarterly commission is earned. The
minimum amount an Eligible Employee may elect to defer is $5,000 during each
year of deferral beginning January 1, 1997.

            (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee who meets the
eligibility requirements set forth in Section 2 above after the deadlines set
forth in this Section 3 for filing election forms for the calendar year may
elect to defer either a flat dollar amount or a percentage of semi-monthly base
salary, quarterly commissions, and annual or quarterly bonuses, which are earned
in such remaining year or quarter, provided that such amount does not exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the Eligible Employee's semi-monthly base salary,
quarterly commissions, and annual or quarterly bonuses in such remaining
calendar year, and to be paid any such base salary, commissions, and bonus as
"Deferred Compensation" by filing the Election Form attached hereto with the
Company prior to the 15th day of the month, or any other date as set by the
Committee, prior to the first day of the quarter coincident with or next
following the date on which such employee met the eligibility requirements.

            (d) The Election Form shall specify the time and manner of payment
of such Deferred Compensation subject to paragraph 6 below. Once filed with the
Committee, an election to defer compensation cannot be changed.

        4.  Crediting of Deferred Compensation. For purposes of paragraph 6
below, the aggregate amount allocable to the Eligible Employee's account as
Deferred Compensation as of the date on which the Eligible Employee receives the
lump sum or first installment of Deferred Compensation (the "Total Deferred
Compensation") shall be the sum of:

            (a) the amounts of base salary, commission and bonus that the
Employee shall have elected to receive as Deferred Compensation pursuant to
paragraph 3 above; and


                                       2
<PAGE>   3

            (b) the earnings or losses credited to the Eligible Employee
pursuant to paragraph 5 below.

            The Total Deferred Compensation may be held and administered by a
custodian appointed by the Committee pursuant to the terms of a trust agreement
approved by the Committee (the "Trust Agreement"). The Company will bear the
cost of fees charged by the custodian for its performance under the Trust
Agreement. An Eligible Employee shall be entitled to receive quarterly
statements of account which describe the Total Deferred Compensation and
earnings and losses which have accrued thereon during that period.

         5.  Investment of Deferred Compensation. Amounts treated as Deferred
Compensation by the Eligible Employee pursuant to paragraph 3 above, shall be
treated as if actually invested by the Company on behalf of the Eligible
Employee among investments designated by the Eligible Employee, other than stock
of the Company, in such manner as the Committee (as defined in paragraph 2
above) shall determine; provided however, that the Committee may: (a) determine
not to take account of such Eligible Employee's designated investments; and (b)
determine to have such amounts invested in another manner in the Committee's
sole discretion. Eligible Employees may change investment elections periodically
in accordance with guidelines set by the Committee.

        6.  Payment of Total Deferred Compensation.

            (a) Normal Distribution. Unless otherwise specified in paragraphs
6(b) - 6(d) or paragraph 7 below, the Total Deferred Compensation shall be paid
to the participant on the date and manner as designated on the Election Form,
but in no event earlier than five years from the January 1st of the year in
which the compensation was earned.

            (a) Termination of Employment. The Total Deferred Compensation shall
be payable to the Eligible Employee in one lump sum within 90 days of such
Eligible Employee's termination of employment with the Company for any reason
other than death, disability or attaining age 65.

            (b) Death, Disability and Retirement. The Total Deferred
Compensation shall be payable to the Eligible Employee (or such Eligible
Employee's beneficiary or legal representative) in one lump sum within 90 days
of the Eligible Employee's death, total and permanent disability (as 





                                       3
<PAGE>   4

defined in the Company's long term disability policy), or attainment of 65 years
of age, the Company's normal retirement age.

            (c) Hardship Withdrawals. The Company may, in its sole discretion,
accelerate the payment of all or any portion of the Total Deferred Compensation
in the event of an unforeseen emergency caused by an event beyond the control of
the Eligible Employee that would result in severe financial hardship to the
Eligible Employee, but only to the extent of the amount necessary to meet such
unforeseen emergency. To qualify for such hardship withdrawal, the participant
must have exhausted all other financial resources such as liquidation of assets,
insurance reimbursements and loans. The approval of any such financial hardship
shall be determined by the Committee.

            (d) Early withdrawals. The Eligible Employee may request that the
Company accelerate the payment of all or any portion of the Total Deferred
Compensation for any reason at any time, provided that such amount shall be
equal to at least $10,000 or the full amount of the Total Deferred Compensation,
if less. In the event of such acceleration of payment, the Eligible Employee
shall be subject to a penalty equal to 15% of the amount of the accelerated
payment. Such penalty shall be paid to or retained by the Company from the
Eligible Employee's Total Deferred Compensation.

        7.  Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the
contrary, the Total Deferred Compensation shall become payable to the Eligible
Employee in one lump sum upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

            (a) Any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any
other corporation or corporations in which the shareholders of the Company
immediately prior to the consolidation or merger do not retain a majority of the
voting power of the surviving corporation;

            (b) As a result of or in connection with any cash tender offer,
exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets or
contested election, or combination of the 




                                       4
<PAGE>   5

foregoing, if the persons who were directors of the Company immediately prior to
such event no longer constitute a majority of the Company's Board of Directors;

            (c) Any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company; or

            (d) Any liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

        8. Payments to Beneficiary or Representative. If the Eligible Employee
should die before receiving any or all of the Total Deferred Compensation to
which he or she is entitled, any such unpaid Total Deferred Compensation shall
be paid to the beneficiary last designated by the Eligible Employee or, if no
such beneficiary shall survive the Eligible Employee, to the Eligible Employee's
estate. If the Company shall find that any person to whom any amount is or was
payable hereunder is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or
accident, or is a minor, or has died, then the Company, if it so elects, may
direct that any payment due him or her or his or her estate (unless a prior
claim therefore has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) or any
part thereof, be paid or applied for the benefit of such person (or such
person's spouse, children or other dependents), to an institution maintaining or
having custody of such person, or to any other person deemed by the Company to
be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment, or
any of them, in such manner and proportion as the Company may deem proper. Any
such payment shall be in complete discharge of the Company's obligations under
this Plan.

        9. Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee,
except as to members of the Board of Directors, in which case the Plan shall be
administered by the entire Board of Directors, which shall have full power,
discretion and authority to interpret, construe and administer the Plan and any
part thereof, and the Committee's interpretation and construction thereof, and
actions thereunder, shall be binding and conclusive on all persons for all
purposes. The Committee may employ legal counsel, consultants, actuaries and
agents as it may deem desirable in the administration of the Plan and may rely
on the opinion of such counsel or the computations of such consultant or other
agent. The Committee shall provide for the keeping of detailed written minutes
of its actions hereunder which shall be reviewed by the legal counsel or the
consultant engaged by the Committee prior to their finalization.



                                       5
<PAGE>   6

        10. Unsecured Funds. All payments of Total Deferred Compensation shall
be paid in cash from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate
fund, other than any Rabbi Trust Agreement between a bank or trust company and
the Company, shall be established and no other segregation of assets shall be
made to assure the payment of any Total Deferred Compensation. The Eligible
Employee shall have no right, title or interest whatever in or to any investment
which the Company may make to aid it in meeting its obligations hereunder,
including, but not limited to, deemed investments. Nothing contained in this
Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be
construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the
Company and the Eligible Employee or any other person. To the extent that any
person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company hereunder such
right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the
Company.

        11. Other Rights. This Plan shall be in addition to any rights of the
Eligible Employee under any other agreement with the Company, if any.

        12. Withholding. The Company may withhold from any benefits payable
under this Plan all federal, state, city or other taxes as shall be required
pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling.

        13. Employment and Benefits Rights. Any benefit payable under this Plan
shall not be deemed salary or other compensation for the purpose of computing
benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of the Company for
the benefit of its employees.

        Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as
giving to any employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or
as affecting the right of the Company to dismiss any employee.

        14. Binding Effect; Nonassignability. This Plan shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns and the
Eligible Employee and the Eligible Employee's designees and estate. Neither the
Eligible Employee or the Eligible Employee's designees or estate shall commute,
encumber, sell or otherwise dispose of the right to receive the 



                                       6
<PAGE>   7

payments provided for in this Plan, which payments and the rights thereto are
expressly declared to be nontransferable and nonassignable.


        15. Amendment. This Plan may be amended, suspended or terminated, in
whole or in part, by the Board of Directors of the Company, but no such action
shall retroactively impair or otherwise adversely affect the rights of any
person to benefits under this Plan which have accrued prior to the date of such
action, as determined by the Committee.

        16. Governing Law. This Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State
of California from time to time in effect.

        17. Captions; Entire Agreement. The captions preceding the Sections
hereof have been inserted solely as a matter of convenience and in no way define
or limit the scope or intent of any provisions hereof.

        III.1.  Rent.

               (a) During the Lease Term, the Lessee shall pay Basic Rent on
        each Basic Rent Payment Date, on the date required under Section 20.1(k)
        in connection with the Lessee's exercise of the Remarketing Option and
        on any date on which this Master Lease shall terminate with respect to
        any or all Properties.

               (b) The Lessee's inability or failure to take possession of all
        or any portion of any Property when delivered by the Lessor, nor the
        Lessor's inability or failure to deliver all or any portions of this
        Property to the Lessee where attributable to any act or omission of the
        Lessee or any act or omission of the Lessor, or for any other reason
        whatsoever, shall delay or otherwise affect the Lessee's obligation to
        pay Rent for such Property in accordance with the terms of this Master
        Lease.

        III.2. Payment of Rent. Rent shall be paid absolutely net to the Lessor,
so that this Master Lease shall yield to the Lessor the full amount thereof,
without setoff, deduction or reduction.

        III.3. Supplemental Rent. The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor or the
Person entitled thereto any and all Supplemental Rent promptly as the same shall
become due and payable, and if the Lessee fails to pay any Supplemental Rent,
the Lessor shall have all rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or by
law or equity or otherwise in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. The Lessee
shall pay to the Lessor, as Supplemental Rent, among other things, on demand, to
the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, interest at the
applicable Overdue Rate on any installment of Basic Rent not paid when due for
the period for which the same shall be overdue and on any payment of
Supplemental Rent not paid when due or demanded by the Lessor for the period
from the due date or the date of any such demand, as the case may be, until the
same shall be paid. The expiration or other termination of the Lessee's
obligations to pay Basic Rent hereunder shall not limit or modify the

obligations of the Lessee with respect to Supplemental Rent. Unless expressly
provided otherwise in this Master Lease, in the event of any failure on the part
of the Lessee to pay and discharge any Supplemental Rent as and when due, the
Lessee shall also promptly pay and discharge any fine, penalty, interest or cost
which may be assessed or added under any agreement with a third party for
nonpayment or late payment of such Supplemental Rent, all of which shall also
constitute Supplemental Rent.

        III.4. Method of Payment. Each payment of Rent shall be made by the
Lessee to the Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., San Francisco, California time to the
Agent's account specified on Schedule II to the Participation Agreement in funds
consisting of lawful currency of the United States of America which shall be
immediately available on the scheduled date when such payment shall be due,
unless such scheduled date shall not be a Business Day, in which case such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. Payments received
after 12:00 p.m., San Francisco time on the date due shall for the purpose of
Section 16.1 hereof be deemed received on such day; provided, however, that for
the purposes of the second sentence of Section 3.3 hereof, such payments shall
be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and, unless the Agent is
otherwise able to invest or employ such funds on the date received, subject to
interest at the Overdue Rate as provided in such Section 3.3.

                        QUIET ENJOYMENT; RIGHT TO INSPECT

        IV.1. Quiet Enjoyment. Subject to Sections 2.4 and 4.2, and subject to
the rights of the Lessor contained in Article XV and the other terms of the
Operative Documents to which the Lessee is a party, the Lessee shall peaceably
and quietly have, hold and enjoy each Property for the Lease Term, free of any
claim or other action by the Lessor or anyone claiming by, through or under the
Lessor (other than the Lessee) with respect to any matters arising from and
after the applicable Acquisition Date. Such right of quiet enjoyment is
independent of, and shall not affect the Lessor's rights otherwise to initiate
legal action to enforce, the obligations of the Lessee under this Master Lease.

        IV.2. Right to Inspect. During the Lease Term, the Lessee shall upon
reasonable notice from the Lessor (except that no notice shall be required if a
Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), permit the Lessor and
its authorized representatives to inspect any Property subject to this Master
Lease during normal business hours, provided that such

Person, or by any court, in any such proceeding; (vii) any claim that the Lessee
has or might have against any Person, including without limitation the Lessor,

of any other agreement; (ix) any invalidity or unenforceability or illegality or

the Lessee may have against the Lessor or any Participant. The parties intend
that the obligations of the Lessee hereunder shall be covenants and agreements
that are separate and independent from any obligations of the Lessor hereunder
or under any other Operative Documents and the obligations of the Lessee shall
continue unaffected unless such obligations shall have been modified or
terminated in accordance with an express provision of this Master Lease.

        V.2. No Termination or Abatement. The Lessee shall remain obligated
under this Master Lease in accordance with its terms and shall not take any
action to terminate, rescind or avoid this Master Lease (except as provided

liquidation, dissolution, or other proceeding affecting the Lessor or any
Participant, or any action with respect to this Master Lease which may be taken
by any trustee, receiver or liquidator of the Lessor or any Participant or by
any court with respect to the Lessor or any Participant. The Lessee hereby
waives all right (i) to terminate or surrender this Master Lease (except as
provided herein) or (ii) to avail itself of any abatement, suspension,
deferment, reduction, setoff, counterclaim or defense with respect to any Rent.
The Lessee shall remain obligated under this Master Lease in accordance with its
terms and the Lessee hereby waives any and all rights now or hereafter conferred
by statute or otherwise to modify or to avoid strict compliance with its
obligations under this Master Lease. Notwithstanding any such statute or
otherwise, the Lessee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions
contained in this Master Lease.

possession of any Property shall in any way discharge or diminish any of the
Lessee's obligations to the Lessor hereunder and the Lessee shall remain
directly and primarily liable under this Master Lease as to the Properties, or
portion thereof, so sublet. Each sublease of any Property shall expressly be

right to finance and to secure under the Uniform Commercial Code, inventory,
furnishings, furniture, equipment, machinery, leasehold improvements and other
personal property located at the Properties other than Equipment, and Lessor
agrees to execute Lessor waiver forms and release of Lessor's Liens in favor of

                               PERMITTED CONTESTS

        XII.1. Permitted Contests in Respect of Applicable Law. If, to the
extent and for so long as (a) a test, challenge, appeal or proceeding for review
of any Applicable Law relating to any Property shall be prosecuted diligently
and in good faith in appropriate proceedings by the Lessee or (b) compliance
with such Applicable Law shall have been excused or exempted by a valid
nonconforming use, variance permit, waiver, extension or forbearance, the Lessee
shall not be required to comply with such Applicable Law but only if and so long
as any such test, challenge, appeal, proceeding, waiver, extension, forbearance
or noncompliance shall not, in the reasonable opinion of the Lessor and the
Agent, involve (A) any risk of criminal liability being imposed on the Lessor or
any Lender or (B) any risk of (1) foreclosure, forfeiture or loss of such
Property, or sale of any Property or any material part thereof, or nonpayment of
Rent (2) civil liability being imposed on the Lessor, any Lender, or such
Property, or (3) enjoinment of, or interference with, the use, possession or

Applicable Law requires that such proceedings be brought by or in the name of
the Lessor; and in that event the Lessor will join in the proceedings or permit
them or any part thereof to be brought in its name if and so long as (i) the
Lessee has not elected the Remarketing Option and (ii) the Lessee pays all
related expenses and indemnifies the Lessor and the Participants with respect to
such proceedings.

                                    INSURANCE

        XIII.1.  Public Liability and Workers' Compensation Insurance.

               (a) During the Lease Term, the Lessee shall procure and carry, at
        the Lessee's sole cost and expense, commercial general liability
        insurance for claims for injuries or death sustained by persons or
        damage to property while on the Properties and such other public
        liability coverages as are ordinarily procured by the Lessee or its
        Affiliates who own or operate similar properties, but in any case shall
        provide liability coverage of at least combined single limit for bodily
        injury or property damage, $5,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate. Such
        insurance shall be on terms and in amounts that are no less favorable
        than insurance maintained by the Lessee or such Affiliates with respect
        to similar properties that they own and that are in accordance with
        normal industry practice. The policy shall be endorsed to name the
        Lessor as additional insured. The policy shall also specifically provide
        that the policy shall be considered primary insurance which shall apply
        to any loss or claim before any contribution by any insurance which the
        Lessor may have in force.

               (b) The Lessee shall in the construction of any Modifications and
        the operation of the Properties, comply with the applicable workers'
        compensation laws.

        XIII.2. Hazard and Other Insurance. During the Lease Term, the Lessee
shall keep, or cause to be kept, such Property insured against loss or damage by
fire, and other risks on terms and in amounts that are no less favorable than
insurance covering other similar properties owned by the Lessee or its
Affiliates and that are in accordance with normal industry practices, but at
least an amount sufficient to cover the replacement cost of the Improvements.
During the construction of any Improvements the Lessee shall also maintain or
cause to be maintained builders' risk insurance. All insurance proceeds in
respect of any loss or

occurrence for which the proceeds related thereto are (i) less than or equal to
$500,000.00, in the absence of the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default, shall be adjusted by and paid to the Lessee for application toward the
reconstruction, repair or refurbishment of the applicable Property and (ii)
greater than $500,000.00, shall be adjusted by and held by the Lessor for
application in accordance with Article XIV.

        XIII.3.  Insurance Coverage.

               (a) The Lessee shall furnish the Lessor and the Agent with
        certificates showing the insurance required under Sections 13.1 and 13.2
        to be in effect and naming the Lessor as additional insured with respect
        to liability coverage (excluding worker's compensation insurance),
        naming the Lessor and the Lessee as their interests may appear with
        respect to property coverage and naming the Lessor as loss payee with
        respect to property coverage and showing the mortgagee endorsement
        required by Section 13.3(c) with respect to such coverage. All such
        insurance shall be at the cost and expense of the Lessee. Such
        certificates shall include a provision for no less than thirty (30)
        days' advance written notice by the insurer to the Lessor in the event
        of cancellation or reduction of such insurance.

               (b) The Lessee agrees that the insurance policy or policies
        required by Sections 13.2 shall include an appropriate clause pursuant
        to which such policy shall provide that it will not be invalidated
        should the Lessee waive, in writing, prior to a loss, any or all rights
        of recovery against any party for losses covered by such policy, and
        that the insurance in favor of the Lessor and its rights under and
        interests in said policies shall not be invalidated or reduced by any
        act or omission (including breach of warranty) or negligence of the
        Lessee or any other Person having any interest in any Property other
        than the Lessor. The Lessee hereby waives any and all such rights
        against the Lessor to the extent of payments made under such policies.

               (c) All such insurance shall be written by reputable insurance
        companies that are financially sound and solvent and otherwise
        reasonably appropriate considering the amount and type of insurance
        being provided by such companies. Any insurance company selected by the
        Lessee which is rated in Best's Insurance Guide or any successor thereto
        (or if there be none, an organization having a similar national
        reputation) shall have a general policyholder rating of "A" and a
        financial rating of at least "VIII" or be otherwise

        acceptable to the Lessor. All insurance policies required by Section
        13.2 shall include a standard form mortgagee endorsement in favor of the
        Lessor.

               (d) The Lessor shall not carry separate insurance concurrent in
        kind or form or contributing in the event of loss with any insurance
        required under this Article XIII except that the Lessor may, at the
        Lessor's expense, carry separate liability insurance so long as (i) the
        Lessee's insurance is designated as primary and in no event excess or
        contributory to any insurance the Lessor may have in force which would
        apply to a loss covered under the Lessee's policy and (ii) each such
        insurance policy will not cause the Lessee's insurance required under
        this Article XIII to be subject to a coinsurance exception of any kind.

               (e) The Lessee shall pay as they become due all premiums for the
        insurance required by Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, and shall renew or
        replace each policy prior to the expiration date thereof. Throughout the
        Lease Term, at the time each of the Lessee's insurance policies is
        renewed (but in no event less frequently than once each year), the
        Lessee shall deliver to the Lessor and the Agent certificates of
        insurance evidencing that all insurance required by this Article XIII is
        being maintained by the Lessee and is in effect.

                                   ARTICLE XIV
                CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION; ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

        XIV.1.  Casualty and Condemnation.

               (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article XIV, if all or a
        portion of any Property is damaged or destroyed in whole or in part by a
        Casualty or if the use, access, occupancy, easement rights or title to
        any Property or any part thereof, is the subject of a Condemnation, then

                      (i) in the case of a Casualty, (x) any insurance proceeds
               less than $500,000 payable with respect to such Casualty shall be
               paid directly to the Lessee, or if received by the Lessor, shall
               be paid over to such Lessee for the reconstruction, refurbishment
               and repair of such Property, and (y) any insurance proceeds in
               excess of $500,000 payable with respect to such Casualty shall be
               paid to the Lessor to be applied by disbursement to the Lessee to
               the restoration of such Property, and

                      (ii) in the case of a Condemnation (that is not a
               Significant Condemnation) of any part of any Land (not including
               the applicable Improvements), any award or compensation relating
               thereto shall be paid to the Lessee and in the case of a
               Significant Condemnation such award or compensation shall be paid
               to the Lessor to be applied in the Lessee's reasonable discretion
               to the restoration of such Property or toward the payment of the
               applicable Lease Balance;

        provided, however, that, in each case, if a Lease Event of Default shall
        have occurred and be continuing, such award, compensation or insurance
        proceeds shall be paid directly to the Lessor or, if received by the
        Lessee, shall be held in trust for the Lessor and the Lenders, and shall
        be paid over by the Lessee to the Lessor to be distributed in accordance
        with the Article VII of the Participation Agreement. All amounts held by
        the Lessor, or the Lenders when a Lease Event of Default exists
        hereunder on account of any award, compensation or insurance proceeds
        either paid directly to the Lessor or the Lenders or turned over to the
        Lessor or the Lenders shall at the option of the Lessor either be (i)
        paid to the Lessee for the repair of damage caused by such Casualty or
        Condemnation in accordance with clause (d) of this Section 14.1, or (ii)
        applied to the purchase price of the related Property on the Termination
        Date with respect to such Property in accordance with Article XV, with
        any Excess Casualty/Condemnation Proceeds being payable to the Lessee.

               (b) The Lessee may appear in any proceeding or action to
        negotiate, prosecute, adjust or appeal any claim for any award,
        compensation or insurance payment on account of any such Casualty or
        Condemnation and shall pay all expenses thereof. At the Lessee's
        reasonable request, and at the Lessee's sole cost and expense, the
        Lessor and the Lenders shall participate in any such proceeding, action,
        negotiation, prosecution or adjustment. The Lessor and the Lessee agree
        that this Master Lease shall control the rights of the Lessor and the
        Lessee in and to any such award, compensation or insurance payment.

               (c) If the Lessor or the Lessee shall receive notice of a
        Casualty or of an actual, pending or threatened Condemnation of any
        Property or any interest therein, the Lessor or the Lessee, as the case
        may be, shall give notice thereof to the other and to the Lenders
        promptly after the receipt of such notice.

               (d) If pursuant to this Section 14.1 and Section 15.1 this Master
        Lease shall continue in full force and effect following a Casualty or
        Condemnation with respect to any Property, the Lessee shall, at its sole
        cost and expense (and, without limitation, if any award, compensation or
        insurance payment is not sufficient to restore such Property in
        accordance with this clause (d), or is not covered by insurance as in
        the case of Casualty caused by earthquake, the Lessee shall pay the
        shortfall), promptly and diligently repair any damage to such Property
        caused by such Casualty or Condemnation in conformity with the
        requirements of Sections 9.1 and 10.1 (as modified to give effect to any
        subsequent Modifications, any Condemnation affecting such Property and
        all applicable Property Legal Requirements) so as to restore such
        Property to at least the same condition, operation, function and value
        as existed immediately prior to such Casualty or Condemnation with such
        Modification as the Lessee may elect in accordance with Section 10.1. In
        such event, title to such Property shall remain with the Lessor subject
        to the terms of this Master Lease. Upon completion of such restoration,
        the Lessee shall furnish the Lessor an architect's certificate of
        substantial completion and a Responsible Employee's Certificate
        confirming that such restoration has been completed pursuant to this
        Master Lease.

               (e) In no event shall a Casualty or Condemnation affect the
        Lessee's obligations to pay Rent pursuant to Section 3.1 or to perform
        its obligations and pay any amounts due on the Expiration Date or
        pursuant to Articles XVIII and XXI.

               (f) Any Excess Casualty/Condemnation Proceeds received by the
        Lessor or the Lenders in respect of a Casualty or Condemnation shall be
        turned over to the Lessee.

        XIV.2. Environmental Matters. Promptly upon the Lessee's knowledge of
the existence of an Environmental Violation with respect to any Property, the
Lessee shall notify the Lessor in writing of such Environmental Violation. If
the Lessor elects not to terminate this Master Lease with respect to such
Property pursuant to Section 15.1, at the Lessee's sole cost and expense, the
Lessee shall promptly and diligently commence any response, clean up, remedial
or other action necessary to remove, clean up or remediate the Environmental
Violation in accordance with the terms of Section 8.3 (including the last
sentence thereof). The Lessee shall, upon completion of remedial action by the
Lessee, cause to be prepared by an environmental consultant reasonably
acceptable to the Lessor a report describing the Environmental

Violation and the actions taken by the Lessee (or its agents) in response to
such Environmental Violation, and a statement by the consultant that the
Environmental Violation has been remedied in compliance in all material respects
with applicable Hazardous Materials Laws. Each such Environmental Violation
shall be remedied prior to the Expiration Date unless each Property with respect
to which an Environmental Violation has occurred but has not been remedied has
been purchased by the Lessee in accordance with Section 18.1 or 18.2. Nothing in
this Article XIV shall reduce or limit the Lessee's obligations under Sections
13.1, 13.2 or 13.3 of the Participation Agreement.

        XIV.3. Notice of Environmental Matters. Promptly, but in any event
within sixty (60) Business Days from the date the Lessee has actual knowledge
thereof, the Lessee shall provide to the Lessor written notice of any pending or
threatened claim, action or proceeding involving any Hazardous Materials Laws or
any Release on or in connection with any Property. All such notices shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, action or proceeding and
the Lessee's proposed response thereto. In addition, the Lessee shall provide to
the Lessor, within sixty (60) Business Days of receipt, copies of all written
communications with any Governmental Authority relating to any Environmental
Violation in connection with any Property. The Lessee shall also promptly
provide such detailed reports of any such material environmental claims as may
reasonably be requested by the Lessor or the Lenders. In the event that the
Lessor receives written notice of any pending or threatened claim, action or
proceeding involving any Hazardous Materials Laws or any Release on or in
connection with any Property, the Lessor shall promptly give notice thereof to
the Lessee.

occurs with respect to any Property:

                (i) a Significant Condemnation occurs; or

                (ii) an Environmental Violation occurs or is discovered the cost
        of remediation of which would exceed $5,000,000;

and the Lessor shall have given written notice (a "Termination Notice") to the
Lessee that, as a consequence of such event, (x) the Lease Supplement relating
to such Property is to be terminated and (y) this Master Lease is to be

Lessor's interest in such affected Property on or prior to the next occurring
Basic Rent Payment Date by paying the Lessor an amount equal to the Property
Balance for such affected Property.

        XV.2. Termination Procedures. On the date of the payment by the Lessee
of the Property Balance, or the Lease Balance, as the case may be, with respect
to any Property or all Properties, as the case may be, in accordance with
Section 15.1 (such date, the "Termination Date"), the Lease Supplement relating
to each such affected Property shall terminate and this Master Lease shall
terminate with respect to each such Property and, concurrent with the Lessor's
receipt of such payment,

               (a) the Lessor shall execute and deliver to the Lessee (or to the
        Lessee's designee) at the Lessee's cost and expense a special warranty
        deed with respect to each such Property, a bill of sale with respect to
        the Equipment located on each such Property and an assignment of the
        Lessor's entire interest in each such Property (which shall include an
        assignment of all of the Lessor's right, title and interest in and to
        any Net Proceeds with respect to each such Property not previously
        received by the Lessor), in each case in recordable form and otherwise
        in conformity with local custom and free and clear of the Lien of the
        Lessor Mortgage and any Lessor Liens attributable to the Lessor;

               (b) each such Property shall be conveyed to the Lessee (or to the
        Lessee's designee) "AS IS" and in its then present physical condition;
        and

               (c) in the case of a termination pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)
        of Section 15.1(a), the Lessor shall convey to the Lessee any Net

        termination of this Master Lease with respect to such Property
        theretofore received by the Lessor or at the request of the Lessee, such
        amounts shall be applied against sums due hereunder.

        Employee of the Lessee shall have knowledge of such failure; provided
        further, that failure by the Lessee to fully comply with the
        requirements of Section 20.1 hereof shall not be subject to any cure
        period; provided, however, that no Event of Default shall be deemed to
        have occurred under this subsection until one hundred twenty (120) days
        has elapsed so long as throughout such time, the Lessee is diligently
        pursuing a cure for such breach (to the extent such breach may be

               (g) any representation or warranty made by the Lessee in any of
        the Operative Documents to which it is a party shall prove to have been
        Materially inaccurate at the time made, and if such inaccuracy can be

        appointed to administer any Material Plan; or a condition shall exist by
        reason of which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree
        adjudicating that any Material Plan must be terminated; or there shall
        occur a complete or partial withdrawal from, or a default, within the
        meaning of Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA, with respect to, one or more

        respect to any Property, whether such indebtedness now exists or shall

discretion shall determine,

without limiting any other right or remedy the Lessor may have on account of
such Lease Event of Default (including, without limitation, the obligation of
the Lessee to purchase the Properties as set forth in Section 18.2:

               (a) The Lessor may, by notice to the Lessee, rescind or terminate
        this Master Lease as to any Property or all of the Properties as of the
        date specified in such notice; however, (i) no reletting, reentry or
        taking of possession of any Property (or any portion thereof) by the
        Lessor will be construed as an election on the Lessor's part to
        terminate this Master Lease unless a written notice of such intention is
        given to the Lessee, (ii) notwithstanding any reletting, reentry or
        taking of possession, the Lessor may at any time thereafter elect to
        terminate this Master Lease for a continuing Lease Event of Default and
        (iii) no act or thing done by the Lessor or any of its agents,
        representatives or employees and no agreement accepting a surrender of
        the Properties shall be valid unless the same be made in writing and
        executed by the Lessor;

               (b) The Lessor may (i) demand that the Lessee, and the Lessee
        shall upon the written demand of the Lessor, return any Property
        promptly to the Lessor in the manner and condition required by, and
        otherwise in accordance with all of the provisions of, Articles VII and
        IX and Section 8.3 hereof as if such Property were being returned at the
        end of the Lease Term, and the Lessor shall not be liable for the
        reimbursement of the Lessee for any costs and expenses incurred by the
        Lessee in connection therewith and (ii) without prejudice to any other
        remedy which the Lessor may have for possession of any Property, and to
        the extent and in the manner permitted by Applicable Law, enter upon
        such Property and take immediate possession of (to the exclusion of the
        Lessee) such Property or any part thereof and expel or remove the Lessee
        and any other Person who may be occupying such Property, by summary
        proceedings or otherwise, all without liability to the Lessee for or by
        reason of such entry or taking of possession, whether for the
        restoration of damage to property caused by such taking or otherwise
        and, in addition to the Lessor's other damages, the Lessee shall be
        responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the Lessor and/or the
        Lenders in connection with any reletting, including, without limitation,
        reasonable brokers' fees and all costs of any alterations or repairs
        made by the Lessor;

               (c) The Lessor may (i) sell all or any part of any Property at
        public sale free and clear of any rights of the

        Lessee and without any duty to account to the Lessee with respect to
        such action or inaction or any proceeds (except that Excess Proceeds are
        payable to and shall be paid to the Lessee) with respect thereto (except
        to the extent required by clause (ii) below if the Lessor shall elect to
        exercise its rights thereunder) in which event the Lessee's obligation
        to pay Basic Rent hereunder for periods commencing after the date of
        such sale shall be terminated or proportionately reduced, as the case
        may be; and (ii) if the Lessor shall so elect, demand that the Lessee
        pay to the Lessor, and the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, on the date
        of such sale, as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as a
        penalty (the parties agreeing that the Lessor's actual damages would be
        difficult to predict, but the aforementioned liquidated damages
        represent a reasonable approximation of such amount) or (in lieu of
        Basic Rent due for periods commencing on or after the Payment Date
        coinciding with such date of sale (or, if the sale date is not a Basic
        Rent Payment Date, the Basic Rent Payment Date next preceding the date
        of such sale)), an amount equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the
        Lease Balance calculated as of such Basic Rent Payment Date (including
        all Rent due and unpaid to and including such Basic Rent Payment Date
        and), over (2) the net proceeds of such sale (that is, after deducting
        all costs and expenses incurred by the Lessor incident to such
        conveyance, including, without limitation, repossession costs, brokerage
        commissions, prorations, transfer taxes, fees and expenses for counsel,
        title insurance fees, survey costs, recording fees, and any repair
        costs); plus (B) interest at the Overdue Rate on the foregoing amount
        from such Basic Rent Payment Date until the date of payment;

               (d) The Lessor may, at its option, elect not to terminate this
        Master Lease with respect to any Property or all of the Properties and
        continue to collect all Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, and all other
        amounts due the Lessor (together with all costs of collection) and
        enforce the Lessee's obligations under this Master Lease as and when the
        same become due, or are to be performed, and at the option of the
        Lessor, upon any abandonment of any Property by the Lessee or re-entry
        of same by the Lessor, the Lessor may, in its sole and absolute
        discretion, elect not to terminate this Master Lease and may make the
        necessary repairs in order to relet such Property, and relet such
        Property or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may be for a
        long term extending beyond the Lease Term of this Master Lease) and at
        such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as the
        Lessor in its

        reasonable discretion may deem advisable; and upon each such reletting
        all rentals actually received by the Lessor from such reletting shall be
        applied to the Lessee's obligations hereunder and the other Operative
        Documents in such order, proportion and priority as the Lessor may elect
        in the Lessor's sole and absolute discretion. If such rentals received
        from such reletting during any period are less than the Rent with
        respect to such Property to be paid during that period by the Lessee
        hereunder, the Lessee shall pay any deficiency, as calculated by the
        Lessor, to the Lessor on the next Basic Rent Payment Date;

               (e) Unless all of the Properties have been sold in their
        entirety, the Lessor may, whether or not the Lessor shall have exercised
        or shall thereafter at any time exercise any of its rights under clause
        (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 16.2 with respect to any Properties or
        any portions thereof, demand, by written notice to the Lessee specifying
        a date (a "Termination Date") not earlier than twenty (20) days after
        the date of such notice, that the Lessee purchase, on such Termination
        Date, all unsold Properties and all unsold portions of Properties in
        accordance with the provisions of Article XXI and Section 18.2;

               (f) The Lessor may exercise any other right or remedy that may be
        available to it under Applicable Law, or proceed by appropriate court
        action (legal or equitable) to enforce the terms hereof or to recover
        damages for the breach hereof. Separate suits may be brought to collect
        any such damages for any period(s), and such suits shall not in any
        manner prejudice the Lessor's right to collect any such damages for any
        subsequent period(s), or the Lessor may defer any such suit until after
        the expiration of the Lease Term, in which event such suit shall be
        deemed not to have accrued until the expiration of the Lease Term;

               (g) The Lessor may retain and apply against the Lease Balance all
        sums which the Lessor would, absent such Lease Event of Default, be
        required to pay to, or turn over to, the Lessee pursuant to the terms of
        this Master Lease;

               (h) If a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
        continuing, the Lessor, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, as a
        matter of right and with notice to the Lessee, shall have the right to
        apply to any court having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or
        receivers of any Property, and the Lessee hereby irrevocably consents to
        any such appointment. Any such receiver(s) shall have all of

        the usual powers and duties of receivers in like or similar cases and
        all of the powers and duties of the Lessor in case of entry, and shall
        continue as such and exercise such powers until the date of confirmation
        of the sale of such Property unless such receivership is sooner
        terminated;

               (i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Lessee hereby
        waives the benefit of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension,
        reinstatement and redemption laws now or hereafter in force and all
        rights of marshalling in the event of any sale of any Property or any
        interest therein;

               (j) The Lessor shall be entitled to enforce payment of the
        indebtedness and performance of the obligations secured hereby and to
        exercise all rights and powers under this instrument or under any of the
        other Operative Documents or other agreement or any laws now or
        hereafter in force, notwithstanding some or all of the obligations
        secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise secured, whether by
        mortgage, security agreement, pledge, lien, assignment or otherwise.
        Neither the acceptance of this instrument nor its enforcement, shall
        prejudice or in any manner affect the Lessor's right to realize upon or
        enforce any other security now or hereafter held by the Lessor, it being
        agreed that the Lessor shall be entitled to enforce this instrument and
        any other security now or hereafter held by the Lessor in such order and
        manner as the Lessor may determine in its absolute discretion. No remedy
        herein conferred upon or reserved to the Lessor is intended to be
        exclusive of any other remedy herein or by law provided or permitted,
        but each shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other
        remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity
        or by statute. Every power or remedy given by any of the Operative
        Documents to the Lessor or to which it may otherwise be entitled, may be
        exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time and as often
        as may be deemed expedient by the Lessor. In no event shall the Lessor,
        in the exercise of the remedies provided in this instrument (including,
        without limitation, in connection with the assignment of rents to
        Lessor, or the appointment of a receiver and the entry of such receiver
        onto all or any part of the Properties), be deemed a "mortgagee in
        possession," and the Lessor shall not in any way be made liable for any
        act, either of commission or omission, in connection with the exercise
        of such remedies.

If, pursuant to the exercise by the Lessor of its remedies pursuant to this
Section 16.2, the Lease Balance and all other amounts due and owing from the
Lessee under this Master Lease and

the other Operative Documents have been paid in full, then the Lessor shall
remit to the Lessee any excess amounts received by the Lessor.

               (k) Foreclosure; Power of Sale. Lessee hereby grants to First
        American Title Guaranty Company, as trustee (together with all successor
        trustees, the "Trustee"), IN TRUST, WITH POWER OF SALE, all of Lessee's
        right, title and interest in and to the Properties and, upon the
        occurrence of a Lease Event of Default, Lessor shall have the power and
        authority, after proper notice and lapse of such time as may be required
        by law, to cause Trustee to sell any Property or the Properties by
        notifying Trustee of that election and depositing with Trustee this
        instrument and receipts and evidence of expenditures made and secured
        hereby as Trustee may reasonably require. Upon receipt of any such
        notice from Lessor, Trustee shall cause to be recorded, published and
        delivered to Lessee such Notice of Default and Election to Sell as is
        then required by applicable statutory authority and by this instrument,
        which notice shall set forth, among other things, the nature of the
        breach(es) or default(s), the action(s) required to effect a cure
        thereof and the time period within which that cure may be effected. If
        no cure is effected within the statutory time limits following
        recordation of the Notice of Default and Election to Sell and after
        Notice of Sale has been given as required by the above-referenced
        statutes, Trustee may without further notice or demand sell and convey
        any Property or the Properties in accordance with the above-referenced
        statutes. Each Property may be sold as a whole or in separate lots,
        parcels or items and in such order as Lessor may direct, at public
        auction to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of the United
        States payable at the time of sale. Trustee shall deliver to such
        purchaser(s) a good and sufficient deed or deeds conveying the property
        so sold, but without any covenant or warranty express or implied. The
        recitals in such deed of any matter or fact shall be conclusive proof of
        the truthfulness thereof. Any Person, including Lessee, Trustee or
        Lessor, may purchase at any sale. After deducting all costs, fees and
        expenses of Lessor and Trustee, including costs of evidence of title in
        connection with any sale, Lessor shall apply the proceeds of sale, in
        the following order of priority, to payment of the following
        (collectively, the "Obligations"): (i) first, all amounts expended by or
        for the account of Lessor under the terms hereof and not then repaid,
        with accrued interest at the Overdue Rate; and (ii) second, all other
        amounts then due and owing hereunder including, without limitation, all
        Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, the full amount of the Lease

        Balance as of the date of sale as if this Lease had been terminated with
        respect to all of the Properties then subject to this Lease under
        Section 18.1, and all other amounts then payable by Lessee under this
        Lease and the other Operative Documents, with Lessor having the right to
        apply the proceeds of sale to the amounts described above in this clause
        (ii) in such order, proportion and priority as Lessor may elect in its
        sole and absolute discretion. To the extent permitted by applicable
        statutes, Trustee may postpone the sale of all or any portion of any
        Property or the Properties by public announcement at the time and place
        of sale, and from time to time thereafter may again postpone that sale
        by public announcement or subsequently noticed sale, and without further
        notice may make such sale at the time fixed at the last postponement or
        may, in its discretion, give a new notice of sale. A sale of less than
        all of any Property or the Properties or any defective or irregular sale
        made hereunder shall not exhaust the power of sale provided for herein,
        and subsequent sales may be made hereunder until all of the Obligations
        have been satisfied or all the Properties have been sold, without defect
        or irregularity. No action of Lessor or Trustee based upon the
        provisions contained herein or contained in the applicable statutes,
        including, without limitation, the giving of the Notice of Default and
        Election to Sell or the Notice of Sale, shall constitute an election of
        remedies which would preclude Lessor from pursuing judicial foreclosure
        before a completed sale pursuant to the power of sale contained herein.
        Lessor shall have the right, with the irrevocable consent of Lessee
        hereby given and evidenced by the execution of this instrument, to
        obtain appointment of a receiver by any court of competent jurisdiction
        without further notice to Lessee, which receiver shall be authorized and
        empowered to enter upon and take possession of any Property or the
        Properties, including all personal property used upon or in connection
        with the real property herein conveyed, to let any Property or the
        Properties, to receive all the rents, issues and profits, if any, which
        may be due or become due in respect to the leasing of any Property or
        the Properties to another party ("Property Rents"), and apply the
        Property Rents after payment of all necessary charges and expenses to
        reduction of the Obligations in such order, proportion and priority as
        Lessor may elect. At the option of Lessor, the receiver shall accomplish
        entry and taking possession of any Property or the Properties by actual
        entry and possession or by notice to Lessee. The receiver so appointed
        by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be empowered to issue
        receiver's certificates for funds advanced by Lessor for the purpose of
        protecting the

        value of any Property or the Properties as security for the Obligations.
        The amounts evidenced by receiver's certificates shall bear interest at
        the Overdue Rate and may be added to the Obligations if the Lessee or a
        junior lienholder purchases any Property or the Properties at the
        trustee's sale. Trustee or any successor acting hereunder may resign and
        thereupon be discharged of the trusts hereunder upon thirty (30) days'
        prior written notice to Lessor. Regardless of whether Trustee resigns,
        Lessor may, from time to time, substitute a successor or successors to
        any Trustee named herein or acting hereunder in accordance with any
        statutory procedure for such substitution; or if Lessor, in its sole and
        absolute discretion, so elects, and if permitted by law, Lessor may
        substitute such successors or successors by recording, in the office of
        the recorder of the county or counties where such Property is located, a
        document executed by Lessor and containing the name of the original
        Lessee and Lessor hereunder, the book and page where this instrument (or
        a memorandum hereof) is recorded (and/or instrument number, as
        applicable) and the name of the new Trustee, which instrument shall be
        conclusive proof of proper substitution of such successor Trustee or
        Trustees, who shall, without conveyance from the predecessor Trustee,
        succeed to the rights, powers and duties hereunder. It is acknowledged
        that A POWER OF SALE HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THIS INSTRUMENT; A POWER OF
        SALE MAY ALLOW LESSOR TO TAKE THE PROPERTIES AND SELL THEM WITHOUT GOING
        TO COURT IN A FORECLOSURE ACTION UPON DEFAULT BY LESSEE UNDER THIS
        INSTRUMENT.

        Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Lessor acknowledges that upon
the occurrence and continuance of a Lease Event of Default solely under clause
(e) of Section 16.1, the Lessor's remedies for such default shall be limited to
recovery of the Loan Balance by liquidation of the Additional Collateral or
through other appropriate means.

        XVI.3. Waiver of Certain Rights. If this Master Lease shall be
terminated pursuant to Section 16.2, the Lessee waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, (a) any notice of re-entry or the institution of legal
proceedings to obtain re-entry or possession; (b) any right of redemption,
re-entry or repossession; (c) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force
exempting property from liability for rent or for debt or limiting the Lessor
with respect to the election of remedies; and (d) any other rights which might
otherwise limit or modify any of the Lessor's rights or remedies under this
Article XVI.

                             LESSOR'S RIGHT TO CURE

        XVII.1. The Lessor's Right to Cure the Lessee's Lease Defaults. The
Lessor, without waiving or releasing any obligation or Lease Event of Default,
may (but shall be under no obligation to) remedy any Lease Event of Default for
the account and at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee, including the
failure by the Lessee to maintain the insurance required by Article XIII, and
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and notwithstanding any right of
quiet enjoyment in favor of the Lessee, enter upon any Property for such purpose
and take all such action thereon as may be necessary or appropriate therefor. No
such entry shall be deemed an eviction of the Lessee. All reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses so incurred (including fees and expenses of
counsel), together with interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date on
which such sums or expenses are paid by the Lessor, shall be paid by the Lessee
to the Lessor as Supplemental Rent.


                                  ARTICLE XVIII
                               PURCHASE PROVISIONS

        XVIII.1. Purchase of All or Some of the Properties. Subject to the
conditions contained herein, and without limitation of the Lessee's purchase
obligation pursuant to Section 18.2, the Lessee shall have the irrevocable
option on any Business Day to purchase all or some of the Properties subject to
this Master Lease at a price equal to the Lease Balance for such Properties on
the date of such purchase relating to such Property. The Lessee's exercise of
its option pursuant to this Section 18.1 shall be subject to the following
conditions:

               (i) the Lessee shall have delivered a Purchase Notice to the
        Lessor not less than thirty (30) days prior to such purchase, specifying
        the date of such purchase, which date shall be a Basic Rent Payment
        Date;

               (ii) the Lessee shall not have given notice of its intention to
        exercise the Remarketing Option.

If the Lessee exercises its option pursuant to this Section 18.1 then, upon the
Lessor's receipt of all amounts due in connection therewith, including Break
Costs, if any, the Lessor shall transfer to the Lessee or its designee all of
the Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the applicable Properties in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 21.1(a), such transfer to be
effective as of the date specified in the Purchase

Notice. The Lessee may designate, in a notice given to the Lessor not less than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the closing of such purchase (time being of the
essence), the transferee or transferees to whom the conveyance shall be made (if
other than to the Lessee), in which case such conveyance shall (subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein) be made to such designee; provided,
however, that such designation of a transferee or transferees shall not cause
the Lessee to be released, fully or partially, from any of its obligations under
this Master Lease, including, without limitation, the obligation to pay the
Lessor the Lease Balance on such Expiration Date.

        XVIII.2. Expiration Date Purchase Obligation. Unless (a) the Lessee
shall have properly exercised its option pursuant to Section 18.1 and purchased
the Properties pursuant thereto, or (b) the Lessee shall have properly exercised
the Remarketing Option and shall have fulfilled all of the conditions of clauses
(a) through (l) of Section 20.1 hereof and the Lessor shall have sold its
interest in all of the Properties pursuant thereto, then, subject to the terms,
conditions and provisions set forth in this Article, and in accordance with the
terms of Section 21.1(a), the Lessee shall purchase from the Lessor, and the
Lessor shall convey to the Lessee, on the Expiration Date all of the Lessor's
interest in all of the Properties for an amount equal to the Lease Balance. The
Lessee may designate, in a notice given to the Lessor not less than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the closing of such purchase (time being of the essence),
the transferee or transferees to whom the conveyance shall be made (if other
than to the Lessee), in which case such conveyance shall (subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein) be made to such designee; provided, however,
that such designation of a transferee or transferees shall not cause the Lessee
to be released, fully or partially, from any of its obligations under this
Master Lease, including, without limitation, the obligation to pay the Lessor
the Lease Balance on such Expiration Date.

                                   ARTICLE XIX
                                  RENEWAL TERMS

        XIX.1. Renewal. Prior to the final Expiration Date, the parties hereto
may agree to renew this Master Lease for one or more additional terms upon terms
and conditions to be mutually agreed upon; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall be construed as a commitment by either party to renew this Master
Lease beyond the Expiration Date.

                                   ARTICLE XX
                               REMARKETING OPTION

        XX.1. Option to Remarket. Subject to the fulfillment of each of the
conditions set forth in this Section 20.1, the Lessee shall have the option (the
"Remarketing Option") to market and complete the sale of all of the Properties
for the Lessor.

        The Lessee's effective exercise and consummation of the Remarketing
Option shall be subject to the due and timely fulfillment of each of the
following provisions as to each of the Properties as of the dates set forth
below.

               (a) Not later than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the
        Expiration Date, the Lessee shall give to the Lessor written notice of
        the Lessee's exercise of the Remarketing Option, which exercise shall be
        irrevocable. Failure by the Lessee to give timely notice shall be deemed
        to be an election by the Lessee, without further act thereby, of its
        Purchase Option for all of the Properties.

               (b) Not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the
        Expiration Date, the Lessee shall deliver to the Lessor an Environmental
        Audit for each of the Properties. Such Environmental Audit shall be
        prepared by an environmental consultant selected by the Lessor in the
        Lessor's reasonable discretion and shall contain conclusions reasonably
        satisfactory to the Lessor as to the environmental status of the
        Properties. If any such Environmental Audit indicates any exceptions,
        the Lessee shall have also delivered prior to the Expiration Date a
        Phase Two environmental assessment by such environmental consultant and
        a written statement by such environmental consultant indicating that all
        such exceptions have been remedied in compliance with Applicable Law.

               (c) The Lessee shall have completed all Modifications,
        restoration and rebuilding of the affected Properties pursuant to
        Sections 10.1 and 14.1 (as the case may be) and shall have fulfilled all
        of the conditions and requirements in connection therewith pursuant to
        said Sections, in each case prior to the date on which the Lessor
        receives the Lessee's notice of the Lessee's intention to exercise the
        Remarketing Option (time being of the essence), regardless of whether
        the same shall be within the Lessee's control. The Lessee shall have
        also paid the cost of all Modifications commenced prior to the
        Expiration Date. The Lessee shall not have been excused pursuant to
        Section 12.1 from complying with any Applicable Law that involved the

                                                                    MASTER LEASE

        extension of the ultimate imposition of such Applicable Law beyond the
        Expiration of the Term. Any Permitted Property Liens (other than Lessor
        Liens) on any Property that were contested by the Lessee shall have been
        removed.

               (d) During the Marketing Period, the Lessee shall, as
        nonexclusive agent for the Lessor, use its best efforts to sell the
        Lessor's interest in the Properties and will attempt to obtain the
        highest purchase price therefor and for not less than the Fair Market
        Sales Value. The Lessee will be responsible for hiring brokers and
        making the Properties available for inspection by prospective
        purchasers. The Lessee shall promptly upon request permit inspection of
        any Property and any maintenance records relating to any Property by the
        Lessor, any Participant and any potential purchasers, and shall
        otherwise do all things necessary to sell and deliver possession of the
        Properties to any purchaser. All such marketing of the Properties shall
        be at the Lessee's sole expense. The Lessee shall allow the Lessor and
        any potential qualified purchaser reasonable access to the Properties
        for the purpose of inspecting the same.

               (e) The Lessee shall procure bids from one or more bona fide
        prospective purchasers and shall deliver to the Lessor and the
        Participants not less than ninety (90) days prior to the Expiration Date
        a binding written unconditional (except as set forth below), irrevocable
        offer by such purchaser or purchasers offering the highest bid to
        purchase the Properties. No such purchaser shall be the Lessee or any
        Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Lessee. The written offer must specify
        the Expiration Date as the closing date unless the Lessor and the
        Participants shall otherwise agree in their sole discretion.

               (f) The Lessee shall submit all bids to the Lessor and the
        Participants, and the Lessor will have the right to submit any one or
        more bids. Any sale by the Lessee shall be for the highest cash bid
        submitted to the Lessor. The determination of the highest bid shall be
        made by the Lessor prior to the end of the Marketing Period, but in any
        event, the Lessor shall have no obligation to approve any bid for any
        Property unless each highest bid plus an amount that may be paid by the
        Lessee in its sole and absolute discretion (in addition to its
        obligations under Section 20.1(i)), together with such bid, equals or
        exceeds the Property Balance. All bids shall be on an all-cash basis
        unless the Lessor and the Participants shall otherwise agree in their
        sole discretion.

               (g) The Lessee shall have obtained, at its cost and expense, all
        required governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and shall
        have made all filings as required by Applicable Law in order to carry
        out and complete the transfer of each of the Properties. As to the
        Lessor, any such sale shall be made on an "as is, with all faults" basis
        without representation or warranty by the Lessor other than the absence
        of Lessor Liens. Any agreement as to such sale shall be made subject to
        the Lessor's rights hereunder.

               (h) As between the Lessor and the Lessee the Lessee shall pay
        directly, and not from the sale proceeds, all prorations, credits, costs
        and expenses of the sale of the Properties, whether incurred by the
        Lessor or the Lessee, including without limitation, the cost of all
        title insurance, surveys, environmental reports, appraisals, transfer
        taxes, the Lessor's reasonable attorneys' fees, the Lessee's attorneys'
        fees, commissions, escrow fees,recording fees, and all applicable
        documentary and other transfer taxes.

               (i) The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on or prior to the
        Expiration Date (or in the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Person
        entitled thereto) an amount equal to the Loan Balance plus all accrued
        and unpaid Rent (including Supplemental Rent, if any) and all other
        amounts hereunder which have accrued or will accrue prior to or as of
        the Expiration Date, in the type of funds specified in Section 3.4
        hereof.

               (j) The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on or prior to the
        Expiration Date the amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to
        Section 13.2 of the Participation Agreement.

               (k) The purchase of all of the Properties shall be consummated on
        the Expiration Date and the gross proceeds (the "Gross Remarketing
        Proceeds") of the sale of the Properties (less any marketing, closing or
        other costs, prorations or commissions) shall be paid directly to the
        Lessor; provided, however, that if the sum of (x) the Gross Remarketing
        Proceeds from such sale plus (y) the Loan Balance received by the Lessor
        exceeds the Lease Balance as of such date, then the excess shall be paid
        to the Lessee on the Expiration Date.

        If the Lessee effectively elects the Remarketing Option and no sale of
any Property is consummated prior to the end of the Marketing Period, Lessee may
exercise its purchase option 



                                      -37-
<PAGE>   39

pursuant to Section 18.2 or Lessee shall, in addition to making the payment
required pursuant to Section 20.1(i) above, at its own cost and expense, do each
of the following:

               (i) execute and deliver to Lessor and the Lessor's title
        insurance company an affidavit as to the absence of any Liens (other
        than Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (i), (viii) or
        (x)), and shall execute and deliver to the Lessor a statement of
        termination of this Master Lease to the extent relating to such
        Property;

               (ii) on the Expiration Date, transfer possession of such Property
        to the Lessor or any Person designated by the Lessor, by surrendering
        the same into the possession of the Lessor or such Person, as the case
        may be, in the condition required by this Section 20.1 and in compliance
        with Applicable Law; and

               (iii) for a period of up to one year after the Expiration Date,
        cooperate reasonably with the Lessor and/or any Person designated by the
        Lessor to receive such Property, which cooperation shall include
        reasonable efforts with respect to the following, all of which the
        Lessee shall do on or before the Expiration Date for such Property or as
        soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable: providing copies of all
        books and records regarding the maintenance and ownership of such
        Property and all know-how, data and technical information relating
        thereto, providing a current copy of the applicable Plans and
        Specifications, granting or assigning all assignable licenses necessary
        for the operation and maintenance of such Property and cooperating
        reasonably in seeking and obtaining all necessary Governmental Action.
        The obligations of the Lessee under this paragraph shall survive the
        expiration or termination of this Master Lease.

        Except as expressly set forth herein, the Lessee shall have no right,
power or authority to bind the Lessor in connection with any proposed sale of
any Property.

        If one or more of the foregoing provisions shall not be fulfilled as of
the date set forth above with respect to any Property, then the Lessor shall
declare by written notice to the Lessee the Remarketing Option to be null and
void (whether or not it has been theretofore exercised by the Lessee) as to all
of the Properties, in which event all of the Lessee's rights under this Section
20.1 shall immediately terminate and the Lessee shall be obligated to purchase
all of the Properties pursuant to Section 18.2 on the Expiration Date.

        XX.2. Certain Obligations Continue. During the Marketing Period, the
obligation of the Lessee to pay Rent with respect to each Property (including
the installment of Rent due on the Expiration Date) shall continue undiminished
until payment in full of the Loan Balance and all other amounts due to the
Lessor with respect to the Properties under the Operative Documents to which the
Lessee is a party. The Lessor shall have the right, but shall be under no duty,
to solicit bids, to inquire into the efforts of the Lessee to obtain bids or
otherwise to take action in connection with any such sale, other than as
expressly provided in this Article XX.

        XXI.1. Provisions Relating to the Exercise of Purchase Option or
Obligation and Conveyance Upon Remarketing and Conveyance Upon Certain Other
Events.

               (a) In connection with any termination of this Master Lease with
        respect to any Property pursuant to the terms of Article XV, in
        connection with any purchase or in connection with the Lessee's purchase
        of any Property in accordance with Section 18.1 or in connection with
        the Lessee's Expiration Date Purchase Obligation or obligations under
        Section 16.2(e), then, upon the date on which this Master Lease is to

        of all amounts due under Section 5.1 of the Construction Agency
        Agreement, as applicable, and upon tender by the Lessee of the amounts

               grant deed with respect to such Property or Properties containing
               representations and warranties of grantor to the Lessee regarding
               Lessor Liens, a bill of sale with respect to the Equipment
               located on such Property or Properties and an assignment of the

               the Lien of the Lessor Deed of Trust and any Lessor Liens;

                      (ii) such Property or Properties shall be conveyed to the
               Lessee "AS IS" and in its then present physical condition; and

                      (iii) the Lessor shall execute and deliver to Lessee and

               Lessor's title and Lessor Liens and shall execute and deliver to
               Lessee a statement of termination of this Master Lease.

               (b) If the Lessee properly exercises the Remarketing Option, then
        the Lessee shall, on the Expiration Date, and at its own cost, transfer
        possession of all of the Properties to the independent purchaser(s)
        thereof, in each case by surrendering the same into the possession of
        the Lessor or such purchaser(s), as the case may be, free and clear of
        all Liens other than Lessor Liens and the lien of the Lessor Mortgage,
        in good condition (as modified by Modifications permitted by this Master
        Lease), ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in compliance with
        Applicable Law. The Lessee shall, on and within a reasonable time before
        and up to one year after the Expiration Date, cooperate reasonably with
        the Lessor and the independent purchaser(s) of the Properties in order
        to facilitate the purchase by such purchaser(s) of the Properties, which
        cooperation shall include the following, all of which the Lessee shall
        do on or before the Expiration Date or as soon thereafter as is
        reasonably practicable: providing copies of all books and records
        regarding the maintenance and ownership of the Properties and all
        know-how, data and technical information relating thereto, providing a
        current copy of the Plans and Specifications for each Property, granting
        or assigning all licenses necessary for the operation and maintenance of
        each Property and cooperating reasonably in seeking and obtaining all
        necessary Governmental Action. The obligations of the Lessee under this
        paragraph shall survive the expiration or termination of this Master
        Lease.

Lenders, and no act by the Lessor or the Lenders or any representative or agent
of the Lessor or the Lenders, other than a written acceptance, shall constitute

                               NO MERGER OF TITLE

        XXIV.1. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of this Master
Lease or of the leasehold estate created hereby by reason of the fact that the
same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part, (a) this Master Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby or any
interest in this Master Lease or such leasehold estate, (b) the fee or
groundleasehold estate in any Property, except as may expressly be stated in a
written instrument duly executed and delivered by the appropriate Person or (c)
a beneficial interest in the Lessor.

                              INTENT OF THE PARTIES

        XXV.1. Ownership of the Properties. (a) The parties hereto intend that
(i) for financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, the Lessor
will be treated as the owner and the lessor of the Properties and the Lessee
will be treated as the lessee of the Properties and (ii) for all other purposes,
including federal and all state and local income tax purposes, state real estate
and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (A) this Lease will be treated as a
financing arrangement, (B) the Lessor and the Lenders will be deemed lenders
making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to the sum of the Lessor Amount
and the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and (C) the Lessee will be
treated as the owner of the Properties and will be entitled to all tax benefits
ordinarily available to an owner of properties like the Properties for such tax
purposes. Nevertheless, the Lessee acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Lessor nor any of the Lenders has made any representations or warranties to the
Lessee concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative
Documents and that the Lessee has obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting
and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it deems appropriate.

        (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that this Lease grants a
security interest and mortgage, as the case may be, on the Properties to the
Lessor to secure Lessee's performance under and payment of all amounts under
this Lease and the other Operative Documents.

                                  ARTICLE XXVI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        XXVI.1. Survival; Severability; Etc. Anything contained in this Master
Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, all claims against and liabilities of the
Lessee or the Lessor arising from events commencing prior to the expiration or
earlier termination of this Master Lease shall survive such expiration or
earlier termination for a period of one year except as to indemnification which
shall continue to survive; provided that any such right shall be exercised
within 54 years from the date hereof. If any term or provision of this Master
Lease or any application thereof shall be declared invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Master Lease and any other application of such term or
provision shall not be affected thereby. If any right or option of the Lessee
provided in this Master Lease, including any right or option described in
Article XIV, XV, XVIII or XX, would, in the absence of the limitation imposed by
this sentence, be invalid or unenforceable as being in violation of the rule
against perpetuities or any other rule of law relating to the vesting of an
interest in or the suspension of the power of alienation of property, then such
right or option shall be exercisable only during the period which shall end
twenty-one (21) years after the date of death of the last survivor of the
descendants of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the former President of the United States,
Henry Ford, the deceased automobile manufacturer, and John D. Rockefeller, the
founder of the Standard Oil Company, known to be alive on the date of the
execution, acknowledgement and delivery of this Master Lease.

        XXVI.2. Amendments and Modifications. Subject to the requirements,
restrictions and conditions set forth in the Participation Agreement, neither
this Master Lease nor any provision hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or
terminated except by an instrument in writing in recordable form signed by the
Lessor and the Lessee.

        XXVI.3. No Waiver. No failure by the Lessor or the Lessee to insist upon
the strict performance of any term hereof or to exercise any right, power or
remedy upon a default hereunder, and no acceptance of full or partial payment of
Rent during the continuance of any such default, shall constitute a waiver of
any such default or of any such term. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no
waiver of any default shall affect or alter this Master Lease, and this Master
Lease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then
existing or subsequent default.

        XXVI.4. Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and directed to the address

Master Lease shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

contents in this Master Lease are for convenience of reference only and shall
not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

        XXVI.7. Counterparts. This Master Lease may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall
together constitute one and the same instrument.

        XXVI.8. GOVERNING LAW. THIS MASTER LEASE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

        XXVI.9. Limitations on Recourse. The parties hereto agree that except as
specifically set forth in this Lease or in any other Operative Document, Lessor
shall have no personal liability whatsoever to the Lessee or its respective
successors and assigns for any claim based on or in respect of this Master Lease
or any of the other Operative Documents or arising in any way from the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and the recourse shall be solely had
against the Lessor's interest in the Property; provided, however, that Lessor
shall be liable in its individual capacity (a) for its own willful misconduct or
gross negligence (or negligence in the handling of funds), (b) breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants under the Operative Documents, or
(c) for any Tax based on or measured by any fees, commission or compensation
received by it for acting as the Lessor as contemplated by the Operative
Documents. It is understood and agreed that, except as provided in the preceding
sentence: (i) Lessor shall have no personal liability under any of the Operative
Documents as a result of acting pursuant to and consistent with any of the
Operative Documents; (ii) all obligations of Lessor to the Lessee are solely
nonrecourse obligations except to the extent that it has received payment from
others; and (iii) all such personal liability of Lessor is expressly waived and
released as a condition of, and as

Lease marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the

Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction, no security
interest in this Master Lease may be created through the transfer or possession
of any counterpart other than the Original Executed Counterpart.

                      MEMORANDUM OF LEASE AND DEED OF TRUST

                          dated as of October 18, 1996

                                      among

                              SYMANTEC CORPORATION,
                                 as the Lessee,

                    SUMITOMO BANK LEASING AND FINANCE, INC.,
                                 as the Lessor,

                     FIRST AMERICAN TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY,

<PAGE>   55

         THIS LEASE SUPPLEMENT NO. 1 AND MEMORANDUM OF LEASE AND DEED OF TRUST
(this "Memorandum") dated as of October 18, 1996, among SYMANTEC CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation, having a principal office at 10101 Torre Avenue,
Cupertino, California 95014, as the Lessee and as Mortgagor (the "Lessee"),
SUMITOMO BANK LEASING AND FINANCE, INC., as the Lessor (the "Lessor"), having an
address at 277 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10172, and FIRST AMERICAN TITLE
INSURANCE COMPANY (the "Trustee").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Lessor is the owner in fee simple of the land described on
Exhibit A-1 attached hereto and all Improvements thereon described in Exhibit
A-2 attached hereto (together, the "Property");

         WHEREAS, the Lessor wishes to lease the Property to the Lessee and the
Lessee wishes to lease the Property from the Lessor;

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree to enter
into this Memorandum, as follows:

         I. Certain Terms. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in
this Memorandum have the meanings specified in Appendix A to the Master Lease
and Security Agreement dated as of October 18, 1996 (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Lease"), between the
Lessee and the Lessor; and the rules of interpretation specified in Appendix A
to the Lease shall apply to this Memorandum.

         2. Property. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the description of the
Property. Effective upon the execution and delivery of this Memorandum by the
Lessor and the Lessee, the Property shall be subject to the terms and provisions
of the Lease. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease, the Lessor
hereby leases the Property to the Lessee for the Term (as defined below) of this
Memorandum, and the Lessee hereby agrees, expressly for the direct benefit of
the Lessor, to lease the Property from the Lessor for the Term. For the purposes
of this Lease Supplement No. 1, the lease of the Exhibit A-1 Land and Exhibit
A-2 Improvements shall be considered separate Leases but one Property for the
purposes of the Master Lease.

         3. Lease Term. The term of this Memorandum (the "Term") shall begin on
the date hereof and shall end on October 18, 2003 unless the Term with respect
to the Property is renewed or earlier terminated in accordance with the
provisions of the Lease or the other Operative Documents. For and in
consideration of 




<PAGE>   56

good and valuable consideration paid by the Lessee to the Lessor as
described in the Lease, the Lessor hereby grants to the Lessee the right to
purchase the Property or to market and sell the Property during the Term of this
Memorandum on the terms set forth in the Lease.

         4. Ownership of the Property. (a) The parties hereto intend that (i)
for financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, the Lessor will be
treated as the owner and the lessor of the Properties and the Lessee will be
treated as the lessee of the Properties and (ii) for all other purposes,
including federal and all state and local income tax purposes, state real estate
and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (A) the Lease will be treated as a
financing arrangement, (B) the Lessor and the Lenders will be deemed lenders
making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to the sum of the Lessor Amount
and the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, which loans are secured by
the Properties and (C) the Lessee will be treated as the owner of the Properties
and will be entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of
properties like the Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the Lessee
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Lessor nor any of the Lenders has made
any representations or warranties to the Lessee concerning the tax, accounting
or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents and that the Lessee has
obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the
Operative Documents as it deems appropriate.

         (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Lease grants a
security interest and deed of trust or lien, as the case may be, on the Property
for the benefit of the Lessor to secure the Lessee's performance under and
payment of all amounts advanced by the Lessor for the acquisition of the
Property (corresponding to the value of the Property as indicated on the
Appraisal) under the Lease and the other Operative Documents, together with
interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under the Operative Documents in
connection therewith.

         (c) Specifically, without limiting the generality of subsection (b),
the Lessor and the Lessee intend and agree that with respect to the nature of
the transactions evidenced by the Lease in the context of the exercise of
remedies under the Operative Documents, including, without limitation, in the
case of any insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the
United States bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute
of the United States of America or any State or Commonwealth thereof affecting
the Lessee and the Lessor, or any enforcement or collection actions, the
transactions evidenced by the Lease are loans made by the Lessor as unrelated
third party lender to the Lessee secured by the Property (it being understood
that the Lessee hereby mortgages, 



                                       -2-
<PAGE>   57

grants, bargains, sells, releases, confirms, conveys, assigns, transfers and
sets over to the Trustee for the benefit of the Lessor, and grants a security
interest in, the Property (consisting of a fee deed of trust with respect to all
right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to the fee title to, and
reversionary interest in, the Land and Improvements, if any, and a leasehold
deed of trust on the Lessee's leasehold estate under the Lease), all to secure
such loans, effective on the date hereof, to have and to hold such interests in
the Property unto the Trustee for the benefit of the Lessor and its successors
and assigns, forever, provided always that these presents are upon the express
condition that, if all amounts due under the Lease shall have been paid and
satisfied in full, then this instrument and the estate hereby granted shall
cease and become void.

         As additional security for the Rent, the Lease Balance and all other
sums owed to the Lessor by the Lessee under the Lease, the Lessee does hereby
grant, bargain, sell, transfer and convey unto the Trustee, its successors in
trust and assigns, IN TRUST, WITH POWER OF SALE, for the benefit of the Lessor,
all of the Lessee's right, title and interest in and to the Property, including,
without limitation, all buildings, structures and other improvements, and all
fixtures and other property now or hereafter attached to or affixed to any such
buildings, structures or other improvements, and any additions and alterations
thereto or replacements thereof, now or hereafter built, constructed or located
upon the Property, all rents, additional rents, issues, income, revenues,
distributions, royalties and profits now or in the future payable in respect of
the Property, together with all of the right, power and authority of the Lessee
to alter, modify or change the terms, conditions and provisions of the Lease and
any other lease pertaining to the Property, to consent to any request made by a
tenant or landlord pursuant thereto, or to surrender, cancel or terminate the
same or to accept any surrender, cancellation or termination of the same,
together with all of the options, rights, powers and privileges of the Lessee
under any lease pertaining to the Property, whether heretofore or hereafter
existing, including, without limitation, the rights and options to purchase the
Property contained in Articles XVIII and XX of the Lease, and all present and
future right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to (i) all refunds, tax
abatement agreements, rebates, reserves, deferred payments, deposits, cost
savings, awards and payments of any kind due from or payable by (a) any
Governmental Authority, or (b) any insurance or utility company, in each case
under clause (a) or (b) above in respect of the Property, and (ii) all refunds,
rebates and payments of any kind due from or payable by any Governmental
Authority for any taxes, assessments, or governmental or quasi-governmental
charges or levies imposed upon the Lessee in respect of the Property, and all
plans and specifications, designs, drawings and other information,





                                       -3-
<PAGE>   58

materials and matters heretofore or hereafter prepared relating to the Property
or any construction on the Property, all proceeds (including claims and demands
therefor) of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of any of the foregoing
into cash or liquidated claims, including without limitation the proceeds of
insurance and condemnation awards in respect of the Property or any portion
thereof, all additional estates, rights and interests hereafter acquired by the
Lessee in the Property, or any portion thereof, together with all proceeds of
the conversion, whether voluntary or involuntary, of any of the Property into
cash or other liquid claims, including without limitation, all awards, payments
or proceeds, including interest thereon, and the right to receive the same,
which may be made as a result of any casualty, any exercise of the right of
eminent domain or deed in lieu thereof, any injury to the Property and any
defect in title in the Property or other matter insured under any policy of
title insurance, together with attorney's fees, costs and disbursements incurred
by the Lessor in connection with the collection of such awards, payments and
proceeds, and the Lessee further grants to the Lessor, pursuant to the
California Uniform Commercial Code (the "UCC"), a security interest in all
present and future right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to any portion
of the foregoing property for which a security interest may be created under the
UCC.

         To have and to hold the same whether now owned or held or hereafter
acquired unto the Trustee, its successors-in-trust forever, IN TRUST, WITH POWER
OF SALE, to secure to the Lessor the payment of the Rent, the Lease Balance and
all other sums owing to the Lessor under the Lease and the performance and
observance of the terms, covenants, warranties, conditions, agreements and
obligations under the Lease. If the Lessee shall pay all sums due under the
Lease when due according to the terms thereof and shall otherwise fully and
properly perform and comply with all of the obligations, agreements, terms and
conditions of the Lease, then this conveyance shall become null and void.

         In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default, then the entire
unpaid balance of all sums due under the Lease and the interest accrued thereon
shall, at the option of the owner thereof and without notice, immediately become
due and payable for all purposes, whether or not due according to the maturity
date or dates thereof; and all other indebtedness, the payment of which is
secured hereby, shall likewise become due and payable. The Trustee and the
Lessor and each of them are authorized prior or subsequent to the institution of
any foreclosure proceedings to enter upon the Property or any part thereof and
to take possession of the Property and exercise without interference from the
Lessee, any and all rights which the Lessee has with respect to the management,
possession, operation, protection or preservation of the Property.




                                      -4-
<PAGE>   59

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lessor shall have the power
and authority, after proper notice and lapse of such time as may be required by
law, to cause Trustee to sell the Property by notifying Trustee of that election
and depositing with Trustee this instrument and receipts and evidence of
expenditures made and secured hereby as Trustee may reasonably require. Upon
receipt of any such notice from Lessor, Trustee shall cause to be recorded,
published and delivered to Lessee such Notice of Default and Election to Sell as
is then required by applicable statutory authority and by this instrument, which
notice shall set forth, among other things, the nature of the breach(es) or
default(s), the action(s) required to effect a cure thereof and the time period
within which that cure may be effected. If no cure is effected within the
statutory time limits following recordation of the Notice of Default and
Election to Sell and after Notice of Sale has been given as required by the
above-referenced statutes, Trustee may without further notice or demand sell and
convey the Property in accordance with the above-referenced statutes. The
Property may be sold as a whole or in separate lots, parcels or items and in
such order as Lessor may direct, at public auction to the highest bidder for
cash in lawful money of the United States payable at the time of sale. Trustee
shall deliver to such purchaser(s) a good and sufficient deed or deeds conveying
the property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty express or implied.
The recitals in such deed of any matter or fact shall be conclusive proof of the
truthfulness thereof. Any Person, including Lessee, Trustee or Lessor, may
purchase at any sale. After deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Lessor and
Trustee, including costs of evidence of title in connection with any sale,
Lessor shall apply the proceeds of sale, in the following order of priority, to
payment of the following (collectively, the "Obligations"): (i) first, all
amounts expended by or for the account of Lessor under the terms hereof and not
then repaid, with accrued interest at the Overdue Rate; and (ii) second, all
other amounts then due and owing hereunder including, without limitation, all
Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, the full amount of the Lease Balance as of the
date of sale as if the Lease had been terminated with respect to all of the
Properties then subject to the Lease under Section 18.1, and all other amounts
then payable by Lessee under the Lease and the other Operative Documents, with
Lessor having the right to apply the proceeds of sale to the amounts described
above in this clause (ii) in such order, proportion and priority as Lessor may
elect in its sole and absolute discretion. To the extent permitted by applicable
statutes, Trustee may postpone the sale of all or any portion of the Property by
public announcement at the time and place of sale, and from time to time
thereafter may again postpone that sale by public announcement or subsequently
noticed sale, and without further notice may make such sale at the time fixed at
the last postponement or may, in 




                                      -5-
<PAGE>   60

its discretion, give a new notice of sale. A sale of less than all of the
Property or any defective or irregular sale made hereunder shall not exhaust the
power of sale provided for herein, and subsequent sales may be made hereunder
until all of the Obligations have been satisfied or the entire Property has been
sold, without defect or irregularity. No action of Lessor or Trustee based upon
the provisions contained herein or contained in the applicable statutes,
including, without limitation, the giving of the Notice of Default and Election
to Sell or the Notice of Sale, shall constitute an election of remedies which
would preclude Lessor from pursuing judicial foreclosure before a completed sale
pursuant to the power of sale contained herein. Lessor shall have the right,
with the irrevocable consent of Lessee hereby given and evidenced by the
execution of this instrument, to obtain appointment of a receiver by any court
of competent jurisdiction without further notice to Lessee, which receiver shall
be authorized and empowered to enter upon and take possession of the Property,
including all personal property used upon or in connection with the real
property herein conveyed, to let the Property, to receive all the rents, issues
and profits, if any, which may be due or become due in respect to the leasing of
the Property to another party ("Property Rents"), and apply the Property Rents
after payment of all necessary charges and expenses to reduction of the
Obligations in such order, proportion and priority as Lessor may elect. At the
option of Lessor, the receiver shall accomplish entry and taking possession of
the Property by actual entry and possession or by notice to Lessee. The receiver
so appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be empowered to issue
receiver's certificates for funds advanced by Lessor for the purpose of
protecting the value of the Property as security for the Obligations. The
amounts evidenced by receiver's certificates shall bear interest at the Overdue
Rate and may be added to the Obligations if the Lessee or a junior lienholder
purchases the Property at the trustee's sale. Trustee or any successor acting
hereunder may resign and thereupon be discharged of the trusts hereunder upon
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lessor. Regardless of whether Trustee
resigns, Lessor may, from time to time, substitute a successor or successors to
any Trustee named herein or acting hereunder in accordance with any statutory
procedure for such substitution; or if Lessor, in its sole and absolute
discretion, so elects, and if permitted by law, Lessor may substitute such
successors or successors by recording, in the office of the recorder of the
county or counties where the Property is located, a document executed by Lessor
and containing the name of the original Lessee and Lessor hereunder, the book
and page where this instrument (or a memorandum hereof) is recorded (and/or
instrument number, as applicable) and the name of the new Trustee, which
instrument shall be conclusive proof of proper substitution of such successor
Trustee or Trustees, who shall, without conveyance from the predecessor Trustee,
succeed 




                                      -6-
<PAGE>   61

to the rights, powers and duties hereunder. It is acknowledged that A
POWER OF SALE HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THIS INSTRUMENT; A POWER OF SALE MAY ALLOW
LESSOR TO TAKE THE PROPERTY AND SELL THEM WITHOUT GOING TO COURT IN A
FORECLOSURE ACTION UPON DEFAULT BY LESSEE UNDER THIS INSTRUMENT.

         If (a) the Property shall consist of one or more parcels, whether or
not contiguous and whether or not located in the same county, or (b) in addition
to this Memorandum, the Lessor shall now or hereafter hold one or more
additional mortgages, liens, deeds of trust or other security (directly or
indirectly) for the Obligations upon other property in the State in which the
Property is located (whether or not such property is owned by Lessor or by
others) or (c) both the circumstances described in clauses (a) and (b) shall be
true, then to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Lessor may, in its sole
discretion, commence or consolidate in a single foreclosure action all
foreclosure proceedings against all such collateral securing the Obligations
(including the Property), which action may be brought or consolidated in the
courts of any county in which any of such collateral is located. The Lessee
acknowledges that the right to maintain a consolidated foreclosure action is a
specific inducement to the Lessor to extend the Advances, and the Lessor
expressly and irrevocably waives any objections to the commencement or
consolidation of the foreclosure proceedings in a single action and any
objections to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non
conveniens which it may now or hereafter have. The Lessee further agrees that if
the Lessor shall be prosecuting one or more foreclosure or other proceedings
against a portion of the Property or against any collateral other than the
Property, which collateral directly or indirectly secures the Obligations, or if
the Lessor shall have obtained a judgment of foreclosure and sale or similar
judgment against such collateral, then, whether or not such proceedings are
being maintained or judgments were obtained in or outside the State in which the
Property is located, the Lessor may commence or continue foreclosure proceedings
and exercise its other remedies granted in this Memorandum against all or any
part of the Property and the Lessor waives any objections to the commencement or
continuation of a foreclosure of this Memorandum or exercise of any other
remedies hereunder based on such other proceedings or judgments, and waives any
right to seek to dismiss, stay, remove, transfer or consolidate either any
action under this Memorandum or such other proceedings on such basis. Neither
the commencement nor continuation of proceedings to foreclose this Memorandum
nor the exercise of any other rights hereunder nor the recovery of any judgment
by the Lessor in any such proceedings shall prejudice, limit or preclude the
Lessor's right to commence or continue one or more foreclosure or other
proceedings or obtain a judgment against any other collateral (either in or
outside the State in which the Property is located) which 




                                      -7-
<PAGE>   62

directly or indirectly secures the Obligations, and the Lessor expressly waives
any objections to the commencement of, continuation of, or entry of a judgment
in such other proceedings or exercise of any remedies in such proceedings based
upon any action or judgment connected to this Memorandum, and the Lessor also
waives any right to seek to dismiss, stay, remove, transfer or consolidate
either such other proceedings or any action under this Memorandum on such basis.

         If the Lessor so elects, the Trustee may sell any personal property
covered by this instrument at one or more separate sales in any manner permitted
by the UCC. One or more exercises of the powers herein granted shall not
extinguish nor exhaust such powers until the entire Property is sold or until
the entire amounts evidenced and/or secured by the Lease and the Operative
Documents is paid in full.

         (d) Specifically, but without limiting the generality of subsection
(b), the Lessor and the Lessee further intend and agree that, with respect to
that portion of the Property constituting personal property, for the purpose of
securing the Lessee's obligations for the repayment of the above-described
obligations from the Lessor to the Lessee, (i) the Lease shall also be deemed to
be a security agreement and financing statement within the meaning of Article 9
of the UCC; (ii) the conveyance provided for hereby shall be deemed to be a
grant by the Lessee to the Lessor of a lien and security interest in all of the
Lessee's present and future right, title and interest in and to such portion of
the Property, including but not limited to the Lessee's leasehold estate therein
and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing
into cash, investments, securities or other property, whether in the form of
cash, investments, securities or other property to secure such obligations,
effective on the date hereof, to have and to hold such interests in the Property
unto the Lessor and its successors and assigns, forever, provided always that
these presents are upon the express condition that, if all amounts due under the
Lease shall have been paid and satisfied in full, then this instrument and the
estate hereby granted shall cease and become void; (iii) the possession by the
Lessor of notes and such other items of property as constitute instruments,
money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be "possession
by the secured party" for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant
to Section 9-305 of the UCC; and (iv) notifications to Persons holding such
property, and acknowledgements, receipts or confirmations from financial
intermediaries, bankers or agents (as applicable) of the Lessee shall be deemed
to have been given for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under
Applicable Law. The Lessor and the Lessee shall, to the extent consistent with
this Memorandum, take such actions and execute, deliver, file and record such
other

documents, financing statements, mortgages and deeds of trust as may be
necessary to ensure that, if the Lease were deemed to create a security interest
in the Property in accordance with this Section, such security interest would be
deemed to be a perfected security interest with priority over all Liens other
than Permitted Liens, under Applicable Law and will be maintained as such
throughout the Term.

         SECTION 5. Ratification. The terms and provisions of the Lease are
hereby ratified and confirmed and remain in full force and effect. In the event
of any conflict between the terms of the Lease and the terms of this Memorandum,
the terms of the Lease shall control.

         SECTION 6.  Supplemental Lease Term.

             84.8469%.

                  (c)  The Loan Margin for the Lease Supplement is 0.20%.

         SECTION 7.  Counterpart Execution.  This Memorandum may be executed in 
any number of counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, all such counterparts together constituting but one and the same
instrument.

         SECTION 8. Future Advances; Revolving Credit. In the event a court of
competent jurisdiction rules that this instrument constitutes a mortgage, deed
of trust or other secured financing as is the intent of the parties pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, then this instrument will be deemed given to secure not only
existing financing, but also future advances made pursuant to or as provided in
the Lease, whether such advances are obligatory or to be made at the option of
the Lessor, or otherwise, to the same extent as if such future advances were
made on the date of execution of this instrument, although there may be no
advance made at the time of execution hereof, and although there may be no
financing outstanding at the time any advance is made. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the lien of this instrument shall be valid as to all such
amounts, including all future advances, from the time this instrument is
recorded. Notwithstanding anything in this instrument to the contrary, although
the amount of the financing secured by this instrument may increase or decrease
from time to time, the maximum principal amount of the financing secured by this
instrument at any one time shall not exceed Fifty Three Million Dollars
($53,000,000), which amount shall be payable as set forth in the Lease, and in
any event the final payment shall be payable no later than

instrument, the Lease and the other Operative Documents, plus the total amount
of any advances made pursuant thereto to protect the collateral and the security
interest and lien created hereby, together with interest on all of the foregoing
as provided in the Operative Documents.

         SECTION 9. GOVERNING LAW. THE LEASE AND THIS MEMORANDUM SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

        THIS LEASE SUPPLEMENT NO. 2 AND MEMORANDUM OF LEASE AND DEED OF TRUST
(this "Memorandum") dated as of October 22, 1996, among SYMANTEC CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation, having a principal office at 10101 Torre Avenue,
Cupertino, California 95014, as the Lessee and as Mortgagor (the "Lessee"),
SUMITOMO BANK LEASING AND FINANCE, INC., as the Lessor (the "Lessor"), having an
address at 277 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10172, and FIRST AMERICAN TITLE
INSURANCE COMPANY (the "Trustee").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

        WHEREAS, the Lessor is the owner in fee simple of the land described on
Exhibit A attached hereto and all Improvements thereon (together, the
"Property");

        WHEREAS, the Lessor wishes to lease the Property to the Lessee and the
Lessee wishes to lease the Property from the Lessor;

        NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree to enter
into this Memorandum, as follows:

        1. Certain Terms. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in
this Memorandum have the meanings specified in Appendix A to the Master Lease
and Security Agreement dated as of October 18, 1996 (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Lease"), between the
Lessee and the Lessor; and the rules of interpretation specified in Appendix A
to the Lease shall apply to this Memorandum.

        2. Property. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the description of the
Property. Effective upon the execution and delivery of this Memorandum by the
Lessor and the Lessee, the Property shall be subject to the terms and provisions
of the Lease. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease, the Lessor
hereby leases the Property to the Lessee for the Term (as defined below) of this
Memorandum, and the Lessee hereby agrees, expressly for the direct benefit of
the Lessor, to lease the Property from the Lessor for the Term.


        3. Lease Term. The term of this Memorandum (the "Term") shall begin on
the date hereof and shall end on October 18, 2003 unless the Term with respect
to the Property is renewed or earlier terminated in accordance with the
provisions of the Lease or the other Operative Documents. For and in
consideration of good and valuable consideration paid by the Lessee to the
Lessor as described in the Lease, the Lessor hereby grants to the Lessee the
right to purchase the Property or to market and sell the Property during the
Term of this Memorandum on the terms set

<PAGE>   80

forth in the Lease.

        4. Ownership of the Property. (a) The parties hereto intend that (i) for
financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, the Lessor will be
treated as the owner and the lessor of the Properties and the Lessee will be
treated as the lessee of the Properties and (ii) for all other purposes,
including federal and all state and local income tax purposes, state real estate
and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (A) the Lease will be treated as a
financing arrangement, (B) the Lessor and the Lenders will be deemed lenders
making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to the sum of the Lessor Amount
and the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, which loans are secured by
the Properties and (C) the Lessee will be treated as the owner of the Properties
and will be entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of
properties like the Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the Lessee
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Lessor nor any of the Lenders has made
any representations or warranties to the Lessee concerning the tax, accounting
or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents and that the Lessee has
obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the
Operative Documents as it deems appropriate.

        (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Lease grants a
security interest and deed of trust or lien, as the case may be, on the Property
for the benefit of the Lessor to secure the Lessee's performance under and
payment of all amounts advanced by the Lessor for the acquisition of the
Property (corresponding to the value of the Property as indicated on the
Appraisal) under the Lease and the other Operative Documents, together with
interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under the Operative Documents in
connection therewith.

        (c) Specifically, without limiting the generality of subsection (b), the
Lessor and the Lessee intend and agree that with respect to the nature of the
transactions evidenced by the Lease in the context of the exercise of remedies
under the Operative Documents, including, without limitation, in the case of any
insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any State or Commonwealth thereof affecting the Lessee and
the Lessor, or any enforcement or collection actions, the transactions evidenced
by the Lease are loans made by the Lessor as unrelated third party lender to the
Lessee secured by the Property (it being understood that the Lessee hereby
mortgages, grants, bargains, sells, releases, confirms, conveys, assigns,
transfers and sets over to the Trustee for the benefit of the Lessor, and grants
a security interest in, the Property (consisting of a fee deed of trust with
respect to all right, 



                                      -2-
<PAGE>   81

title and interest of the Lessee in and to the fee title to, and reversionary
interest in, the Land and Improvements, if any, and a leasehold deed of trust on
the Lessee's leasehold estate under the Lease), all to secure such loans,
effective on the date hereof, to have and to hold such interests in the Property
unto the Trustee for the benefit of the Lessor and its successors and assigns,
forever, provided always that these presents are upon the express condition
that, if all amounts due under the Lease shall have been paid and satisfied in
full, then this instrument and the estate hereby granted shall cease and become
void.

        As additional security for the Rent, the Lease Balance and all other
sums owed to the Lessor by the Lessee under the Lease, the Lessee does hereby
grant, bargain, sell, transfer and convey unto the Trustee, its successors in
trust and assigns, IN TRUST, WITH POWER OF SALE, for the benefit of the Lessor,
all of the Lessee's right, title and interest in and to the Property, including,
without limitation, all buildings, structures and other improvements, and all
fixtures and other property now or hereafter attached to or affixed to any such
buildings, structures or other improvements, and any additions and alterations
thereto or replacements thereof, now or hereafter built, constructed or located
upon the Property, all rents, additional rents, issues, income, revenues,
distributions, royalties and profits now or in the future payable in respect of
the Property, together with all of the right, power and authority of the Lessee
to alter, modify or change the terms, conditions and provisions of the Lease and
any other lease pertaining to the Property, to consent to any request made by a
tenant or landlord pursuant thereto, or to surrender, cancel or terminate the
same or to accept any surrender, cancellation or termination of the same,
together with all of the options, rights, powers and privileges of the Lessee
under any lease pertaining to the Property, whether heretofore or hereafter
existing, including, without limitation, the rights and options to purchase the
Property contained in Articles XVIII and XX of the Lease, and all present and
future right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to (i) all refunds, tax
abatement agreements, rebates, reserves, deferred payments, deposits, cost
savings, awards and payments of any kind due from or payable by (a) any
Governmental Authority, or (b) any insurance or utility company, in each case
under clause (a) or (b) above in respect of the Property, and (ii) all refunds,
rebates and payments of any kind due from or payable by any Governmental
Authority for any taxes, assessments, or governmental or quasi-governmental
charges or levies imposed upon the Lessee in respect of the Property, and all
plans and specifications, designs, drawings and other information, materials and
matters heretofore or hereafter prepared relating to the Property or any
construction on the Property, all proceeds (including claims and demands
therefor) of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of any of the foregoing
into cash or 



                                      -3-
<PAGE>   82

liquidated claims, including without limitation the proceeds of insurance and
condemnation awards in respect of the Property or any portion thereof, all
additional estates, rights and interests hereafter acquired by the Lessee in the
Property, or any portion thereof, together with all proceeds of the conversion,
whether voluntary or involuntary, of any of the Property into cash or other
liquid claims, including without limitation, all awards, payments or proceeds,
including interest thereon, and the right to receive the same, which may be made
as a result of any casualty, any exercise of the right of eminent domain or deed
in lieu thereof, any injury to the Property and any defect in title in the
Property or other matter insured under any policy of title insurance, together
with attorney's fees, costs and disbursements incurred by the Lessor in
connection with the collection of such awards, payments and proceeds, and the
Lessee further grants to the Lessor, pursuant to the California Uniform
Commercial Code (the "UCC"), a security interest in all present and future
right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to any portion of the foregoing
property for which a security interest may be created under the UCC.

        To have and to hold the same whether now owned or held or hereafter
acquired unto the Trustee, its successors-in-trust forever, IN TRUST, WITH POWER
OF SALE, to secure to the Lessor the payment of the Rent, the Lease Balance and
all other sums owing to the Lessor under the Lease and the performance and
observance of the terms, covenants, warranties, conditions, agreements and
obligations under the Lease. If the Lessee shall pay all sums due under the
Lease when due according to the terms thereof and shall otherwise fully and
properly perform and comply with all of the obligations, agreements, terms and
conditions of the Lease, then this conveyance shall become null and void.

        In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default, then the entire
unpaid balance of all sums due under the Lease and the interest accrued thereon
shall, at the option of the owner thereof and without notice, immediately become
due and payable for all purposes, whether or not due according to the maturity
date or dates thereof; and all other indebtedness, the payment of which is
secured hereby, shall likewise become due and payable. The Trustee and the
Lessor and each of them are authorized prior or subsequent to the institution of
any foreclosure proceedings to enter upon the Property or any part thereof and
to take possession of the Property and exercise without interference from the
Lessee, any and all rights which the Lessee has with respect to the management,
possession, operation, protection or preservation of the Property.

        Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lessor shall have the power
and authority, after proper notice and lapse of such time as may be required by
law, to cause Trustee to sell the Property 



                                      -4-

<PAGE>   83

by notifying Trustee of that election and depositing with Trustee this
instrument and receipts and evidence of expenditures made and secured hereby as
Trustee may reasonably require. Upon receipt of any such notice from Lessor,
Trustee shall cause to be recorded, published and delivered to Lessee such
Notice of Default and Election to Sell as is then required by applicable
statutory authority and by this instrument, which notice shall set forth, among
other things, the nature of the breach(es) or default(s), the action(s) required
to effect a cure thereof and the time period within which that cure may be
effected. If no cure is effected within the statutory time limits following
recordation of the Notice of Default and Election to Sell and after Notice of
Sale has been given as required by the above-referenced statutes, Trustee may
without further notice or demand sell and convey the Property in accordance with
the above-referenced statutes. The Property may be sold as a whole or in
separate lots, parcels or items and in such order as Lessor may direct, at
public auction to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of the United
States payable at the time of sale. Trustee shall deliver to such purchaser(s) a
good and sufficient deed or deeds conveying the property so sold, but without
any covenant or warranty express or implied. The recitals in such deed of any
matter or fact shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any
Person, including Lessee, Trustee or Lessor, may purchase at any sale. After
deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Lessor and Trustee, including costs of
evidence of title in connection with any sale, Lessor shall apply the proceeds
of sale, in the following order of priority, to payment of the following
(collectively, the "Obligations"): (i) first, all amounts expended by or for the
account of Lessor under the terms hereof and not then repaid, with accrued
interest at the Overdue Rate; and (ii) second, all other amounts then due and
owing hereunder including, without limitation, all Basic Rent, Supplemental
Rent, the full amount of the Lease Balance as of the date of sale as if the
Lease had been terminated with respect to all of the Properties then subject to
the Lease under Section 18.1, and all other amounts then payable by Lessee under
the Lease and the other Operative Documents, with Lessor having the right to
apply the proceeds of sale to the amounts described above in this clause (ii) in
such order, proportion and priority as Lessor may elect in its sole and absolute
discretion. To the extent permitted by applicable statutes, Trustee may postpone
the sale of all or any portion of the Property by public announcement at the
time and place of sale, and from time to time thereafter may again postpone that
sale by public announcement or subsequently noticed sale, and without further
notice may make such sale at the time fixed at the last postponement or may, in
its discretion, give a new notice of sale. A sale of less than all of the
Property or any defective or irregular sale made hereunder shall not exhaust the
power of sale provided for herein, and subsequent sales may be made hereunder
until all of 



                                      -5-
<PAGE>   84

the Obligations have been satisfied or the entire Property has been sold,
without defect or irregularity. No action of Lessor or Trustee based upon the
provisions contained herein or contained in the applicable statutes, including,
without limitation, the giving of the Notice of Default and Election to Sell or
the Notice of Sale, shall constitute an election of remedies which would
preclude Lessor from pursuing judicial foreclosure before a completed sale
pursuant to the power of sale contained herein. Lessor shall have the right,
with the irrevocable consent of Lessee hereby given and evidenced by the
execution of this instrument, to obtain appointment of a receiver by any court
of competent jurisdiction without further notice to Lessee, which receiver shall
be authorized and empowered to enter upon and take possession of the Property,
including all personal property used upon or in connection with the real
property herein conveyed, to let the Property, to receive all the rents, issues
and profits, if any, which may be due or become due in respect to the leasing of
the Property to another party ("Property Rents"), and apply the Property Rents
after payment of all necessary charges and expenses to reduction of the
Obligations in such order, proportion and priority as Lessor may elect. At the
option of Lessor, the receiver shall accomplish entry and taking possession of
the Property by actual entry and possession or by notice to Lessee. The receiver
so appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be empowered to issue
receiver's certificates for funds advanced by Lessor for the purpose of
protecting the value of the Property as security for the Obligations. The
amounts evidenced by receiver's certificates shall bear interest at the Overdue
Rate and may be added to the Obligations if the Lessee or a junior lienholder
purchases the Property at the trustee's sale. Trustee or any successor acting
hereunder may resign and thereupon be discharged of the trusts hereunder upon
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lessor. Regardless of whether Trustee
resigns, Lessor may, from time to time, substitute a successor or successors to
any Trustee named herein or acting hereunder in accordance with any statutory
procedure for such substitution; or if Lessor, in its sole and absolute
discretion, so elects, and if permitted by law, Lessor may substitute such
successors or successors by recording, in the office of the recorder of the
county or counties where the Property is located, a document executed by Lessor
and containing the name of the original Lessee and Lessor hereunder, the book
and page where this instrument (or a memorandum hereof) is recorded (and/or
instrument number, as applicable) and the name of the new Trustee, which
instrument shall be conclusive proof of proper substitution of such successor
Trustee or Trustees, who shall, without conveyance from the predecessor Trustee,
succeed to the rights, powers and duties hereunder. It is acknowledged that A
POWER OF SALE HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THIS INSTRUMENT; A POWER OF SALE MAY ALLOW
LESSOR TO TAKE THE PROPERTY AND SELL THEM WITHOUT GOING TO COURT IN A
FORECLOSURE ACTION UPON DEFAULT BY 



                                      -6-
<PAGE>   85

LESSEE UNDER THIS INSTRUMENT.

        If (a) the Property shall consist of one or more parcels, whether or not
contiguous and whether or not located in the same county, or (b) in addition to
this Memorandum, the Lessor shall now or hereafter hold one or more additional
mortgages, liens, deeds of trust or other security (directly or indirectly) for
the Obligations upon other property in the State in which the Property is
located (whether or not such property is owned by Lessor or by others) or (c)
both the circumstances described in clauses (a) and (b) shall be true, then to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the Lessor may, in its sole discretion,
commence or consolidate in a single foreclosure action all foreclosure
proceedings against all such collateral securing the Obligations (including the
Property), which action may be brought or consolidated in the courts of any
county in which any of such collateral is located. The Lessee acknowledges that
the right to maintain a consolidated foreclosure action is a specific inducement
to the Lessor to extend the Advances, and the Lessor expressly and irrevocably
waives any objections to the commencement or consolidation of the foreclosure
proceedings in a single action and any objections to the laying of venue or
based on the grounds of forum non conveniens which it may now or hereafter have.
The Lessee further agrees that if the Lessor shall be prosecuting one or more
foreclosure or other proceedings against a portion of the Property or against
any collateral other than the Property, which collateral directly or indirectly
secures the Obligations, or if the Lessor shall have obtained a judgment of
foreclosure and sale or similar judgment against such collateral, then, whether
or not such proceedings are being maintained or judgments were obtained in or
outside the State in which the Property is located, the Lessor may commence or
continue foreclosure proceedings and exercise its other remedies granted in this
Memorandum against all or any part of the Property and the Lessor waives any
objections to the commencement or continuation of a foreclosure of this
Memorandum or exercise of any other remedies hereunder based on such other
proceedings or judgments, and waives any right to seek to dismiss, stay, remove,
transfer or consolidate either any action under this Memorandum or such other
proceedings on such basis. Neither the commencement nor continuation of
proceedings to foreclose this Memorandum nor the exercise of any other rights
hereunder nor the recovery of any judgment by the Lessor in any such proceedings
shall prejudice, limit or preclude the Lessor's right to commence or continue
one or more foreclosure or other proceedings or obtain a judgment against any
other collateral (either in or outside the State in which the Property is
located) which directly or indirectly secures the Obligations, and the Lessor
expressly waives any objections to the commencement of, continuation of, or
entry of a judgment in such other proceedings or exercise of any remedies in
such proceedings based upon any 



                                      -7-
<PAGE>   86

action or judgment connected to this Memorandum, and the Lessor also waives any
right to seek to dismiss, stay, remove, transfer or consolidate either such
other proceedings or any action under this Memorandum on such basis.

        If the Lessor so elects, the Trustee may sell any personal property
covered by this instrument at one or more separate sales in any manner permitted
by the UCC. One or more exercises of the powers herein granted shall not
extinguish nor exhaust such powers until the entire Property is sold or until
the entire amounts evidenced and/or secured by the Lease and the Operative
Documents is paid in full.

        (d) Specifically, but without limiting the generality of subsection (b),
the Lessor and the Lessee further intend and agree that, with respect to that
portion of the Property constituting personal property, for the purpose of
securing the Lessee's obligations for the repayment of the above-described
obligations from the Lessor to the Lessee, (i) the Lease shall also be deemed to
be a security agreement and financing statement within the meaning of Article 9
of the UCC; (ii) the conveyance provided for hereby shall be deemed to be a
grant by the Lessee to the Lessor of a lien and security interest in all of the
Lessee's present and future right, title and interest in and to such portion of
the Property, including but not limited to the Lessee's leasehold estate therein
and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing
into cash, investments, securities or other property, whether in the form of
cash, investments, securities or other property to secure such obligations,
effective on the date hereof, to have and to hold such interests in the Property
unto the Lessor and its successors and assigns, forever, provided always that
these presents are upon the express condition that, if all amounts due under the
Lease shall have been paid and satisfied in full, then this instrument and the
estate hereby granted shall cease and become void; (iii) the possession by the
Lessor of notes and such other items of property as constitute instruments,
money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be "possession
by the secured party" for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant
to Section 9-305 of the UCC; and (iv) notifications to Persons holding such
property, and acknowledgements, receipts or confirmations from financial
intermediaries, bankers or agents (as applicable) of the Lessee shall be deemed
to have been given for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under
Applicable Law. The Lessor and the Lessee shall, to the extent consistent with
this Memorandum, take such actions and execute, deliver, file and record such
other documents, financing statements, mortgages and deeds of trust as may be
necessary to ensure that, if the Lease were deemed to create a security interest
in the Property in accordance with this Section, such security interest would be
deemed to be a 



                                      -8-
<PAGE>   87

perfected security interest with priority over all Liens other than Permitted
Liens, under Applicable Law and will be maintained as such throughout the Term.

        SECTION 5. Ratification. The terms and provisions of the Lease are
hereby ratified and confirmed and remain in full force and effect. In the event
of any conflict between the terms of the Lease and the terms of this Memorandum,
the terms of the Lease shall control.

        SECTION 6.  Supplemental Lease Term.

               (a)  The Lenders' Percentage for the Lease Supplement is
        84.8469%.

               (b)  The Lessor Margin for this Lease Supplement is 0.695%

               (c)  The Loan Margin for the Lease Supplement is 0.20%.

        SECTION 7. Counterpart Execution. This Memorandum may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, all such counterparts together constituting but one and the same
instrument.

        SECTION 8. Future Advances; Revolving Credit. In the event a court of
competent jurisdiction rules that this instrument constitutes a mortgage, deed
of trust or other secured financing as is the intent of the parties pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, then this instrument will be deemed given to secure not only
existing financing, but also future advances made pursuant to or as provided in
the Lease, whether such advances are obligatory or to be made at the option of
the Lessor, or otherwise, to the same extent as if such future advances were
made on the date of execution of this instrument, although there may be no
advance made at the time of execution hereof, and although there may be no
financing outstanding at the time any advance is made. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the lien of this instrument shall be valid as to all such

         THIS LEASE SUPPLEMENT NO. 3 AND MEMORANDUM OF LEASE AND DEED OF TRUST
(this "Memorandum") dated as of February 5, 1997, among SYMANTEC CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation, having a principal office at 10101 Torre Avenue,
Cupertino, California 95014, as the Lessee and as Mortgagor (the "Lessee"),
SUMITOMO BANK LEASING AND FINANCE, INC., as the Lessor (the "Lessor"), having an
address at 277 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10172, and FIRST AMERICAN TITLE
INSURANCE COMPANY (the "Trustee").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Lessor is the owner in fee simple of the land described on
Exhibit A attached hereto and all Improvements thereon (together, the
"Property");

         WHEREAS, the Lessor wishes to lease the Property to the Lessee and the
Lessee wishes to lease the Property from the Lessor;

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree to enter
into this Memorandum, as follows:

         I.       Certain Terms.  Capitalized terms used but not otherwise 
defined in this Memorandum have the meanings specified in Appendix A to the
Master Lease and Security Agreement dated as of October 18, 1996 (as amended,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Lease"),
between the Lessee and the Lessor; and the rules of interpretation specified in
Appendix A to the Lease shall apply to this Memorandum.

         2. Property. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the description of the
Property. Effective upon the execution and delivery of this Memorandum by the
Lessor and the Lessee, the Property shall be subject to the terms and provisions
of the Lease. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease, the Lessor
hereby leases the Property to the Lessee for the Term (as defined below) of this
Memorandum, and the Lessee hereby agrees, expressly for the direct benefit of
the Lessor, to lease the Property from the Lessor for the Term.

         3. Lease Term. The term of this Memorandum (the "Term") shall begin on
the date hereof and shall end on October 18, 2003 unless the Term with respect
to the Property is renewed or earlier terminated in accordance with the
provisions of the Lease or the other Operative Documents. For and in
consideration of good and valuable consideration paid by the Lessee to the
Lessor as described in the Lease, the Lessor hereby grants to the Lessee the
right to purchase the Property or to market and sell the 



<PAGE>   95

Property during the Term of this Memorandum on the terms set forth in the Lease.

         4. Ownership of the Property. (a) The parties hereto intend that (i)
for financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, the Lessor will be
treated as the owner and the lessor of the Properties and the Lessee will be
treated as the lessee of the Properties and (ii) for all other purposes,
including federal and all state and local income tax purposes, state real estate
and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (A) the Lease will be treated as a
financing arrangement, (B) the Lessor and the Lenders will be deemed lenders
making loans to the Lessee in an amount equal to the sum of the Lessor Amount
and the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, which loans are secured by
the Properties and (C) the Lessee will be treated as the owner of the Properties
and will be entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of
properties like the Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the Lessee
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Lessor nor any of the Lenders has made
any representations or warranties to the Lessee concerning the tax, accounting
or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents and that the Lessee has
obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the
Operative Documents as it deems appropriate.

         (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Lease grants a
security interest and deed of trust or lien, as the case may be, on the Property
for the benefit of the Lessor to secure the Lessee's performance under and
payment of all amounts advanced by the Lessor for the acquisition of the
Property (corresponding to the value of the Property as indicated on the
Appraisal) under the Lease and the other Operative Documents, together with
interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under the Operative Documents in
connection therewith.

         (c) Specifically, without limiting the generality of subsection (b),
the Lessor and the Lessee intend and agree that with respect to the nature of
the transactions evidenced by the Lease in the context of the exercise of
remedies under the Operative Documents, including, without limitation, in the
case of any insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the
United States bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute
of the United States of America or any State or Commonwealth thereof affecting
the Lessee and the Lessor, or any enforcement or collection actions, the
transactions evidenced by the Lease are loans made by the Lessor as unrelated
third party lender to the Lessee secured by the Property (it being understood
that the Lessee hereby mortgages, grants, bargains, sells, releases, confirms,
conveys, assigns, transfers and sets over to the Trustee for the benefit of the
Lessor, and grants a security interest in, the Property 



                                      -2-
<PAGE>   96

(consisting of a fee deed of trust with respect to all right, title and interest
of the Lessee in and to the fee title to, and reversionary interest in, the Land
and Improvements, if any, and a leasehold deed of trust on the Lessee's
leasehold estate under the Lease), all to secure such loans, effective on the
date hereof, to have and to hold such interests in the Property unto the Trustee
for the benefit of the Lessor and its successors and assigns, forever, provided
always that these presents are upon the express condition that, if all amounts
due under the Lease shall have been paid and satisfied in full, then this
instrument and the estate hereby granted shall cease and become void.

         As additional security for the Rent, the Lease Balance and all other
sums owed to the Lessor by the Lessee under the Lease, the Lessee does hereby
grant, bargain, sell, transfer and convey unto the Trustee, its successors in
trust and assigns, IN TRUST, WITH POWER OF SALE, for the benefit of the Lessor,
all of the Lessee's right, title and interest in and to the Property, including,
without limitation, all buildings, structures and other improvements, and all
fixtures and other property now or hereafter attached to or affixed to any such
buildings, structures or other improvements, and any additions and alterations
thereto or replacements thereof, now or hereafter built, constructed or located
upon the Property, all rents, additional rents, issues, income, revenues,
distributions, royalties and profits now or in the future payable in respect of
the Property, together with all of the right, power and authority of the Lessee
to alter, modify or change the terms, conditions and provisions of the Lease and
any other lease pertaining to the Property, to consent to any request made by a
tenant or landlord pursuant thereto, or to surrender, cancel or terminate the
same or to accept any surrender, cancellation or termination of the same,
together with all of the options, rights, powers and privileges of the Lessee
under any lease pertaining to the Property, whether heretofore or hereafter
existing, including, without limitation, the rights and options to purchase the
Property contained in Articles XVIII and XX of the Lease, and all present and
future right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to (i) all refunds, tax
abatement agreements, rebates, reserves, deferred payments, deposits, cost
savings, awards and payments of any kind due from or payable by (a) any
Governmental Authority, or (b) any insurance or utility company, in each case
under clause (a) or (b) above in respect of the Property, and (ii) all refunds,
rebates and payments of any kind due from or payable by any Governmental
Authority for any taxes, assessments, or governmental or quasi-governmental
charges or levies imposed upon the Lessee in respect of the Property, and all
plans and specifications, designs, drawings and other information, materials and
matters heretofore or hereafter prepared relating to the Property or any
construction on the Property, all proceeds (including claims and demands
therefor) of the conversion, 




                                      -3-
<PAGE>   97

voluntary or involuntary, of any of the foregoing into cash or liquidated
claims, including without limitation the proceeds of insurance and condemnation
awards in respect of the Property or any portion thereof, all additional
estates, rights and interests hereafter acquired by the Lessee in the Property,
or any portion thereof, together with all proceeds of the conversion, whether
voluntary or involuntary, of any of the Property into cash or other liquid
claims, including without limitation, all awards, payments or proceeds,
including interest thereon, and the right to receive the same, which may be made
as a result of any casualty, any exercise of the right of eminent domain or deed
in lieu thereof, any injury to the Property and any defect in title in the
Property or other matter insured under any policy of title insurance, together
with attorney's fees, costs and disbursements incurred by the Lessor in
connection with the collection of such awards, payments and proceeds, and the
Lessee further grants to the Lessor, pursuant to the California Uniform
Commercial Code (the "UCC"), a security interest in all present and future
right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to any portion of the foregoing
property for which a security interest may be created under the UCC.

         To have and to hold the same whether now owned or held or hereafter
acquired unto the Trustee, its successors-in-trust forever, IN TRUST, WITH POWER
OF SALE, to secure to the Lessor the payment of the Rent, the Lease Balance and
all other sums owing to the Lessor under the Lease and the performance and
observance of the terms, covenants, warranties, conditions, agreements and
obligations under the Lease. If the Lessee shall pay all sums due under the
Lease when due according to the terms thereof and shall otherwise fully and
properly perform and comply with all of the obligations, agreements, terms and
conditions of the Lease, then this conveyance shall become null and void.

         In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default, then the entire
unpaid balance of all sums due under the Lease and the interest accrued thereon
shall, at the option of the owner thereof and without notice, immediately become
due and payable for all purposes, whether or not due according to the maturity
date or dates thereof; and all other indebtedness, the payment of which is
secured hereby, shall likewise become due and payable. The Trustee and the
Lessor and each of them are authorized prior or subsequent to the institution of
any foreclosure proceedings to enter upon the Property or any part thereof and
to take possession of the Property and exercise without interference from the
Lessee, any and all rights which the Lessee has with respect to the management,
possession, operation, protection or preservation of the Property.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lessor shall have the power
and authority, after proper notice and lapse of such time 




                                      -4-
<PAGE>   98

as may be required by law, to cause Trustee to sell the Property by notifying
Trustee of that election and depositing with Trustee this instrument and
receipts and evidence of expenditures made and secured hereby as Trustee may
reasonably require. Upon receipt of any such notice from Lessor, Trustee shall
cause to be recorded, published and delivered to Lessee such Notice of Default
and Election to Sell as is then required by applicable statutory authority and
by this instrument, which notice shall set forth, among other things, the nature
of the breach(es) or default(s), the action(s) required to effect a cure thereof
and the time period within which that cure may be effected. If no cure is
effected within the statutory time limits following recordation of the Notice of
Default and Election to Sell and after Notice of Sale has been given as required
by the above-referenced statutes, Trustee may without further notice or demand
sell and convey the Property in accordance with the above-referenced statutes.
The Property may be sold as a whole or in separate lots, parcels or items and in
such order as Lessor may direct, at public auction to the highest bidder for
cash in lawful money of the United States payable at the time of sale. Trustee
shall deliver to such purchaser(s) a good and sufficient deed or deeds conveying
the property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty express or implied.
The recitals in such deed of any matter or fact shall be conclusive proof of the
truthfulness thereof. Any Person, including Lessee, Trustee or Lessor, may
purchase at any sale. After deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Lessor and
Trustee, including costs of evidence of title in connection with any sale,
Lessor shall apply the proceeds of sale, in the following order of priority, to
payment of the following (collectively, the "Obligations"): (i) first, all
amounts expended by or for the account of Lessor under the terms hereof and not
then repaid, with accrued interest at the Overdue Rate; and (ii) second, all
other amounts then due and owing hereunder including, without limitation, all
Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, the full amount of the Lease Balance as of the
date of sale as if the Lease had been terminated with respect to all of the
Properties then subject to the Lease under Section 18.1, and all other amounts
then payable by Lessee under the Lease and the other Operative Documents, with
Lessor having the right to apply the proceeds of sale to the amounts described
above in this clause (ii) in such order, proportion and priority as Lessor may
elect in its sole and absolute discretion. To the extent permitted by applicable
statutes, Trustee may postpone the sale of all or any portion of the Property by
public announcement at the time and place of sale, and from time to time
thereafter may again postpone that sale by public announcement or subsequently
noticed sale, and without further notice may make such sale at the time fixed at
the last postponement or may, in its discretion, give a new notice of sale. A
sale of less than all of the Property or any defective or irregular sale made
hereunder shall not exhaust the power of sale provided for




                                      -5-
<PAGE>   99

herein, and subsequent sales may be made hereunder until all of the Obligations
have been satisfied or the entire Property has been sold, without defect or
irregularity. No action of Lessor or Trustee based upon the provisions contained
herein or contained in the applicable statutes, including, without limitation,
the giving of the Notice of Default and Election to Sell or the Notice of Sale,
shall constitute an election of remedies which would preclude Lessor from
pursuing judicial foreclosure before a completed sale pursuant to the power of
sale contained herein. Lessor shall have the right, with the irrevocable consent
of Lessee hereby given and evidenced by the execution of this instrument, to
obtain appointment of a receiver by any court of competent jurisdiction without
further notice to Lessee, which receiver shall be authorized and empowered to
enter upon and take possession of the Property, including all personal property
used upon or in connection with the real property herein conveyed, to let the
Property, to receive all the rents, issues and profits, if any, which may be due
or become due in respect to the leasing of the Property to another party
("Property Rents"), and apply the Property Rents after payment of all necessary
charges and expenses to reduction of the Obligations in such order, proportion
and priority as Lessor may elect. At the option of Lessor, the receiver shall
accomplish entry and taking possession of the Property by actual entry and
possession or by notice to Lessee. The receiver so appointed by a court of
competent jurisdiction shall be empowered to issue receiver's certificates for
funds advanced by Lessor for the purpose of protecting the value of the Property
as security for the Obligations. The amounts evidenced by receiver's
certificates shall bear interest at the Overdue Rate and may be added to the
Obligations if the Lessee or a junior lienholder purchases the Property at the
trustee's sale. Trustee or any successor acting hereunder may resign and
thereupon be discharged of the trusts hereunder upon thirty (30) days' prior
written notice to Lessor. Regardless of whether Trustee resigns, Lessor may,
from time to time, substitute a successor or successors to any Trustee named
herein or acting hereunder in accordance with any statutory procedure for such
substitution; or if Lessor, in its sole and absolute discretion, so elects, and
if permitted by law, Lessor may substitute such successors or successors by
recording, in the office of the recorder of the county or counties where the
Property is located, a document executed by Lessor and containing the name of
the original Lessee and Lessor hereunder, the book and page where this
instrument (or a memorandum hereof) is recorded (and/or instrument number, as
applicable) and the name of the new Trustee, which instrument shall be
conclusive proof of proper substitution of such successor Trustee or Trustees,
who shall, without conveyance from the predecessor Trustee, succeed to the
rights, powers and duties hereunder. It is acknowledged that A POWER OF SALE HAS

WITHOUT GOING TO COURT IN A FORECLOSURE ACTION UPON DEFAULT BY LESSEE UNDER THIS
INSTRUMENT.

         If (a) the Property shall consist of one or more parcels, whether or
not contiguous and whether or not located in the same county, or (b) in addition
to this Memorandum, the Lessor shall now or hereafter hold one or more
additional mortgages, liens, deeds of trust or other security (directly or
indirectly) for the Obligations upon other property in the State in which the
Property is located (whether or not such property is owned by Lessor or by
others) or (c) both the circumstances described in clauses (a) and (b) shall be
true, then to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Lessor may, in its sole
discretion, commence or consolidate in a single foreclosure action all
foreclosure proceedings against all such collateral securing the Obligations
(including the Property), which action may be brought or consolidated in the
courts of any county in which any of such collateral is located. The Lessee
acknowledges that the right to maintain a consolidated foreclosure action is a
specific inducement to the Lessor to extend the Advances, and the Lessor
expressly and irrevocably waives any objections to the commencement or
consolidation of the foreclosure proceedings in a single action and any
objections to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non
conveniens which it may now or hereafter have. The Lessee further agrees that if
the Lessor shall be prosecuting one or more foreclosure or other proceedings
against a portion of the Property or against any collateral other than the
Property, which collateral directly or indirectly secures the Obligations, or if
the Lessor shall have obtained a judgment of foreclosure and sale or similar
judgment against such collateral, then, whether or not such proceedings are
being maintained or judgments were obtained in or outside the State in which the
Property is located, the Lessor may commence or continue foreclosure proceedings
and exercise its other remedies granted in this Memorandum against all or any
part of the Property and the Lessor waives any objections to the commencement or
continuation of a foreclosure of this Memorandum or exercise of any other
remedies hereunder based on such other proceedings or judgments, and waives any
right to seek to dismiss, stay, remove, transfer or consolidate either any
action under this Memorandum or such other proceedings on such basis. Neither
the commencement nor continuation of proceedings to foreclose this Memorandum
nor the exercise of any other rights hereunder nor the recovery of any judgment
by the Lessor in any such proceedings shall prejudice, limit or preclude the
Lessor's right to commence or continue one or more foreclosure or other
proceedings or obtain a judgment against any other collateral (either in or
outside the State in which the Property is located) which directly or indirectly
secures the Obligations, and the Lessor expressly waives any objections to the
commencement of, continuation of, or entry of a judgment in such other
proceedings 




                                      -7-
<PAGE>   101

or exercise of any remedies in such proceedings based upon any action or
judgment connected to this Memorandum, and the Lessor also waives any right to
seek to dismiss, stay, remove, transfer or consolidate either such other
proceedings or any action under this Memorandum on such basis.

         If the Lessor so elects, the Trustee may sell any personal property
covered by this instrument at one or more separate sales in any manner permitted
by the UCC. One or more exercises of the powers herein granted shall not
extinguish nor exhaust such powers until the entire Property is sold or until
the entire amounts evidenced and/or secured by the Lease and the Operative
Documents is paid in full.

         (d) Specifically, but without limiting the generality of subsection
(b), the Lessor and the Lessee further intend and agree that, with respect to
that portion of the Property constituting personal property, for the purpose of
securing the Lessee's obligations for the repayment of the above-described
obligations from the Lessor to the Lessee, (i) the Lease shall also be deemed to
be a security agreement and financing statement within the meaning of Article 9
of the UCC; (ii) the conveyance provided for hereby shall be deemed to be a
grant by the Lessee to the Lessor of a lien and security interest in all of the
Lessee's present and future right, title and interest in and to such portion of
the Property, including but not limited to the Lessee's leasehold estate therein
and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing
into cash, investments, securities or other property, whether in the form of
cash, investments, securities or other property to secure such obligations,
effective on the date hereof, to have and to hold such interests in the Property
unto the Lessor and its successors and assigns, forever, provided always that
these presents are upon the express condition that, if all amounts due under the
Lease shall have been paid and satisfied in full, then this instrument and the
estate hereby granted shall cease and become void; (iii) the possession by the
Lessor of notes and such other items of property as constitute instruments,
money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be "possession
by the secured party" for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant
to Section 9-305 of the UCC; and (iv) notifications to Persons holding such
property, and acknowledgements, receipts or confirmations from financial
intermediaries, bankers or agents (as applicable) of the Lessee shall be deemed
to have been given for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under
Applicable Law. The Lessor and the Lessee shall, to the extent consistent with
this Memorandum, take such actions and execute, deliver, file and record such
other documents, financing statements, mortgages and deeds of trust as may be
necessary to ensure that, if the Lease were deemed to create a security interest
in the Property in accordance with 




                                      -8-
<PAGE>   102

this Section, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security
interest with priority over all Liens other than Permitted Liens, under
Applicable Law and will be maintained as such throughout the Term.

         SECTION 5. Ratification. The terms and provisions of the Lease are
hereby ratified and confirmed and remain in full force and effect. In the event
of any conflict between the terms of the Lease and the terms of this Memorandum,
the terms of the Lease shall control.

         SECTION 6.  Supplemental Lease Term.

                  (a)  The Lenders' Percentage for the Lease Supplement is
             97.0%.

                  (b)  The Lessor Margin for this Lease Supplement is 2.70%

                  (c)  The Loan Margin for the Lease Supplement is 0.20%.

         SECTION 7.  Counterpart Execution.  This Memorandum may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, all such counterparts together constituting but one and the same
instrument.

         SECTION 8. Future Advances; Revolving Credit. In the event a court of
competent jurisdiction rules that this instrument constitutes a mortgage, deed
of trust or other secured financing as is the intent of the parties pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, then this instrument will be deemed given to secure not only
existing financing, but also future advances made pursuant to or as provided in
the Lease, whether such advances are obligatory or to be made at the option of
the Lessor, or otherwise, to the same extent as if such future advances were
made on the date of execution of this instrument, although there may be no
advance made at the time of execution hereof, and although there may be no
financing outstanding at the time any advance is made. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the lien of this instrument shall be valid as to all such
amounts, including all future advances, from the time this instrument is
recorded. Notwithstanding anything in this instrument to the contrary, although
the amount of the financing secured by this instrument may increase or decrease
from time to time, the maximum principal amount of the financing secured by this
instrument at any one time shall not exceed Fifty Three Million Dollars
($53,000,000), which amount shall be payable as set forth in the Lease, and in
any event the final payment shall be payable no later than October 18, 2003,
plus all costs of enforcement and collection of this instrument, the Lease and
the other Operative Documents, plus the total amount of any advances made
pursuant thereto to 




                                      -9-
<PAGE>   103

protect the collateral and the security interest and lien created hereby,
together with interest on all of the foregoing as provided in the Operative
Documents.

         SECTION 9. GOVERNING LAW. THE LEASE AND THIS MEMORANDUM SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

                                                    Assignment of Lease and Rent

         5. Validity. The Lessor represents and warrants (on a continuing basis)
and covenants to the Lenders that (a) the Lessor has not assigned or executed
any assignment of, and will not assign or execute any assignment of, the
Lessor's interest in any of the Assigned Leases, in any Contract, in any Rents
or in any other subject matter of this Assignment to anyone other than the
Lenders and any assignment, designation or direction by the Lessor inconsistent
herewith shall be void, and (b) the Lessor has not done any act or executed any
document that impairs the rights of the Lenders to the Leases or the Rents under
this Assignment.

         6. The Lessor Remains Liable. While the assignment made hereby is
present, direct and continuing, it has been made for the purpose of providing
the Lenders with security for the performance of the Lessor's obligations under
the Loan Agreement and the Notes and the execution and delivery hereof shall not
impair or diminish in any way the obligations of the Lessor under the Assigned
Leases, or impose any of such obligations on the Lenders. This Assignment shall
not operate to cause the Lenders (or their designee) to be regarded as a
mortgagee in possession. Neither the Lenders nor their designee shall be
responsible or liable for performing any of the obligations of the Lessor under
any of the Assigned Leases or any Contract, for any waste by the Lessee or
others, for any dangerous or defective conditions of any Property, for
negligence in the management, upkeep, repair or control of any Property or any
other act or omission by any other Person. Nothing contained herein shall
operate or be construed to (a) obligate the Lenders (or their designee) to
assume the obligations of the Lessor under any of the Assigned Leases or any
Contract, to perform any of the terms and conditions contained in any of the
Assigned Leases or any Contract or otherwise to impose any obligation upon the
Lenders with respect to any of the Assigned Leases or any Contract or (b) place
upon the Lenders (or their designee) any responsibility for the operation,
control, care, management or repair of any Property or any part thereof. Subject
at all times to the terms and conditions of this Assignment, the Lessor will at
all times promptly and faithfully perform in all respects, or cause to be
performed in all respects, all of its covenants, conditions and agreements
contained in the Assigned Leases or any Contract now or hereafter existing on
the part of the Lessor to be kept and performed.

         7. Amendments; Lessee's Consent. The Lessor will not enter into any
agreement subordinating, amending, extending or terminating any of the Assigned
Leases except as provided in Section 14.5 of the Participation Agreement, and
any such

                                                    Assignment of Lease and Rent

attempted subordination, amendment, modification, extension or termination
without compliance with such Section 14.5 shall be void. If any of the Assigned
Leases or any Contract shall be amended, it shall continue to be subject to the
provisions hereof without the necessity of any further act by any of the parties
hereto. The Lessor and the Lenders hereby consent to the provisions of Lessee's
Consent attached to this Assignment and agree to be bound thereby.

         8. Termination of this Assignment. This Assignment shall continue in
full force and effect until all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of any
kind now or hereafter due to the Lenders from the Lessor or the Lessee under or
with respect to the Loan Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents, or
which are otherwise secured hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising or
incurred, have been fully paid, performed and satisfied, at which time this
Assignment will terminate.

         9. Ongoing Right to Collect Rents; Receivers. If notwithstanding the
terms of this Assignment, a petition or order for sequestration of rents, or the
appointment of a receiver or some similar judicial action or order is deemed
required under applicable state law to allow the Lenders to continue to collect
the moneys described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) and (c) of this Assignment, then it
is agreed by the Lessor that any proof of claim or similar document filed by the
Lenders in connection with the breach or rejection of any Lease by the lessee
thereunder or the trustee of any lessee under any federal or state insolvency
statute shall for the purpose of perfecting the Lenders' rights conferred in
said paragraphs be deemed to constitute action required under such state law.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Loan Agreement Event of
Default (not existing solely by virtue of a Lease Event of Default), the Lessor
hereby consents to the appointment of a receiver for any or all of the
Properties as a matter of right and without any requirement for notice to the
Lessor and without regard to the solvency of the Lessor or to the collateral
that may be available for the satisfaction of the Notes and all other
obligations under the Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents.

         10. Amendment. This Assignment may not be amended or otherwise modified
except by a writing signed by the Lessor, the Agent and, if required by Section
14.5 of the Participation Agreement, the Lessee, in accordance with the terms of
the Participation Agreement.

         11. Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals and
other instruments under this Assignment shall be 




                                      -6-

                                                    Assignment of Lease and Rent

made in accordance with the notice provisions of the Participation Agreement.

         12. Successors and Assigns. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties in this Assignment by the Lessor and the Lenders shall bind, and
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, their respective successors
and assigns, whether or not so expressed.

         13. Severability. If any provision or provisions, or if any portion of
any provision or provisions, in this Assignment is found by a court of law of
competent jurisdiction to be in violation of any local, state or Federal
ordinance, statute, law, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy,
and if such court should declare such portion, provision or provisions to be
illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the
intent of the parties hereto that such portion, provision or provisions shall be
given force to the fullest possible extent that they are legal, valid and
enforceable, that the remainder of this Assignment shall be construed as if such
illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable portion, provision or
provisions were not contained therein, and that the rights, obligations and
interests of the Lessor, the Lenders and the Lessee under the remainder of this
Assignment shall continue in full force and effect.

         14. Governing Law. THIS ASSIGNMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
THE LESSOR UNDER THIS ASSIGNMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WITHOUT
REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

         15. Counterparts. This Assignment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         16. Conflicts. In the event of any conflicts between the terms and
provisions hereof and the terms and provisions of the other Operative Documents,
the terms and provisions of the other Operative Documents shall be controlling.

         17. Non-Disturbance. So long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Lenders will take no action to disturb the Lessee's
rights to quiet enjoyment of each Property as set forth in Section 4.1 of the
Master Lease.

                            REPRESENTATIONS OF LESSEE

      SECTION IV.1.  Representations of Lessee.  The Lessee represents and
warrants to each of the other parties as follows:

            (a) Representations in Operative Documents. The representations and
      warranties of the Lessee set forth in the Operative Documents (including,
      without limitation, the representations and warranties set forth in
      Section 8.2 of the Participation Agreement) are true and correct in all
      material respects on and as of the Improvements Closing Date except to the
      extent such representations or warranties relate solely to an earlier
      date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been
      true and correct on and as of such earlier date. No Event of Default has
      occurred and is continuing and no Default of which the Lessee has
      knowledge and that has not been previously disclosed to the Agent and the
      Participants has occurred and is continuing under the Master Lease, the
      Construction Agency Agreement or, to the knowledge of the Lessee, any
      other Operative Document. No Default or Event of Default under the Master
      Lease, the Construction Agency Agreement or, to the knowledge of the
      Lessee, any other Operative Document, will occur as a result of, or after
      giving effect to, the transactions contemplated hereby.

            (b) Due Authorization, Non-Contravention, etc. The execution,
      delivery and performance by the Lessee of this Amendment and each other
      Operative Document executed or to be executed by it in connection with
      this Amendment are within the Lessee's corporate powers, have been duly
      authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not

                  (i)  contravene the Lessee's Organic Documents;

                  (ii) contravene any material contractual restriction the
            contravention of which is reasonably likely to have a material
            adverse effect on the financial condition of the Lessee (including
            any covenant relating to the incurrence of indebtedness, which
            restrictions the Lessee hereby acknowledges are material), law or
            governmental regulation or court decree or order binding on or
            affecting the Lessee; or

                  (iii) result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any
            Lien on any of the Lessee's properties (including the Properties)
            other than as are contemplated by the Operative Documents.

            (c) Governmental Approval, Regulation, etc. No authorization or
      approval or other action by, and not notice to or filing with, any
      governmental authority or regulatory body or other Person is required for
      the due execution, delivery or performance by the Lessee of this Amendment
      or any other Operative Document to be executed by it in connection with
      this Amendment.

            (d) Validity, etc. This Amendment constitutes, and each other
      Operative Document executed by the Lessee in connection with this
      Amendment will, on the due execution and delivery thereof, constitute, the
      legal, valid and binding obligations of the Lessee enforceable in
      accordance with their respective terms, subject, in each case, as to
      enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other
      similar laws affecting enforcement of creditor rights generally (insofar
      as any such law relates to the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
      similar event of the Lessee) and, as to the availability of specific
      performance or other injunctive relief, subject to the discretionary power
      of a court to deny such relief and to general equitable principles.

representations, warranties or covenants under the Operative Documents, or (c)

        Deposit, with interest thereon, will be referred to hereinafter,
        collectively, as the "Deposit"); and

                (c)     The balance of the Purchase Price shall be paid at time
        of Closing by Federal wire transfer, with the transfer of funds to
        Seller to be completed on the day of the Closing.

        The Deposit shall be paid to Seller at the Closing as a credit against
the Purchase Price. Purchaser shall provide the Title Company with its tax


                                                                         Page 2

identification number, and all interest shall be for Purchaser's account for
tax purposes.

        In addition to the Deposit, Purchaser shall deposit five fully executed
copies of this Agreement with the Title Company immediately after both parties
have executed it. The date of such deposit shall be acknowledged by the Title
Company on all copies, and such date shall be the "Effective Date" of this
Agreement. The Title Company shall retain one copy of this Agreement and
deliver two copies hereof to each of Purchaser and Seller.

                                  Article III.

                                Failure to Close

        3.1     Purchaser's Default.

IF SELLER HAS COMPLIED WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED
HEREIN AND IS READY, WILLING AND ABLE TO CONVEY THE PROPERTY IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THIS AGREEMENT AND PURCHASER FAILS TO CONSUMMATE THIS AGREEMENT AND TAKE TITLE,
THEN THE PARTIES HERETO RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT THE DAMAGES THAT SELLER WILL
SUSTAIN AS A RESULT THEREOF WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL, BUT DIFFICULT IF NOT
IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN. THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, IN THE EVENT OF
PURCHASER'S DEFAULT, SELLER SHALL, AS ITS SOLE REMEDY, BE ENTITLED TO RETAIN
THE DEPOSIT AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY FURTHER
RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT
FOR THE SURVIVING COVENANTS (HEREINAFTER DEFINED).

        SELLER'S INITIALS:                      PURCHASER'S INITIALS:
                          -------                                    -------

        3.2     Seller's Default. In the event that Purchaser has complied with
all of the covenants and conditions contained herein and is ready, willing and
able to take title to the Property in accordance with this Agreement, and
Seller fails to consummate this Agreement and convey title as set forth


                                                                         Page 3
<PAGE>   7
herein, then Purchaser shall have, as its sole and exclusive remedy the right
to either (i) terminate this contract and recover the Deposit and all of
Purchaser's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with
its due diligence investigation of the Property pursuant to this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, costs of obtaining environmental reports,
appraisals and engineering reports), or (ii) pursue the remedy of specific
performance of Seller's obligations under this Agreement, provided however that
(a) Purchaser must furnish ten (10) days prior written notice to Seller of its
intent and election to seek specific enforcement of this Agreement, and (b)
Purchaser must not be in default under this Agreement. In the event that either
of the conditions set forth in (a) or (b) above is not satisfied, the remedy of
specific performance shall be deemed waived by Purchaser.

        Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary contained herein,
if Purchaser seeks specific performance under this Agreement, Purchaser agrees
to accept the Property in its "WHERE IS, AS IS" condition. Purchaser further
hereby agrees that prior to its exercise of any right or remedies as a result
of any defaults by Seller, Purchaser will first deliver written notice of said
default to Seller and give Seller ten (10) days thereafter in which to cure
said default, if Seller so elects. Except as specifically provided herein,
Purchaser shall have no right to seek money damages of any kind as a result of
any default by Seller under any of the terms of this Agreement. Purchaser's
claim and any recovery of damages shall be limited to direct damages from
Seller's breach of this Agreement, and in no event shall Seller be liable to
Purchaser for any punitive, speculative, incidental, consequential or any
other type of damages. If for any reason the remedy of specific performance is
denied Purchaser following all available court proceedings, or Purchaser
discontinues the action for specific performance, then the Deposit, if
applicable, shall be returned to Purchaser and Seller shall then be released
from any further liability to Purchaser in reference to this Agreement.



                                                                        Page 4

                                  Article IV.
                         Closing and Transfer of Title

        4.1  Closing.  The parties hereto agree to conduct a closing of this
sale (the "Closing") on or before 10:00 a.m. E.S.T. on October 22, 1996
("Closing Date") in the principal office of Morrison & Foerster, or at such
other place as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto. This Agreement shall
terminate if transfer of title is not completed by the Closing Date (unless
such failure to close is due to Seller's default, the date for Closing is
extended pursuant to any provision hereof, including, without limitation, the
matters described in Sections 6.3, 6.5 and Article VII hereof, or the date for
Closing is extended by agreement of the parties, which agreement shall be
confirmed in writing).

        4.2  Closing Procedure.  Seller shall execute and deliver or cause to
be delivered (a) a Grant Deed, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, proper
for recording, conveying Seller's interest in the Real Property to Purchaser,
subject, however, to (i) exceptions as reported in the Title Report (defined in
Section 6.5) and either approved by Purchaser or as to which objection has been
waived by Purchaser, or as shown on the Survey (as defined in Section 6.4),
(ii) taxes not yet delinquent, (iii) the rights of lessees and licensees of
space in the Improvements at the time of Closing (to the extent such lessees
and licensees are listed on the Rent Roll), and (iv) any encumbrances created
or permitted by the terms of this Agreement; (b) a Bill of Sale in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D, dated as of the date of Closing conveying to
Purchaser any and all Personal Property; (c) an Assignment of Leases in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit E, dated the date of Closing, assigning all of
the landlord's right, title and interest in and to any tenant and other leases
covering all or any portion of the Real Property; (d) an Owner's Title
Insurance Policy (the "Owner's Title Policy") dated no earlier than the date of
the recording of the Deed, in the full amount of the Purchase Price, insuring
that good and indefeasible fee simple 

                                                                        Page 5
<PAGE>   9

title to the Property is vested in Purchaser, containing no exceptions to such
title other than the standard printed exceptions (provided, however, that (i)
the printed survey exception must be deleted, except for matters shown on the
Survey, (ii) the exception as to ad valorem taxes shall be limited to taxes for
the current and subsequent years, and (iii) the exception for tenants and
parties in possession shall be limited to those tenants, licensees, and
occupants shown on the Rent Roll delivered at Closing), those items listed on
Schedule "B" of the Title Report that either were approved by Purchaser or as
to which objection has been waived by Purchaser or cured by Seller (but only as
to the portion of such encumbrance remaining after such cure), and encumbrances
created or permitted by the terms of this Agreement; (e) Tenant Notification
Agreements (the "Tenant Notices"), dated the date of the Closing, executed by
Seller, and complying with applicable statutes in order to relieve Seller of
liability for tenant security deposits (provided the security deposits are paid
to Purchaser), notifying the tenants of the Real Property that the Property has
been sold to Purchaser and directing the tenants to pay rentals to Purchaser
(or Purchaser's designated agent); (f) the originals of all leases and, to the
extent in Seller's possession or under Seller's control, as-built plans and
specifications and maintenance and service contracts that are to be assumed;
(g) a tenant estoppel certificate executed by Canon, in form and substance
satisfactory to Purchaser, which certificate shall identify the lease documents
and state the date of commencement and termination of the lease term, the rent
currently being paid, the amount of any rental payments made in advance, if any,
the amount of any security deposit, if any, that no party is in default under
the lease, and the date to which rent has been paid and shall list any renewal
options that exist, (except that Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts to
obtain such estoppel certificates from all other tenants of space in the
Improvements other than Purchaser, and Seller shall represent and warrant to
the best of Seller's knowledge as to the same matters for all leases shown on
the Rent Roll (except the lease to Purchaser) for which no tenant estoppel
certificate was obtained); (h) an updated Rent Roll, in the form of the Rent
Roll attached 

                                                                        Page 6
<PAGE>   10

hereto as Exhibit B, dated within 15 days of the date of the Closing; (i) an
affidavit that Seller is not a "foreign person" in the form attached as Exhibit
G and the corresponding California Form 590 RE Form; (j) a master key or
duplicate key for all locks in the Improvements; and (k) to the extent in the
possession of Seller or Seller's property management company, all maintenance
records.

        Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller is under no obligation to
clear from the title any easements, rights of way, encumbrances, liens,
covenants, restrictions, or any other matters of record, or to cure any survey
objections of Purchaser, or to create any encumbrances on, or for the benefit
of, the Property, except any monetary liens or encumbrances against the
Property created by Seller on or after the Effective Date and any existing
mortgages or deeds of trust encumbering the Property (which shall be satisfied
in full by Seller on or before the Closing Date). Except as set forth above, if
Seller does not deliver title at Closing in form consistent with the Title
Report as approved or deemed approved in accordance with the terms hereof, such
failure shall not constitute a default or breach by Seller hereunder, and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser's sole and
exclusive remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement and receive a return of
the Deposit or to accept conveyance of title as delivered by Seller without
reduction of the Purchase Price.

        4.3  Purchaser's Performance.  At the Closing, Purchaser will cause the
Purchase Price to be delivered to the Title Company, will execute and deliver
the Tenant Notices, the Assignment of Leases, and the Bill of Sale.

        4.4  Evidence of Authority; Miscellaneous.  Both parties will deliver
to the Title Company and each other such evidence or documents as may
reasonably be required by the Title Company or either party hereto evidencing 

                                                                        Page 7
<PAGE>   11

the power and authority of Seller and Purchaser and the due authority of, and
execution and delivery by, any person or persons who are executing any of the
documents required hereunder in connection with the sale of the Property. Both
parties will execute and deliver such other documents as are reasonably
required to effect the intent of this Agreement.

                                   Article V.

                        Prorations of Rents, Taxes, Etc.

        Real estate taxes for the year of closing shall be prorated as of the
date of Closing either using actual tax figures or, if actual figures are not
available, then using as a basis for said proration the most recent assessed
value of the Real Estate multiplied by the current tax rate, with a subsequent
cash adjustment to be made between Purchaser and Seller when actual tax figures
are available. Personal property taxes, annual permit or inspection fees, sewer
charges and other expenses normal to the operation and maintenance of the
Property shall also be prorated as of the date of Closing. Rents that have been
collected for the month of the Closing will be prorated at the Closing, effect
as of the date of the Closing. With regard to rents that are delinquent as of
the date of the Closing, (i) no proration will be made at the Closing, (ii)
Purchaser will make a good faith effort after the Closing to collect the rents
in the usual course of Purchaser's operation of the Property, and (iii)
Purchaser will apply all rents collected first to the current rents and the
excess amount, if any, shall be applied to the delinquent rent owed to Seller.
It is agreed, however, that Purchaser will not be obligated to institute any
lawsuit or other collection procedures to collect delinquent rents. Rents
collected by Purchaser after the Closing Date, to which Seller is entitled,
shall be promptly paid to Seller.

        As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be entitled to a credit for any
tenant deposits under the leases.

                                                                        Page 8
<PAGE>   12
        Final readings on all gas, water and electric meters shall be made as
of the date of closing, if possible. If final readings are not possible, gas,
water and electricity charges will be prorated based on the most recent period
for which costs are available. Any deposits made by Seller with utility
companies shall be returned to Seller. Purchaser shall be responsible for
making all arrangements for the continuation of utility services. After the
Closing, Purchaser will assume full responsibility for all security deposits
and advance rental deposits of current tenants of the Real Property currently
held by Seller, which items will be itemized by Seller and transferred and paid
over to Purchaser at the Closing.

        All items (including taxes) that are not subject to an exact
determination shall be estimated by the parties. When any item so estimated is,
after the Closing capable of exact determination, the party in possession of
the facts necessary to make the determination shall send the other party a
detailed report on the exact determination so made and the parties shall adjust
the prior estimate within thirty (30) days after both parties have received
said reports.


                                  ARTICLE VI.

                    Purchaser Inspections and Contingencies

        6.1     Document Inspection. Seller has made or will make available
within ten (10) days from the Effective Date of this Agreement the following
items relating to the Real Property for review by Purchaser, to the extent in
Seller's or its property manager's possession:
        1.      Copies of all leases and other occupancy agreements applicable
                to the Property;
        2.      Copies of all licenses and permits regarding the Property;
        3.      Seller's existing survey of the Property;
        4.      Copies of any warranties or guarantees currently in effect (if
                any);


                                                                        Page 9
<PAGE>   13
        5.      As-built plans and specifications for the improvements on the
                Property and any soil reports, environmental reports,
                engineering and architectural studies, grading plans,
                topographical maps, and similar data relating to the Property;
        6.      A copy of Seller's policy of lender's title insurance;
        7.      Copies of all service and maintenance agreements;
        8.      A Rent Roll prepared as of the first day of the month in which
                this Agreement is executed; and
        9.      Books and records of the Property.

        Purchaser acknowledges that Seller took title to the Property through
deed in lieu of foreclosure on March 1, 1995, and that Seller has limited
records and knowledge pertaining to prior periods of time.

        Seller shall also provide to Purchaser on or before two (2) business
days before the expiration of the Feasibility Period an updated Rent Roll for
the Property for review by Purchaser.

        Purchaser agrees that if for any reason the Closing is not consummated,
Purchaser will immediately return to Seller all materials furnished to
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.1.

        6.2     Physical Inspection. In addition to the items set forth in
Section 6.1, Seller will make the Property available for inspection by
Purchaser and Purchaser shall, at Purchaser's option and risk, conduct an
engineering and/or market and economic feasibility study of the Property and
undertake such physical inspection of the Property as Purchaser deems
appropriate as soon as possible after the Effective Date of this Agreement.
Such inspection shall be conducted at reasonable times upon reasonable oral or
written notice to Seller's property manager. Seller shall have the right to
designate a representative to accompany Purchaser's employees, agents, and
independent contractors on any such inspections.


                                                                        Page 10


<PAGE>   14
        Purchaser hereby agrees to pay, protect, defend, indemnify and save
Seller harmless against all liabilities, obligations, claims (including
mechanic's lien claims), damages, penalties, causes of action, judgments, costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses)
imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against Seller in connection with or
arising out of the entry upon the Real Property by Purchaser's employees,
agents or independent contractors and the actions of such persons on the Real
Property. In the event any part of the Property is damaged or excavated by
Purchaser, its employees, agents or independent contractors, Purchaser agrees
in the event its purchase hereunder is not consummated, to make such additional
payments to Seller as may be reasonably required to return the Property to its
condition immediately prior to such damage or excavation or, at Seller's
option, to cause such work to be done. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary herein, Purchaser's obligations under this subparagraph shall survive
the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and shall survive Closing.

        6.3     Feasibility Period. Purchaser shall have a period ending 5:00
p.m. E.D.T. September 19, 1996 to conduct its inspection of the documents
delivered in accordance with Section 6.1 and to conduct a physical inspection
of the Property as set forth in Section 6.2 (the "Feasibility Period"). On or
before the last day of the Feasibility Period, Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion without obligation to specify which aspect of its inspection was
unsatisfactory, terminate this Agreement by providing a written notice to
Seller so providing. Upon receipt of such notice, this Agreement shall
terminate and Seller shall instruct the Title Company to return the Deposit to
Purchaser, and neither party shall have any obligation to the other, except for
the Surviving Covenants. If Purchaser fails to provide such notice of
termination on or before the last day of the Feasibility Period, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have approved such inspections and this contract shall
remain in full force and effect.




                                                                     Page 11
<PAGE>   15
        6.4     Survey. Purchaser shall obtain, within ten (10) business days of
the Effective Date of this Agreement, a survey of the Real Property by a
registered surveyor (the "Survey"). The Survey shall show the location of all
improvements, structures, driveways, parking areas, easements, rights of way,
and any encroachments and shall specify whether the Property is within the 100
year flood plain or flood way. The Survey shall further set forth a legal
description of the boundaries of the Real Property in accordance with local
practices. Purchaser's obligations hereunder do not constitute a contingency
for closing under this Agreement.

        6.5     Title Contingency. Purchaser's obligation to purchase the
Property is subject to its receipt of a preliminary title report (the "Title
Report"), issued by the Title Company, together with legible copies of all
items and documents referred to in the Title Report. Purchaser acknowledges
that the Title Report and accompanying documents have been delivered to
Purchaser by Seller. Purchaser shall have until the last day of the
Feasibility Period to state any objections in writing. This contingency shall
be deemed satisfied or waived if such written notice of objection is not
received by Seller before such date. Such written notice of objection shall
state all of Purchaser's objections with specificity. Upon receipt of such
notice, Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, cure such objection, except
for monetary encumbrances in an amount in the aggregate below $100,000. If
Seller cures such objections within 15 days, or, if such objections are such
that they cannot be cured within 15 days and Seller has commenced curing such
objections and thereafter diligently proceeds to perfect such cure, then this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the Closing Date shall be
adjusted accordingly. If Seller is unable or chooses not to cure such
objections within the time permitted, then this Agreement shall terminate, and
Seller shall instruct the Title Company to return the Deposit to Purchaser, and
neither party shall have any further obligations hereunder except for the
Surviving Covenants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Purchaser may
waive such objections that Seller is unable or chooses not to cure within 10




                                                                        Page 12
<PAGE>   16
days after receipt of a notice that Seller is unable or chooses not to cure
such objections, and upon receipt by Seller of such waiver in full from
Purchaser, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with no
reduction in the Purchase Price.

        If required by Seller, Purchaser will confirm in writing whether this
title contingency has been satisfied and, if so, the date on which it was
satisfied.


                                  Article VII.

                      Loss due to Casualty or Condemnation

        7.1     Loss due to Condemnation. In the event of a condemnation of all
or a Substantial Portion of the Real Property which condemnation shall or would
render a Substantial Portion of the Real Property untenantable, or if any
portion of the building or parking area is taken, either party may, upon
written notice to the other party given within 10 days of receipt of notice of
such event, cancel this Agreement, in which event Seller shall instruct the
Title Company to return the Deposit to Purchaser, this Agreement shall
terminate and neither party shall have any rights or obligations hereunder
except for the Surviving Covenants. In the event that neither party elects to
terminate, or if the condemnation affects less than a Substantial Portion or
does not affect the building or parking area, then this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect, and Seller shall be entitled to all monies received
or collected by reason of such condemnation prior to closing. In such event,
the transaction hereby contemplated shall close in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement except that there will be an abatement of the
Purchase Price equal to the amount of the net proceeds, less costs and
attorney's fees, which are received by Seller by reason of such condemnation
prior to closing. If the condemnation proceeding shall not have been concluded
prior to the closing, then there shall be no abatement of the Purchase Price
and Seller shall assign any interest it has in the pending




                                                                        Page 13
<PAGE>   17
award to Purchaser. For purposes of this Section 7.1, a Substantial Portion
shall mean a condemnation of in excess of $5,000,000 in value of the Real
Property.

        7.2     Loss due to Casualty. In the event of Substantial Loss or Damage
to the Real Property by fire or other casualty, either party may, upon written
notice to the other party given within 10 days of receipt of notice of such
event, cancel this Agreement in which event Seller shall instruct the Title
Company to return the Deposit to Purchaser and this Agreement shall terminate
and neither party shall have any rights or obligations hereunder except for the
Surviving Covenants. In the event that neither party elects to terminate, then
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, the transaction hereby
contemplated shall close in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement except that Seller shall assign to Purchaser its rights to all
insurance proceeds by reason of such damage or loss, and there will be an
abatement of the Purchase Price equal to the amount of any loss not covered by
insurance, including without limitation the amount of any deductible, provided
that such abatement will be reduced by the amount expended by Seller in
accordance with Article VIII hereof for restoration or preservation of the
Property following the casualty. In the event that the casualty results in less
than Substantial Loss or Damage and the repair or replacement will take no more
than sixty (60) days to complete, Seller shall repair or replace the damaged
Property, and there shall be no abatement of the Purchase Price in such case. In
the event that the casualty results in less than Substantial Loss or Damage and
the repair or replacement will take more than sixty (60) days to complete, the
transaction hereby contemplated shall close in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement except that Seller shall assign to Purchaser its
rights to all insurance proceeds by reason of such damage or loss, and there
will be an abatement of the Purchase Price equal to the amount of any loss not
covered by insurance, including without limitation the amount of any deductible,
provided that such abatement will be reduced by the amount expended by Seller in
accordance with Article VIII hereof for restoration or preservation of the
Property following the casualty. In no event shall the date of Closing be
extended beyond sixty (60) days pursuant to this Section 7.2. For purposes of
this Section 7.2, "Substantial Loss or Damage" shall mean loss or damage, the
cost for repair of which exceeds $500,000.


                                                                         Page 14
<PAGE>   18
                                 Article VIII.

                          Maintenance of the Property

        Between the time of execution of this Agreement and the Closing, Seller
shall maintain the Property in good repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted,
shall perform all work required to be done under the terms of any lease or
agreement relating to the Property, and shall timely make all repairs,
maintenance and replacements of equipment or improvements, the same as though
Seller were retaining the Property; except that in the event of a fire or other
casualty, damage or loss, Seller shall have no duty to repair said damage.
However, Seller may repair any such damage with Purchaser's prior, written
approval and may, without Purchaser's approval, repair damage where such repair
is necessary in Seller's reasonable opinion to preserve and protect the health
and safety of tenants of the Property or to preserve the Property from imminent
risk of further damage or if required to do so by Seller's insurance carrier.
Any such emergency repairs shall be reported to Purchaser within 48 hours of
their completion. During the period prior to the Closing and after the latest
to occur of (i) the last day of the Feasibility Period, or (ii) the date on
which the title contingency in Section 6.5 is satisfied, Seller shall not lease
any portion of the Real Property unless such lease has been approved in writing
by Purchaser. Any such proposed lease shall be on Seller's standard form of
lease and shall be reviewed and approved or rejected within five (5) business
days after receipt thereof by Purchaser. Failure to approve or reject such
proposed lease within such period shall be deemed approval. If the proposed
lease is rejected, then Seller shall not enter into such lease. With respect to

Purchaser shall pay the unamortized cost (based on the number of months in the
entire term of the lease for which rent is paid and the number of such months
that shall have occurred as of the date of the Closing) of all tenant
improvements and leasing commissions with respect thereto.

                                  Article IX.

                                     Broker

        Purchaser and Seller represent to each other that they have dealt with
no agent or broker who in any way has participated as a procuring cause of the
sale of the Property, except Cornish & Carey Commercial ("Cornish"),
Cooper/Brady ("Cooper/Brady"), and McCandless Management Company
("McCandless"). At Closing, Seller shall be responsible for any real estate
brokerage commissions due to Cornish and McCandless in connection with this
transaction, each pursuant to a separate written agreement. In addition, Seller
shall be responsible for a real estate brokerage commission of three-quarters
of one percent (.75%) to Cooper/Brady at the Closing. Purchaser and Seller each
agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other for any and all
judgments, costs of suit, attorneys' fees, and other reasonable expenses which
the other may incur by reason of any action or claim against the other by any
broker, agent, or finder with whom the indemnifying party has dealt arising out
of this Agreement or any subsequent sale of the Property to Purchaser, except
for the above-described commissions, which shall be paid by Seller. The
provisions of this Article IX shall survive the Closing and any termination of
this Agreement.

foregoing) representations as to the physical nature or condition of the
Property or the capabilities thereof, and that Purchaser, in executing,
delivering and/or performing this Agreement, does not rely upon any statement

representations and warranties and agrees that Purchaser's obligations under
this Agreement are conditioned upon the truth and accuracy of such

Closing:

        (a)     Seller has the corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and convey the Property to Purchaser.

        (b)     To the best of Seller's knowledge, Seller has received no
notice of any existing, pending or threatened litigation, administrative
proceeding 

                                                                        Page 17
<PAGE>   21
or condemnation or sale in lieu thereof, with respect to any portion of the
Real Property, except as noted on Exhibit H attached hereto.

        (c)     Except for those tenants and licensees in possession of the
Real Property under written leases or license Agreements for space in the Real
Property, as shown in the Rent Roll, to the best of Seller's knowledge there
are no parties in possession of, or claiming any possession to, any portion of
the Real Property as leases, tenants at sufferance, licensees, trespassers or
otherwise.

        (d)     The updated Rent Roll for the Real Property, which shall be
delivered at the Closing, will be true, correct and complete as of the date set
forth thereon; no tenant will be entitled to any rebates, rent concessions, or
free rent (other than as reflected in said Rent Roll) and no rents due under
any of the tenant or other leases will have been assigned, hypothecated, or
encumbered, to any party except pursuant to documents to be released at Closing.

        (e)     There are no attachments or executions affecting the Property,
general assignments for the benefit of creditors, or voluntary or involuntary
proceedings in bankruptcy, pending or, to the best of Seller's knowledge,
threatened against Seller.

        (f)     During the period of Seller's ownership of the Property (i.e.
from March 1, 1995 to the Date of Closing) Seller has not itself, and to the
best of Seller's knowledge no prior owner or current or prior tenant or other
occupant of all or any part of the Property at any time has, used Hazardous
Materials (hereinafter defined) on, from, or affecting the Property in any
manner that violates federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, rules, or
regulations governing the use, storage, treatment, transportation, generation,
or disposal of Hazardous Materials (collectively, the "Environmental Laws"),
and to the best of Seller's knowledge no Hazardous Materials are present



                                                                        Page 18

"Hazardous Materials" shall mean any flammable substances, explosives,
radioactive materials, hazardous wastes, toxic substances, pollutants,
pollution, or related materials regulated under any of the Environmental Laws.

        10.3    Seller's Knowledge. Whenever the term "to the best of Seller's
knowledge" is used in this Agreement or in any representations and warranties
given to Purchaser at Closing, such knowledge shall be the actual knowledge of
Thomas W. Johnson and Leon Pouncy (the "Key Personnel"), the asset manager
assigned to the Real Property by CIGNA Investments, Inc., authorized agent for
Seller, after review of the files of CIGNA Investments, Inc. and inquiry of
Seller's property manager. Seller shall have no duty to conduct any further
inquiry in making any such representations and warranties, and no knowledge of
any other person shall be imputed to the Key Personnel. Purchaser acknowledges
that Seller took title to the Property through deed in lieu of foreclosure on
March 1, 1995, and that Seller has limited records and knowledge pertaining to
prior periods of time.

        10.4    Survival. All representations and warranties contained in
Section 10.2 will survive the Closing of this transaction (but only as to the
status of facts as they exist as of the Closing, it being understood that
Seller makes no representations or warranties which would apply to changes or
other matters occurring after the Closing), but shall expire on the date one
year from the date of Closing, and no action on such representations and
warranties may be commenced after such expiration.

      Property deemed appropriate by Buyer to aid Buyer in determining whether

      Buyer's sole discretion, at any time prior to the end of the Feasibility
      Period to terminate this Agreement. Upon such election to terminate, the
      Deposit together with interest earned thereon shall be returned to Buyer.
      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall have the
      right to approve the following during the Feasibility Period:

              3.2.1.1. SITE APPRAISAL. An appraisal of the Property at Buyer's
              expense;

              conditions concerning, without limitation, (i) the stability and
              load bearing capacity of the soil, and (ii) the presence of
              Hazardous Material on or under the Property or the potential for
              migration of Hazardous Material onto or under the Property from
              other property; provided, however, Buyer agrees not to perform any
              drilling without giving Seller notice at least two (2) business
              days in advance.

              3.2.1.5. FINANCING. Buyer shall have obtained a binding commitment
              of an institutional lender to provide financing for Buyer's

<PAGE>   7

              Property on terms satisfactory to Buyer. In connection therewith,
              Seller agrees to cooperate, at no expense to Seller, in the
              assignment of this Agreement to a third party selected by Buyer.

              3.2.1.6. BOARD APPROVAL. Buyer's obligations under this Agreement
              are conditioned upon the approval of this Agreement and the
              purchase contemplated hereby by Buyer's Board of Directors prior
              to the end of the Feasibility Period.

      3.2.2. APPROVAL OF CONDITION OF TITLE. Seller shall obtain and deliver to
      Buyer within five (5) days of the Agreement Date a Title Report together
      with full and complete copies of all documents referenced as exceptions
      therein and a plotting of all easements referred to as exceptions therein.
      This Agreement is contingent on Buyer's approval of the condition of title
      of the Property as shown in such Title Report. If Seller and Escrow holder
      are not notified in writing of Buyer's disapproval thereof by the later of
      (i) the end of the Feasibility Period or (ii) ten (10) days after Buyer
      receives such Title Report, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved the
      condition of title as reflected in such Title Report. In case of Buyer's
      timely objection, Seller shall have ten (10) days from receipt of Buyer's
      notice of objection to inform Buyer and Escrow Holder in writing whether
      Seller shall use its best efforts to remove such disapproved exceptions
      prior to the Closing. In the event Seller agrees that Seller shall use its
      best efforts to remove such disapproved exceptions, such removal shall be
      a condition to the Closing and the condition of title as shown on the
      Title Report shall otherwise be deemed approved. In the event that Seller
      is unwilling or unable to remove such disapproved exceptions or fails to
      notify Buyer and Escrow Holder whether it shall use its best efforts to
      remove such exceptions, Buyer shall have ten (10) days from the first to
      occur of (a) the date of receipt of Seller's notice, or (b) the expiration
      of Seller's ten (10) day notice period, to inform Seller and Escrow Holder
      whether Buyer is waiving its disapproval of such exceptions. In the event
      Buyer fails to waive such disapproval, the condition of title shall be
      deemed disapproved and this condition shall be deemed to have failed. All
      matters shown on the Title Report, which are not disapproved by Buyer or
      for which Buyer waives its disapproval, shall be deemed to be Permitted
      Exceptions.

      3.2.3. ASSIGNMENT OF PLANS. At Closing, Seller shall assign, at no cost to
      Buyer, in form acceptable to Buyer, all of Seller's assignable rights in
      the Property Documents.

      3.2.4. REMOVAL OF ENCUMBRANCES. On or before the Scheduled Closing Date,
      Seller shall have, at Seller's sole cost and expense and to Buyer's
      satisfaction, removed the effect on title to the Property, or any portion
      thereof, of any 


                                       7

      any other monetary or similar encumbrances.

      and tenant of the Property pursuant to a lease with Seller as Landlord
      (the "Existing Lease"). The following conditions shall be satisfied by
      Seller or waived by Buyer as of the Closing Date:

              3.2.5.1. LEASE TERMINATION. The Existing Lease shall be deemed
              terminated without the necessity of any further documentation
              between Seller and Symantec Corporation; provided, however, if
              requested by Symantec Corporation, Seller agrees to execute
              documentation confirming the termination of the Existing Lease.

Agreement:

              upon Buyer's delivery to Seller, by the end of the Feasibility
              Period, of Buyer's written election to proceed with the purchase
              of the Property. If Buyer elects to proceed in Buyer's sole
              discretion with the purchase after the Feasibility Period, Buyer

the failure of conditions intended to benefit Buyer as set forth in this Article
3. or Schedule "3" attached hereto or terminated by Seller on account of the

event of a default by Seller or a failure of a condition which is for the
benefit of the Buyer.

purchase the Property and Seller's obligation to sell the Property shall be
contingent upon the satisfaction (or deemed satisfaction as specifically set
forth in each Section herein) or waiver by Buyer or Seller of all of the
conditions that are expressly stated to be in favor of each as set forth in this
Article and the Conditions to Close of Escrow as set forth in Schedule "3"
hereof, within the time limits specified in each Section of this Article and
such Schedule. In the event that any such condition is neither satisfied within
the time limits specified in each such Section nor waived in writing by the
party specifically stated to be benefited by such Section, such condition shall
be deemed to have failed and this Agreement shall terminate. In the event of any
termination pursuant to this Article, Buyer and Seller shall be released from
their respective obligations to purchase or sell under this Agreement and shall
have no further rights or remedies regarding purchase or sale against the other
as a result of such termination, except for the return of Buyer's Deposit and

                                       5
<PAGE>   6

pursuant to Section 5.4.. In such event, Buyer and Seller shall comply with any
requirements reasonably imposed by Escrow Holder to evidence such termination.

3.2. CONDITIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF BUYER. In addition to any other conditions to
Buyer's obligations contained in Schedule 3, the following shall constitute
conditions to Buyer's obligation to purchase the Property from Seller and are
for the benefit of Buyer, the failure of any of which shall allow Buyer to
terminate this Agreement:

      3.2.1. FEASIBILITY STUDIES. This Agreement is contingent on Buyer's
      approval of any and all investigations, studies or analyses, including,
      but not limited to engineering reports, soils reports, surveys, and

      Buyer in determining whether to consummate the transaction ("Feasibility
      Studies").

            Buyer may elect in Buyer's sole discretion, at any time prior to the
      end of the Feasibility Period to terminate this Agreement. Upon such
      election to terminate, the Deposit together with interest earned thereon
      shall be returned to Buyer, and Buyer shall furnish to Seller a copy of
      all Feasibility Studies produced by or for Buyer which Buyer has the right
      to so furnish. Any such Feasibility Studies so furnished to Seller shall
      be accepted by Seller "as is" and Buyer shall not warrant or represent in

      3.2.2. APPROVAL OF CONDITION OF TITLE. Buyer shall obtain a Title Report
      together with full and complete copies of all documents referenced as
      exceptions therein and a plotting of all easements referred to as
      exceptions therein. This Agreement is contingent on Buyer's approval of
      the condition of title of the Property as shown in such Title Report. If
      Seller and Escrow holder are not notified in writing of Buyer's
      disapproval thereof by within thirty-five (35) days after the Agreement
      Date, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved the condition of title as
      reflected in such Title Report. In case of Buyer's timely objection,
      Seller shall have ten (10) days from receipt of Buyer's notice of
      objection to inform Buyer and Escrow Holder in writing whether Seller
      shall use its diligent efforts to remove such disapproved exceptions prior
      to the Closing. In the event Seller agrees that Seller shall use its
      diligent efforts to remove such disapproved exceptions, such removal shall
      be a condition to the Closing and the condition of title as shown on the
      Title Report shall otherwise be deemed approved. In the event that Seller
      is unwilling or unable to remove such disapproved exceptions or fails to
      notify Buyer and Escrow Holder whether it shall use its best efforts to
      remove such exceptions, Buyer shall have ten (10) days from the first to
      occur of (a) the date of receipt of Seller's notice, or (b) the expiration
      of Seller's ten (10) day notice period, to inform Seller and Escrow Holder
      whether Buyer is waiving 


                                       6
<PAGE>   7

      its disapproval of such exceptions. In the event Buyer fails to waive such
      disapproval, the condition of title shall be deemed disapproved. All
      matters shown on the Title Report, which are not disapproved by Buyer
      and/or as to which Buyer waives its disapproval, shall be deemed to be
      Permitted Exceptions. Unless Seller has actual knowledge that a matter of
      record which is material is not disclosed in the Title Report, any matter
      of record not disclosed in the Title Report shall be the responsibility of
      the Title Insurer and not Seller and shall be deemed a Permitted
      Exception.

      3.2.3. APPROVAL TO ENTER AGREEMENT. Buyer's obligations under this
      Agreement shall be subject to Seller obtaining within thirty (30) days of
      the Agreement Date the written approval of Lienholder and any other
      necessary parties for Seller to enter into this Agreement.

      Tract 7953 for vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress to the parking
      garage and service area, which grant shall be by deed recordable at the
      closing and in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

      3.2.7. CONSTRUCTION STAGING AREA. Seller shall have arranged prior to the
      end of the Feasibility Period for a temporary easement ("Construction
      Staging Easement") in favor of Buyer effective as of the Closing to permit
      Buyer to use Parcels 1 and 6 of Tract 7953 in the City for construction
      staging purposes in connection with Buyer's contemplated construction of
      the Project. The Construction Staging easement shall be coordinated with

      Buyer and Seller that during Buyer's construction of the Project, the
      parking facilities currently existing on the Property will be removed and,
      if required, inter alia, by the City, temporary parking facilities will be
      provided by Buyer, at Buyer's cost and expense. Upon the completion of the
      Project, Buyer will provide replacement parking on the Property for the
      Benefitted Lots to the extent required by those entitled thereto. To
      facilitate the accommodation of parking, Buyer and Seller agree to
      cooperate during the Feasibility Period to understand the requirements for
      such temporary and permanent parking, if any, and to reach agreement with
      any necessary third parties about the exact time, place and manner of
      accommodating such parking. The parties contemplate that the terms,
      conditions and requirements with respect to such parking shall be
      contained in an agreement to be negotiated during the Feasibility Period

      Closing by Buyer and Seller and any other parties that Buyer and Seller

      needs currently filled by the surface parking on the Property can be

      (except for the term "Buyer" which is defined in this Agreement, the
      capitalized terms that follow refer to those same terms as capitalized and
      defined in such Parking Agreement). Buyer must elect to relocate the
      Existing Parking Rights to the Parcel A Commercial Garage to the extent
      rights to the Parcel A Commercial Garage are available for such purpose at
      the time of such election. However, if Buyer elects to relocate the
      Existing Parking Rights to the Parcel A Commercial Garage and, within
      three (3) months following such election, Buyer determines that such
      rights are not reasonably 

                                       1
<PAGE>   37

      available in the Parcel A Commercial Garage, then Buyer may elect to
      relocate the Existing Parking Rights to the Alternate Property. In any
      event, Buyer may elect to relocate the Existing Parking Rights to the
      Alternate Property only until the earlier of (x) 36 months following the
      date of the Owner Relocation Notice or (y) thirty (30) days after Seller
      or Seller's successors or assigns have obtained a use permit for the
      construction of permanent improvements on the Alternate Property at which
      time such Existing Parking Rights must be relocated off the Alternate
      Property.

            (B) To the extent the following is within the power or control of
      Seller (or any entity controlled by Seller or controlled by or under
      common control with Sanford Diller, collectively a "Controlled Party"),
      Seller or such Controlled Party, at no cost to Seller or such Controlled
      Party nor payment to Apple, shall take such action as is reasonably
      necessary to revoke the consent for, and require Apple Computer to move
      the "Apple Computer" monument from a portion of Lot 7 of Tract 7953 which
      is adjacent to the Property, to a location selected by Apple Computer that
      is not located in any portion of said Lot 7 adjacent to the Property, and
      Seller hereby represents to Buyer that, after diligent search, Seller has
      been unable to locate any evidence that any specific permission has been
      granted to Apple Computer to allow such monument to be so placed and
      maintained. To the extent that the foregoing is not within the power or
      control of Seller, this Feasibility Condition shall be satisfied upon
      written notice from Seller to Buyer representing to Buyer that neither
      Seller nor any Controlled Party has the requisite power and control to
      satisfy such condition, in which event, Seller covenants to utilize its
      reasonable efforts following the Closing to cause such monument to be so
      moved.

            (C) As a Feasibility Condition, a declaration in the form attached
      hereto as Appendix C (the "Special Declaration") shall have been executed
      by Seller, the Cupertino City Center Owners Association, and those parties
      referred to therein as "Declarant" and an easement in form attached hereto
      as Appendix D (the "Grant of Easement") shall have been executed by the
      Cupertino City Center Owners Association (the "Association").

            (D)  Intentionally Omitted.

            (E)  Intentionally Omitted.

            (F) As a Feasibility Condition, the "Consent to Declaration" in the
      form attached hereto as Appendix F shall have been executed by Seller and
      all the parties thereto except for the signatures of CIGNA and Travelers
      Insurance Company ("Travelers") to the Consent to Declaration which shall
      be the sole responsibility of Buyer and not a Feasibility Condition. Based
      upon Seller's representation to Buyer that Seller has no reason to believe
      that Travelers will refuse or grant such consent if requested by Buyer,
      Buyer agrees to not seek the consent of Travelers prior to the Closing;

            (G) As a Feasibility Condition, the Association's Design Review
      Board shall have approved preliminary plans for Buyer's proposed Project
      to be built on the Property;

            (H)  Intentionally Omitted;

                                       2

            (I) As a Feasibility Condition, the "Entry Permit for a Construction
      Staging Area" in the form attached hereto as Appendix G (the "Construction
      Staging Easement) shall have been executed by Cupertino City Center Land
      and delivered to Escrowholder with instructions that the Construction
      Staging Easement shall be delivered to Buyer at the Closing. As a covenant
      to survive Closing, but not as a Feasibility Condition, the Construction
      Staging easement shall be coordinated with and subject to any temporary
      parking requirements that need to be provided on such parcels pursuant to
      Section 5.3.1.2 of the Agreement and shall be of a duration limited to
      Buyer's contemplated construction period;

            (J) As a Feasibility condition, Seller shall have delivered to Buyer
      the commitment of the Title Insurer that as of the Closing the title
      exceptions listed in paragraph 8 below shall be removed.

      3.  Section 1.2.15 (entitled "Purchase Price") is hereby restated in
its entirety as follows:

            "1.2.15  "Purchase Price".  Six Million Five Hundred Thousand
      Dollars ($6,500,000), plus interest at the rate of ten percent (10%)
      per annum from September 30, 1996 through Closing."

      4.  Section 1.2.16 (entitled "Scheduled Closing Date") is hereby
restated in its entirety as follows:

            "1.2.16 "Scheduled Closing Date". Shall occur on or before the later
      of (i) January 7, 1997, plus such additional time as Buyer may require if,
      despite using good faith efforts to complete the Closing, Buyer is unable
      to fulfill its requirements by such date or (ii) seven (7) days after the
      end of the Feasibility Period; provided, however, that in no event shall
      the Scheduled Closing Date be extended beyond January 31, 1997 without the
      written agreement of both Buyer and Seller.

      5. In Section 2.2.1 (entitled "Deposit") the amount of Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($200,000) shall be increased to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) and the following sentence shall be added:

            "When Seller has given the Feasibility Completion Notice [all
      conditions to the end of the Feasibility Period, have occurred] and Buyer
      has given the [e]Election to [p]Proceed under Section 3.3.1, the Deposit
      shall be increased to $500,000. Concurrently with Buyer's increase of the
      Deposit, Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) will be released to
      Seller and shall be nonrefundable except in the event of a Seller material
      default under this Agreement. If Buyer fails to close, except in the event
      of a Seller material default under this Agreement, Seller shall be
      entitled to retain the $250,000 released to Seller as consideration to
      Seller for the making and entering into of this Second Amendment and,
      among other things, for Seller's holding the Property off the market
      during the Feasibility Period as extended by this Amendment and for the
      costs and expenses incurred by Seller in pursuing this Agreement and the
      transactions contemplated hereunder (including expenses of third party
      consultants and attorneys), and in addition,

      Seller shall be entitled to the balance of the Deposit (then $250,000) as
      liquidated damages pursuant to Section 6.5.

      6. The second sentence of Section 3.1 (entitled "Effect of Conditions
Generally") shall be restated in its entirety as follows:

            "Subject to the provisions of Section 2.2.1, in the event that any
      such condition is neither satisfied within the time limits specified in
      each such Section nor waived in writing by the party specifically stated
      to be benefited by such Section, such condition shall be deemed to have
      failed and the party specifically stated to be benefited by such failed
      condition may elect to terminate this Agreement."

            The following clause is inserted at the beginning of the third
      sentence of Section 3.1:  "Subject to the provisions of Section 2.2.1, "

      7.  The introductory sentence of Section 3.2 (entitled "Conditions for
the Benefit of Buyer") is restated in its entirety as follows:

                  "In addition to any other conditions to Buyer's obligations
            contained in Schedule 3, the following shall constitute conditions
            to Buyer's obligations to purchase the Property from Seller and are
            for the benefit of Buyer, the failure of any of which shall allow
            Buyer to terminate this Agreement subject to the provisions of
            Section 2.2.1."

      8.  Section 3.2.2 (entitled "Approval of Condition of Title") shall be
restated in its entirety as follows:

            "Buyer has reviewed the preliminary title report prepared by the
      Title Insurer for the Property dated as of June 5. 1996 under its Order
      No. 511373-A (the "title Report"). All of the exceptions shown on the
      Title Report plus the Second Amendment to Declaration in the form attached
      hereto as Appendix H (the "Second Amendment to Declaration"), the Special
      Declaration, the Grant of Easement, the Parking Easement and Relocation
      Agreement, and the "Grant of Lot 4 Easement Rights" in the form attached
      hereto as Appendix I and the Amendment to Declaration in the form attached

      its reasonable efforts to cause to be removed prior to Closing both as to
      the Property and to the portion of Lot 7 of Tract 7953 that is the subject
      of the easement described in 1.2.8.c":

            With respect to exception No. 18 (regarding City Resolution No.
      7007) shown on the Title Report, Buyer has approved exception No. 18 and
      Seller hereby agrees (i) to indemnify Buyer against any and all loss,
      cost, damage or liability that may arise out of the failure of Seller to
      fulfill the requirements under City Resolution 7007 and (ii) to take
      prompt and reasonable steps to fulfill such requirements as may be imposed
      as a result of City Resolution 7007 and cause the effect thereof to be
      removed as an exception to Buyer's title to the Property. Such indemnity
      shall survive the Closing and the delivery of the Grant Deed.

      9. The following subsections of Section 3.2 (entitled "Conditions for the
Benefit of Buyer") shall be deleted in their entirety:

            (A)  Section 3.2.3 (entitled "Approval to Enter Agreement");

            (AA)  Section 3.2.5 (entitled "Parking Agreement")

      11.  Section 3.4 (entitled "Conditions of Deposit Refund to Buyer") is
deleted in its entirety.

      12.  The following is added to Section 4.3 (entitled "Limitation of
Actions"):

                  "In addition, the twelve (12) month limitation for the
            commencement of legal action shall not apply to claims arising under
            the Parking Agreement, the Construction Staging Easement, Buyer's
            Parking Indemnity, or any other obligation the performance of which
            is by its express terms deferred to a period later than the Closing,
            and such claims shall be subject to the applicable statute of
            limitations."

      13.  The following Section 5.2.3 (entitled "Buyer's Parking Indemnity"
is added to the Purchase Agreement:

      "5.2.3.  Buyer's Parking Indemnity.  Unless defined in this Agreement,
the capitalized terms used in this Section shall have the meanings ascribed
to such capitalized terms in the Parking Agreement.

            5.2.3.1 Buyer's Limited Indemnity. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold Seller and the Controlled Parties, and their respective officers,
directors, shareholders, partners and employees (the "Indemnified Parking
Agreement Parties"), free and harmless from any and all expense, loss, damage,
liability and claims of any kind or nature arising out of any actions against
the Indemnified Parking Agreement Parties made by the Permittees alleging in
effect that Buyer has not provided the Symantec Parking Facilities pursuant to
the Parking Agreement ("Buyer's Parking Indemnity").

            5.2.3.2 Indemnity Procedures. Promptly, and in no event later than
ten (10) days, after receipt by an Indemnified Parking Agreement Party of notice
of the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Parking Agreement Party
shall, if a claim in respect of such action is to be made against Buyer pursuant
to Buyer's Parking Indemnity, notify Buyer in writing of the commencement
thereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnfied Parking
Agreement Party and such Indemnified Parking Agreement Party shall notify Buyer
of the commencement thereof, Buyer shall be entitled to participate in such
action and, to the extent that Buyer shall wish, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Parking Agreement Party (which
counsel shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Parking Agreement
Party, be counsel to Buyer on other matters), and, after notice from Buyer to
such Indemnified Parking Agreement Party of Buyer's election so to assume the
defense thereof, Buyer shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parking Agreement
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each
case subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parking Agreement Party, in
connection with the defense of such action, other than reasonable costs of
investigation and legal expenses of other counsel in the event the counsel
selected by Buyer has a conflict of interest in representing Buyer as well as
any Indemnified Parking Agreement Party.

            5.2.3.3.  Other Indemnity Provisions.  Notwithstanding anything in
this Amendment or in the Agreement to the contrary, Buyer's Parking Indemnity
shall survive the Closing, and the limitation for the commencement of legal
action under Section 4.3 of the Agreement, as amended by this Amendment shall
not apply to claims arising under Buyer's Parking Indemnity[. In all events,
Buyer's obligation to indemnify shall apply only to actual compensatory damages
to an Indemnified Parking Agreement Party and shall NOT extend to consequential
damages of any kind.]

      14. Sections 5.2.1.2 (entitled "Temporary Parking") and 5.3.1.1 (entitled
"Parking Approvals") are modified by deleting therefrom the references to Apple
Computer, Inc." The foregoing deletion is agreed by Buyer based upon Seller's
representation that, other than the Apple Lease described in exception 25 of the
Title Report, there are no agreements granting Apple Computer parking rights
with respect to the Property.

      15.  Section 6.5 (entitled "Liquidated Damages"), is hereby restated in
its entirety as follows:

            "IF BUYER FAILS TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE PROVIDED FOR IN THIS
      AGREEMENT BY REASON OF ANY DEFAULT OF BUYER, SELLER SHALL BE RELEASED FROM
      SELLER'S OBLIGATION TO SELL THE PROPERTY TO BUYER. BUYER AND SELLER AGREE
      IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FIX ACTUAL DAMAGES IN
      THE CASE OF BUYER'S DEFAULT AND THAT THE DEPOSIT OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
      ($50,000) PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FEASIBILITY PERIOD, OR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY
      THOUSAND DOLLARS ($250,000) AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE FEASIBILITY PERIOD
      WHICH SUM OF $250,000 OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT
      FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF $250,000 WHICH MAY BE RETAINED BY SELLER UNDER
      SECTION 2.2.1. EACH SUCH SUM IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLER'S DAMAGES
      IN SUCH EVENT, AND THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY DEFAULT BY BUYER HEREUNDER AS
      AFORESAID, SELLER MAY RETAIN THE SUM. SUCH SUM SHALL CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED
      DAMAGES AND SELLER'S SOLE REMEDY ON ACCOUNT OF BUYER'S DEFAULT FOR FAILURE
      TO CLOSE, BUT SHALL NOT LIMIT BUYER'S LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 5.4 ABOVE.

                  Buyers Initials                    Seller's Initials


      16. Buyer hereby agrees that at the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to
grant to Cupertino City Center Apartments II, a California limited partnership
("CCCApartments II") one of the Controlled Parties and the owner of Lot 4, Tract
7953, a non-exclusive easement, in the form of the Grant of Lot 4 Easement
Rights, within the parking area established and designated by Buyer on the
Property for 12 parking spaces originally planned to be located within the
portion of Lot 7 adjacent to Lot 4 and displaced by Buyer's use of said portion
of Lot 7 pursuant to the Grant of Easement , provided, however, that the
entitlement therefore for nine (9) of such spaces shall only include weekends,
holidays and that time between 5 pm and 8 am on days other than weekends

and holidays, and provided further, that such parking spaces and the holders of
the rights thereto, shall be subject to reasonable, non-discriminatory rules and
regulations (including, without limitation, instituting such security and
administrative procedures as Buyer deems necessary for the safe, efficient
operation of the parking facilities located thereon). The parties acknowledge
that notwithstanding the Grant of the Lot 4 Easement rights, such parking rights
will be unavailable to CCCApartments II during the period that Buyer is
constructing the Project on Lot 5. Accordingly, during such period of
construction, Buyer covenants, as a covenant surviving the Closing, that
CCCApartments II shall have and enjoy said parking rights, including the right
of access thereto, on Buyer's property commonly known as its World Headquarters
having an address of 10201 Torre Avenue, Cupertino, California. If required in
order to satisfy the City's parking requirements for Lot 4, the foregoing
temporary parking rights will be expressed in a written instrument and recorded
in the official Records of Santa Clara County.

      17. Prior to, but not as a condition to Closing, and to the extent not
completed at, Closing, Seller covenants and agrees to cooperate with Buyer and
to use Seller's and any Controlled Party's reasonable good faith efforts (i) to
enable Buyer to obtain permission (pursuant to written agreement which will
include, inter alia, provisions by which Buyer will agree to minimize any
disturbance to tenants and/or other users of the affected property, agree to
repair and maintain any damage to the affected property, agree that the affected
property will not be the subject of any lien by virtue of the activity of Buyer,
agree to obtain and maintain comprehensive general liability insurance in the
sum of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) protecting the affected property owners,
and agree to give written notice to the affected property owners prior to the
commencement of any work and/or the delivery of any materials so that the
affected property owners may post notices of non-responsibility) from the
Cupertino City Center Owners Association, the City, and other property owners
and their lenders to construct, install and maintain a fiber-optic or similar
"hard-wired" communications link between the Property, the property adjacent to
the southern boundary of the Property which is occupied by and owned or to be
acquired by Buyer and any other property owned or occupied by Buyer or Buyer's
affiliates within the Cupertino City Center and (ii) to cause the Association
and the Declarant members thereof to execute the Third Amendment providing for
the cessation of the Class B Membership in the Cupertino City Center Owners
Association not later than thirty-six (36) months from the date of the Closing.
To the extent that the cooperation of Seller and the Controlled Parties requires
Seller or the Controlled Parties to hire non-affiliated third parties, the
reasonable out of pocket cost of hiring such third parties shall be reimbursed
by Buyer. If not fulfilled as of the Closing, the covenants and agreements set
forth in this paragraph shall survive the Closing. [Resolution No. 9751
("Resolution 9751") of the City Council of the City of Cupertino adopted by the
City Council on December 11, 1996 contemplates an agreement between Seller,
Buyer and the City of Cupertino for the completion of certain improvements along
Stevens Creek Boulevard and within the southeast corner of Stevens Creek and De
Anza Boulevard. With respect to Resolution 9751 and the agreements contemplated
thereby, Buyer agrees to be responsible for those items specified in Exhibit A
to Resolution 9751 pursuant to which Buyer alone is mentioned and required to
perform. With respect to those items specified in Exhibit A to Resolution 9751
in which Buyer and Seller are both mentioned and required to perform, Seller
agrees that Seller shall be soley responsible for such performance, and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing.] Seller shall, on or before September
1, 1997, subject to extensions due to matters beyond the

reasonable control of Seller and/or the Controlled Parties, caused to be
completed (i) the park roadway on Lots 1 and 8 of Tract 7953 in accordance with
the plans therefore approved by the City of Cupertino, [and] (ii) the hardscape
and landscape improvements on Lot 9 and adjacent to the northerly boundary of
Lot 1 in accordance with the plans therefore approved by the City of Cupertino.

      18. Notwithstanding the Closing, Seller agrees that Seller and the
Controlled Parties will reasonably cooperate with Buyer in order to effectuate
the intent of (i) the Agreement as amended and (ii) the other agreements to be
consummated and delivered pursuant to the Agreement as amended. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, to the extent that as of the Closing, any
covenants of Seller or Buyer remain unfulfilled or Buyer or Seller has waived an
unfulfilled condition to Closing, Seller or Buyer agrees that such unfulfilled
covenants or conditions shall remain covenants that survive the Closing
requiring Seller and the Controlled Parties to use reasonable efforts to
fulfill, working in cooperation with the other. To the extent that the
cooperation of Seller and the Controlled Parties, on the one hand and Buyer, on
the other hand, requires Seller or the Controlled Parties to hire non-affiliated
third parties, the reasonable out of pocket cost of hiring such third parties
shall be reimbursed by Buyer[; provided, however, prior to hiring any such third
parties the cost for which Seller shall expect to be reimbursed by Buyer, Seller
agrees to give Seller not less than ten (10) days notice specifying the third
parties that Seller desires to hire and the specific tasks that such third
parties will be hired to undertake].

      19. The parties acknowledge that construction is under way and will
continue with respect to the improvement of Lot 4 of Tract 7953, which
construction includes some utilization of the "Burdened Property" shown on the
Grant of Easement. Buyer and Seller, for itself and the Controlled Parties,
covenant and agree that they will reasonably and in good faith cooperate and
coordinate their development on and utilization of the Burdened Property so that
neither will be unreasonably impeded.

      20. Exhibit "C" (Election to Proceed) is revised and restated as set forth
in the Appendix J attached hereto. Said Election to Proceed must be given, if at
all, within three (3) business days of Seller having given the Feasibility
Completion Notice.

      21. Whenever in the Purchase Agreement and/or this First Amendment, a
party has the right to "terminate" the agreement, the exercise of such right of
termination shall mean only the extinction of the obligation of Buyer to
purchase the Property and the obligation of Seller to sell the Property as well
as the extinction of any obligations under any documents ancillary to the
purchase of the Property.

      22. To the extent this Second Amendment conflicts with the First
Amendment, this Second Amendment shall control.

      22.  Except as herein and heretofore amended, the Purchase Agreement
remains unchanged and in full force and effect.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Second Amendment
on the dates set forth opposite their respective signatures below.

<PAGE>   61
                          THIRD AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT
                FOR PURCHASE AND SALE AND ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS

      This THIRD AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT FOR PURCHASE AND SALE AND ESCROW
INSTRUCTIONS ("Second Amendment") made effective as of January __, 1997, amends
that certain Agreement for Purchase and Sale and Escrow Instructions dated May
31, 1996 ("Purchase Agreement") by and between Symantec Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, therein and herein called "Buyer," and Cupertino City Center
Buildings, a California Limited Partnership, therein and herein called "Seller."
The Purchase Agreement was previously amended by the First Amendment to
Agreement for Purchase and Sale and Escrow Instructions made effective July 30,
1996 (the "First Amendment") and by the Second Amendment to Agreement for
Purchase and Sale and Escrow Instructions made effective September 5, 1996 (the
"Second Amendment"). Those terms defined in the Purchase Agreement as
supplemented and modified by the Second Amendment shall have the same
definitions when used herein unless specifically modified hereby.

      Buyer and Seller now wish to further modify the Purchase Agreement, as
amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, as hereinafter set
forth.

      1.  The following is added as subsection (k) to Section 1.2.8, as
amended by the Second Amendment:

            (k) CCCApartments II, one of the Controlled parties, is currently
constructing an apartment project on Lot 4 of Tract 7953 (the "Lot 4 Project").
As a condition to the entitlements from the City of Cupertino for the Lot 4
Project, 12 parking spaces were to be provided adjacent to the western boundary
of said Lot 4. Pursuant to the Grant of Easement and otherwise as described in
paragraph 16 of the Second Amendment, CCCApartments II agreed to relinquish any
rights to such 12 parking spaces and instead agreed to the temporary and
permanent parking rights described in paragraph 16 of the Second Amendment. As a
Feasibility Condition, the City of Cupertino shall have confirmed (the "City
Entitlement Confirmation") that the temporary and permanent parking rights to be
granted to CCCApartments II as described in paragraph 16 of the Second Amendment
will satisfy the entitlement condition that would previously have been satisfied
by having such 12 parking spaces located adjacent to the western boundary of
said Lot 4. Seller agrees to use Seller's and to cause the Controlled Parties to
use their reasonable efforts to obtain the "City Entitlement Confirmation" as
soon as possible. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller
agrees that if the City Council of the City of Cupertino acts to give the City
Entitlement Confirmation, that this Feasibility Condition shall be deemed
satisfied.

      2.  Section 1.2.16 (entitled "Scheduled Closing Date") is hereby
restated in its entirety as follows:

            1.2.16 "Scheduled Closing Date". Shall occur on or before the later
      of (i) January 28, 1997, plus such additional time as Buyer may require
      if, despite using good faith efforts to complete the Closing, Buyer is
      unable to fulfill its requirements by such date but

                                       1
<PAGE>   62

      not later than February 15, 1997 or (ii) seven (7) days after the end of
      the Feasibility Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, despite the
      exercise of reasonable efforts by Seller and the Controlled Parties, the
      Feasibility Condition described in Section 1.2.8(k) is not fulfilled
      because the City Entitlement Confirmation cannot be obtained, Buyer and
      Seller agree to cooperate in good faith to accommodate the requirement for
      the 12 parking spaces described in Section 1.2.8(k) and at the same time
      preserve the Project designed by Buyer for the Property, provided however,
      that if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on a mutually agreeable plan
      (using such good faith efforts) by April 21, 1997, then either party may
      elect to terminate this Agreement, at which time it shall have no further
      force and effect.

      3. To the extent this Third Amendment conflicts with the First Amendment
or the Second Amendment, this Third Amendment shall control.

      4.  Except as herein and heretofore amended, the Purchase Agreement
remains unchanged and in full force and effect.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Third Amendment
on the dates set forth opposite their respective signatures below.

      SECTION II.4. Interest Rates and Payment Dates.

            (a) Each Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest

      (ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any other amount payable
      hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
      acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a
      rate per annum which is equal to the Overdue Rate. Interest accruing
      pursuant to this clause (b) shall be payable from time to time on demand.

            (c) During the Base Lease Term, interest shall accrue on outstanding
      Loans and shall be paid on the Scheduled Payment Date.

      on a 360-day year basis if the Alternate Base Rate is calculated at the
      Federal Funds Rate, and a 365- or, if applicable, 366-, day year basis if
      the Alternate Base Rate is calculated at the Prime Rate, in each case for
      the actual days elapsed. The Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the
      Lessor and the Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate. Any change
      in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate

      opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The
      Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Lessor and the Lenders of
      the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.

      any provision of this Loan Agreement shall be correct and binding on the
      Lessor and each Lender in the absence of demonstrable error. The Agent
      shall, at the request of the Lessor, deliver to the Lessor a statement
      prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail showing the quotations
      used by the Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section

respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held by each such

immediately available on the scheduled date when such payment is due. Payments
received after 1:00 p.m., San Francisco, California time, on the date due shall

of this Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the
terms of this Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Loan Agreement, the Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or
any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or any other party to the Operative
Documents, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,

omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Loan
Agreement or any other Operative Document (except for its or such Person's own
gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants under the Operative Documents) or (b) responsible in any
manner to any of the Lenders or any other party to the Operative Documents for
any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Lessor or
the Lessee or any officer thereof contained in this Loan Agreement or any other
Operative Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection
with, this Loan Agreement or any other Operative Document or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Loan
Agreement or any other Operative Document or for any failure of the Lessor or
the Lessee to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agent shall
not be under any obligation to any Lender or any other party to the Operative
Documents to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any
of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Loan Agreement or any
other Operative Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the
Lessor or the Lessee.

      SECTION VII.4. Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Lessor or the Lessee), independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Loan Agreement or any other Operative Document unless it shall
first receive the advice or concurrence of Lenders holding a majority of the
outstanding Loans or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Loan Agreement and the other Operative Documents in accordance with a request of
Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Loans, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the

Loan Agreement Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

     SECTION VII.5. Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Loan Agreement Default or Loan
Agreement Event of Default hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a
Lender or the Lessor referring to this Loan Agreement, describing such Loan
Agreement Default or Loan Agreement Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Lessee. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Loan Agreement
Default or Loan Agreement Event of Default as shall be directed by Lenders
holding a majority of the outstanding Loans; provided, however, that unless and
until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Loan Agreement Default or Loan Agreement Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

      SECTION VII.6. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the Lessor or the Lessee, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Lessor and the Lessee and made its own
decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Loan Agreement. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Loan
Agreement and the other Operative Documents, and to make such investigation as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Lessor and the Lessee.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Lessor or the

Lessee which may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

     SECTION VII.7. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent in
its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Lessee and without
limiting the obligation of the Lessee to do so), ratably according to the
percentage each Lender's Commitment bears to the total Commitments of all of the
Lenders on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 7.7
(or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Lenders'
Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full,
ratably in accordance with the percentage that each Lender's Commitment bears to
the Commitments of all of the Lenders immediately prior to such date), from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
whatsoever (including without limitation all reasonable fees and disbursements
of any law firm or other external counsel of the Agent, the allocated cost of
internal legal services and all disbursements of internal counsel of the Agent)
which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the
payment of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent
in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Loan Agreement,
any of the other Operative Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of
the foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment
of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this
Section 7.7 shall survive the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

      SECTION VII.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the
Lessor, the Lessee and their Affiliates as though The Sumitomo Bank, Limited,
San Francisco Branch, were not the Agent hereunder and under the other Operative
Documents and without notice to or consent of the Banks. Each Lender
acknowledges that, pursuant to such activities, The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, San
Francisco Branch, or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the
Lessee, the Lessor or their Affiliates (including information that may be

subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Lessee, the Lessor or
their Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to
provide such information to them. With respect to any Loans made or renewed by
it and any Note issued to it, The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, San Francisco Branch,
shall have the same rights and powers under this Loan Agreement and the other
Operative Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not the Agent, and, in the event The Sumitomo Bank, Limited, San Francisco
Branch, becomes a Lender, the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include The
Sumitomo Bank, Limited, San Francisco Branch, in its individual capacity.

      SECTION VII.9. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 20
days' notice to the Lenders. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this Loan
Agreement and the other Operative Documents, then Lenders holding a majority of
the outstanding Loans shall appoint a successor agent for Lenders, which
successor agent shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the
United States of America or any State thereof or under the laws of another
country which is doing business in the United States of America and having a
combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $100,000,000 (and if
no Lease Default or Lease Event of Default exists, shall be approved by the
Lessee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)), whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and
the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment
and approval, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Agent or any of the parties to this Loan Agreement or any holders of the Notes.
If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 20
days following a resigning Agent's notice of resignation, the resigning Agent's
resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall
perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as
Lenders holding a majority of the outstanding Loans appoint a successor Agent as
provided above. After any retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, all of the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Loan Agreement
and the other Operative Documents.

                            THE SUBJECT IMPROVEMENTS

      III.1. Construction of the Subject Improvements. The Construction Agent
shall (a) cause the Subject Improvements to be constructed in accordance with
the Plans and Specifications (as such Plans and Specifications may be modified
from time to time in accordance with Section 3.3) and (b) cause the Subject
Improvements to be constructed, equipped, maintained and used in compliance in
all Material respects with all Requirements of Law and Insurance Requirements,
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, the Lease

required (except to the extent that such revision, amendment or modification

modification would result in the Substantial Completion of the Construction
occurring after the Outside Completion Date, or (ii) the aggregate effect of
such revision, amendment or modification, when taken together with any previous
or contemporaneous revisions, amendments or modifications to the Plans and
Specifications and Construction Documents, would be to reduce the Fair Market

(iii) such revision, amendment or modification would materially change the
nature of the contemplated Subject Improvements or the utility of such Subject
Improvements for the purposes contemplated by the parties hereto as of the date
hereof; (b) the Construction Agent shall not terminate any Construction Document

      IV.1. Funding of Property Improvements Costs. (a) In connection with and
during the course of the construction of the Subject Improvements, the
Construction Agent may request that the Lessor advance funds for the payment of
Property Improvements Costs, and the Lessor will comply with such request to the

other Operative Documents.

      (b) The proceeds of any funds made available to the Lessor to pay Property
Improvements Costs shall be made available to the Construction Agent or its
designee(s) in accordance with the Funding Request relating thereto and the
terms of the Lease. The Construction Agent will use such proceeds only to pay

such funds.

      (c) If, for any reason, the Construction Agent shall at any time incur
costs to complete the Construction that shall be in excess of the amounts then
payable under this Article IV, then all such excess costs shall be borne by the
Construction Agent from its own funds.

      (d) The Construction Agent shall at all times cause to be and remain
vested in the Lessor's control any and all construction materials and equipment
not yet incorporated into the Properties for which funds shall have been
requested pursuant to this Article IV, and cause such title to be and remain

                      CONSTRUCTION AGENCY EVENTS OF DEFAULT

      V.1.  Construction Agency Events of Default.  If any one or more of the
following events (each a "Construction Agency Event of Default") shall occur:

            (a) the Construction Agent fails to apply any funds paid by the
      Lessor to the Construction Agent or its designee(s) to the payment of the
      appropriate Property



                                      -6-
<PAGE>   8

      Improvements Costs; or

            (b) the Construction Agent shall fail to observe or perform any
      term, covenant or condition of this Agreement (except those specified in
      clause (a) above), and such failure shall remain uncured for a period of
      thirty (30) days; provided, however, that no Construction Agency Event of
      Default shall be deemed to occur if such failure or breach cannot
      reasonably be cured within such period, so long as the Construction Agent
      shall have promptly commenced the cure thereof and continues to act with
      diligence to cure such failure or breach and in fact cures such failure or
      breach within one hundred eighty (180) days,

then, in any such event, the Lessor may, in addition to the other rights and
remedies provided for in this Article V and under the Lease, immediately
terminate this Agreement by giving the Construction Agent written notice of such
termination, and upon the giving of such notice, all rights of the Construction
Agent and all obligations of the Lessor under this Agreement shall cease. Upon
any such termination, the Construction Agent shall immediately pay to the
Lessor, as and for liquidated damages, an amount equal to the Lease Balance as
of the date of such payment (whereupon the Lessor shall convey title to the
Properties to the Lessee or its designee in accordance with Article XXII of the
Lease). Alternatively, the Lessor, with or without terminating this Agreement
and without waiving or releasing the Construction Agent from any obligation or
Construction Agency Event of Default, may (but shall be under no obligation to)
remedy any Construction Agency Event of Default for the account of and at the
sole cost and expense of the Construction Agent. The Construction Agent shall
pay upon demand all costs, expenses, losses, expenditures and damages
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred by or on behalf of
Lessor in connection with any Construction Agency Event of Default, together
with interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date on which such amounts
are paid by the Lessor.

      V.2. Survival. The termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1
shall in no event relieve the Construction Agent of its liability and
obligations hereunder which accrued prior to such termination, all of which
shall survive any such termination.

      V.3. Remedies Cumulative; Waivers. (a) If a Construction Agency Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessor shall have, in
addition to the rights and remedies provided for in Section 5.1, all rights and
remedies available under the Operative Documents or available at law, equity or
otherwise.



                                      -7-

      (b) No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the
Lessor, any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement or under the
other Operative Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
privileges provided in this Agreement, including with particularity Section 5.1,
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

duties and requirements imposed upon or allocated to the Construction Agent
shall be performed by the Construction Agent at the Construction's Agent's sole
cost and expense, and the Construction Agent will not be entitled to, and the
Lessor shall have no obligation to pay, any agency fee or other fee or
compensation, and the Construction Agent shall not be entitled to, and the
Lessor shall have no obligation to make or pay, any reimbursement therefor, it
being understood that this Agreement is being entered into as consideration for
and as an inducement to the Lessor and the Construction Agent entering into the
Lease and the other Operative Documents.

                                              TO CONSTRUCTION AGENCY AGREEMENT


                        CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS ASSIGNMENT

      FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and to secure the performance by SYMANTEC CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation (hereinafter referred to as either the "Lessee" or
"Assignor"), of all of its obligations under that certain Construction Agency
Agreement dated as of March 3, 1997 (as the same may be amended, modified or
restated from time to time, and together with all supplements thereto, the
"Construction Agency Agreement"), between the Lessee and Sumitomo Bank Leasing
and Finance, Inc. (the "Lessor" or "Secured Party"), the Lessee does hereby
quitclaim, sell, assign, transfer and set over unto the Secured Party and its
successors and assigns, all of the Lessee's right, title and interest in and to
the following (referred to collectively herein as the "Collateral"):

            I all construction contracts relating to the Construction of the
      Subject Improvements (including, without limitation, the Prime
      Construction Contract), as each such agreement may hereafter be
      supplemented, modified or amended from time to time (collectively, the
      "Construction Contracts");

            (ii) all architectural services agreements pertaining to the
      Construction, as each such agreement may hereafter be supplemented,
      modified or amended from time to time (collectively, the "Architect's
      Agreements");

            (iii) all plans, specifications and drawings of any and every kind
      heretofore or hereafter prepared for use in connection with the
      Construction of the Properties (including, without limitation, the Plans
      and Specifications), and any supplements, amendments or modifications
      thereto (collectively, the "Plans"); and

            (iv) all building and other permits, licenses and governmental
      approvals which are necessary or useful to the commencement and completion
      of the Construction, or otherwise relate to the Construction, heretofore
      or hereafter obtained or applied for by or on behalf of the Assignor or
      any architects, engineers or contractors working on any aspect of the
      Construction, and any deposits made in connection therewith (collectively,
      the "Permits");

provided, however, that the Secured Party shall have no obligation or liability
of any kind under or with respect to the Construction Contracts, the Architect's
Agreements, the Permits

 
<PAGE>   16

 or the Plans, either before or after the Secured Party's
exercise of any rights hereby granted to it, and the Assignor agrees to save and
hold the Secured Party harmless of and from, and to indemnify the Secured Party
against, any and all such obligations and liabilities, contingent or otherwise,
including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection
therewith.

      This Construction Documents Assignment shall inure to the benefit of the
Secured Party and its successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon the
Assignor and its successors and assigns, and shall continue in full force and
effect until all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of any kind now or
hereafter due the Secured Party from the Assignor under or with respect to the
Lease or any of the other Operative Documents, or which are otherwise secured
hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising or incurred (collectively, the
"Liabilities"), have been fully paid, performed and satisfied, and all
Commitments have terminated, at which time this Construction Documents
Assignment will terminate. The Secured Party will not exercise any of its rights
hereunder until there shall have occurred and be continuing a Lease Event of
Default.

      For purposes of completing the Construction after any Lease Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Secured Party may, at its
option, further assign its right, title and interest in the Collateral without
the consent of the Assignor, or any contractor or architect.

      This Construction Documents Assignment is a present, perfected and
absolute assignment; provided, however, that the Secured Party shall not have
the right to undertake completion of the Construction or directly to enforce the
provisions of any Construction Contract or any Architect's Agreement until a
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. During the
continuance of any such Event of Default, the Secured Party may, without
affecting any other right or remedy available to it, exercise its rights under
this Construction Documents Assignment as provided herein in any manner
permitted by law. If any notice to the Assignor is required by law, such notice
shall be deemed commercially reasonable if given at least ten (10) days prior to
the date of intended action.

      This Construction Documents Assignment may be effectively waived,
modified, amended or terminated only by a written instrument executed by the
Secured Party and the Lessee. Any waiver by the Secured Party shall be effective
only with respect to the specific instance described therein. Delay or course of
conduct shall not constitute a waiver of any right or remedy of the Secured
Party.

      Unless the context shall otherwise require, capitalized 
<PAGE>   17


terms used and not defined in this Construction Documents Assignment shall have
the meanings assigned thereto in Appendix A (as defined in the Construction
Agency Agreement) for all purposes hereof; and the rules of interpretation set
forth in Appendix A shall apply to this Construction Documents Assignment.

      THIS CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS ASSIGNMENT SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED
BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA (EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT-OF-LAW OR
CHOICE-OF-LAW RULES WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERNAL LAWS OF
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) AS TO ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND
PERFORMANCE.

                        CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS ASSIGNMENT

      FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and to secure the performance by SYMANTEC CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation (hereinafter referred to as either the "Lessee" or
"Assignor"), of all of its obligations under that certain Construction Agency
Agreement dated as of February __, 1997 (as the same may be amended, modified or
restated from time to time, and together with all supplements thereto, the
"Construction Agency Agreement"), between the Lessee and Sumitomo Bank Leasing
and Finance, Inc. (the "Lessor" or "Secured Party"), the Lessee does hereby
quitclaim, sell, assign, transfer and set over unto the Secured Party and its
successors and assigns, all of the Lessee's right, title and interest in and to
the following (referred to collectively herein as the "Collateral"):

            I.    all construction contracts relating to the Construction of
      the Subject Improvements (including, without limitation, the Prime
      Construction Contract), as each such agreement may hereafter be
      supplemented, modified or amended from time to time (collectively, the
      "Construction Contracts");

            (ii) all architectural services agreements pertaining to the
      Construction, as each such agreement may hereafter be supplemented,
      modified or amended from time to time (collectively, the "Architect's
      Agreements");

            (iii) all plans, specifications and drawings of any and every kind
      heretofore or hereafter prepared for use in connection with the
      Construction of the Properties (including, without limitation, the Plans
      and Specifications), and any supplements, amendments or modifications
      thereto (collectively, the "Plans"); and

            (iv) all building and other permits, licenses and governmental
      approvals which are necessary or useful to the commencement and completion
      of the Construction, or otherwise relate to the Construction, heretofore
      or hereafter obtained or applied for by or on behalf of the Assignor or
      any architects, engineers or contractors working on any aspect of the
      Construction, and any deposits made in connection therewith (collectively,
      the "Permits");

provided, however, that the Secured Party shall have no obligation or liability
of any kind under or with respect to the Construction Contracts, the Architect's
Agreements, the Permits or the Plans, either before or after the Secured Party's
exercise of any rights hereby granted to it, and the Assignor agrees to 
<PAGE>   22

save and hold the Secured Party harmless of and from, and to indemnify the
Secured Party against, any and all such obligations and liabilities, contingent
or otherwise, including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses incurred
in connection therewith.

      This Construction Documents Assignment shall inure to the benefit of the
Secured Party and its successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon the
Assignor and its successors and assigns, and shall continue in full force and
effect until all obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of any kind now or
hereafter due the Secured Party from the Assignor under or with respect to the
Lease or any of the other Operative Documents, or which are otherwise secured
hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising or incurred (collectively, the
"Liabilities"), have been fully paid, performed and satisfied, and all
Commitments have terminated, at which time this Construction Documents
Assignment will terminate. The Secured Party will not exercise any of its rights
hereunder until there shall have occurred and be continuing a Lease Event of
Default.

      For purposes of completing the Construction after any Lease Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Secured Party may, at its
option, further assign its right, title and interest in the Collateral without
the consent of the Assignor, or any contractor or architect.

      This Construction Documents Assignment is a present, perfected and
absolute assignment; provided, however, that the Secured Party shall not have
the right to undertake completion of the Construction or directly to enforce the
provisions of any Construction Contract or any Architect's Agreement until a
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. During the
continuance of any such Event of Default, the Secured Party may, without
affecting any other right or remedy available to it, exercise its rights under
this Construction Documents Assignment as provided herein in any manner
permitted by law. If any notice to the Assignor is required by law, such notice
shall be deemed commercially reasonable if given at least ten (10) days prior to
the date of intended action.

      This Construction Documents Assignment may be effectively waived,
modified, amended or terminated only by a written instrument executed by the
Secured Party and the Lessee. Any waiver by the Secured Party shall be effective
only with respect to the specific instance described therein. Delay or course of
conduct shall not constitute a waiver of any right or remedy of the Secured
Party.

      Unless the context shall otherwise require, capitalized terms used and not
defined in this Construction Documents Assignment shall have the meanings
assigned thereto in Appendix A 

                                      -2-

(as defined in the Construction Agency Agreement) for all purposes hereof; and
the rules of interpretation set forth in Appendix A shall apply to this
Construction Documents Assignment.

      THIS CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS ASSIGNMENT SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED
BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA (EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT-OF-LAW OR
CHOICE-OF-LAW RULES WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERNAL LAWS OF
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) AS TO ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND
PERFORMANCE.

as defined in Article 7 and the Contractor's Fee determined as follows:

(State a lump sum of Cost of the Work or other provision for determining the

improvements.



5.2   GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE (IF APPLICABLE)

5.2.1 The sum of the Cost of the Work and the Contractor's Fee is guaranteed by
the Contractor not to exceed the amount to be established pursuant to this
Paragraph 5.2.1 [Dollars($_________)] subject to additions and deductions by

<PAGE>   4

Costs which would cause the Guaranteed Maximum Price to be exceeded shall be
paid by the Contractor without reimbursement by the Owner.

(Insert specific provisions if the Contractor is to participate in any savings.)


     Within fifteen (10) days after Contractor receives completed Construction
Drawings and Specifications, Contractor shall submit to Owner a proposed
Guaranteed Maximum Price (excluding Tenant Improvements) based on the
subcontractor bids selected in accordance with Article 10 of this Agreement and
Article 5 of the General Conditions and in such detail as Owner shall reasonably

in Paragraph 12.5.1. The actual Guaranteed Maximum Price shall be determined and
agreed upon by Owner and Contractor within ten (10) days of Owner's receipt of
such proposal, but in no event later than June 30, 1997. In the event Owner and
Contractor cannot agree on the actual Guaranteed Maximum Price by such date,
then either party may terminate this Agreement and such termination shall be
deemed a Termination for Convenience pursuant to Paragraph 14.2 of the General
Conditions. The estimate of the Guaranteed Maximum Price (exclusive of the
Contractor's Fee) based on preliminary construction drawings and specifications
("Preliminary Guaranteed Maximum Price") is as follows:

                  Office Building         $ 9,822,855
                  -----------------------------------
                  Parking Structure       $ 9,652,125
                  -----------------------------------
                  Site Work               $ 1,048,331
                  -----------------------------------
                  CC5/WHQ Interconnect    $   121,763
                  -----------------------------------
                                          $20,645,074
                  -----------------------------------

5.2.2 The Guaranteed Maximum Price is based upon the following alternates, if
any, which are described in the Contract Documents and are hereby accepted by
the Owner:

(State the numbers or other identification of accepted alternates, not only if a
Guaranteed Maximum Price is inserted in Subparagraph 5.2.1. If decisions on
other alternates are to be made by the Owner subsequent to the execution of this
Agreement, attach a schedule of such other alternates showing the amount for
each and the date until which that amount is valid.)


5.2.3 The amounts agreed to for unit prices, if any, are as follows:

(State unit prices only if a Guaranteed maximum Price is inserted in
Subparagraph 5.2.1)


                                    ARTICLE 6
                               CHANGES IN THE WORK

6.1   CONTRACTS WITH A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE

6.1.1 Adjustments to the Guaranteed Maximum Price on account of changes in the
Work may be determined by any of the methods listed in subparagraph 7.3.3 of the
General Conditions.


                                       4
<PAGE>   5

6.1.2 In calculating adjustments to subcontracts (except those awarded with the
Owner's prior consent on the basis of cost plus a fee), the terms "cost" and
"fee" as used in Clause 7.3.3.3 of the General Conditions and the terms "costs"
and "a reasonable allowance for overhead and profit" as used in Subparagraph
7.3.6 of the General Conditions shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
General Conditions and shall not be modified by Articles 5, 7 and 8 of this
Agreement. Adjustments to subcontracts awarded with the Owner's prior consent on
the basis of cost plus a fee shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of
[those subcontracts] this Agreement, unless the Owner has furnished the 
Contractor with prior written approval of the form and substance of a
subcontract, in which case such adjustments shall be calculated in accordance
with the terms and conditions of that subcontract.

6.1.3 In calculating adjustments to this Contract, the terms "cost" and "costs"
as used in the above-referenced provisions of the General Conditions shall mean
the Cost of the Work as defined in Article 7 of this Agreement and the terms
"fee" and "a reasonable allowance for overhead and profit" shall mean the
Contractor's Fee as defined in Paragraph 5.1 of this Agreement.

6.1.4 Contractor understands and agrees that neither the Contract Sum nor the
Contract Time may be increased or extended except as provided in the Contract
Documents. Contractor agrees that the Contract Sum and Contract Time cannot be
changed by implication, oral agreement, course of conduct, course of dealing, or
other method not specifically set forth in the Contract Documents. The Owner's
decision in any instance to increase the Contract Sum or extend the Contract
Time when such increase or extension is not required by the Contract Documents
(e.g., pursuant to an oral agreement) shall not serve to waive Owner's right to
require a written Change Order or Change Directive in every other instance and
shall not estop Owner from denying any other increase or extension that is not
required under the express provisions of the Contract Documents.

[6.2   CONTRACTS WITHOUT A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE]

[6.2.1 Increased costs for the items set forth in Article 7 which result from
changes in the Work shall become part of the Cost of the Work, and the
Contractor's Fee shall be adjusted as provided in Paragraph 5.1.]

[6.3   ALL CONTRACTS]

[6.3.1 If no specific provision is made in Paragraph 5.1 for adjustment of the
Contractor's Fee in the case of changes in the Work, or if the extent of such
changes is such, in the aggregate, that application of the adjustment provisions
of Paragraph 5.1 will cause substantial inequity to the Owner or Contractor, the
Contractor's Fee shall be equitably adjusted on the basis of the Fee established
for the original Work.]

contributions, assessments and benefits required by law or collective bargaining
agreements and, for personnel not covered by such agreements, customary benefits

fully consumed, whether sold to others or retained by the Contractor. Cost for

consumed in the performance of the Work. Any such items used but not consumed,
which are paid for by the Owner, shall become the property of the Owner and
shall be delivered to the Owner upon completion of the Work in accordance with
instructions furnished by the Owner. If the Owner elects, however, the
Contractor shall purchase any such items from the Owner at a purchase price
equal to the original cost charged to the Owner, less the reduction in fair
market value resulting directly from use of any such item in connection with the
Work or such other price which is mutually acceptable to the Owner and the
Contractor. Upon demand by the Owner, the Contractor shall furnish the Owner

location of the Project. The Contractor shall obtain bids for all machinery and
equipment to be rented from no less than two (2) responsible suppliers other
than the Contractor itself or an affiliate. The Owner shall, with the advice of
the Contractor and the Development Manager, determine which bid is to be
accepted and, if the Contractor is offering to rent its equipment or machinery,
determine whether to accept one of the bids or whether to accept Contractor's
offer to rent such equipment or machinery. In no event shall the Contractor be
entitled to reimbursement for any cumulative total of rental charges in
connection with any single piece of machinery or equipment in excess of the
difference between (x) the fair market value of the piece of machinery or
equipment on the date it is first rented in connection with the Work, and (y)
the fair market value of the piece of machinery or equipment on the last day it
is rented in connection with the Work. The Contractor shall pay any excess
rental charges.

                        SUBCONTRACTS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

10.1 Those portions of the Work that the Contractor does not customarily perform
with the Contractor's own personnel shall be performed under subcontracts or by
other appropriate agreements with the Contractor. The Contractor shall obtain
bids from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated
especially for the Work and shall deliver such bids to the [Architect]
Development Manager. The Owner will then determine, with the advice of the
Contractor and subject to the reasonable objection of the Development Manager or
Architect, which bids will be accepted. The Owner may designate specific persons
or entities from whom the Contractor shall obtain bids; however, if a Guaranteed
Maximum Price has been established, the Owner may not prohibit the Contractor
from obtaining bids from others. The Contractor shall not be required to
contract with anyone to whom the Contractor has reasonable objection.

10.2 If a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specific bidder
among those whose bids are delivered by the Contractor to the Development
Manager [Architect] (1) is recommended to the Owner by the Contractor; (2) is
qualified to perform that portion of the Work; [and] (3) has submitted a bid
which conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without
reservations or exceptions, but the Owner requires that another bid be accepted,
and (4) Owner's objection to the specific bidder recommended to Owner by
Contractor is not reasonable; then the Contractor may require that a Change
Order be issued to adjust the Guaranteed Maximum Price by the lesser of (i) the
difference between the bid of the person or entity recommended to the Owner by
the Contractor and the amount of the subcontract or other agreement actually
signed with the person or entity designated by the Owner, and (ii) the
difference between the bid of the person or entity recommended by the Owner to
the Contractor and the amount attributable to such subcontract or other
agreement in the original schedule of values with respect to the Guaranteed
Maximum Price submitted by the Contractor and accepted by the Owner.

instructions, drawings, receipts, vouchers, memoranda or any other data relating
to the Contract Documents reveals an overcharge, Contractor shall pay Owner upon
demand an amount equal to the overcharge, plus simple interest from the date of
such overcharge at the annual rate of 10% as reimbursement for said overcharge
and the administrative expenses incurred in determining the overcharge. The
requirements of this Paragraph 11.2 shall not apply to any portion of an
overcharge which is the subject of a good faith dispute between the Owner and
the Contractor.

                                PROGRESS PAYMENTS

12.1 Based upon Applications for Payment and all supporting documentation
submitted to the [Architect] Development Manager by the Contractor and
Certificates for Payment issued [by the Architect] pursuant to Article 9 of the
General Conditions, the Owner shall make progress payments on account of the
Contract Sum to the Contractor as provided below and elsewhere in the Contract
Documents.

12.2 The period covered by each Application for Payment shall be [one calendar
month ending on the last day of the month, or as follows] as established in
Article 9 of the General Conditions.[:]

12.3 [Provided an Application for Payment is received by the Architect not later

provisions set forth in the General Conditions.

12.4 With each Application for Payment the Contractor shall submit payrolls,
petty cash accounts, receipted invoices or invoices with check vouchers
attached, and any other evidence required by the Owner or [Architect]
Development Manager to demonstrate that cash disbursements already made by the
Contractor on account of the Cost of the Work equal or exceed (1) progress
payments already received by the Contractor; less (2) that portion of those
payments attributable to the Contractor's Fee; plus (3) payrolls for the period
covered by the present Application for Payment; plus (4) retainage provided in
Subparagraph 12.5.4, if any,

applicable to prior progress payments. In addition to any other items required
in this Paragraph 12.4 or in Paragraph 9.3.1.3 of the General Conditions, each
Application for Payment shall be accompanied by the following, all in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner and in compliance with applicable
California statutes:

      (1)   Duly executed waivers of mechanics' and materialmen's liens from the
            Contractor and all such Subcontractors, establishing payment or
            satisfaction of the payment requested by the Contractor in the
            Application for Payment; and

      (2)   Such other information, documentation and materials as the Owner or
            the Development Manager may require, including without limitation
            invoices from Subcontractors or Sub-subcontractors evidencing
            amounts requested in such Application for Payment.

12.5  CONTRACTS WITH A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE

12.5.1 Each Application for Payment shall be based upon the most recent schedule
of values submitted by the Contractor in accordance with the Contract Documents.
The schedule of values shall allocate the entire Guaranteed Maximum Price among
the various portions of the Work, except that the Contractor's Fee shall be
shown as a single separate item. The schedule of values shall be prepared in
such form and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as the
[Architect] Development Manager may require. This schedule, unless objected to
by the [Architect] Development Manager or the Owner, shall be used as a basis
for reviewing the Contractor's Applications for Payment.

12.5.2 Applications for Payment shall show the percentage completion of each
portion of the Work as of the end of the period covered by the Application for
Payment. The percentage completion shall be the lesser of (1) the percentage of
that portion of the Work which has actually been completed or (2) the percentage
obtained by dividing (a) the expense which has actually been incurred by the
Contractor on account of that portion of the Work for which the Contractor has
made or intends to make actual payment prior to the next Application for Payment
by (b) the share of the Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of
the Work in the schedule of values.

12.5.3 Subject to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount of each
progress payment shall be computed as follows:

12.5.3.1 Take that portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to
completed Work as determined by multiplying the percentage completion of each
portion of the Work by the share of the Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to
that portion of the Work in the schedule of values. Pending final determination
of cost to the Owner of changes in the Work, amounts not in dispute may be
included as provided in subparagraph 7.3.7 of the General Conditions, even
though the Guaranteed Maximum Price has not yet been adjusted by Change order.

12.5.3.2 If approved in advance in writing by the Owner, [Add] add that portion
of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to materials and equipment
delivered and suitably

stored at the site for subsequent incorporation in the Work or, if approved in
advance by the Owner, suitably stored off the site at a location agreed upon in
writing.

12.5.3.3 Add the Contractor's Fee, less retainage of ten percent (10%). The
Contractor's Fee shall be computed upon the Cost of the Work described in the
two preceding Clauses at the rate stated in Paragraph 5.1 or, if the
Contractor's Fee is stated as a fixed sum in that Paragraph, shall be an amount
which bears the same ratio to that fixed-sum Fee as the Cost of the Work in the
two preceding Clauses bears to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the
Work upon its completion.

12.5.3.4 Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.

12.5.3.5 Subtract the shortfall, if any, indicated by the Contractor in the
documentation required by Paragraph 12.4 to substantiate prior Applications for
Payment, or resulting from errors subsequently discovered by the Owner's
accountants in such documentation.

12.5.3.6 Subtract amounts, if any, for which the Architect and Development
Manager has withheld or nullified a Certificate for Payment as provided in
Paragraph 9.5 of the General Conditions and other amounts, not including
retainage described in Paragraph 12.5.3.3, properly held by the Owner under the
Contract Documents at the time of each progress payment.

12.5.4 Additional retainage, if any, shall be as follows: The Owner shall
withhold as retainage ten percent (10%) of all Cost of the Work items and of the
Contractor's Fee included in each Application for Payment; provided, however, at
no time shall retainage in the aggregate exceed five percent (5%) of the Cost of
the Work. Retainage for Cost of the Work attributable to rebar, concrete,
shoring, mass excavation and certain other trades may be subject to a further
limitation on retainage as approved in writing by Owner, Lender and Contractor.
Any retainage under this Paragraph 12.5.4 shall not duplicate any amounts
retained pursuant to Subparagraphs 12.5.3.3, 12.7.1, or 12.7.2. The Owner shall
have the option, but not the obligation, to reduce the retainage requirement of
this Agreement or release any portion of retainage prior to the date specified
in the Contract Documents. Any exercise of this option, however, shall be in
writing and shall not be a waiver of (1) any of the Owner's rights to retainage
in connection with other payments to the Contractor, or (2) any other right or
remedy that the Owner has under the Contract Documents, at law or in equity.

(If it is intended to retain additional amounts from progress payments to the
Contractor beyond (1) the retainage from the Contractor's Fee provided in Clause
12.5.3.3, (2) the retainage from Subcontractors provided in Paragraph 12.7
below, and (3) the retainage, if any, provided by other provisions of the
contract, insert provision for such additional retainage here. Such provision,
if made, should also describe any arrangement for limiting or reducing the
amount retained after the Work reaches a certain state of completion.)

12.6.2.1 Take the Cost of the Work as described in subparagraph 12.6.1.

12.8.2.2 Add the Contractor's Fee, less retainage of ________________ percent
(________%). The Contractor's Fee shall be computed upon the Cost of the Work
described in the preceding Clause 12.6.2.1 at the rate stated in Paragraph 5.1
or, if the Contractor's Fee is stated as a fixed sum in that Paragraph, an
amount which bears the same ratio to that fixed-sum Fee as the Cost of the Work
in the preceding Clause bears to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of
the Work upon its completion.

12.6.2.3 Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.

12.6.2.4 Subtract the shortfall, if any, indicated by the Contractor in the
documentation required by Paragraph 12.4 or to substantiate prior Applications
for Payment or resulting from errors subsequently discovered by the Owner's
accountants in such documentation.

withdrawn a Certificate for Payment as provided in the Contract Documents.

12.6.3  Additional retainage, if any, shall be as follows:]

12.7 Except with the Owner's prior approval, payments to Subcontractors included
in the Contractor's Applications for Payment shall not exceed an amount for each
Subcontractor calculated as follows:

12.7.1 Take that portion of the Subcontract Sum properly allocable to completed
Work as determined by multiplying the percentage completion of each portion of
the Subcontractor's Work by the share of the total Subcontract Sum allocated to
that portion in the Subcontractor's schedule of values, less retainage of ten
percent (10%). Pending final determination of amounts to be paid to the
Subcontractor for changes in the Work, amounts not in dispute may be included as
provided in Subparagraph 7.3.7 of the General Conditions even though the
Subcontract Sum has not yet been adjusted by Change order.

12.7.2 If approved in writing in advance in writing by Owner, Add add that
portion of the Subcontract Sum properly allocable to materials and equipment
delivered and suitably stored at the site for subsequent incorporation in the
Work or, if approved in advance by the Owner, suitably stored off the site at a
location agreed upon in writing, less retainage of ten percent (10%).

12.7.3  Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Contractor to
the Subcontractor.

12.7.4 Subtract amounts, if any, for which the Architect has withheld or
nullified a Certificate for Payment by the Owner to the Contractor for reasons
which are the fault of the Subcontractor

and other amounts, not including retainage described in Paragraph 12.7.1 and
12.7.2, properly held by the Owner under the Contract Documents at the time of
each progress payment.

12.7.5 Add, upon Substantial Completion of the entire Work of the Contractor, a
sum sufficient to increase the total payments to the Subcontractor to one
hundred percent (100%) of the Subcontract Sum, less amounts, if any, for
incomplete Work and unsettled claims; and, if final completion of the entire
Work is thereafter materially delayed through no fault of the Subcontractor, add
any additional amounts payable on account of Work of the Subcontractor in
accordance with Subparagraph 9.10.3 of the General Conditions.

(If it is intended, prior to Substantial Completion of the entire Work of the
Contractor, to reduce or limit the retainage from Subcontractors resulting from
the percentages inserted in Subparagraphs 12.7.1 and 12.7.2 above, and this is
not explained elsewhere in the Contract Documents, insert here provisions for
such reduction or limitation.)

The Subcontract Sum is the total amount stipulated in the subcontract to be paid
by the Contractor to the Subcontractor for the Subcontractor's performance of
the subcontract.

12.8 Except with the Owner's prior approval, the Contractor shall not make
advance payments to suppliers for materials or equipment which have not been
delivered and stored at the site.

12.9 In taking action on the Contractor's Applications for Payment, the
Architect and Development Manager shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy and
completeness of the information furnished by the Contractor and shall not be
deemed to represent that the Architect or Development Manager has made a
detailed examination, audit or arithmetic verification of the documentation
submitted in accordance with Paragraph 12.4 or other supporting data; that the
Architect or Development Manager has made exhaustive or continuous on-site
inspections or that the Architect or Development Manager has made examinations
to ascertain how or for what purposes the Contractor has used amounts previously
paid on account of the Contract. Such examinations, audits and verifications, if
required by the Owner, will be performed by the Owner's accountants acting in
the sole interest of the Owner.

13.2.1 Take the sum of the Cost of the Work substantiated by the Contractor's
final accounting and the Contractor's Fee; but not more than the Guaranteed
Maximum Price, [if any.]

13.2.2 Subtract amounts, if any, for which the Development Manager and Architect
withholds, in whole or in part, a final Certificate for Payment as provided in
Subparagraph 9.5.1 of the General Conditions or other provisions of the Contract
Documents.

13.2.3  Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.

If the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner exceeds the amount due
the Contractor, the Contractor shall reimburse the difference to the Owner.

13.3 The Owner's accountants will review and report in writing on the
Contractor's final accounting within 30 days after delivery of the final
accounting to the Architect by the Contractor. Based upon such Cost of the Work
as the Owner's accountants report to be substantiated by the Contractor's final
accounting, and provided the other conditions of Paragraph 13.1 have been met,
the Architect will, within seven days after receipt of the written report of the
Owner's accountants, either issue to the Owner a final Certificate for Payment
with a copy to the Contractor, or notify the Contractor and Owner in writing of
the Architect's reasons for withholding a certificate as provided in
subparagraph 9.5.1 of the General Conditions. The time periods stated in this
Paragraph 13.3 supersede those stated in subparagraph 9.4.1 of the General
Conditions.

13.4 If the Owner's accountants report the Cost of the Work as substantiated by
the Contractor's final accounting to be less than claimed by the Contractor, the
Contractor shall be entitled to demand arbitration of the disputed amount
without a further decision of the Architect. Such demand for arbitration shall
be made by the Contractor within 30 days after the Contractor's receipt of a
copy of the Architect's final Certificate for Payment; failure to demand
arbitration within this 30-day period shall result in the substantiated amount
reported by the Owner's accountants becoming binding on the Contractor. Pending
a final resolution by arbitration, the Owner shall pay the Contractor the amount
certified in the Architect's final Certificate for Payment.

13.5 If, subsequent to final payment and at the Owner's request, the Contractor
incurs costs described in Article 7 and not excluded by Article 8 to correct
defective or nonconforming Work, the Owner shall reimburse the Contractor such
costs and the Contractor's Fee applicable thereto on the same basis as if such
costs had been incurred prior to final payment, but not in excess of the
Guaranteed Maximum Price, if any. [If the Contractor has participated in savings
as provided in Paragraph 5.2, the amount of such savings shall be recalculated
and appropriate credit given to the Owner in determining the net amount to be
paid by the Owner to the Contractor.]

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

14.1 Where reference is made in this Agreement to a provision of the General
Conditions or another Contract Document, the reference refers to that provision
as amended or supplemented by other provisions of the Contract Documents.

14.2 Payments due and unpaid under the Contract shall bear interest from the
date payment is due at the rate stated below, or in the absence thereof, at the
legal rate prevailing from time to time at the place where the Project is
located.

(Insert rate of interest agreed upon, if any.)


(Usury laws and requirements under the Federal Truth in lending Act, similar
state and local consumer credit laws and other regulations at the Owner's and
Contractor's principal places of business, the location of the Project and
elsewhere may affect the validity of this provision. Legal advice should be
obtained with respect to deletions or modifications, and also regarding
requirements such as written disclosures or waivers.)

14.3  Other provisions:

A. (i)   Contractor has included zero (0) days of weather related delays in
the schedule.  In the event the work is delayed by weather, the completion
date shall be extended by the actual number of days lost.

   (ii) The construction schedule is based on all design information, permits
and approvals being available when needed to allow for a proper and continuous
flow of the construction. Subject to the limitations on delay contained in the
General Conditions, including without limitation Paragraphs 7.5 and 8.3 thereof,
any deviation from this will delay the completion date shown in Section 4.2.

B. Contingency Fund - Included in the Guaranteed Maximum Price is a contingency
fund in the amount of $_________ (to be determined). This contingency fund shall
be administered jointly by Owner and Contractor, neither of which shall
unreasonably withhold approval. This fund is not to be used for changes in the
scope or for upgrades in the quality of the Work as reflected in the Contract
Documents. The fund is intended to be used for additional costs necessary to
complete the Project which relate to necessary work about which Contractor had
no knowledge and would not reasonably be expected to have knowledge at the time
Contractor and Owner agreed upon the Guaranteed Maximum Price. In general, the
fund is to be used for coordination of items necessary for a completed building
and inadvertently missed. Examples included items not shown on the Plans and
Specifications that cause a "gap" between any subcontractors' scope of work or a
"gap" between Contractor's and a subcontractor's work, and items that are
improperly coordinated or are impractical in the Plans and Specifications and
must be modified at a cost.

C. Savings - All savings which are generated after the Guaranteed Maximum
Price is established will be returned to the Owner.


                                       18
<PAGE>   19

D. Subcontractors - All trades will be bid to a minimum of three qualified
subcontractors approved by the Owner, except the concrete work which shall be
performed by the Contractor. Concrete work is to be performed on a cost plus 10%
markup basis with a savings split of 70% to the Owner and 30% to the Contractor.
Owner or Owner's Representative will have the right to full audit of all
concrete estimates and cost reports upon completion of the work. The HVAC and
electrical work shall be negotiated with Critchfield Mechanical and Schwartz &
Lindheim, providing these subcontractors do not exceed their schematic budgets.
After competitive bidding, all bids will be analyzed by the Contractor and a
recommendation for selection will be presented to the Owner for approval.

E. Design-build - Electrical, HVAC, Plumbing and Fire Protection will be done on
a design-build basis. The engineering for each of these trades will be included
in the subcontractor scopes of work. Owner will engage consulting engineers who
will provide the following services:

   i.   Performance outline specifications and definition of finish/quality
levels during the schematic design phase.

   ii.  Reviews of design-build bids for compliance with performance
criteria, including evaluation of proposed designs and alternates.

   iii. Review and approval of design drawings provided by design-build
subcontractors prior to permit submittal.

   iv.  Review of shop drawings and submittals during construction.

                            TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION

15.1 The Contract may be terminated by the Contractor as provided in Article 14
of the General Conditions; however, the amount to be paid to the Contractor
under Subparagraph 14.1.2 or 14.2.5 (excluding the fee described in Paragraph
14.2.5(c) of the General Conditions, if applicable) of the General Conditions
shall not exceed the amount the Contractor would be entitled to receive under
Paragraph 15.3 below, except that the Contractor's Fee shall be calculated as if
the Work had been fully completed by the Contractor, including a reasonable
estimate of the Cost of the Work for Work not actually completed.

15.2 If a Guaranteed Maximum Price is established in Article 5, the Contract may
be terminated by the Owner for cause as provided in Article 14 of the General
Conditions; however, the amount, if any, to be paid to the Contractor under
Subparagraph 14.2.4 of the General Conditions shall not cause the Guaranteed
Maximum Price to be exceeded, nor shall it exceed the amount the Contractor
would be entitled to receive under Paragraph 15.3 below.

15.3 If no Guaranteed Maximum Price is established in Article 5, the Contract
may be terminated by the Owner for cause as provided in Article 14 of the
General Conditions; however, the Owner shall then pay the Contractor an amount
calculated as follows:


                                       19

<PAGE>   20

15.3.1  Take the Cost of the Work incurred by the Contractor to the date of
termination.

15.3.2 Add the Contractor's Fee computed upon the Cost of the Work to the date
of termination at the rate stated in Paragraph 5.1 or, if the Contractor's Fee
is stated as a fixed sum in that Paragraph, an amount which bears the same ratio
to that fixed-sum Fee as the Cost of the Work at the time of termination bears
to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the Work upon its completion.

15.3.3  Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.

The Owner shall also pay the Contractor fair compensation, either by purchase or
rental at the election of the Owner, for any equipment owned by the Contractor
which the Owner elects to retain and which is not otherwise included in the Cost
of the Work under Subparagraph 15.3.1. To the extent that the Owner elects to
take legal assignment of subcontracts and purchase orders (including rental
agreements), the Contractor shall, as a condition of receiving the payments
referred to in this Article 15, execute and deliver all such papers and take all
such steps, including the legal assignment of such subcontracts and other
contractual rights of the Contractor, as the Owner may require for the purpose
of fully vesting in the Owner the rights and benefits of the Contractor under
such subcontracts or purchase orders.

15.4 The Work may be suspended by the Owner as provided in Article 14 of the
General Conditions; in such case, the Guaranteed Maximum Price, if any, shall be
increased as provided in Subparagraph 14.3.2 of the General Conditions except
that the term "cost of performance of the Contract" in that Subparagraph shall
be understood to mean the Cost of the Work and the term "profit" shall be
understood to mean the Contractor's Fee as described in Paragraphs 5.1 [and
6.3] of this Agreement.

written amendment to the Contract signed by both parties, (2) a Change Order,
(3) a Construction Change Directive or (4) a written order for a minor change in
the Work issued by the [Architect] Development Manager pursuant to Paragraph 7.4
or by the Owner. Unless specifically enumerated in the Agreement, the Contract
Documents do not include other documents such as bidding requirements
(advertisement or invitation to bid, instructions to Bidders, sample forms, the
Contractor's bid or portions of addenda relating to bidding requirements).

1.1.2 THE CONTRACT

The Contract Documents form the Contract for Construction. The Contract
represents the entire and integrated agreement between the parties hereto and
supersedes prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or
oral. The Contract may be amended or modified only by a Modification. [The
Contract Documents shall not be construed to create a contractual relationship
of any kind (l) between the Architect and Contractor, (2) between the Owner and
a Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor or (3) between any persons or entities
other than the Owner and Contractor. The Architect shall, however, be entitled
to performance and enforcement of obligations under the Contract intended to
facilitate performance of the Architect's duties.] The Contract Documents shall
not be construed to create a contractual relationship of any kind (1) between
the Architect and Contractor, (2) between the Development Manager and
Contractor, (3) between the Architect and Development Manager, (4) between the
Owner and a Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor (except as provided in Paragraph
5.4 hereof) or (5) between any persons or entities other than the Owner and
Contractor. The Development Manager and Architect shall, however, be entitled to
performance by the Contractor and to enforce the obligations of the Contractor
under the Contract as the same are intended to facilitate performance of their
duties.

1.1.3 THE WORK

The term "Work" means the construction and services required by the Contract
Documents, whether completed or partially completed, and includes all other
labor, materials, equipment and services provided or to be provided by the
Contractor to fulfill the Contractor's obligations. The Work may constitute the
whole or a part of the Project.

1.1.12      CONCEALED CONDITIONS

Conditions at site which are (i) subsurface or otherwise concealed physical
conditions which differ materially from those indicated in the Contract
Documents, or (ii) unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature which differ
materially from those ordinarily found to exist and generally recognized as
inherent in construction activities of the character provided for in the
Contract Documents (including, without limitation, existence of asbestos,
phychlorinated biphenyls, or other hazardous materials) which adversely affect
the quality or cost of the Work.

1.2   EXECUTION, CORRELATION AND INTENT

1.2.1 The Contract Documents shall be signed by the Owner and Contractor as
provided in the Agreement. If either the Owner or Contractor or both do not sign
all the Contract Documents, the Architect shall identify such unsigned Documents
upon request.

1.2.2 [Execution of the Contract by the Contractor is a representation that the
Contractor has visited the site, become familiar with local conditions under
which the Work is to be performed and correlated personal observations with
requirements of the Contract Documents.] Execution of the Contract by the
Contractor is a representation that said Contract Documents [are full and
complete,] are sufficient to have enabled the Contractor to determine the cost
of the Work therein to enter into the Contract, and that the Contract Documents
are sufficient to enable it to contract the Work outlined therein, and otherwise
to fulfill all its obligations hereunder, including, but not limited to,
contractor's obligation to construct the Work for an amount not in excess of the
Contract Sum on or before the date(s) of Substantial Completion established in
the Agreement. The Contractor further acknowledges and declares that it has
visited and examined the site, examined all physical, legal, and other
conditions affecting the Work and is fully familiar with all of the conditions
thereon and thereunder affecting the same. In connection therewith, Contractor
specifically represents and warrants to Owner that it has, by careful
examination, satisfied itself as to: (1) The nature, location, and character of
the Project and the site, including, without limitation, the surface [and
subsurface] conditions of the site and all structures and obstructions thereon
[and thereunder], both natural and man-made, and all surface [and subsurface]
water conditions of the site and the surrounding area; (2) the nature, location,
and character of the general area in which the Project is located,

including without limitation, its climatic conditions, available labor supply
and labor costs, and available equipment supply and equipment costs; and (3) the
quality and quantity of all materials, supplies, tools, equipment, labor, and
professional services necessary to complete the Work in the manner and within
the cost and time frame required by the Contract Documents. In connection with
the foregoing, and having carefully examined all Contract Documents, as
aforesaid, and having visited the site, the Contractor acknowledges and declares
that it has no knowledge of any discrepancies, omissions, ambiguities, or
conflicts in said Contract Documents, and that if it becomes aware of any such
discrepancies, or conflicts, it will promptly notify Development Manager and
Architect of such fact.

1.2.3 [The intent of the Contract Documents is to include all items necessary
for the proper execution and completion of the Work by the Contractor. The
Contract Documents are complementary, and what is required by one shall be as
binding as if required by all; performance by the Contractor shall be required
only to the extent consistent with the Contract Documents and reasonably
inferable from them as being necessary to produce the intended results.] The
intent of the Contract Documents is to include all items necessary for the
proper execution and completion of the Work by the Contractor. The Work shall
consist of all items specifically [included] shown in the Contract Documents as
well as all additional items of Work which are reasonably inferable from that
which is specified in order to complete the Work in accordance with the Contract
Documents. The Contract Documents are complementary, and what is required by any
one Contract Document shall be as binding as if required by all. Any differences
between the requirements of the Drawings and the Specifications or any
differences noted within the Drawing themselves or within the Specifications
themselves will be referred to the Owner, Development Manager and Architect by
Contractor.

1.2.4 Organization of the Specifications into divisions, sections and articles,
and arrangement of Drawings shall not control the Contractor in dividing the
Work among Subcontractors or in establishing the extent of Work to be performed
by any trade.

1.2.5 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents, words and abbreviations
which have well-known technical or construction industry meanings are used in
the Contract Documents in accordance with such recognized meanings.

1.3   OWNERSHIP AND USE OF ARCHITECT'S DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER
      DOCUMENTS

1.3.1 [The Drawings, Specifications and other documents prepared by the
Architect are instruments of the Architect's service through which the Work to
be executed by the Contractor is described. The Contractor may retain one
contract record set.] The Drawings, Specifications, and other similar or related
documents and copies thereof are furnished to the Contractor for the purpose of
performing the Work are, and shall remain, the property of the Owner. Neither
the Contractor nor any Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or material or equipment
supplier shall own or claim a copyright in the Drawings, Specifications [and
other documents prepared by the Architect, and unless otherwise indicated the
Architect shall be deemed the author of them and will retain all common law,
statutory and other reserved rights, in addition to the copyright. All copies of
them, except the Contractor's record set, shall be returned or suitably
accounted for to the Architect, on request, upon completion of the Work.] and
other similar or related documents, and Owner will retain all common law,
statutory, and other reserved rights, in addition to the copyright (including,
without limitation, the right to create derivative works therefrom). [All copies
of such document shall be returned to the Owner upon completion of the Work.]
The Drawings, Specifications and other similar or related documents [prepared by
the Architect], and copies thereof furnished to the Contractor, are for use
solely with respect to this Project. They are not to be used by the Contractor
or any Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or material or equipment supplier on
other projects or for additions to this Project outside the scope of the Work
without the specific written consent of the Owner [and Architect]. The
Contractor, Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors and material or equipment
suppliers are granted a limited license to use and reproduce applicable portions
of the Drawings, Specifications and other documents [prepared by the Architect]
appropriate to and solely for use in the execution of their Work under the
Contract Documents. All copies made under this license shall bear the statutory
copyright notice, if any, shown on the Drawings, Specifications and other
documents prepared by the Architect. Submittal or distribution to meet official
regulatory requirements or for other purposes in connection with this Project is
not to be construed as publication in derogation of [the Architect's] any
copyright or other reserved rights.

persistently fails to carry out Work in accordance with the Contract Documents,
the Owner, by written order signed personally or by an agent specifically so
empowered by the Owner in writing, may order the Contractor to stop the Work, or
any portion thereof, until the cause for such order has been eliminated;
however, the right of the Owner to stop the Work shall not give rise to a duty
on the part of the Owner to exercise this right for the benefit of the
Contractor or any other person or entity, except to the extent required by
Subparagraph 6.1.3.] If the Contractor fails to correct defective Work as
required by Paragraph 12.2, or fails to complete the Work within the Contract
Time or fails or refuses to provide a sufficient amount of properly supervised
and coordinated labor, materials, or equipment so as to be able to complete the
Work within the Contract Time, or fails to remove or discharge (within ten days)

accordance with the Agreement filed upon Owner's property by anyone claiming by,
through, or under Contractor, or disregards the instructions of Architect,
Development Manager or Owner when based upon the requirements of the Contract
Documents, or is in default of any of its obligations hereunder, the Owner, by a
written order signed by any agent specifically so empowered by the Owner in
writing, may order the Contractor to stop the Work, or any portion thereof,
until cause of such order has been eliminated; however, this right of the Owner
to stop the Work shall not give rise to any duty on the part of the Owner to
exercise this right for the benefit of the Contractor or any other person or
entity. This right shall be in addition to, and not in restriction of, the
Owner's rights under Paragraph 12.2.

2.4   OWNER'S RIGHT TO CARRY OUT THE WORK

written notice from the Owner to commence and continue correction of such
default or neglect with diligence and promptness, [the Owner may after such
seven-day period give the Contractor a second written notice to correct such
deficiencies within a second seven-day period. If the Contractor within such
second seven-day period after receipt of such second notice fails to commence
and continue to correct any deficiencies,] or fails within such seven-day period
to eliminate (or diligently commence to eliminate) the cause of any stop work
order issued under Subparagraph 2.3.1 hereof, the Owner may, without prejudice
to other remedies the Owner may have, correct such deficiencies. In such case an
appropriate Change Order shall be issued deducting from payments then or
thereafter due the Contractor the cost of correcting such deficiencies,
including compensation for the Development Manager's and Architect's and their
consultants' additional services and expenses made necessary by such default,
neglect or failure. [Such action by the Owner and amounts charged to the
Contractor are both subject to prior approval of the Architect.] If payments
then or thereafter due the Contractor are not sufficient to cover such amounts,
the Contractor shall pay the difference to the Owner.

otherwise alter such construction by the Owner or a separate contractor except
with written consent of the Owner and [of such separate contractor] such other

other Contractors the Contractor's consent to cutting or otherwise altering the
Work.

indemnify, defend and hold the Owner, Development Manager and Architect harmless
from loss on account thereof, but shall not be responsible for such defense or
loss when a particular design, process or product of a particular manufacturer
or manufacturers is required by the Contract Documents. However, if the
Contractor has reason (or should have had reason) to believe that the required
design, process or product is an infringement of a patent, the Contractor shall
be responsible for such loss unless such information is promptly furnished to
the Architect.

3.18  INDEMNIFICATION

3.18.1 [To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Contractor shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Owner, Architect, Architect's consultants, and agents and
employees of any of them from and against claims, damages, losses and expenses,
including but not limited to attorneys' fees, arising out of or resulting from
performance of the Work, provided that such claim, damage, loss or expense is
attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or
destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself) including loss of
use resulting therefrom, but only to the extent caused in whole or in part by
negligent acts or omissions of the Contractor, a Subcontractor, anyone directly
or indirectly employed by them or anyone for whose acts they may be liable,
regardless of whether or not such claim, damage, loss or expense is caused in
part by a party indemnified hereunder. Such obligation shall not be construed to
negate, abridge, or reduce other rights or obligations of indemnity which would
otherwise exist as to a party or person described in this Paragraph 3.18.] To 
the greatest extent permitted by law, the Contractor shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Owner, Development Manager, Architect and their agents,
shareholders, directors, employees, affiliates, consultants, successors and
assigns ("Indemnitees") from and against any and all of the following
("Claims"): (i) claims, damages, losses, liability and expenses, including but
not limited to attorneys' fees, arising out of or resulting from the act,
omission, negligence or willful misconduct of the Contractor, Subcontractors,
Sub-subcontractors or their employees or agents or in connection with the
performance of the Work; and (ii) any claim for payment or damages by a
Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor, except for claims resulting from Owner's
failure to pay Contractor in accordance with the Agreement for Work performed by
such Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor. Such Claims may include, but are not
limited to, mechanics' liens, unperfected claims of mechanics, materialmen or
laborers, bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, injury to or destruction of
tangible property, or a patent infringement. Such indemnity obligation shall not
be construed to negate, abridge, or otherwise reduce any other right or
obligation of indemnity which would otherwise exist in favor or any person or
party described in this Paragraph 3.18 under the Contract Documents or at law or
in equity. Nothing herein shall be deemed to abridge the right of Owner to seek
contribution where appropriate.

3.18.2 In claims against any person or entity indemnified under this paragraph
3.18 by an employee of the Contractor, a Subcontractor, anyone directly or
indirectly employed by them or anyone for whose acts they may be liable, the
indemnification obligation under this Paragraph 3.18 shall not be limited by a
limitation on amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or
for the Contractor or a Subcontractor under workers' or workmen's compensation
acts, disability benefit acts or other employee benefit acts.

3.18.3 The obligations of the Contractor under this paragraph 3.18 shall not
extend to the liability of the Development Manager, Architect, [the Architect's]
their consultants, and agents and employees of any of them arising out of (1)
the preparation or approval of maps, drawings, opinions, reports, surveys,
Change Orders, designs or specifications, or (2) the giving of the failure to
give directions or instructions by the Architect, the Architect's consultants,
and agents and employees of any of them provided such giving or failure to give
is the primary cause of the injury or damage.

3.18.4 The Contractor shall defend Indemnitees, through counsel reasonably
approved by Owner, in any action, proceeding or arbitration brought against the
Indemnitees, or any of them, by reason of any such claim described above in this
paragraph 3.18. The Contractor's obligation to defend Indemnitees shall extend
to any action, proceeding or arbitration alleging any claim described in this
paragraph 3.18, except if such action, proceeding or arbitration asserts or
alleges only that the injury to the claimant results solely from the negligence
or misconduct of Indemnitees, or any of them, and from no other cause, or if a
final judgment is obtained establishing that such injury to the claimant
resulted solely from the negligence or misconduct of Indemnitees, or any of
them, in which event Contractor's obligation to defend Indemnitees shall cease
upon the date such judgment becomes final and each Indemnitee shall thereupon
reimburse Contractor for its reasonable attorneys' fees, consultant's fees and
court costs incurred in so defending that Indemnitee.

3.18.5 If any claim or lien or stop-notice or any other demand for payment or
security therefor, including claims or demands upon the performance and payment
bond sureties, is made or filed with or against the Owner or the Project by
Contractor or by any Person claiming that the Contractor or any Subcontractor,
Sub-Subcontractor, Supplier or other person under it has failed to perform its
contractual obligations or to make payment for any labor, services, materials,
equipment, taxes, trust fund contribution or other items or obligations
furnished or incurred for, or in connection with, the Work, or if the Contractor
or any Subcontractor, Sub-Subcontractor, Supplier or other person under it
causes damage to the Work or fails to comply with the terms or provisions of the
Contract Documents (and Owner has not received insurance proceeds fully
compensating it for such damage or failure), then the Owner shall have the right
to retain from any payment then due or thereafter to become due an amount
sufficient to (1) satisfy, discharge and defend against any such claim of lien
or stop notice or other demand, or any action or proceeding thereon which may be
brought to judgment or award; (2) make good any such nonpayment, nonperformance,
damage, failure or default; and (3) compensate the Owner and other Indemnitees
for, and indemnify them against, any and all losses, reasonable accountants',
reasonable consultants' and reasonable experts' fees and costs which may be
sustained or incurred, by the Owner and other Indemnitees through counsel
reasonably approved by Owner in connection therewith. The Owner shall have the
right to apply and charge against any amount due to be paid to the Contractor,
or any amounts retained from such payments, as may be required for the foregoing
purposes. If the amount to be paid, or the amount retained, is insufficient
therefor, the Contractor shall be liable for the difference and upon written
demand shall immediately pay the same to the Owner. The provisions of this
paragraph are in addition to such other rights and entitlements as the
Indemnitees may enjoy against Contractor under this Agreement, the Contract
Documents, and at law and in equity, provided, however, the provisions of this
paragraph shall not apply to any claim of lien, stop-notice or other demand for
payment or security which arise out of Owner's breach of this Agreement,
including Owner's failure or the failure of the lender(s) for the Project to pay
for the Work which is the subject of the lien, stop notice or other demand.

3.18.6 Should any Subcontractor, Sub-Subcontractor, Supplier or other person
under them make, record or file, or maintain any action on or respecting, a
claim of mechanic's lien, a stop-notice or equitable lien, a claim of the
payment or performance bond, or a lis pendens, the Contractor shall immediately
and at its own expense procure, furnish and record appropriate statutory release
bonds, or take other action reasonably approved by Owner, which would under
applicable law extinguish or expense said claim, stop-notice or lis pendens. Any
failure of the Contractor to procure, furnish and record such release bond may
be treated by the Owner as an event of default under the Contract Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor shall have no obligations to take the
action required under this paragraph if any such claim, lien or lis pendens
results from Owner's failure to make progress payments required hereunder.

3.19.1 If the Owner furnishes to the Contractor a construction loan agreement or
similar agreement between Owner and any lender, Contractor agrees to fully
cooperate with Owner in reasonably complying with the provisions thereof and
agrees to furnish any and all information, reports and certificates which are
required thereunder. Contractor specifically agrees to make such changes to the
Contract Documents as the lender may reasonably request, including without
limitation, changes to the monthly payment schedule, retentions, data to be
delivered with invoices, lender inspections, delivery of notices to the lender
regarding various matters and assignment of the Contract Documents to the
lender.

3.19.2 The Contractor shall provide all documents, reports and other information
requested by any escrow agent or title insurer, and shall cooperate with such
persons to the fullest extent possible.

3.19.3 In the event any lender of the Owner shall designate an inspecting
architect or other representative, the Owner may require the concurrence of such
architect or representative in each instance in which approval of Owner,
Development Manager or Architect is required by any Provision of these General
Conditions or other Contract Documents. The Contractor agrees to cooperate with
such inspecting architect or representative.

3.20 Contractor shall, in addition to any other Contractor duties and
obligations set forth in this Contract and subject to the terms and provisions
of this Contract, perform the following:

3.20.1 The Contractor, and any Subcontractor if expressly requested by Owner or
Development Manager, shall provide Owner and Development Manager with a copy of
the current contractor's license and certificate of insurance for the Contractor
prior to payment of the first Application for Payment. The Contractor shall
remain at all times during the term of this Contract fully qualified and capable
of performing every phase of the Work to complete the Project, either itself or
through the Subcontractors.

3.20.2 The Contractor shall maintain at the site on a current basis records of
all Subcontracts, orders for materials and equipment, shop drawings, samples,
and any other related documents and revisions thereto which arise out of the
Contract Documents or the Work.

3.20.3 After Substantial Completion, the Contractor shall perform or assist
Owner or Development Manager in the start-up of all Equipment and other
mechanical operations and systems included as a part of the Work.

                                    ARTICLE 4

                         ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONTRACT

4.1   ARCHITECT AND DEVELOPMENT MANAGER

4.1.1 The Architect is the person lawfully licensed to practice architecture or
an entity lawfully practicing architecture identified as such in the Agreement
and is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if singular in number.
The term "Architect" means the Architect or the Architect's authorized
representative.

4.1.2 The Development Manager is Sares-Regis Group of Northern California, LP,
with offices at 393 Vintage Park Drive, Suite 100, Foster City, CA 94404-1134 or
such successor as the Owner may appoint from time to time by written notice to
the Contractor.

4.1.[2]3 [Duties, responsibilities and limitations of authority of the 
Architect as set forth in the Contract Documents shall not be restricted,
modified or extended without written consent of the Owner, Contractor and
Architect. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.] The duties,
responsibilities and limitations of authority of the Architect and Development
Manager as set forth in the Contract Documents shall not be modified or extended
without written consent of the Owner and the Architect or Development Manager
and written notice to the Contractor, except that the Owner may unilaterally
limit the Architect's or Development Manager's authority from time to time by
written notice to the Contractor; however, the limiting of the Development
Manager's or Architect's authority cannot be retroactive. Except to the extent
provided in Paragraph 7.5, Owner shall have no liability for the negligence,
willful misconduct or defaults of Development Manager or Architect. If
Contractor incurs any expense or liability as a result thereof, Contractor shall
be subrogated to the rights, if any, of Owner against Development Manager or
Architect.

It is the intent of the parties that if there are any errors or inconsistencies
in the Specifications and Drawings or if the Specifications or Drawings are in
violation of Law, then (i) Contractor and the Architect preparing such
Specifications and Drawings shall allocate such liability and responsibility,
should they so elect, in a separate document of which Owner shall not be a
party, (ii) as between Owner and Contractor, Owner shall have no liability or
responsibility whatsoever (except to the limited extent provided in Paragraph
7.5).

4.1.4 In case of termination of employment of the Architect or Development
Manager, [the Owner shall appoint an architect against whom the Contractor makes
no reasonable objection and whose status under the Contract Documents shall be
that of the former architect.] Owner may at any time employ or retain any
licensed Architect or person or entity qualified to act as Architect or
Development Manager to perform all or any part of their duties hereunder or to
exercise any of their rights hereunder. Owner shall notify all parties in
writing (setting forth the scope of said replacement Architect's or Development
Manager's duties and responsibilities).

4.1.4 Disputes arising under Subparagraphs 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 shall be subject to
arbitration.

4.2   [ARCHITECT'S] ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONTRACT

4.2.1 [The Architect will provide administration of the Contract 2s described in
the Contract Documents, and will be the Owner's representative (I) during
construction, (2) until final payment is due and (3) with the Owner's
concurrence, from time to time during the correction period described in
Paragraph 12.2. The Architect will advise and consult with the Owner. The
Architect will have authority to act on behalf of the Owner only to the extent
provided in the Contract Documents, unless otherwise modified by written
instrument in accordance with other provisions of the Contract.] The Owner shall
provide administration of the Contract as hereinafter described and may delegate
any part of such obligation to the Development Manager or Architect, but such
delegation shall not limit the Owner's right to require its concurrence or
approval of the Development Manager's or Architect's actions, if the Owner so
elects. The Owner may participate in all major meetings as required, and may
serve as the person through whom the Contractor special communications and needs
are passed, including requests for information and special consultation with
architects, engineers, outside consultants and lending institutions.

<PAGE>   32

The Development Manager, with the concurrence of the Owner and Architect, shall
have general supervision and direction of the Work. The Architect, with the
approval of the Owner in each case shall supervise and instruct the Contractor
with regard to matters set forth in the Drawings and Specifications. In addition
to any specific responsibilities assigned elsewhere in the Contract Documents,
the Owner shall decide any and all questions which may arise as to the rate of
progress of the Work. The Development Manager and Architect will have authority
to act on behalf of the Owner only to the extent provided in the Contract
Documents, unless otherwise modified by written instrument executed by Owner.

4.2.2 The Architect will visit the site at intervals appropriate to the stage of
construction to become generally familiar with the progress and quality of the
completed Work and to determine in general if the Work is being performed in a
manner indicating that the Work, when completed, will be in accordance with the
Contract Documents. However, the Architect will not be required to make
exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check quality or quantity of the
Work. On the basis of on-site observations as an architect, the Architect will
keep the Owner informed of progress of the Work, and will endeavor to guard the
Owner against defects and deficiencies in the Work.

4.2.3 The Development Manager and The the Architect will not have control over
or charge of and will not be responsible for construction means, methods,
techniques, sequences or procedures, or for safety precautions and programs in
connection with the Work, since these are solely the Contractor's responsibility
as provided in Paragraph 3.3. The Architect will not be responsible for the
Contractor's failure to carry out the Work in accordance with the Contract
Documents. The Architect will not have control over or charge of and will not be
responsible for acts or omissions of the Con-tractor, Subcontractors, or their
agents or employees, or of any other persons performing portions of the Work.

4.2.4 COMMUNICATIONS FACILITATING CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION. Except as otherwise
provided in the Contract Documents or when direct communications have been
specially authorized by Owner, the Owner and Contractor shall [endeavor to]
communicate through the [Architect] Development Manager; provided, however, that
Owner may instruct, correspond or negotiate with Contractor directly.
Communications by and with the Architect's consultants shall be through the
Architect. Communications by and with Subcontractors and material suppliers
shall be through the Contractor. Communications by and with [separate 
contractors] other Contractors shall be through the [Owner] Development Manager.

4.2.5 [Based on the Architect's observations and evaluations of the Contractor's
Applications for Payment, the Architect will review and certify the amounts due
the Contractor and will issue Certificates for Payment in such amounts.]

4.2.6 The Owner, Development Manager and Architect will have authority to reject
Work which does not conform to the Contract Documents. Whenever the Architect
considers it necessary or advisable for implementation of the intent of the
Contract Documents, and after consulting with Development Manager, the Architect
will have authority to require additional inspection or testing of the Work in
accordance with Subparagraphs 13.5.2 and 13.5.3, whether or not such Work is
fabricated, installed or completed. However, neither this authority of the
Owner, Development Manager and Architect nor a decision made in good faith
either to exercise or not to exercise such authority shall give rise to a duty
or responsibility of the Owner, Development Manager or Architect to the
Contractor, Subcontractors, material and equipment suppliers, their agents or
employees, or other persons performing portions of the Work.

4.2.7 The Architect will review and approve or take other appropriate action
upon the Contractor's submittals such as Shop Drawings, Product Data and
Samples, but only for the limited purpose of checking for conformance with
information given and the design concept expressed in the Contract Documents.
The Architect's action will be taken with such reasonable promptness as to cause
no delay in the Work or in the activities of the Owner, Contractor or separate
contractors, while allowing sufficient time in the Architect's professional
judgment to permit adequate review. Review of such submittals is not conducted
for the purpose of determining the accuracy and completeness of other details
such as dimensions and quantities, or for substantiating instructions for
installation or performance of equipment or systems, all of which remain the
responsibility of the Contractor as required by the Contract Documents. The
Architect's review of the Contractor's submittals shall not relieve the
Contractor of the obligations under Paragraphs 3.3, 3.5 and 3.12. The
Architect's review shall not constitute approval of safety precautions or,
unless otherwise specifically stated by the Architect, of any construction
means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures. The Architect's approval of
a specific item shall not indicate approval of an assembly of which the item is
a component.

4.2.8 The Architect Development Manager will [prepare] direct the Architect to
issue Change Orders and Construction Change Directives, and may authorize minor
changes in the Work as provided in Paragraph 7.4. All Change Orders and
Construction Change Directives shall require the approval of Owner in writing to
be binding on Owner.

4.2.9 The Architect will conduct inspections to determine the date or dates of
Substantial Completion and the date of Final Completion, will receive and
forward to the Owner for the Owner's review and records written warranties and
related documents required by the Contract and assembled by the Contractor, and
will issue a final Certificate for Payment upon compliance with the requirements
of the Contract Documents approve, subject to Owner's review and approval, the
final Application for Payment in such amounts.

4.2.10 If the Owner and Architect agree, the Architect will provide one or more
project representatives to assist in carrying out the Architect's
responsibilities at the site. The duties, responsibilities and limitations of
authority of such project representatives shall be as set forth in an exhibit to
be incorporated in the Contract Documents.

4.2.11 Subject to Paragraph 4.3 hereinbelow in respect of claims, the [The]
Architect will, in the first instance, interpret and decide matters concerning
performance under and requirements of the Contract Documents on written request
of either the Owner, Development Manager or Contractor. The Architect's response
to such requests will be made with reasonable promptness and within any time
limits agreed upon. If no agreement is made concerning the time within which
interpretations required of the Architect shall be furnished in compliance with
this Paragraph 4.2, then delay shall not be recognized on account of failure by
the Architect to furnish such interpretations until 15 days after written
request is made for them. Should a conflict be discovered within the Contract
Documents, the CONTRACTOR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE AGREED TO PERFORM THE WORK IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEVEL OF QUALITY ESTABLISHED IN THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATION
AND ACCEPTED INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR SIMILAR PROJECTS unless it shall have asked
for and obtained a decision, in writing, approved by Owner, from the Architect
before entering into the Contract.

4.2.12 Interpretations and decisions of the Architect will be consistent with
the intent of and reasonably inferable from the Contract Documents and will be
in writing or in the form of drawings. When making such interpretations and
decisions, the Architect will endeavor to secure faithful performance by both
Owner and Contractor, will not show partiality to either and will not be liable
for results of interpretations or decisions so rendered in good faith.

4.2.13 The Architect's decisions on matters relating to aesthetic effect will be
final if consistent with the intent expressed in the Contract Documents.

<PAGE>   33

4.3   CLAIMS AND DISPUTES

4.3.1 DEFINITION. A Claim is a demand or assertion by one of the parties
seeking, as a matter of right, adjustment [or interpretation] of Contract terms,
payment of money, extension of time or other relief with respect to the terms of
the Contract. The term "Claim" also includes other disputes [and matters in
question] between the Owner and Contractor arising out of or relating to the
Contract. Claims must be made by written notice. The responsibility to
substantiate Claims shall rest with the party making the Claim.

4.3.2 DECISION OF ARCHITECT. Claims, including those alleging an error or
omission by the Development Manager or Architect, shall be referred initially to
the Architect for action as provided in Paragraph 4.4. A decision by the
Architect, as provided in Subparagraph 4.4.4, shall be required as a condition
precedent to arbitration or litigation of a Claim between the Contractor and
Owner as to all such matters arising prior to the date final payment is due,
regardless of (1) whether such matters relate to execution and progress of the
Work or (2) the extent to which the Work has been completed. The decision by the
Architect in response to a Claim shall not be a condition precedent to
arbitration or litigation in the event (l) the position of Architect is vacant,
(2) the Architect has not received evidence or has failed to render a decision
within agreed time limits, (3) the Architect has failed to take action required
under Subparagraph 4.4.4 within 30 days after the Claim is made, (4) 45 days
have passed after the Claim has been referred to the Architect or (5) the Claim
relates to a mechanic's lien.

4.3.3 TIME LIMITS ON CLAIMS. Claims by either party must be made within 21 days
after occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claim or within 21 days after
the claimant first recognizes the condition giving rise to the Claim, whichever
is later. Claims must be made by written notice. An additional Claim made after
the initial Claim has been implemented by Change Order will not be considered
unless submitted in a timely manner.

4.3.4 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE. Pending final resolution of a Claim
including arbitration, unless otherwise agreed in writing the Contractor shall
proceed diligently with performance of the Contract and the Owner shall continue
to make payments in accordance with the Contract Documents.

4.3.5 WAIVER OF CLAIMS: FINAL PAYMENT. The making of final payment shall
constitute a waiver of Claims by the Owner except those arising from:

       .1     liens, Claims, security interests or encumbrances arising out of
              the Contract and unsettled;

       .2     failure of the Work to comply with the requirements of the
              Contract Documents; or

       .3     terms of special warranties required by the Contract Documents.

4.3.6 CLAIMS FOR CONCEALED OR UNKNOWN CONDITIONS. If a Concealed Condition is
discovered at the site [which are (1) subsurface or otherwise concealed physical
conditions which differ materially from those indicated in the Contract
Documents, or (2) unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature which differ
materially from those ordinarily found to exist and generally recognized as
inherent in construction activities of the character provided for in the
Contract Documents], then notice by the observing party shall be given to the
other party promptly before conditions are disturbed and in no event later than
21 days after first observance of the conditions. The Architect will promptly
investigate such conditions and, if they differ materially and cause an increase
or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or time required for, performance of
any part of the Work, and if Contractor neither knew nor should have known of
such Concealed Condition prior to entering into this Agreement or prior to
establishing the Guaranteed Maximum Price, will recommend an equitable
adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, or both. If the Architect
determines that the conditions at the site are not materially different from
those indicated in the Contract Documents or that Contractor either knew or
should have known of such Concealed Condition prior to the time established
above, and that no change in the terms of the Contract is justified, the
Architect shall so notify the Owner and Contractor in writing, stating the
reasons. Claims by either party in opposition to such determination must be made
within 21 days after the Architect has given notice of the decision. If the
Owner and Contractor cannot agree on an adjustment in the Contract Sum or
Contract Time, the adjustment shall be referred to the Architect for initial
determination, subject to further proceedings pursuant to Paragraph 4.4.

4.3.7 CLAIMS FOR ADDITIONAL COST. If the Contractor wishes to make Claim for an
increase in the Contract Sum, written notice as provided herein shall be given
before proceeding to execute the Work. Prior notice is not required for Claims
relating to an emergency endangering life or property arising under Paragraph
10.3. [If the Contractor believes additional cost is involved for reasons
including but not limited to (1) a written interpretation from the Architect,
(2) an order by the Owner to stop the Work where the Contractor was not at
fault, (3) a written order for a minor change in the Work issued by the
Architect, (4) failure of payment by the Owner, (5) termination of the Contract
by the Owner, (6) Owner's suspension or (7) other reasonable grounds, Claim
shall be filed in accordance with the procedure established herein.] Contractor
shall only be allowed to make and recover on a Claim for an increase in the
Contract Sum resulting from events specifically listed in Paragraph 7.5; no
other increase in the Cost of the Work shall result in an increase in the
Contract Sum.

4.3.8   CLAIMS FOR ADDITIONAL TIME

4.3.8.1 If the Contractor wishes to make Claim for an increase in the Contract
Time, written notice as provided herein shall be given. The Contractor's Claim
shall include an estimate of cost and of probable effect of delay on progress of
the Work. In the case of a continuing delay only one Claim is necessary.

4.3.8.2 If adverse weather conditions are the basis for a Claim for additional
time, such Claim shall be documented by data substantiating that weather
conditions [were abnormal for the period of time and could not have been
reasonably anticipated, and that weather conditions] had an adverse effect on 
the scheduled construction.

4.3.9 INJURY OR DAMAGE TO PERSON OR PROPERTY. If either party to the Contract
suffers injury or damage to person or property because of an act or omission of
the other party, of any of the other party's employees or agents, or of others
for whose acts such party is legally liable, written notice of such injury or
damage, whether or not insured, shall be given to the other party within a
reasonable time not exceeding 2 I days after first observance. The notice shall
provide sufficient detail to enable the other party to investigate the matter.
If a Claim for additional cost or time related to this Claim is to be asserted,
it shall be filed as provided in Subparagraphs 4.3.7 or 4.3.8.

4.4   RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTES

4.4.1 The Architect will review Claims and take one or more of the following
preliminary actions within ten days of receipt of a Claim: (1) request
additional supporting data from the claimant, (2) submit a schedule to the
parties indicating when the Architect expects to take action, (3) reject the
Claim in whole or in part, stating reasons for rejection, (4) recommend approval
of the Claim by the other party or (5) suggest a compromise. The Architect may
also, but is not obligated to, notify the surety, if any, of the nature and
amount of the Claim.

4.4.2 If a Claim has been resolved, the Architect, or at Owner's sole option,
Owner will prepare or obtain appropriate documentation.

4.4.3 If a Claim has not been resolved, the party making the Claim shall, within
ten days after the Architect's preliminary response, take one or more of the
following actions: (1) submit additional supporting data requested by the
Architect, (2) modify the initial Claim or (3) notify the Architect that the
initial Claim stands.

4.4.4 If a Claim has not been resolved after consideration of the foregoing and
of further evidence presented by the parties or requested by the Architect, the
Architect will notify the parties in writing that the Architect's decision will
be made within seven days, which decision shall be [final and] considered
advisory only and not binding on the parties [but subject to arbitration]. Upon
expiration of such time period, the Architect will render to the parties the
Architect's written decision relative to the Claim, including any change in the
Contract Sum or Contract Time or both. If there is a surety and there appears to
be a possibility of a Contractor's default, the Architect may, but is not
obligated to, notify the surety and request the surety's assistance in resolving
the controversy.

4.5   ARBITRATION

4.5.1 CONTROVERSIES AND CLAIMS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. Any controversy or Claim
arising out of or related to the Contract, or the breach thereof, shall be
settled by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof, except controversies or Claims relating to aesthetic
effect and except those waived as provided for in Subparagraph 4.3.5. Such
controversies or Claims upon which the Architect has given notice and rendered a
decision as provided in Subparagraph 4.4.4 shall be subject to arbitration upon
written demand of either party. Arbitration may be commenced when 45 days have
passed after a Claim has been referred to the Architect as provided in Paragraph
4.3 and no decision has been rendered.

4.5.2 RULES AND NOTICES FOR ARBITRATION. Claims between the Owner and Contractor
not resolved under Paragraph 4,4 shall, if subject to arbitration under
Subparagraph 4.5.1, be decided by arbitration in accordance with the
Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
currently in effect, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. Notice of
demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party to the
Agreement between the Owner and Contractor and with the American Arbitration
Association, and a copy shall be filed with the Architect.

4.5.3 CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING ARBITRATION. During arbitration proceedings,
the Owner and Contractor shall comply with Subparagraph 4.3.4.

4.5.4 WHEN ARBITRATION MAY BE DEMANDED. Demand for arbitration of any Claim may
not be made until the earlier of (1) the date on which the Architect has
rendered a final written decision on the Claim, (2) the tenth day after the
parties have presented evidence to the Architect or have been given reasonable
opportunity to do so, if the Architect has not rendered a final written decision
by that date, or (3) any of the five events described in Subparagraph 4.3.2.

4.5.4.1 When a written decision of the Architect states that (1) the decision is
final but subject to arbitration and (2) a demand for arbitration of a Claim
covered by such decision must be made within 30 days after the date on which the
party making the demand receives the final written decision, then failure to
demand arbitration within said 30 days' period shall result in the Architect's
decision becoming final and binding upon the Owner and Contractor. If the
Architect renders a decision after arbitration proceedings have been initiated,
such decision may be entered as evidence, but shall not supersede arbitration
proceedings unless the decision is acceptable to all parties concerned.

4.5.4.2 A demand for arbitration shall be made within the time limits specified
in Subparagraphs 4.5.1 and 4.5.4 and Clause 4.5.4.1 as applicable, and in other
cases within a reasonable time after the Claim has arisen, and in no event shall
it be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings
based on such Claim would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations as
determined pursuant to Paragraph 13.7.

4.5.5 Limitation on Consolidation or Joinder. No arbitration arising out of or
relating to the Contract Documents shall include, by consolidation or joinder or
in any other manner, the Architect, the Architect's employees or consultants,
except by written consent containing specific reference to the Agreement and
signed by the Architect, Owner, Contractor and any other person or entity sought
to be joined. No arbitration shall include, by consolidation or joinder or in
any other manner, parties other than the Owner, Contractor, a separate
contractor as described in Article 6 and other persons substantially involved in
a common question of fact or law whose presence is required if complete relief
is to be accorded in arbitration. No person or entity other than the Owner,
Contractor or a separate contractor as described in Article 6 shall be included
as an original third party or additional third party to an arbitration whose
interest or responsibility is insubstantial. Consent to arbitration involving an
additional person or entity shall not constitute consent to arbitration of a
dispute not described therein or with a person or entity not named or described
therein. The foregoing agreement to arbitrate and other agreements to arbitrate
with an additional person or entity duly consented to by parties to the
Agreement shall be specifically enforceable under applicable law in any court
having jurisdiction thereof.

4.5.6 CLAIMS AND TIMELY ASSERTION OF CLAIMS. A party who files a notice of
demand for arbitration must assert in the demand all Claims then known to that
party on which arbitration is permitted to be demanded. When a party fails to
include a Claim through oversight, inadvertence or excusable neglect, or when a
Claim has matured or been acquired subsequently, the arbitrator or arbitrators
may permit amendment.

4.5.7 JUDGMENT ON FINAL AWARD. The award rendered by the arbitrator or
arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance
with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

                                    ARTICLE 5

                                 SUBCONTRACTORS

5.1   DEFINITIONS

5.1.1 A Subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct contract with the
Contractor to perform a portion of the Work at the site. The term
"Subcontractor" is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if singular
in number and means a Subcontractor or an authorized representative of the
Subcontractor. The term "Subcontractor does not include [a separate contractor]
other Contractors or subcontractors of [a separate contractor] other 
Contractors.

5.1.2 A Sub-subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct or indirect
contract with a Subcontractor to perform a portion of the Work at the site. The
term "Sub-subcontractor" is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if
singular in number and means a Sub-subcontractor or an authorized representative
of the Sub-subcontractor.

5.1.3 The terms Subcontractor and Sub-subcontractor also include persons
supplying materials and equipment incorporated into, used in connection with, or
consumed by the Work.

5.2   AWARD OF SUBCONTRACTS AND OTHER CONTRACTS FOR PORTIONS OF THE WORK

5.2.1 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents or the bidding
requirements, the Contractor, as soon as practicable after award of the
Contract, shall furnish in writing to the [Owner through the Architect]
Development Manager for review by the Owner, Development Manager and Architect
the names of persons or entities (including 


Language indicated as being shown by strike out in the typeset document is
enclosed in brackets "[" and "]" in the electronic format.

<PAGE>   35

those who are to furnish materials or equipment fabricated to a special design)
proposed for each portion of the Work.[ The Architect will promptly reply to the
Contractor in writing stating whether or not the Owner or the Architect, after
due investigation, has reasonable objection to any such proposed person or
entity. Failure of the Owner or Architect to reply promptly shall constitute
notice of no reasonable objection.] Copies of all bids or other proposals from
Subcontractors shall, upon request of the Owner, be submitted to the Owner. All
Subcontractors shall be subject to the approval of Owner which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

5.2.2 The Contractor shall not contract with a proposed person or entity to whom
the Owner, Development Manager or Architect has made reasonable and timely
objection. The Contractor shall not be required to contract with anyone to whom
the Contractor has made reasonable objection.

5.2.3 If the Owner, Development Manager or Architect has reasonable objection to
a person or entity proposed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall propose
another to whom the Owner, Development Manager or and Architect has have no
reasonable objection. The Contract Sum shall be increased or decreased by the
difference in cost occasioned by such change and an appropriate Change Order
shall be issued. However, no increase in the Contract Sum shall be allowed for
such change unless the Contractor has acted promptly and responsively in
submitting names as required.

5.2.4 The Contractor shall not change a Subcontractor, person or entity
previously selected if the Owner, Development Manager or Architect makes
reasonable objection to such change. The Owner may require the Contractor to
change any Subcontractor previously approved and, if at such time the Contractor
is not in default hereunder, the Contract Sum shall be increased or decreased by
the difference in cost occasioned by such change.

5.2.5 Prior to solicitation of bids from Subcontractors and material suppliers,
Contractor shall submit to the Owner, Development Manager and Architect a
proposed list of bidders. The Owner reserves the right to approve and add to
such bidders list. Such approval shall be in writing.

5.2.6 It is understood that in the event of a conflict between Owner, on the one
hand, and the Development Manager or Architect, on the other hand, regarding the
selection of subcontractors, the Owner's decision in selection of subcontractors
shall govern.

5.3   SUBCONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

5.3.1 By appropriate written agreement, [written where legally required for
validity,] the Contractor shall require each Subcontractor, to the extent of the
Work to be performed by the Subcontractor, to be bound to the Contractor by
terms of the Contract Documents, and to assume toward the Contractor all the
obligations and responsibilities which the Contractor, by these Documents,
assumes toward the Owner, Development Manager and Architect. Each subcontract
agreement shall preserve and protect the rights of the Owner, Development
Manager and Architect under the Contract Documents with respect to the Work to
be performed by the Subcontractor so that subcontracting thereof will not
prejudice such rights, and shall allow to the Subcontractor, unless specifically
provided otherwise in the subcontract agreement, the benefit of all rights,
remedies and redress against the Contractor that the Contractor, by the Contract
Documents, has against the Owner. Where appropriate, the Contractor shall
require each Subcontractor to enter into similar agreements with
Sub-subcontractors. The Contractor shall make available to each proposed
Subcontractor, prior to the execution of the subcontract agreement, copies of
the Contract Documents to which the Subcontractor will be bound, and, upon
written request of the Subcontractor, identify to the Subcontractor terms and
conditions of the proposed subcontract agreement which may be at variance with
the Contract Documents. Subcontractors shall similarly make copies of applicable
portions of such documents available to their respective proposed
Sub-subcontractors.

5.3.2 Any part of the work performed for the Contractor by a Subcontractor shall
be pursuant to a written Subcontract between the Contractor and such
Subcontractor, which shall be prepared on the form of Subcontract which the
Owner has approved. Each Subcontract shall:

       .1     require that such work be performed in accordance with the
              requirements of the Contract Documents;

       .2     waive all rights the contracting parties may have against one
              another or that the Subcontractor may have against the Owner for
              damages caused by fire or other perils covered by the property
              insurance described in the Contract Documents;

       .3     require the Subcontractor to carry and maintain liability
              insurance in accordance with the Contract Documents; and

       .4     require the Subcontractor to furnish such certificates and waivers
              of liens as Owner, any lender or title insurer may reasonably
              request including waivers of mechanics' lien rights to the extent
              permitted by law.

5.4   CONTINGENT ASSIGNMENT OF SUBCONTRACTS

5.4.1 [Each subcontract agreement for a portion of the Work is assigned by the
Contractor to the Owner provided that:

        .1    assignment is effective only after termination of the Contract by
              the Owner for cause pursuant to Paragraph 14.2 and only for those
              subcontract agreements which the Owner accepts by notifying the
              Subcontractor in writing; and

        .2    assignment is subject to the prior rights of the surety, if any,
              obligated under bond relating to the Contract.]

All subcontract agreements shall conform to the requirements of the Contract
Documents and Contractor hereby assigns to Owner (and Owner's permitted assigns)
all its interest in any subcontract agreements and purchase orders now existing
or hereinafter entered into by Contractor for performance of any part of the
Work, which assignment will be effective upon acceptance by Owner in writing and
only as to those subcontract agreements and purchase orders that Owner
designates in said writing. It is agreed and understood that Owner may only
accept said assignment upon (i) Termination for Cause pursuant to Paragraph
14.2.1, or (ii) upon Termination for Convenience pursuant to Paragraph 14.2.5
and payment of the fee as provided under Paragraph 14.2.6.2. Upon such
acceptance by Owner, (1) Contractor shall promptly furnish to Owner true and
correct copies of the designated subcontract agreements, and purchase orders,
and (2) Owner shall only be required to compensate the designated
Subcontractor(s) or supplier(s) for compensation accruing to such party(ies) for
Work done or materials delivered from and after the date on which Owner
determines to accept the subcontract agreement(s) or purchase order(s). All sums
due and owing by Contractor to the designated Subcontractor(s) or supplier(s)
for work performed or material supplied prior to Owner's determination to accept
the subcontract agreement(s) or purchase order(s) shall constitute a debt
between such parties and Contractor. It is further agreed that all subcontract
agreements and purchase orders shall provide that they are freely assignable by
Contractor to Owner and assigns under the terms and conditions stated
hereinabove. It is further agreed and understood that such assignment is part of
the consideration to Owner for entering into the Contract with Contractor any
may not be withdrawn prior to Final Completion. Contractor shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Owner a written acknowledgment in form and substance
satisfactory to Owner from each of its Subcontractors and suppliers of the
contingent assignment described herein no later than ten (10) days after the
date of

execution of each subcontract agreement and purchase order with such parties.

5.4.2 If the Work has been suspended for more than 30 days, he Subcontractor's
compensation shall be equitably adjusted.

5.5     CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTS OF SUBCONTRACTORS

5.5.1 The Contractor shall be totally responsible and liable for all acts and
omissions of the Subcontractors and each of their employees, agents and
independent contractors and all other parties for whose acts any of such
Subcontractors may be liable, to the same extent as the Contractor is
responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of parties directly employed
by the Contractor. The Contractor shall also be solely responsible for the
payment of the Subcontractor and all other persons directly or indirectly
employed by the Contractor or the Subcontractors, whether or not such persons
are entitled to assert mechanics' lien, stop notice, equitable lien or labor and
material lien rights against the Project or the site.

                                    ARTICLE 6

             CONSTRUCTION BY OWNER OR BY [SEPARATE] OTHER CONTRACTORS

6.1.1 OWNER'S RIGHT TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTION WITH OWN FORCES AND TO AWARD 
      [SEPARATE] OTHER CONTRACTS

6.1.1 The Owner reserves the right to perform construction or operations related
to the Project with the Owner's own forces, which include persons or entities
under separate contracts not administered by the Development Manager. The Owner
further reserves the right to award other contracts in connection with other
portions of the Project or other construction or operations on the site [and to
award separate contracts in connection with other portions of the Project or
other construction or operations on the item] under Conditions of the Contract
identical or substantially similar to these including those portions related to
insurance and waiver of subrogation. If the Contractor claims that delay or
additional cost is involved because of such action by the owner, the Contractor
shall make such Claim as provided elsewhere in the Contract Documents.

6.1.2 [When separate contracts are awarded for different portions of the Project
or other construction or operations on the site, the term "Contractor" in the
Contract Documents in each case shall mean the Contractor who executed each
separate Owner-Contractor Agreement.] When the Owner performs construction or
operations with the Owner's own forces, including persons or entities under
separate contracts not administered by the Development Manager, the Owner shall
provide for coordination of such forces with the Work of the Contractor in order
to prevent any disruption or delay to the Work of the Contractor, who shall
cooperate with them.

6.1.3 [The Owner shall provide for coordination of the activities of the Owner's
own forces and of each separate contractor with the Work of the Contractor, who
shall cooperate with them. The Contractor shall participate with other separate
contractors and the Owner in reviewing their construction schedules when
directed to do so. The Contractor shall make any revisions to the construction
schedule and Contract Sum deemed necessary after a joint review and mutual
agreement. The construction schedules shall then constitute the schedules to be
used by the Contractor, separate contractors and the Owner until subsequently
revised.

6.1.4 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, when the Owner
performs construction or operations related to the Project with the Owner's own
forces, the Owner shall be deemed to be subject to the same obligations and to
have the same rights which apply to the Contractor under the Conditions of the
Contract, including, without excluding others, those stated in Article 3, this
Article 6 and Articles 10, 11 and 12.]

6.2   MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY

6.2.1 The Contractor shall afford [the Owner and separate contractors] the
Owner's own forces, Development Manager and other Contractors reasonable
opportunity for introduction and storage of their materials and equipment and
performance of their activities and shall connect and coordinate the
Contractor's construction and operations with theirs as required by the Contract
Documents.

6.2.2 If part of the Contractor's Work depends for proper execution or results
upon construction or operations by the [Owner or a separate contractor] Owner's
own forces or other Contractors, the Contractor shall, prior to proceeding with
that portion of the Work, promptly report to the Owner, Development Manager and
Architect [apparent] discrepancies or defects in such other construction that
would render it unsuitable for such proper execution and results or would render
it incompatible with Contractor's Work. Failure of the Contractor so to report
shall constitute an acknowledgment that the Owner's [or separate contractors']
or other Contractors' completed or partially completed construction is fit and
proper to receive the Contractor's Work[, except as to defects not then
reasonably discoverable] and is fully compatible therewith.

6.2.3 [Costs] Subject to Paragraph 8.3 hereof, costs caused by delays or by
improperly timed activities or defective construction shall be borne by the
party responsible therefor.

6.2.4 The Contractor shall promptly remedy damage wrongfully caused by the
Contractor to completed or partially completed construction or to property of
the Owner or [separate contractors] other Contractors as provided in
Subparagraph 10.2.5 or to other completed or partially completed construction or
property on the site or to property of any adjoining owner or other party.

6.2.5 Claims and other disputes and matters in question between the Contractor
and a separate contractor shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph 4.3
provided the separate contractor has reciprocal obligations.

6.2.6 The Owner and each separate contractor shall have the same
responsibilities for cutting and patching as are described for the Contractor in
Paragraph 3.14.

6.3   OWNER'S RIGHT TO CLEAN UP

6.3.1 If a dispute arises among the Contractor[, separate contractors and the
Owner] and other Contractors as to their responsibility [under their respective
contracts for maintaining the premises and surrounding area free from waste
materials and rubbish as described in Paragraph 3.15, the Owner may clean up and
allocate the cost among those responsible as the Architect determines to be
just.] for cleaning up as required by Paragraph 3.15, assignment of this
clean-up will be determined by the Development Manager.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                               CHANGES IN THE WORK

7.1   CHANGES

7.1.1 Changes in the Work may be accomplished after execution of the Contract,
and without invalidating the Contract, only by Change Order, Construction Change
Directive or order for a minor change in the Work as provided in Paragraph 7.4,
subject to the limitations stated in this Article 7 and elsewhere in the
Contract Documents. When submitting a proposal for a Change Order or
Construction Change Directive, the Contractor shall include and set forth in
clear and precise detail breakdowns of labor and materials for all trades
involved and the estimated impact on the construction schedule. The Contractor
shall furnish spread sheets from which the breakdowns were prepared, plus spread
sheets, if requested, of any Subcontractors.

7.1.2 A Change Order shall be based upon agreement among the Owner, and
Contractor; a Construction Change

                                       14
<PAGE>   37

Directive requires agreement by the Owner, Development Manager and Architect and
may or may not be agreed to by the Contractor; an order for a minor change in
the Work may be issued by the Architect Development Manager alone.

7.1.3 Changes in the Work shall be performed under applicable provisions of the
Contract Documents, and the Contractor shall proceed promptly, unless otherwise
provided in the Change Order, Construction Change Directive or order for a minor
change in the Work.

7.1.4 If unit prices are stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed
upon, and if quantities originally contemplated are so changed in a proposed
Change Order or Construction Change Directive that application of such unit
prices to quantities of Work proposed will cause substantial inequity to the
Owner or Contractor, the applicable unit prices shall be equitably adjusted.

7.2   CHANGE ORDERS

7.2.1 A Change Order is a written instrument prepared by the [Architect]
Development Manager and signed by the Owner, Contractor, Development Manager and
Architect, stating their agreement upon all of the following for the item
covered in each Change Order as well as the cumulative effect and impact of all
previous Change Orders:

   .1    a change in the Work;

   .2    the amount of the adjustment in the Contract Sum, if any; and

   .3    the extent of the adjustment in the Contract Time, if any[.]; and

   .4    the portion of the cost thereof to be applied against the Contractor's
         Contingency or the Owner's Contingency.

7.2.2 Methods used in determining adjustments to the Contract Sum may include
those listed in Subparagraph 7.3.3.

7.3   CONSTRUCTION CHANGE DIRECTIVES

7.3.1 A Construction Change Directive is a written order [prepared by the
Architect] directed to the Contractor and signed by the Owner [and architect],
directing a change in the Work and stating a proposed basis for adjustment, if
any, in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, or both. The Owner may by
Construction Change Directive, without invalidating the Contract, order changes
in the Work within the general scope of the Contract consisting of additions,
deletions or other revisions, the Contract Sum and Contract Time being adjusted
accordingly.

7.3.2 A Construction Change Directive shall be used in the absence of total
agreement on the terms of a Change Order.

7.3.3 If the Construction Change Directive provides for an adjustment to the
Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be based on one of the following methods:

   .1   mutual acceptance of a lump sum properly itemized and supported by
        sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation;

   .2   unit prices stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed upon

   .3   cost to be determined in a manner agreed upon by the parties and a
        mutually acceptable fixed or percentage fee; or

   .4   as provided in Subparagraph 7.3.6.

7.3.4 Upon receipt of a Construction Change Directive, the Contractor shall
promptly proceed with the change in the Work involved and within five days of
receipt of same advise the [Architect] Development Manager and Owner of the
Contractor's agreement or disagreement with the method, if any, provided in the
Construction Change Directive for determining the proposed adjustment in the
Contract Sum or Contract Time.

7.3.5 A Construction Change Directive signed by the Contractor indicates the
agreement of the Contractor therewith, including adjustment in Contract Sum and
Contract Time or the method for determining them for the item covered in each
Change Directive as well as the cumulative effect and impact of all previous
Change Directives. Such agreement shall be effective immediately and shall be
recorded as a Change Order.

7.3.6 If the Contractor does not respond [promptly] within the five-day period
prescribed above, or disagrees with the method for adjustment in the Contract
Sum, the method and the adjustment shall be determined by the [Architect]
Development Manager on the basis of reasonable expenditures and savings of those
performing the Work attributable to the change, including, in case of an
increase in the Contract Sum, a reasonable allowance for overhead and profit as
provided in Paragraph 7.3.3. In such case, and also under Clause 7.3.3.3, the
Contractor shall keep and present, in such form as the [Architect] Development
Manager may prescribe, an itemized accounting together with appropriate
supporting data. Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, costs for
the purposes of this Subparagraph 7.3.6 shall be limited to the following:

   .1    costs of labor, including social security, old age and unemployment
         insurance, fringe benefits required by agreement or custom, and
         workers' or workmen's compensation insurance;

   .2    costs of materials, supplies and equipment, including cost of
         transportation, whether incorporated or consumed;

   .3    reasonable rental costs of machinery and equipment, exclusive of hand
         tools, obtained and used specifically for such Work, whether rented
         from the Contractor or others;

   .4    costs of premiums for all bonds (if any) and insurance, permit fees,
         and sales, use or similar taxes directly attributable to such Work
         [related to the Work]; and

   .5    additional costs of supervision and field office personnel directly
         attributable to the change.

7.3.7 Pending final determination of actual cost to the Owner, amounts not in
dispute may be included in Applications for Payment. The amount of credit to be
allowed by the Contractor to the Owner for a deletion or change which results in
a net decrease in the Contract Sum shall be actual net cost as confirmed by the
[Architect] Development Manager and Owner. When both additions and credits
covering related Work or substitutions are involved in a change, the allowance
for overhead and profit shall be figured on the basis of net increase, if any,
with respect to that change.

7.3.8 If the Owner and Contractor do not agree with the adjustment in Contract
Time or the method for determining it, the adjustment or the method shall be
[referred to the Architect for determination] determined in accordance with
Paragraph 8.3 hereof.

7.3.9 When the [Owner and Contractor agree with the determination made by the
Architect concerning the] adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract Time[, or
otherwise reach agreement upon the adjustments] are determined as provided
herein, such [agreement] determination shall be effective immediately and shall
be recorded by preparation and execution of an appropriate Change Order.

7.4   MINOR CHANGES IN THE WORK

7.4.1 The [Architect] Owner and Development Manager will each have authority to
order minor changes in the Work not involving adjustment in the Contract Sum or
extension of the Contract Time and not inconsistent with the intent of the

Contract Documents. Such changes shall be effected by written order and shall be
binding on the Owner and Contractor. The Contractor shall carry out such written
orders promptly.

7.5     ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL COSTS

7.5.1 Additional Costs caused by the following events shall not constitute a
Cost of the Work or entitle the Contractor to an increase in the Contract Sum or
extension of the Contract Time:

       .1     Any act or omission constituting a default or negligence by
              Contractor, Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors or their employees
              or agents.

       .2     The cost of repair of improper Work or Work damaged by Contractor,
              Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or their employees or agents.

       .3     Intentionally omitted.

       .4     Additional testing, inspections or approvals pursuant to Paragraph
              13.5.3.

       .5     Deposits lost because of Contractor's fault or negligence.

7.5.2 Additional costs caused by the following events shall constitute a Cost of
the Work and shall entitle Contractor to an increase in the Contract Sum and/or
an extension of the Contract Time without application against the Contingency:

     .1 Willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement by Owner.

     .2 Voluntary changes in the Work requested by Owner constituting changes in
        the Project not required by Law or reasonably necessary to cause the
        Project to operate as generally contemplated by the Plans and
        Specifications.

     .3 Changes in Subcontractors required by Owner without cause pursuant to
        Paragraph 5.2.4.

     .4 Suspensions, delays or interruptions pursuant to Paragraph 14.3 without
        cause or resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct or defaults
        of Architect or Development Manager.

     .5 Damage to the project caused by Owner due to move in.

     .6 Increases in the Contractor's cost of performance of any part of the
        Work to the extent such increase is the result of the negligence or
        willful misconduct or defaults of Architect or Development Manager.

     7. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including without
        limitation Paragraphs 1.2 or 3.2), errors, discrepancies, omissions or
        interfacing omissions in the Drawings and Specifications.

7.5.3 After execution of a Change Order, the change in the Contract Sum and
Contract Time, if any, shall be final and binding on both parties. Thereafter,
Contractor shall not be entitled to request any additional increase to the
Contract Sum as a result of such Change Order for direct, indirect, delay,
acceleration or other costs or extension of the Contract Time, whether caused as
a result of facts known prior to such determination or thereafter. In
determining any claim for an increase, the Contract Sum or extensions of the
contract Time as a result of delays, any and all "float time" (i.e., delay in
portions of the Work not directly causing a delay in Substantial Completion;
i.e., critical path) shall be owned by Owner. The Contractor shall use its best
efforts to rearrange the Work so as to minimize delays and minimize any valid
Cost of the Work increase or any valid Contract Time extensions. In any event,
no claim by Contractor for an increase in the Contract Sum whether by a claim
based on additional direct costs, delay costs, acceleration costs, unjust
enrichment, quantum merit or otherwise, or for an extension of the Contract
Time, shall be valid.

7.5.4 Failure of both parties to agree to any change to the Contract Sum,
Contract Time or other Contract term pursuant to a Change Directive shall be
treated as provided in Paragraph 4.4. However, nothing shall excuse the
Contractor from proceeding with performance of the Contract as changed by Change
Directive from Owner, provided Owner continues to pay Contractor in accordance
with the Contract Documents and Contractor shall use its best efforts to
rearrange the Work so as to avoid or minimize delays and additional costs
resulting from delays in final agreement on such disputed matters.

7.5.5 References in the Contract Documents to "the expense of Contractor",
"charged to Contractor", "Contractor shall bear the cost of" or the like shall
mean that the Contractor shall absorb the cost thereof which shall not
constitute a Cost of the Work, whether or not any Contractor's Contingency then
exists.

                                      TIME

8.1   DEFINITIONS

8.1.1 Unless otherwise provided, Contract Time is the period of time, including
authorized adjustments, allotted in the Contract Documents for Substantial
Completion of the Work.

8.1.2 The date of commencement of the Work is the date established in the
Agreement. The date shall not be postponed by the failure to act of the
Contractor or of persons or entities for whom the Contractor is responsible.

8.1.3 The date of Substantial Completion is the date certified by the Architect
and approved by the Owner in accordance with Paragraph 9.8.

8.1.4 The term "day" as used in the Contract Documents shall mean calendar day
unless otherwise specifically defined.

8.2   PROGRESS AND COMPLETION

8.2.1 Time limits stated in the Contract Documents are of the essence of the
Contract. By executing the Agreement the Contractor confirms that the Contract
Time is a reasonable period for performing the Work.

8.2.2 The Contractor shall not [knowingly], except by agreement or instruction
of the Owner in writing, prematurely commence operations on the site or
elsewhere prior to the effective date of insurance required by Article II to be
furnished by the Contractor. The date of commencement of the Work shall not be
changed by the effective date of such insurance. Unless the date of commencement
is established by a notice to proceed given by the Owner, the Contractor shall
notify the Owner in writing not less than five days or other agreed period
before commencing the Work to permit the timely filing of mortgages, mechanic's
liens and other security interests.

8.2.3 The Contractor shall proceed expeditiously with adequate forces and shall
achieve Substantial Completion within the Contract Time.

8.3   DELAYS AND EXTENSIONS OF TIME

8.3.1 Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 7.5, if [If] the Contractor is
delayed at any time in progress of the Work by an act or neglect of the Owner or
Architect, or of an employee of either, or of a separate contractor employed by
the Owner, or by changes ordered in the Work, or by [labor disputes, fire,
unusual delay in deliveries, unavoidable casualties or other causes beyond the
Contractor's control, or by delay authorized by the Owner pending arbitration,
or by other causes which the Architect determines may justify delay, then the
Contract Time shall be extended by Change Order for such reasonable time as the
Architect may determine] occurrences beyond the control and without the fault or
negligence of the Contractor

and which by the exercise of reasonable diligence the Contractor is unable to
prevent or provide against, including labor disputes (other than disputes
limited to the work force of, or provided by, the Contractor or its
Subcontractors), fire, unusual delay in deliveries not reasonably anticipatable,
unavoidable casualties, or by other occurrences which the Development Manager,
subject to the Owner's approval, determines may justify delay, then, provided
that the Contractor is in compliance with Subparagraph 4.3.3 hereof, the
Contract Time Shall be extended and the Contract Sum shall be increased by
Change Order or Construction Change Directive for the length of time actually
and directly caused by such occurrence as determined by the Development Manager
and approved by the Contractor and Owner (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned); provided, however, that such extension of
Contract Time shall be net of any delays caused by or due to the fault or
negligence of the Contractor or which are otherwise the responsibility of the
Contractor and shall also be net of any contingency of "float" time allowance
included in the Contractor's construction schedule. The Contractor shall, in the
event of any occurrence likely to cause a delay, cooperate in good faith with
the Development Manager and Owner to minimize and mitigate the impact of any
such occurrence and do all things reasonable under the circumstances to achieve
this goal.

8.3.2 Claims relating to time shall be made in accordance with applicable
provisions of Paragraphs 4.3 and Article 7. A copy of any claim for extension
shall be delivered to the Owner, and the Contractor shall immediately take all
steps reasonably possible to lessen the adverse impact of such delay.

8.3.3 This Paragraph 8.3 does not preclude recovery of damages for delay by
either party under other provisions of the Contract Documents; provided,
however, that Contractor's sole and exclusive remedy for delays of the type
described in Paragraph 8.3.1 shall be an extension of the Contract Time or an
increase in the Contract Sum as provided in this Article 8.

8.3.4 The Owner may seek recovery for actual damages suffered due to delays of
the Contractor; such actual damages will be considered to commence five (5) days
after each or all of the following: (1) scheduled Substantial Completion date
for any portion of the Work, (2) scheduled occupancy date for any portion of the
Work, (3) scheduled Substantial Completion date for the entire Work; and (4)
scheduled occupancy date for the entire Work. The dates referenced herein shall
be subject to adjustment as provided in the Contract Documents.

8.3.5 No change in the Work, whether by way of alteration or addition to the
Work, shall be the basis of an extension in the Contract Time unless and until
such alteration or addition has been authorized by a Change Order or Change
Directive executed and issued in accordance with and in strict compliance with
the requirements of the Contract Documents.

Any claim for increased cost for delay shall be asserted in accordance with the
provisions of Paragraph 4.3.3 unless the time is extended in writing by the
Owner. This requirement is of the essence of the Contract Documents.
Accordingly, no course of conduct or dealings between the parties, no express or
implied acceptance of alterations or additions to the Work, and no claim that
the Owner has been unjustly enriched by any alteration or addition to the Work,
whether or not there is in fact any such unjust enrichment, shall be the basis
for any claim to an increase in the Contract sum or an extension in the Contract
Time.

                             PAYMENTS AND COMPLETION

9.1   CONTRACT SUM

9.1.1 The Contract Sum is stated in the Agreement and, including authorized
adjustments, is the total amount payable by the Owner to the Contractor for
performance of the Work under the Contract Documents.

9.2   SCHEDULE OF VALUES

9.2.1 Before the first Application for Payment, the Contractor shall submit to
the Architect a schedule of values allocated to various portions of the Work,
prepared in such form and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as
the Architect may require. This schedule, unless objected to by the Architect,
shall be used as a basis for reviewing the Contractor's Applications for
Payment.

9.3   APPLICATIONS FOR PAYMENT

9.3.1 At least ten days before the date established by the lender(s) for the
Project for each progress payment, the Contractor shall submit to the Architect
Development Manager an itemized Application for Payment for operations completed
in accordance with the schedule of values. Such application shall be notarized,
if required, and supported by such data substantiating the Contractor's right to
payment as the Owner or Architect Development Manager may require, such as
copies of requisitions from Subcontractors and material suppliers, and
reflecting retainage if provided for elsewhere in the Contract Documents.

9.3.1.1 Such applications may include requests for payment on account of changes
in the Work which have been properly authorized by Construction Change
Directives but not yet included in Change Orders.

9.3.1.2 Such applications may not include requests for payment of amounts the
Contractor does not intend to pay to a Subcontractor or material supplier
because of a dispute or other reason.

9.3.1.3 Such Application for Payment shall be accompanied by waivers of lien and
other documentation from subcontractors as may be reasonably required by the
Owner, any lender and title insurer to establish the absence of any claims for
mechanics or other statutory liens.

9.3.1.4 Copies of all Applications for Payment shall be submitted to the Owner
and, upon the Owner's request, directly to the lender(s) for the Project.

9.3.2 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, payments shall be
made on account of materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the
site for subsequent incorporation in the Work. If approved in advance by the
Owner, payment may similarly be made for materials and equipment suitably stored
off the site at a location agreed upon in writing. Payment for materials and
equipment stored on or off the site shall be conditioned upon compliance by the
Contractor with procedures satisfactory to the Owner to establish the Owner's
title to such materials and equipment or otherwise protect the Owner's interest,
and shall include applicable insurance, storage and transportation to the site
fur such materials and equipment stored off the site.

9.3.3 The Contractor warrants that title to all Work covered by an Application
for Payment will pass to the Owner no later than the time of payment. The
Contractor further warrants that upon submittal of an Application for Payment
all Work for which Certificates for Payment have been previously issued and
payments received from the Owner shall, to the best of the Contractor's
knowledge, information and belief, be free and clear of liens, claims, security
interests or encumbrances in favor of the Contractor, Subcontractors, material
suppliers, or other persons or entities making a claim by reason of having
provided labor, materials and equipment relating to the Work.

9.4   CERTIFICATES FOR PAYMENT

9.4.1 [The Architect will, within seven days after receipt of the Contractor's
Application for Payment, either issue to the Owner a Certificate for Payment,
with a copy to the Contractor, for such amount as the Architect determines is
properly due, or notify the Contractor and Owner in writing of the Architect's
reasons for withholding certification in whole or in part as provided in
Subparagraph 9.5.1.] The Development Manager will assemble a Project Application
for Payment by combining the Contractor's applications with

                                       17
<PAGE>   40

similar applications for progress payments from other Contractors and, after
certifying the amounts due on such applications, forward them to the Architect
within seven days.

9.4.1.1 Within seven days after the Architect's receipt of the Project
Application for Payment, the Development Manager and Architect will either issue
to the Owner a Project Certificate for Payment, with a copy to the Contractor,
for such amount as the Development Manager and Architect determine is properly
due, or notify the Contractor and Owner in writing of the Development Manager's
and Architect's reasons for withholding certification in whole or in part as
provided in Subparagraph 9.5.1. Such notification will be forwarded to the
Contractor by the Development Manager.

9.4.2 The issuance of a separate Certificate for Payment or a Project
Certificate for Payment will constitute a representations made separately by the
Development Manager and Architect to the Owner, based on their Architect's
individual observations at the site and the data comprising the Application for
Payment submitted by the Contractor, that the Work has progressed to the point
indicated and that, to the best of the Development Manager's and Architect's
knowledge, information and belief, quality of the Work is in accordance with the
Contract Documents. The foregoing representations are subject to an evaluation
of the Work for conformance with the Contract Documents upon Substantial
Completion, to results of subsequent tests and inspections, to minor deviations
from the Contract Documents correctable prior to completion and to specific
qualifications expressed by the Development Manager or Architect. The issuance
of a separate Certificate for Payment or a Project Certificate for Payment will
further constitute a representation that the Contractor is entitled to payment
in the amount certified. However, the issuance of a separate Certificate for
Payment or a Project Certificate for Payment will not be a representation that
the Development Manager or Architect has (1) made exhaustive or continuous
on-site inspections to check the quality or quantity of the Work, (2) reviewed
construction means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures, (3) reviewed
copies of requisitions received from Subcontractors and material suppliers and
other data requested by the Owner to substantiate the Contractor's right to
payment or (4) made examination to ascertain how or for what purpose the
Contractor has used money previously paid on account of the Contract Sum.

9.5   DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD CERTIFICATION

9.5.1 The Development Manager and Architect may decide not to certify payment
and may withhold a Certificate for Payment in whole or in part, to the extent
reasonably necessary to protect the Owner, if in the Development Manager's or
Architect's opinion the representations to the Owner required by Subparagraph
9.4.2 cannot be made. If the Architect is unable to certify payment in the
amount of the Application, the Architect will notify the Contractor and Owner as
provided in Subparagraph 9.4.1. If the Development Manager or Architect is
unable to certify payment in the amount of the Application, the Development
Manager or Architect will notify the Contractor and Owner as provided in
Subparagraph 9.4.1.1. If the Contractor, Development Manager and Architect
cannot agree on a revised amount, the Development Manager and Architect will
promptly issue a Certificate for Payment for the amount for which the
Development Manager and Architect is are able to make such representations to
the Owner. The Development Manager or Architect may also decide not to certify
payment or, because of subsequently discovered evidence or subsequent
observations, may nullify the whole or a part of a Certificate for Payment
previously issued, to such extent as may be necessary in the Development
Manager's or Architect's opinion to protect the Owner from loss because of:

       .1     defective Work not remedied;

       .2     third party claims filed or reasonable evidence indicating
              probable filing of such claims:

       .3     failure of the Contractor to make payments properly to
              Subcontractors or for labor, materials equipment.

       .4     reasonable evidence that the Work cannot be completed for the
              unpaid balance of the Contract Sum,

       .5     damage to the Owner or another contractor,

       .6     reasonable evidence that the Work will not be completed within the
              Contract Time, and that the unpaid balance would not be adequate
              to cover actual or liquidated damages for the anticipated delay:
              or

       .7     persistent failure to carry, out the Work in accordance with the
              Contract Documents.

9.5.2 When the above reasons for withholding certification are removed,
certification will be made for amounts previously withheld.

9.5.3 If Contractor disputes any determination by the Development Manager or
Architect with regard to any Certificate of Payment, Contractor shall
nevertheless expeditiously continue to prosecute the Work.

9.5.4 The Owner may independently dispute payment in whole or part, whether or
not a Certificate for Payment has been issued regarding the same, and in such
event shall promptly notify the Development Manager, Architect and Contractor in
writing of the dispute and the reason or reasons therefor. The Owner shall not
be deemed to be in breach of this Contract by reason of the withholding of any
payment pursuant to any provision of the Contract Documents, provided the
Development Manager or Architect has approved the Owner's action, or the Work in
question shall have been rejected by any governmental authority, the Owner or
any lender of the Owner.

9.6   PROGRESS PAYMENTS

9.6.1 After the Development Manager and Architect has have issued a Project
Certificate for Payment or a separate Certificate for Payment, the Owner shall
make payment in the manner and within the time provided in the Contract
Documents, [and shall so notify the Architect] subject to Subparagraph 9.6.4.

9.6.1.1 The Owner shall have the option, but not the obligation, to issue joint
checks to the Contractor and various Subcontractors at the Owner's discretion
with respect to all or any part of the payments discussed in this Article. Any
payment in joint check form or the lack thereof shall not constitute a waiver of
the same as to later payments.

9.6.2 The Contractor shall promptly pay each Subcontractor, upon receipt of
payment from the Owner, out of the amount paid to the Contractor on account of
such Subcontractor's portion of the Work, the amount to which said Subcontractor
is entitled, reflecting percentages actually retained from payments to the
Contractor on account of such Subcontractor's portion of the Work. The
Contractor shall, by appropriate agreement with each Subcontractor, require each
Subcontractor to make payments to Sub-subcontractors in similar manner.

9.6.3 The Architect Development Manager will, on request, furnish to a
Subcontractor, if practicable, information regarding percentages of completion
or amounts applied for by the Contractor and action taken thereon by the
Development Manager, Architect and Owner on account of portions of the Work done
by such Subcontractor.

9.6.4 Neither the Owner, Development Manager nor Architect shall have an
obligation to pay or to see to the payment of money to a Subcontractor except as
may otherwise be required by law.

                                       18
<PAGE>   41

9.6.5 Payment to material suppliers shall be treated in a manner similar to that
provided in Subparagraphs 9.6.2, 9.6.3 and 9.6.4.

9.6.6 A Certificate for Payment, a progress payment, or partial or entire use or
occupancy of the Project by the Owner shall not constitute acceptance of Work
not in accordance with the Contract Documents.

9.7   FAILURE OF PAYMENT

9.7.1 If, through no fault of the Contractor, (1) the Architect does not issue a
Project Certificate for Payment, [through no fault of the Contractor,] within
seven days after receipt of the Development Manager's receipt of the
Contractor's Application for Payment, or (2) if the Owner does not pay the
Contractor within seven days after the date established in the Contract
Documents the amount certified by the Development Manager and Architect or
awarded by arbitration or reference, then the Contractor may, upon seven
additional days' written notice to the Owner, Development Manager and Architect,
stop the Work until payment of the amount owing has been received. The Contract
Time shall be extended appropriately and the Contract Sum shall be increased by
the amount of the Contractor's reasonable costs of shut-down, delay and
start-up, which shall be accomplished as provided in Article 7. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Contractor may not stop the Work during the pendency of a
bona fide dispute between Owner and Contractor provided any sums in dispute
claimed by the Contractor are placed in escrow.

9.8   SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

9.8.1 Substantial Completion is the stage in the progress of the Work when the
Work or designated portion thereof is sufficiently complete in accordance with
the Contract Documents so the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work for its
intended use.

9.8.2 When the Contractor considers that the Work, or a portion thereof which
the Owner agrees to accept separately, is substantially complete, the Contractor
and Development Manager shall jointly prepare and submit to the Architect and
Owner a comprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected. The Contractor
shall proceed promptly, to complete and correct items on the list. Failure to
include an item on such list does not alter the responsibility of the Contractor
to complete all Work in accordance with the Contract Documents. Upon receipt of
the Contractor's list, the Architect and Owner, assisted by the Development
Manager, will make an inspection to determine whether the Work or designated
portion thereof is substantially complete. If the Architect's inspection
discloses any item, whether or not included on the Contractor's list, which is
not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the
Contractor shall, before issuance of the Certificate of Substantial Completion,
complete or correct such item upon notification by the Architect. The Contractor
shall then submit a request for another inspection by the Architect and Owner,
assisted by the Development Manager, to determine Substantial Completion. When
the Work or designated portion thereof is substantially complete, the Architect
will prepare a Certificate of Substantial Completion which shall establish
assist in the determination of the date of Substantial Completion, shall
establish responsibilities of the Owner and Contractor for security,
maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and insurance, and shall fix
the time within which the Contractor shall finish all items on the list
accompanying the Certificate. Warranties required by the Contract Documents
shall commence on the date of Substantial Completion of the Work or designated
portion thereof unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Substantial
Completion. The Certificate of Substantial Completion shall be submitted to the
Owner and Contractor for their written acceptance of responsibilities assigned
to them in such Certificate.

9.8.2.1 Upon receipt of the Contractor's list of items to be completed or
corrected, the Development Manager and Architect will promptly make a thorough
review and prepare a "punch list," setting forth in accurate detail any items on
the Contractor's list and additional items that are not acceptable.

9.8.2.2 When the "punch list" has been prepared, the Development Manager and
Architect, if requested, will meet with the Contractor and any Subcontractor to
identify and explain all "punch list" items and answer questions on the work
which must be done before final acceptance.

9.8.2.3 If the Contractor gives notice that a major subcontractor has completed
his "punch list" items, the Development Manager and Architect will review that
portion of the work and, if the items are found to be satisfactorily completed,
advise the Contractor accordingly.

9.8.3 Upon Substantial Completion of the Work or designated portion thereof and
upon application by the Contractor, and certification by the Development Manager
and Architect, and acceptance by the Owner, all lenders for the Project and
applicable governmental authorities, the Owner shall make payment, reflecting
adjustment in retainage, if any, for such Work or portion thereof as provided in
the Contract Documents.

9.9   PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OR USE

9.9.1 The Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially completed portion
of the Work at any stage when such portion is designated by separate agreement
with the Contractor, provided such occupancy or use is consented to by the
insurer as required under Subparagraph 11.3.11 and authorized by public
authorities having jurisdiction over the Work. Such partial occupancy or use may
commence whether or not the portion is substantially complete, provided the
Owner and Contractor have accepted in writing the responsibilities assigned to
each of them fur payments, retainage if any, security. maintenance, heat,
utilities, damage to the Work and insurance, and have agreed in writing
concerning the period for correction of the Work and commencement of warranties
required by the Contract Documents. When the Contractor considers a portion
substantially complete, the Contractor and Development Manager shall jointly
prepare and submit a list to the Architect as provided under Subparagraph 9.8.2.
Consent of the Contractor to partial occupancy or use shall out be unreasonably
withheld. The stage of the progress of the Work shall be determined by written
agreement between the Owner and Contractor or, if an agreement is reached, by
decision of the Architect after consultation with the Development Manager.

9.9.2 Immediately prior to such partial occupancy or use, the Owner, Development
Manager, Contractor and Architect shall jointly inspect the area be occupied or
portion of the Work to be used in order determine and record the condition of
the Work.

9.9.3 Unless otherwise agreed upon, partial occupancy or use of a portion or
portions of the work shall not constitute acceptance of Work not complying with
the requirements of the Contract Documents.

9.10  FINAL COMPLETION AND FINAL PAYMENT

9.10.1 Upon completion of the Work, the Contractor shall forward to the
Development Manager and Owner a written notice that the Work is ready for final
inspection and acceptance and a final Contractor's Application for Payment. Upon
[receipt of written notice that the Work is ready for final inspection and
acceptance and upon receipt of a final Application for Payment,] the Development
Manager will forward the notice and Application for Payment to the Architect,
who will promptly make such inspection. [and, when]When the Architect, based on
the recommendation of the Development Manager, finds the Work acceptable under
the Contract Documents and the Contract fully performed, the Architect will
promptly issue a final Certificate for Payment stating that to the best of the
Architect's knowledge, information and belief, and on the basis of the
Architect's observations and inspections, the Work has been completed in
accordance with terms and conditions of the Contract 

Language indicated as being shown by strike out in the typeset document is

Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the Contractor and noted
in said final Certificate is due and payable. The Architect's final Certificate
for Payment will constitute a further representation that conditions listed in
Subparagraph 9.10.2 as precedent to the Contractor's being entitled to final
payment have been fulfilled. The Owner shall approve or disapprove the final
Certificate for Payment, stating whether the same is correct and accurate and,
if the Owner disapproves the final Certificate for Payment, stating the reasons
therefor.

9.10.2 Neither final payment nor any remaining retained percentage shall become
due until the Contractor submits to the Architect through the Development
Manager (1) an affidavit that payrolls, bills for materials and equipment, and
other indebtedness connected with the Work for which the Owner or the Owner's
property might be responsible or encumbered (less amounts withheld by Owner)
have been paid or otherwise satisfied, (2) a certificate evidencing that
insurance required by the Contract Documents to remain in force after final
payment is currently in effect and will not be canceled or allowed to expire
until at least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the Owner, (3) a
written statement that the Contractor knows of no substantial reason that the
insurance will not be renewable to cover the period required by the Contract
Documents, (4) consent of surety, if any, to final payment and (5), if required
by the Owner, other data establishing payment or satisfaction of obligations,
such as receipts, releases and waivers of liens, claims, security interests or
encumbrances arising out of the Contract, to the extent and in such form as may
be designated by the Owner. If a Subcontractor refuses to furnish a release or
waiver required by the Owner, the Contractor may furnish a bond satisfactory to
the Owner to indemnify the Owner against such lien. If such lien remains
unsatisfied after payments are made, the Contractor shall refund to the Owner
all money that the Owner may be compelled to pay in discharging such lien,
including all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.

9.10.2.1 A reasonable sum may be withheld until the Contractor delivers to the
Owner record drawings and other items required pursuant to Subparagraph 3.11.2,
and the warranties, instructions and maintenance manuals required to be
furnished pursuant to Subparagraphs 3.5 and 3.12.9.2, and a final statement of
the cost of the Work allocated in accordance with the budget and in a form which
has been approved by the lender(s) for the Project has been furnished. All
submittals required to be made to Architect or Development Manager hereunder
shall concurrently be made to Owner.

9.10.3 If, after Substantial Completion of the Work, Final Completion thereof is
materially delayed through no fault of the Contractor or by issuance of Change
Orders affecting Final Completion, and the Development Manager and Architect so
confirms, the Owner shall, upon application by the Contractor and certification
by the Development Manager and Architect, and without terminating the Contract,
make payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and
accepted. If the remaining balance for Work Out fully completed or corrected is
less than retainage stipulated in the Contract Documents, and if bonds have been
furnished, the written consent of surety to payment of the balance due for that
portion of the Work fully completed and accepted shall be submitted by the
Contractor to the Architect through the Development Manager prior to
certification of such payment. Such payment shall be made under terms and
conditions concerning final payment, except that it shall not constitute a
waiver of claims. The making of final payment shall constitute a waiver of
claims by the Owner as provided in Subparagraph 4.3.5.

9.10.4 Acceptance of final payment by the Contractor, a Subcontractor or
material supplier shall constitute a waiver claims by that payee except those
previously made in writing and identified by that payee as unsettled at the time
of final Application for Payment. Such waivers shall be in addition to the
waiver described in Subparagraph 4.3.5.

10.1  SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND PROGRAMS

10.1.1 The Contractor shall be responsible for initiating, maintaining and
supervising all safety precautions and programs in connection with the
performance of the Contract. The Contractor shall submit the Contractor's safety

been rendered harmless, provided that such claim, damage, loss or expense is
attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury to or
destruction of tangible property (other than the Work itself) including loss of
use resulting therefrom, but only to the extent caused in whole or in part by
negligent acts or omissions of the Owner, anyone directly or indirectly employed
by the Owner or anyone for whose acts the Owner may be liable, regardless of
whether or not such claim, damage, loss or expense is caused in part by a party

other perils shall not be required unless otherwise provided in the Contract

deductibles are identified in the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall pay

Owner's property due to fire or other hazards, however caused. [The Owner waives
all rights of action against the Contractor for loss of use of the Owner's
property including consequential losses due to fire or other hazards however
caused.] To the extent that the Owner actually receives insurance proceeds to
cover such losses, and only to the extent permitted by the Owner's insurer,
Owner shall waive any rights of action it may have against Contractor for loss
of use of the Owner's property, including consequential losses due to fire or
other hazard however caused. In addition, Owner acknowledges that it shall not
have a right of action against Contractor for loss of use of the Owner's
property unless such loss was caused by Contractor, its Subcontractors,
Sub-subcontractors, or other persons for whom Contractor is responsible.

11.3.4 If the Contractor requests in writing that insurance for risks other than
those described herein or for other special hazards be included in the property

cost thereof shall be charged to the Contractor by appropriate Change Order.

real or personal or both, adjoining or adjacent to the site by property
insurance under policies separate from those insuring the Project, or if after
final payment property insurance is to be provided on the completed Project
through a policy or policies other than those insuring the Project during the
construction period, the Owner shall waive all rights in accordance with the
terms of Subparagraph 11.3.7 for damages caused by fire or other perils covered
by this separate property insurance. All separate policies shall provide this
waiver of subrogation by endorsement or otherwise.

allowed to expire until at least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to
the Contractor.

[(1) each other and any of their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and
employees, each of the other, and (2) the Architect, Architect's consultants,
separate contractors] each other and against the Development Manager, Architect,
Owner's other Contractors and own forces described in Article 6, if any, and any
of their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees, for damages
caused by fire or other perils to the extent covered by property insurance
obtained pursuant to this Paragraph 11.3 or other property insurance applicable
to the Work, except such rights as they have to proceeds of such insurance held
by the Owner as fiduciary. [The Owner or Contractor, as appropriate, shall
require of the Architect, Architect's consultants, separate contractors
described in Article 6, if any, and the subcontractors, sub-subcontractors,
agents and employees of any of them, by appropriate agreements, written where
legally required for validity, similar waivers each in favor of other parties
enumerated herein.] The policies shall provide such waivers of subrogation by
endorsement or otherwise to the extent such waiver is permitted by Owner's and
Contractor's insurers and does not prejudice the insurance required to be
carried by the Owner and Contractor under this Agreement. A waiver of
subrogation shall be effective as to a person or entity even though that person
or entity would otherwise have a duty of indemnification, contractual or
otherwise, did not pay the insurance premium directly or indirectly, and whether
or not the person or entity had an insurable interest in the property damaged.

11.3.8 A loss insured under Owner's property insurance shall be adjusted by the
Owner as fiduciary and made payable to the Owner as fiduciary for the insureds,
as their interests may appear, subject to requirements of any applicable
mortgagee clause and of Subparagraph 11.3.10. The Contractor shall pay
Subcontractors their just shares of insurance proceeds received by the
Contractor, and by appropriate agreements, written where legally required for
validity, shall require Subcontractors to make payments to their
Sub-subcontractors in similar manner.

11.3.9 If required in writing by a party in interest, the Owner as fiduciary
shall, upon occurrence of an insured loss, give bond for proper performance of
the Owner's duties. The cost of required bonds shall be charged against proceeds
received as fiduciary. The Owner shall deposit in a separate account proceeds so
received, which the Owner shall distribute in accordance with such agreement as
the parties in interest may teach, or in accordance with an arbitration award in
which case the procedure shall be as provided in Paragraph 4.5. If after such
loss no other special agreement is made, replacement of damaged property shall
be coveted by appropriate Change Order.

11.3.10 The Owner as fiduciary shall have power to adjust and settle a loss with
insurers unless one of the parties in interest shall object in writing within
five days after occurrence of loss to the Owner's exercise of this power; if
such objection be made, arbitrators shall be chosen as provided in Paragraph
4.5. The Owner as fiduciary shall, in that case, make settlement with insurers
in accordance with directions of such arbitrators. If distribution of insurance
proceeds by arbitration is required, the arbitrators will direct such
distribution.

have consented to such partial occupancy or use by endorsement or otherwise. The

suppliers to release, Owner, Owner's partners, parent companies, affiliates,
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Development Manager,

                        UNCOVERING AND CORRECTION OF WORK

12.1  UNCOVERING OF WORK

12.1.1 If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to the Owner's, Development
Manager's or Architect's request or to requirements specifically expressed in

Architect], be uncovered for [the Architect's] their observation and be replaced
at the Contractor's expense without change in the Contract Time or Contract Sum.

12.1.2 If a portion of the Work has been covered which the Owner, Development
Manager or Architect has not specifically requested to observe prior to its
being covered, the Owner, Development Manager or Architect may request to see
such Work and it shall be uncovered by the Contractor. If such Work is in
accordance with the Contract Documents, costs of uncovering and replacement
shall, by appropriate Change Order, be charged to the Owner. If such Work is not
in accordance with the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall pay such costs
unless the condition was caused by the Owner [or a separate contractor] one of
the other Contractors in which event the Owner shall be responsible for payment
of such costs.

12.2  CORRECTION OF WORK

12.2.1 The Contractor shall promptly correct Work rejected by the Owner,
Development Manager or Architect or failing to conform to the requirements of
the Contract Documents, whether observed before or after Substantial Completion

inspections and compensation for the Architect's services and expenses made

acceptance of the Work, to inspect and reject work and materials which in the
Owner's judgment are not in conformity with the Contract Documents.

12.2.2 If, within one year after the date of Substantial Completion of the Work
of designated portion thereof, or after the date for commencement of warranties

warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the Work is found to be not
in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Contractor
shall correct it promptly after receipt of written notice from the Owner to do
so unless the Owner has previously given the Contractor a written acceptance of
such condition. This period of one year shall be extended with respect to
portions of Work first performed after Substantial Completion by the period of
time between Substantial Completion and the actual performance of the Work. This
obligation under this Subparagraph 12.2.2 shall survive acceptance of the Work
under the Contract and termination of the Contract. The Owner shall give such
notice promptly after discovery of the condition.

Contractor does not proceed with correction of such nonconforming Work within a
reasonable time fixed by written notice from the Owner [Architect], the Owner
may remove it and store the salvable materials or equipment at the Contractor's
expense. If the Contractor does not pay costs of such removal and storage within
ten days after written notice, the Owner may upon ten additional days' written
notice sell such materials and equipment at auction or at private sale and shall
account for the proceeds thereof, after deducting costs and damages that should
have been borne by the Contractor, including compensation for the Development
Manager's and Architect's services and expenses made necessary thereby. If such
proceeds of sale do not cover costs which the Contractor should have borne, the
Contract Sum shall be reduced by the deficiency. If payments then or thereafter
due the Contractor are not sufficient to cover such amount, the Contractor shall
pay the difference to the Owner.

12.2.5 The Contractor shall beat the cost of correcting destroyed or damaged
construction, whether completed or partially completed, of the Owner or
[separate contractors] or other Contractors caused by the Contractor's
correction or removal of Work which is not in accordance with the requirements
of the Contract Documents.

12.2.6 Nothing contained in this Paragraph 12.2 shall be construed to establish
a period of limitation with respect to other obligations which the Contractor
might have under the Contract Documents. Establishment of the time period of one
year as described in Subparagraph 12.2.2 relates only to the specific obligation
of the Contractor to correct the Work, and has no relationship to the time
within which the obligation to comply with the Contract Documents may be sought
to be enforced, nor to the time within which proceedings may be commenced to
establish the Contractor's liability with respect to the Contractor's
obligations other than specifically to correct the Work.

12.3  ACCEPTANCE OF NONCONFORMING WORK

12.3.1 If the Owner prefers to accept Work which is not in accordance with the
requirements of the Contract Documents, the Owner may do so instead of requiring
its removal and correction, in which case the Contract Sum will be reduced as
appropriate and equitable. Such adjustment shall be effected whether or not
final payment has been made.

                                   ARTICLE 14

                    TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE CONTRACT

4.1   TERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTOR

14.1.1 The Contractor may terminate the Contract if the Work is stopped for a
period of 30 days through no act or fault of the Contractor or a Subcontractor,
Sub-subcontractor or their agents or employees or any other persons performing
portions of the Work under contract with the Contractor, for any of the
following reasons:

     .1   issuance of an order of a court or other public authority having
          jurisdiction;

     .2   an act of government, such as a declaration of national emergency,
          making material unavailable;

     .3   because the Development Manager or Architect has not issued a
          Certificate for Payment and has not notified the Contractor of the
          reason for withholding certification as provided in Subparagraph
          9.4.1, or because the Owner has not made payment on a Certificate for
          Payment within the time stated in the Contract Documents;

     .4   if repeated suspensions, delays or interruptions by the Owner as
          described in Paragraph 14.3 constitute in the aggregate more than 100
          percent of the total number of days scheduled for completion, or 120
          days in any 365-day period, whichever is less; or

     .5   the Owner has failed to furnish to the Contractor promptly, upon the
          Contractor's request, reasonable evidence as required by Subparagraph
          2.2.1.

14.1.2 If one of the above reasons exists, the Contractor may, upon seven
additional days' written notice to the Owner, Development Manager and Architect,
terminate the Contract and recover from the Owner payment for Work executed and
for proven loss with respect to materials, equipment, tools, and construction
equipment and machinery, including reasonable overhead, profit and damages.

14.1.3 If the Work is stopped for a period of 60 days through no act or fault of
the Contractor or a Subcontractor or their agents or employees or any other
persons performing portions the Work under contract with the Contractor because
the Owner has persistently failed to fulfill the Owner's obligations under the
Contract Documents with respect to matters important to the progress of the
Work, the Contractor may, upon seven additional days' written notice to the
Owner, Development Manager and the Architect, terminate the Contract and recover
from the Owner as provided in Subparagraph 14.1.2.

14.2  TERMINATION BY THE OWNER [FOR CAUSE]

14.2.1  The Owner may terminate the Contract if the Contractor:

     .1   [persistently or repeatedly] refuses or fails to supply enough 
          properly skilled workers or proper materials;

     .2   fails to make payment to Subcontractors for materials or labor in
          accordance with the respective agreements between the Contractor and
          the Subcontractors;

     .3   [persistently] disregards laws, ordinances, or rules, regulations or
          orders of a public authority having jurisdiction; or

     .4   otherwise is guilty of substantial breach of a provision the Contract
          Documents.

Termination for any of the above reasons shall be referred to in this Agreement
as "Termination for Cause."

14.2.2 When any of the above reasons exist, the Owner, [upon certification by 
the Architect that sufficient cause exists to justify such action,] may without
prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the Owner and after giving the
Contractor and the Contractor's surety, if any, seven days' written notice,
terminate employment of the Contractor and may, subject to any prior rights of
the surety:

     .1   take possession of the site and of all materials, equipment, tools,
          and construction equipment and machinery thereon owned by the
          Contractor;

     .2   accept assignment of subcontracts pursuant to Paragraph 5.4; and

     .3   finish the Work by whatever reasonable method the Owner may deem
          expedient.

14.2.3 [When the Owner terminates the Contract for one of the reasons stated in
Subparagraph 14.2.1] Upon a Termination for Cause, the Contractor shall not be
entitled to receive further payment until the Work is finished.

14.2.4 Once the Work is finished, [If] if the unpaid balance of the Contract Sum
[exceeds] exceeded the costs of finishing the Work, including compensation for 
the Development Manager's and Architects services and expenses made necessary
thereby, such excess shall be paid to the Contractor. If such costs exceed the
unpaid balance, the Contractor shall pay the difference to the Owner. The amount
to he paid to the Contractor or Owner, as the case may be, shall, upon
application, be certified by the Architect after consultation with the
Development Manager[, upon application], and this obligation for payment shall
survive termination of the Contract.

14.2.5 The Owner may, at its option, terminate this Contract in whole or in part
from time to time at any time by seven days' written notice thereof to the
Contractor and Contractor's surety, if any ("Termination for Convenience"). Upon
a Termination for Convenience, Contractor agrees to waive any claims for
damages, including loss of anticipated profits, on account thereof, and as the
sole right and remedy of Contractor, Owner shall pay Contractor in accordance
with Subparagraph 14.2.3(c) below. The provisions of the Contract, which by
their nature survive final acceptance of the Work, shall remain in full force
and effect after such Termination for Convenience to the extent provided in such
provisions.

      (a)   Upon receipt of a notice instituting a Termination for Cause or a
            Termination for Convenience, Contractor shall, unless the notice
            directs otherwise, immediately discontinue the Work on that date and
            to the extent specified in the notice, place no further orders or
            subcontracts for materials, equipment, services or facilities,
            except as may be necessary for completion of such portion of the
            Work as is not discontinued, promptly make every reasonable effort
            to procure cancellation upon terms satisfactory to Owner of all
            orders and subcontracts to the extent they relate to the performance
            of the discontinued portion of the Work, and thereafter do only such
            Work as may be necessary to preserve and protect work already in
            progress and to protect materials, plants and equipment on the Site
            or in transit thereto.

<PAGE>   49

      (b)   Upon a Termination for Convenience or a Termination for Cause, the
            obligations of the Contract shall continue as to portions of the
            Work already performed and as to bona fide obligations assumed by
            Contractor prior to the date of termination.

      (c)   Upon a Termination for Convenience, Contractor shall be entitled to
            be paid the full cost of all Work properly done by Contractor to the
            date of termination not previously paid for, less sums already
            received by Contractor on account of the portion of the Work
            performed. If at the date of such termination Contractor has
            properly prepared or fabricated off the Site any goods for
            subsequent incorporation in the Work, and if Contractor delivers
            such goods to the Site or to such other place as the Owner shall
            reasonably direct, then Contractor shall be paid for such goods or
            materials.

14.2.6 Upon a Termination for Convenience, the Owner may without prejudice to
any other rights or remedies of the Owner and subject to any prior rights of the
surety:

        .1    take possession of the site and of all materials, equipment,
              tools, and construction equipment and machinery thereon owned by
              the Owner or rented on its behalf by Contractor;

        .2    accept assignment of subcontracts pursuant to Paragraph 5.4 if but
              only if Owner pays Contractor, in addition to any other sums owing
              hereunder, a fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of the difference
              between (x) the Contractor's Fee calculated as if the Cost of the
              Work were equal to the Guaranteed Maximum Price at the time of
              termination (or, if the Guaranteed Maximum Price has not yet been
              established, the Preliminary Guaranteed Maximum Price established
              in the Agreement), and (y) the Contractor's Fee paid or owing to
              Contractor as a result of the actual Cost of the Work completed
              prior to termination; provided, however, that upon Final
              Completion, the value for (x) will be recalculated based on the
              actual Cost of the Work rather than the Guaranteed Maximum Price
              or estimate thereof, and Contractor will refund to Owner the
              difference between the fee paid by Owner based on the initial
              calculation and the amount owed based on such recalculation.

        .3    finish the Work by whatever reasonable method the Owner may
              deem expedient.

14.3  SUSPENSION BY THE OWNER FOR CONVENIENCE

14.3.1 The Owner may, without cause, order the Contractor in writing to suspend,
delay or interrupt the Work in whole or in part for such period of time as the
Owner may determine.

14.3.2 An ad99justment shall be made for increases in the cost of performance of
the Contract, including profit on the increased cost of performance, caused by
suspension, delay or interruption. No adjustment shall be made to the extent:

        .1    that performance is, was or would have been so suspended, delayed
              or interrupted by another cause for which the Contractor is
              responsible; or

        .2    that an equitable adjustment is made or denied under another
              provision of this Contract.

14.3.3 Adjustments made in the cost of performance may have a mutually agreed
fixed or percentage fee.

intended to inure solely to the benefit of Symantec, and, not withstanding
anything herein to the contrary, such assumption is not intended and shall not
be construed to give any third parties any greater or additional benefits than
they would have but for HP's assumption.

         Section 2.5  Liabilities and Obligations Not Assumed.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in Section 2.4
above or as set forth below in this Section 2.5, HP shall not assume or have
any responsibility for any liability, obligation or commitment of any nature of
Symantec, whether now or hereafter existing, and Symantec covenants that it
shall retain all such liabilities, obligations or commitments, including
without limitation:

                 (a)      Any liabilities, obligations, commitments made by
         Symantec to any customer, including without limitation for service,
         support or maintenance of any kind;

                 (b)      Any liabilities for any Taxes, including without
         limitation Transfer Taxes, of any kind relating to or attributable to
         any previous period (or any portion of any period) ending on or prior
         to the Closing Date levied or imposed upon the Assets, or in
         connection with this Agreement





                                       7

         or the transactions contemplated hereby; and

                 (c)      Except as set forth in Section 7.5 below or in the
         offer letters from HP referred to therein any liabilities, obligations
         or commitments of Symantec to New HP Regular Personnel incurred or
         made in connection with the Business.

         Section 2.6      Consideration.  The consideration for the transfer of
the Assets shall be a stream of cash payments not to exceed an aggregate of
$30,000,000 net present value as follows (collectively, the "Purchase Price"):

                 (a)      $2,000,000 payable at closing as reimbursement of
         Symantec's development expenses on "Big Bang" between February 19,
         1997 and the Closing Date;

                 (b)      Nonrefundable royalties paid as follows: (i)
         $1,000,000 paid at Closing, and (ii) as set forth on Schedule 2.6(b)
         to this Agreement, a royalty payable within 45 days after the end of
         each of HP's fiscal quarters commencing with the quarter ending April
         30, 1997 and ending with the quarter ending October 31, 1998, in an
         amount equal to a percentage of HP's Network and System Management
         Division's ("NSMD") net revenue, as defined and tracked by NSMD's
         controller for each such quarter, provided that such amounts will not
         aggregate more than $27,000,000 net present value.  Symantec agrees
         that neither it nor its auditors will have audit rights or the right
         to see any financial statements of NSMD or any other HP organization,
         other than those publicly available.

         Section 2.7      Allocation of Purchase Price.

                 (a)      The royalties paid to Symantec, as set forth in
         Section 2.6(b) above, will be allocated as follows: (i) $2,071,000
         will be allocated to tangible property including fixed assets,
         diskettes and manuals, and (ii) the remainder will be allocated to
         intangible property.

                 (b)      Symantec and HP will treat, account and report this
         transaction in accordance with the above allocation for internal
         accounting purposes and with respect to any returns filed with
         federal, state or local tax authorities.

         Section 2.8      Transfer Taxes. Symantec shall pay and promptly
discharge when due the entire amount of any and all excise, sales, value-added,
use, registration, stamp, transfer and other like Taxes (the "Transfer Taxes")
imposed or levied by reason of, in connection with or attributable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  The parties shall
cooperate with each other to the extent reasonably requested and legally
permitted to minimize any Transfer Taxes.

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SYMANTEC

         As an inducement to HP to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, except as set forth in Schedule 4 (the
"Disclosure Letter") (which Disclosure Letter shall specifically reference the
Sections of this Agreement to which the disclosure therein applies and shall be
executed by an authorized officer of Symantec), Symantec represents and
warrants to HP as follows:

         Section 4.1      Organization of Symantec.  Symantec is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware.  Symantec is duly qualified to transact business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each of the 50 states of the
United States in which the ownership or leasing of the Assets or the conduct of
the Products Business requires such qualification.  Symantec has full power and
authority to own or lease and to operate and use the Assets and to carry on the
Products Business as now conducted and as now proposed to be conducted pursuant
to this Agreement.  Symantec has no subsidiaries or affiliated companies, and
does not otherwise own or control, directly or indirectly, any equity interest
in any corporation, association or business entity, that has any interest in
the Assets or the Products Business.  Symantec has delivered to HP complete and
correct copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Symantec, in
each case as amended to the date hereof, and has delivered or made available
minutes of all of directors', directors' committees' and shareholders' meetings
that directly discuss the Products Business or the Assets.

         Section 4.2      Authorization.

                 (a)      Symantec has full power and authority to execute,
         deliver and perform this Agreement and all of the Symantec Ancillary
         Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
         thereby.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
         and the Symantec Ancillary Agreements by Symantec have been duly and
         validly authorized and approved by all required corporate proceedings
         on the part of Symantec.  This Agreement has been duly authorized,
         executed and delivered by Symantec and is the legal, valid and binding
         obligation of Symantec enforceable in accordance with its terms,
         except (a) as such enforcement may be





                                       10
<PAGE>   11
         subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights,
         and (b) as the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
         forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
         the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may
         be brought, and each of the Symantec Ancillary Agreements has been
         duly authorized by Symantec and upon execution and delivery by
         Symantec will be a legal, valid and binding obligation of Symantec
         enforceable in accordance with its terms.

                 (b)      Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Disclosure
         Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of
         the Symantec Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of any of the
         transactions contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance with or
         fulfillment of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof
         will: (i) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of the terms,
         conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default, an event of
         default or an event creating rights of acceleration, termination or
         cancellation or a loss of rights under, or result in the creation or
         imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the Assets under, (1) the
         Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Symantec, (2) any
         Transferred Agreement (as defined in Section 4.10), (3) any other
         note, instrument, agreement, mortgage, lease, license, franchise,
         permit or other authorization, right, restriction or obligation to
         which Symantec is a party or any of its properties is subject or by
         which Symantec is bound, (4) any Court Order to which Symantec is a
         party or any of its properties is subject or by which Symantec or any
         of its properties is bound, or (5) any Requirements of Laws affecting
         Symantec or its property; or (ii) require the approval, consent,
         authorization or act of, or the making by Symantec of any declaration,
         filing or registration with any Person.

                 (c)      Except for the HSR Filing, no consent, approval,
         order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
         with, any Governmental Body is required by or with respect to Symantec
         in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
         the Symantec Ancillary Agreements by Symantec or the consummation by
         Symantec of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         Section 4.3      Taxes.  Symantec has filed all Tax Returns which it
is required to file and has paid all Taxes which it is required to pay or which
have become payable pursuant to any assessment.  There are (and as of
immediately following the Closing there will be) no Encumbrances on the Assets
relating to or attributable to Taxes other than Permitted Encumbrances.
Symantec has no knowledge of any basis for the assertion of any such claims
which, if adversely determined, would result in an Encumbrance on the Assets,
other than Permitted Encumbrances, or otherwise adversely affect HP or HP's use
of the Assets.  None of the Assets are treated as "tax-exempt use property"
within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code.

         Section 4.4      Availability of Assets and Legality of Use.  Symantec
does not own any real property for the operations of the Products Business.
Except (i) as set forth in Section 4.4 of the Disclosure Letter, (ii) for the
Excluded Assets, and (iii) the rights granted under the License Agreement, the
Assets, in conjunction with the rights granted under the License Agreement,
constitute all the rights and intangible assets primarily used for and
necessary to operate the Products Business and constitute all the tangible
assets primarily used for the Products Business  (including, but not limited
to, all books, records, computers and computer programs and data processing
systems) and are in good condition (subject to normal wear and tear) and
serviceable condition and are suitable for the uses for which they are
intended.

         Section 4.5      Governmental Permits.





                                       11
<PAGE>   12
                 (a)      Symantec owns, holds or possesses all licenses,
         franchises, permits, privileges, immunities, approvals and other
         authorizations from a Governmental Body which are necessary to entitle
         it to own or lease, operate and use the Assets and to carry on and
         conduct the Products Business substantially as currently conducted
         (herein collectively called "Governmental Permits").  Section 4.5 of
         the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list and brief description of each
         Governmental Permit, except for such incidental licenses, permits and
         other authorizations which would be readily obtainable by any
         qualified applicant without undue burden in the event of any lapse,
         termination, cancellation or forfeiture thereof.  The Governmental
         Permits to be transferred to HP in connection with the transactions
         contemplated hereby as indicated in Section 4.5 of the Disclosure
         Letter are collectively referred to herein as the "Transferred
         Permits."  Complete and correct copies of all of the Transferred
         Permits have heretofore been delivered to HP by Symantec.

                 (b)      (i) Symantec has fulfilled and performed its
         obligations under each of the Governmental Permits, and no event has
         occurred or condition or state of facts exists which constitutes or,
         after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or
         default under any such Governmental Permit or which permits or, after
         notice or lapse of time or both, would permit revocation or
         termination of any such Governmental Permit, or which might adversely
         affect in any material respect the rights of Symantec under any such
         Governmental Permit; (ii) no notice of cancellation, of default or of
         any material dispute concerning any Governmental Permit, or of any
         event, condition or state of facts described in the preceding clause,
         has been received by, or is known to, Symantec; and (iii) each of the
         Governmental Permits is valid, subsisting and in full force and effect
         and may be assigned and transferred to HP in accordance with this
         Agreement and will continue in full force and effect thereafter, in
         each case without (x) the occurrence of any breach, default or
         forfeiture of rights thereunder, or (y) the consent, approval, or act
         of, or the making of any filing with, any Governmental Body.

         Section 4.6      Personal Property.  Schedule 2.1(e) contains a
detailed list of all capital equipment and hard assets used in the Products
Business.  Schedule 2.1(e) contains a brief description of each lease or other
agreement or right, whether written or oral (including in each case the annual
rental amount, the expiration date thereof and a brief description of the
property covered) under which Symantec is lessee of, or holds or operates, any
machinery, equipment, vehicle or other tangible personal property owned by a
third Person transferred under this Agreement.

         Section 4.7      Title to Property.  Symantec has good and marketable
title to all of the Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for
Permitted Encumbrances.   Except as disclosed in Section 4.7 of the Disclosure
Letter, the Assets constitute all of the intangible assets which are primarily
used for and necessary for the continued conduct of the Products Business as
now conducted and all of the tangible assets which are primarily used for the
continued conduct of the Products Business as now conducted.  Upon delivery to
HP on the Closing Date of the instruments of transfer contemplated by Section
3.4 above, Symantec will thereby transfer to HP good and marketable title to
the Assets, subject to no Encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

         Section 4.8      Intellectual Property.

                 (a)      Symantec owns, or is licensed or otherwise entitled
         to exercise, without restriction, all rights to the Intellectual
         Property of the Assets.

         standard object code end user license agreements, (B) standard upgrade
         insurance agreements, (C) standard support agreements and (D) any
         other end user upgrade or support agreement that only materially
         deviates from the standard form agreement by providing that the

         to comply with the "Year 2000," or Symantec has provided patent
         indemnification to the other party to the agreement.  The Disclosure
         Letter shall include the full name of such agreements, the full names
         of all parties thereto, and the effective date thereof.  The

         code end use license agreements, (B) standard upgrade insurance
         agreements, and (C) standard support agreements are labeled and
         appended to the Disclosure Letter.  Copies of all non-standard

         clause (ii) above have been delivered by Symantec to HP.

                 (c)      Symantec is not, nor as a result of the execution and
         delivery of this Agreement or the performance of Symantec's
         obligations hereunder will be, in violation of, or lose any rights
         pursuant to any license, sublicense or agreement described in the
         Disclosure Letter.

                 (d)      Symantec is the owner or licensee of, with all
         necessary right, title and interest in and to (free and clear of any
         liens, encumbrances or security interests), the Intellectual Property
         of the Assets and has rights (and except as set forth in the
         Disclosure Letter is not contractually obligated to pay any
         compensation to any third party in respect thereof) to the use thereof
         or the material covered thereby in connection with the services or
         products in respect of which such rights are being used.

                 (e)      No claims with respect to the Intellectual Property
         of the Assets have been asserted or, are threatened by any person and
         Symantec does not know of any claims (i) to the effect that the
         manufacture, sale or use of any product as now used or offered or

         trade secret, or other Intellectual Property right of any third party,

         Assets, or (iii) challenging the ownership, validity or effectiveness

         unauthorized use,

         valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto and is in full

         of the Transferred Agreements and no other party to any of the
         Transferred Agreements has materially breached or defaulted
         thereunder, and no event has occurred and no condition or state of
         facts exists which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice
         or both, would constitute such a default or breach by Symantec or by

         outdoor air of the Symantec Property in violation of applicable Law.

                 (b)      Compliance With Environmental Laws: To Symantec's
         knowledge, prior to the Closing, all Hazardous Materials Activities
         conducted on or about the Symantec Property by Symantec or its agent,

         accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental
         Permits and all Hazardous Material waste generated at the Symantec
         Property or as a consequence of the Products Business has been
         transferred to Disposal Facilities where it has been recycled,

         Disposal Site in connection with such transferred Hazardous Material
         waste.

                 (c)      Permits: There are no Environmental Permits which are

         reserves the right to redefine job content or position description of
         any employee.  Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 is intended or
         shall be deemed to (i) require HP to employ such persons for any fixed
         or predetermined time after the Closing, or (ii) confer upon any
         employee of Symantec, past, present, or future, any rights of
         employment of any nature, it being understood and agreed that the
         provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended to set forth an agreement
         between HP and Symantec, and are not intended to benefit any persons
         not party to this Agreement, including





                                       20
<PAGE>   21
         such employees.  Regardless of the date of the Closing, Symantec will
         pay (i) any bonuses due to each of the New HP Regular Personnel and
         the Technical Support People for Symantec's fiscal 1997 fourth quarter
         and fiscal 1998 first quarter (any bonus pertaining to the fiscal 1998
         first quarter shall be prorated for the employee's actual period of
         employment with Symantec during such quarter) on the same date that
         Symantec pays its other employees not engaged in the Business their
         bonuses for such quarters, and (ii) on the Closing Date, all vacation
         pay accrued and other earned benefits as of the Closing Date due to
         each of the New HP Regular Personnel.

                 (c)      With respect to those employees of the Business to
         whom HP chooses not to extend offers of employment, as more fully
         described in the Transition Agreement, either (i) if Symantec chooses
         to keep those employees on its payroll, Symantec shall provide the
         services of those employees as set forth in the Transition Agreement,
         or (ii) if Symantec terminates those employees at the Closing, HP may
         attempt to engage the services, on a contract basis, of those
         individuals, in either case for a period of two to six months after
         the Closing Date until HP's release of "Big Bang" products.

                 (d)      Symantec will not solicit any of the (i) New HP
         Regular Personnel for a period of two years after the Closing Date,
         and (ii) HP contractors that were Symantec employees or contractors
         prior to the Closing, if any, for their respective periods of service
         after the Closing, but in any event no more than two years; provided,
         that this restriction shall not apply if HP were to terminate any of
         the New HP Regular Personnel or contractors after the Closing.

                 (e)      HP acknowledges that under the CDA, HP may use
         Symantec confidential information disclosed under the CDA only for the
         purpose of evaluating a potential acquisition of certain assets of the
         Business during the confidentiality period of the CDA.  HP
         acknowledges that, under the CDA, disclosed Symantec confidential
         information includes confidential information about Symantec employees
         that remain Symantec employees after the Transition Period, even if
         known by the Symantec employees that become HP employees during the
         Transition Period.  HP further acknowledges that, under the CDA, use
         of such confidential information by HP for the purpose of direct
         solicitation of any of the remaining Symantec employees would be
         outside the scope of the rights granted under the CDA.

                 (f)      The following Symantec employees are affected by visa
         issues that may delay the commencement of their employment with HP
         should new visas reflecting their proposed new employment status not
         issue by the Closing Date:  Huey Ly, Rosely Ng, Swee Ying Yap, Nikhil
         Dhami, Nivedita Ghosh, Raymond Siu and Sanjay Mehta.  These seven
         individuals shall remain employees of Symantec for a period of time
         after the Closing Date, anticipated to be approximately 30- 60 days,
         necessary for issuance of new visas reflecting their proposed new
         employment status. Upon resolution of such matters, their employment
         with HP shall commence as promptly as practicable for HP.  HP shall be
         responsible by direct payment for the reasonable fees and costs
         associated with the issuance of new visas.  HP will reimburse Symantec
         for the (i) base pay, and (ii) pro rata benefits cost calculated at
         the rate of 34% of base pay, for such employees for the period, if
         any, beginning the day after the Closing Date, through and including
         the day prior to the date of their commencement of employment at HP,
         in an aggregate daily amount not to exceed $2,000 per individual.  On
         the same date in August 1997 that Symantec pays any bonuses for its
         first quarter of fiscal 1998 to its standard, full-time employees,
         Symantec shall pay directly to each of these seven individuals the
         appropriate pro rata portion of any bonuses due to them for such
         fiscal quarter.  On





                                       21
<PAGE>   22
         their respective termination dates, Symantec will also pay all
         vacation pay accrued and other earned benefits as of their respective
         termination dates to each of these seven individuals.

         Section 7.6      Taxes.  Symantec shall be responsible for and pay
when due (i) all Taxes attributable, levied or imposed upon or incurred in
connection with the Assets or the Business (pertaining to the period (or that
portion of any period) ending on or prior to the Closing Date).  Symantec
agrees to continue to timely file within the time period for filing, or any
extension granted with respect thereto, all Tax Returns it is required to file
in connection with the Assets or the Business, and such Tax Returns shall be
true and correct and completed in accordance with applicable laws.

         Section 7.7      Discharge of Symantec's Liabilities.  Symantec
covenants and agrees that it will pay and discharge, and hold HP harmless from,
each and every liability and obligation of Symantec in respect of the Business
or the Assets arising from events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, it
being understood and agreed that HP is assuming no liabilities or obligations
of Symantec other than the "Assumed Liabilities."

         Section 7.8      Support.  HP shall provide support to the Products'
Business support contract customers and will, as more fully described in the
Transition Agreement, provide such support by contracting with Symantec for the
services of the appropriate Symantec technical support people in Eugene,
Oregon, Leiden, Holland and Melbourne, Australia (collectively, the "Technical
Support People") during a Transition Period (as defined in the Transition
Agreement).  HP may  directly solicit the Technical Support People in North
America  during the Transition Period for possible employment to commence at
the end of the Transition Period.  At the end of the Transition Period, HP
shall provide to Symantec an amount equal to the retention benefit agreed upon
by HP and Symantec for some of the Technical Support People, as stated in
letters from Symantec to those people.  After the Transition Period, HP will
provide comparable support for any remaining term of the Products Business'
outstanding support contracts between Symantec and its customers.

         Section 7.9      Upgrade Insurance.  For Symantec's customers with
upgrade insurance agreements in effect as of the Closing Date, HP will provide,
at no charge, any major release of "Big Bang" from the Closing Date through the
coverage lapse date (not to exceed one year from the Closing Date) of the
relevant upgrade insurance agreement.  Thereafter, HP shall provide any
upgrades and updates to all of the Products Business' customers pursuant to
HP's terms and conditions.

         Section 7.10     Sublease.  HP agrees to enter into a written sublease
agreement with Symantec and the landlord of the Leased Premises in the form of
Exhibit F hereto to become effective at the Closing Date.

enter into the PcANYWHERE OEM Agreement in the form of Exhibit B hereto to
become effective at the Closing Date, relating to the product known as
"pcANYWHERE."

         Section 7.13     Transition OEM Agreement.  Symantec and HP agree to
enter into the Transition OEM Agreement in the form of Exhibit E hereto to
become effective at the Closing Date.

         Section 7.14     HSR Filings.  Each of Symantec and HP agree to use
commercially reasonable

Notification and Report Form with the Premerger Notification Office of the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States

regulatory approvals, clearances and expirations of waiting periods.

         Section 7.15     Consent to Use of Certain Marks.  Symantec will not
object to or attack HP's adoption, use or registration of the following marks
or combination of marks: "Administrator for Networks," "Desktop Administrator,"
"Expose," "NAN" or "NDA."  Symantec agrees to furnish HP with a letter of
consent for any mark permitted above, if so requested by HP, in any country in
which Symantec is the senior party.  HP agrees it receives no right under this
Agreement to register as marks the names "Norton" or "Symantec."

         Section 7.16     Termination of Certain Agreements.  The Software
License Agreement dated August 23, 1996 and the OEM Agreement effective June 1,
1994, as amended by the First Amendment to OEM Agreement effective February 1,

         Section 10.5     Third Person Claims.

                 (a)      If any third Person claim, action or suit is made
         against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party will be entitled
         to control the defense thereof.  The Indemnitors will (i) reasonably
         cooperate in connection with the defense of a third Person claim, and
         (ii) not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
         discharge any third Person claim without the Indemnified Party's prior
         written consent.  The Indemnitors shall be entitled to participate in,
         but not control, such defense with their own counsel at their own
         expense.

                 (b)      Reimbursement of Losses or Expenses in connection
         with a settlement shall be in accordance with Sections 10.5(c) and
         10.6 below.

                 (c)      The Indemnified Party will not settle, compromise or
         discharge any third Person claim without the consent of the
         Indemnitors, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  In the
         event the Indemnitors and the Indemnified Party cannot agree on a
         settlement, compromise or discharge of any third Person claim, the
         Indemnified Party may settle, compromise or discharge the third Person
         claim without such consent; provided, however, that, if the
         Indemnitors dispute the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification
         of the settled claim, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance
         with Section 10.6 below.

         Section 10.6     Dispute Resolution.  In the event the Indemnitors
dispute the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification of a third Person
claim that the Indemnified Party settles without the consent of the
Indemnitors, prior to filing any claims in a court of law or to submitting the
dispute to binding arbitration, the parties shall in good faith first negotiate
a written resolution of such dispute or claim for a period not to exceed
fifteen days from the date of receipt of a party's request for such
negotiation.  Such negotiation shall be conducted between Symantec and managers
of HP who have authorization to resolve any such dispute or claim.  In the
event the parties cannot negotiate a written resolution to such dispute or
claim during this fifteen-day negotiation period, and prior to filing any claim
in a court of law or submitting the dispute to binding arbitration, the parties
shall then submit such dispute or claim to nonbinding mediation with Judicial
Arbitration & Mediation Services ("JAMS").  The mediation may be initiated by
the written request of either party to the other party, shall commence within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice and shall be conducted in
accordance with the standard mediation procedures established by JAMS, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties.  The mediation shall not exceed a period of
thirty (30) days.  In the event the parties do not resolve such dispute or
claim as a result of such mediation or in the event such dispute or claim is
not resolved within three months, either party may seek to resolve the dispute
or claim in a court of competent jurisdiction or seek other legal or equitable
resolution.  The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the
time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken
or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.  The costs of
resolving the dispute, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, shall
be borne by the losing parties.

or by way of indemnification against any other amounts payable by HP to
Symantec whether under this Agreement or otherwise as HP's sole monetary
remedy.  Where the claim by HP relates to amounts paid or payable currently by
HP, HP may set off such amounts against the amounts next due and payable in
respect of the Purchase Price.

                 (a)      The rights of either party under this Agreement shall
         not be assignable by such party hereto prior to the Closing without
         the written consent of the other, except that the rights of HP

         benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
         assigns.  The successors and permitted assigns hereunder shall include

         any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

         Section 12.6     Access to Records After Closing.

                 (a)      For a period of three (3) years after the Closing
         Date, HP and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all
         of the books and records relating to the Business which Symantec or
         any of its Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date.  Such access
         shall be afforded by Symantec and its Affiliates upon receipt of
         reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours.  HP shall
         be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it
         pursuant to this Section 12.6.  If Symantec or any of its Affiliates
         shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
         expiration of such three (3) year period, Symantec shall prior to such
         disposition, give HP a reasonable opportunity, at HP's expense, to
         segregate and remove such books and records as HP may select.

                 (b)      For a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date,

         Agreement, Symantec will notify HP of its request.  HP may make such
         copy available to Symantec, at Symantec's sole expense, in HP's
         reasonable discretion.

         Section 12.7     Entire Agreements, Amendments.  With the exception of
the CDA, this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein and
the documents delivered pursuant hereto contain the





                                       30
<PAGE>   31
entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter
contained herein or therein, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings
or letters of intent between or among any of the parties hereto, including
without limitation the Letter of Intent.  This Agreement shall not be amended,
modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized
representative of each of the parties hereto.

         Section 12.8     Interpretation.  Article titles and headings to
sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

         Section 12.9     Waivers.  Any term or provision of this Agreement may
be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof.  Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party.  The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.  No waiver of
any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach.

         Section 12.10    Expenses.  Each party hereto will pay all costs and
expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to
its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained
herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees,
expenses and disbursements of its counsel, accountants and other advisors.

         Section 12.11    Partial Invalidity.  Wherever possible, each
provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions
contained herein shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating
the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions
or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be
unreasonable.

         Section 12.12    Execution in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an
original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to each of Symantec and HP.

         Section 12.13    Further Assurances.  On the Closing Date, Symantec
shall (i) deliver to HP such other bills of sale, deeds, endorsements,
assignments and other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and
transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to HP and its counsel, as HP may
reasonably request or as may be otherwise reasonably necessary to vest in HP
all the right, title and interest of Symantec in, to or under any or all of the
Assets, and (ii) take all steps as may be reasonably necessary to put HP in
actual possession and control of all the Assets.  From time to time following
the Closing, Symantec shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to HP such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as HP may
reasonably request or as otherwise may be reasonably necessary to more
effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in, HP and put HP in possession
of, any part of the Assets, and, in the case of licenses, certificates,
approvals, authorizations, agreements, contracts, leases, easements and other
commitments included in the Assets (a) which cannot be transferred or assigned
effectively without the





                                       31
<PAGE>   32
consent of third parties which consent has not been obtained prior to the
Closing, to cooperate with HP at its request in endeavoring to obtain such
consent promptly, and if any such consent is unobtainable, to use its
reasonable efforts to secure to HP the benefits thereof in some other manner,
or (b) reasonable efforts jointly with HP to secure to HP the benefits thereof
in some other manner (including the exercise of the rights of Symantec
thereunder).  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any license, certificate,
approval, authorization, agreement, contract, lease, easement or other
commitment included in the Assets if an attempted assignment thereof without
the consent of a third party thereto would constitute a breach thereof.

         Section 12.14    Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts
of law provisions) of the State of California.

MARCH 26, 1997

                               LICENSE AGREEMENT


This license agreement (the "License Agreement") is entered into and is
effective as of the Closing Date specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement by
and between Hewlett-Packard Company, a California corporation ("HP") and
Symantec Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Symantec").

1.       RECITALS:

         1.1     Symantec has been operating a business to design, develop,
                 enhance, test, manufacture,  distribute and support the
                 products, technologies and intellectual property known to
                 Symantec and its customers as all versions of Norton
                 Administrator for Networks ("NAN"), Norton Desktop
                 Administrator ("NDA"), Expose ("Expose") and work-in-progress
                 and developments intended for the upcoming "Big Bang" release
                 (collectively, the "Business").

         1.2     Symantec's business of (i) designing, developing, enhancing
                 and testing the Products and Work-in-Progress, (ii)
                 manufacturing and distributing specifically for the Products,
                 and (iii) and supporting primarily the Products and
                 Work-in-Progress constitutes the "Products Business."

         1.3     Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement between HP and
                 Symantec dated March 27, 1997 ("Asset Purchase Agreement"),
                 Symantec is selling and HP is buying the Assets;

         1.4     In conjunction with execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
                 HP wishes to license from Symantec certain intellectual
                 property (described in Schedules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to this
                 Agreement) primarily related to other Symantec businesses but
                 also related to the Products.    Symantec wishes to license
                 back from HP certain intellectual property (described in
                 Schedules 7, 8 and 9 to this Agreement) contained in the
                 Assets but also related to other Symantec business.

The parties agree as follows:

                 Symantec and Division General Manager for HP or higher as its
                 representative.  These representatives will meet in person and
                 alone (except for one interpreter, if necessary, and one other
                 assistant allowed for each party) and will attempt in good
                 faith to resolve the dispute.  This meeting will be a required
                 prerequisite before either party may seek judicial or
                 governmental resolution of the dispute, except for claims
                 seeking injunctive or other equitable relief.  The parties may
                 agree to pursue any other additional mutually acceptable
                 dispute resolution method but such pursuit will not modify the
                 above-stated prerequisite.

10.      TERMINATION

         10.1    Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated by the mutual
                 consent of HP and Symantec;

         10.2    Notice of Termination.  Any party desiring to terminate this
                 Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 above shall give notice
                 of such desire to the other party to this Agreement.

                                 AMENDMENT NO. 1

     This Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment") to the Asset Purchase Agreement
dated March 27, 1997 (the "Agreement") is entered into and made effective this
24th day of April, 1997 by and between Hewlett-Packard Company, a California
corporation ("HP"), and Symantec Corporation, a Delaware corporation 
("Symantec"). Terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to 
them in the Agreement.

                                    RECITAL

      WHEREAS, HP and Symantec executed and delivered the Agreement and now
desire to amend the Agreement to clarify certain of its terms and to add certain
additional matters not previously provided for in the Agreement.

      NOW THEREFORE, intending to be bound, in consideration for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby mutually
acknowledged, HP and Symantec agree as follows:

      1. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 7.4. Section 7.4 Is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety as follows:

*Section 7.4 Special License Grant.

(a) From time to time and at HP's sole discretion, HP shall sell at a price of
$0.01 per build a portion of the NAN and NDA Products (the "Source") to Symantec
for the purpose of incorporating in the Source an appropriate database with the
same or superior functionality to C-Index/II. As soon as reasonably practicable,
Symantec shall, using its computers and related equipment, complete the
incorporation of such database into the Source (the "Completed Builds") and
shall sell at a price of $0.01 per build such Completed Builds to HP.
Thereafter, HP may dispose of such Completed Builds at its sole discretion. HP
acknowledges that Symantec may need certain software tools and compilers which
are currently owned or licensed by HP in order to produce the Completed Builds.
HP will pay Symantec $1,000 as a fully-paid up license for the final Completed
Build. In that regard, upon reasonable requests by Symantec and pursuant to any
rights that HP may have, HP agrees to license such tools to Symantec. In
addition, HP agrees to license to Symantec all necessary equipment for Symantec
to produce the Completed Builds at a fee to be negotiated in good faith
following the Closing.

(b) HP and Symantec will mutually agree on the appointment of one or more
persons, who shall not be employees of HP, to perform consulting services to
produce the Completed Builds.

(c) HP will develop and release software containing all or any part of the
Products in which C-Index/II has been replaced with another database (the "New
Database Software") as quickly as is

<PAGE>   65

commercially reasonable. HP acknowledges that it would have replaced this
database in any event, but would not have engaged in such development prior to
the release of the next release of NAS (the "Next Release"), but for the
commitment hereunder.

(d) HP may set-off that portion of its expenses (which are directly attributed
to the parallel development of the New Database Software prior to the initial
release of the Next Release) for the development of the New Database Software
(the "Development Expenses"), that HP would not have otherwise incurred, but
for its obligations to accelerate development under subsection 7.4(c) above,
against the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 10.7 hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, HP's right to set-off the Development Expenses will terminate at such
time as (i) Symantec has developed and delivered to HP a version of the Next
Release that does not contain C-Index/II or (ii) Symantec has provided to HP a
license to use C-Index/II in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(the "New C-Index License"). Such development expenses may include charges on or
after May 5, 1997 of up to $100,000 for the cost of a new database.

(e) Symantec, hereby grants to HP any and all rights that Symantec may obtain at
a future date under the New C-Index License with respect to the Products.

      Each of HP and Symantec agree to use its reasonable best efforts to
incorporate and expand upon the provisions set forth above in a mutually
satisfactory agreement to be executed within four weeks following the Closing
Date; provided, that, in the event that, for whatever reason, the parties are
unable to timely or otherwise execute such a definitive agreement, paragraphs
(a) through (e) above shall be enforced in accordance with their terms.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, HP may, at any time and in its
sole discretion, terminate the provisions set forth in Sections 7.4(a) and (b).

      2.    AMENDMENT TO SECTION 10.3.

            (a) The first sentence of Section 10.3(a) is hereby amended and
replaced in its entirety as follows:

"Except for Losses and Expenses related to Trio, the liabilities and obligations
of Symantec arising under this Article 10 shall commence only following the
incidence of Losses and Expenses aggregating $150,000, following which all
claims starting from the first dollar shall be recoverable as provided in this
Agreement."

            (b) The first sentence of Section 10.3(b) is hereby amended and
replaced in its entirety as follows:


"The liabilities and obligations of HP and any HP Group Member arising under
this Article 10 shall commence only following the incidence of Losses and
Expenses (incurred by any and all Indemnified Parties) aggregating $150,000,
following which all claims starting from the first dollar shall be recoverable
as provided in this Agreement."


<PAGE>   66

      3. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 10.7. The first sentence of Section 10.7 of the
Agreement is hereby amended and replaced in its entirety with the following:

"HP shall be entitled to set-off the amount of any claim reasonably submitted in
good faith under Section 10.1 as a Loss and/or Expense or by way of
indemnification against any other amounts payable by HP to Symantec whether
under this Agreement or otherwise as HP's sole monetary remedy."

      4. AMENDMENT TO EXHIBIT A-2. Any and all agreements among Trio Systems,
LLC and Symantec are hereby removed from the list of "Transferred Agreements"
under Exhibit A-2 of the Agreement.

      5. GENERAL. The General Provisions of Article 12 of the Agreement are
hereby incorporated into and deemed applicable to this Amendment. Subject to the
foregoing amendments and restatements, the Agreement remains in full force and
effect. Each of HP and Symantec hereby agree that the terms and conditions of
this Amendment shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third
party, whether a governmental entity, pursuant to a legal proceeding or
otherwise, without the written consent of the other party, unless such
disclosure is required by law.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be
executed on the date first written above.
