Item 5.    OTHER EVENTS.

On December 16, 1999, at a special meeting of the stockholders of Xilinx, Inc.

Company's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized
shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01 par value per share, from
300,000,000 to 500,000,000.  This amendment was necessary in order to

reserved for issuance or subject to outstanding options granted under the
Company's 1997 Stock Plan, 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan and 1988

will cover the increase in the number of shares as a result of the stock split:
333-62897; 333-44233; and 333-12339.  The Company hereby incorporates by

           XILINX REVENUES UP 13% SEQUENTIALLY; EPS $0.35 EXCLUDING
                ONE-TIME CHARGE; COMMON SHARES TO SPLIT 2-FOR-1

          SAN JOSE, CA., OCTOBER 19, 1999 -- Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) today
announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2000 ending October 2, 1999.
Second quarter revenue was $238.8 million, an increase of 13% from the previous
quarter, and an increase of 53% from the second quarter of last year. Operating
income increased 14% sequentially, excluding a one-time charge of $4.6 million
associated with the acquisition of Philip's CPLD business, as Xilinx continued
to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues. Net income for
the second quarter was $56.0 million, or $0.33 per share. Excluding the one-time
charge, net income was $59.2 million, or $0.35 per share, an increase of 15%
from the prior quarter, which is more than double the net income reported in the
second fiscal quarter of last year. Xilinx's profit margin, excluding the one-
time charge, was nearly 25%, setting a corporate record for the second quarter
in a row.

          "The September quarter exceeded our expectations," commented Wim
Roelandts, Xilinx's chief executive officer. "Revenues from all geographies were
up sequentially during the quarter. Most surprisingly, European revenues--which
tend to be seasonally weak during the September quarter--were up nearly 22%
sequentially as several customer programs commenced production." Roelandts
continued, "While we experienced broad-based product demand during the quarter,
I am particularly pleased with the growth of our new products. Since its
introduction four quarters ago, cumulative revenues from the Virtex family have
totaled approximately $50 million. Additionally, CPLD revenues now represent
nearly 10% of total Xilinx revenues, up from 6% in the same quarter a year ago."

          Xilinx also announced that its Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1
split of its common shares. The stock split is subject to the approval of Xilinx
shareholders, who must

approve an amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation to increase the
Company's authorized common stock. Subject to such approval, shareholders of
record as of December 17, 1999 would receive one additional common share for
every share held, to be distributed on December 27, 1999. The numbers reported
for the second quarter do not reflect the split.


                    Business Review - Second Quarter FY'00:

 .  Turns bookings averaged approximately 51% for the quarter.

 .  Inventory days at Xilinx and at distribution were 83 days and 69 days,
   respectively.

 .  Capital expenditures and depreciation were $20.4 million and $8.1 million,
   respectively.

 .  Approximately 4% of Xilinx's work-in-progress inventory was damaged as a
   result of the Taiwan earthquake. As a result, the Company expects no material
   impact to future financial results.*
