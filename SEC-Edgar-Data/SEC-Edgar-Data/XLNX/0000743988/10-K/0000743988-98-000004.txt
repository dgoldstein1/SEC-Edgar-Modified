ITEM  1.          BUSINESS

Items  1  and 3 of this 10-K contain forward-looking statements concerning the
Company's  development  efforts,  strategy, new product introductions, backlog
and  litigation.    These  statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties
including  those  discussed throughout this document as well as under "Factors
Affecting  Future  Operating  Results"  in  Item  7.

GENERAL

Xilinx,  Inc.  (Xilinx  or the Company) designs, develops and markets complete
programmable  logic  solutions,  including advanced integrated circuits (ICs),
software design tools, predefined system functions delivered as cores of logic
and  field  engineering  support.    The  Company's programmable logic devices
(PLDs) include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable
logic  devices  (CPLDs).    These  components  are  standard ICs programmed by
Xilinx's  customers  to  perform desired logic operations. Xilinx also markets
HardWire  devices,  which are specifically configured during the manufacturing
process  and  functionally  equivalent  to  programmed  FPGAs.   The Company's
products are designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for
electronic equipment manufacturers in the data processing, telecommunications,
networking, industrial control, instrumentation, high-reliability/military and
consumer  markets.

Competitive  pressures  require  manufacturers  of electronic systems to bring
increasingly  complex  products  to market rapidly.  Customer requirements for
improved  functionality,  performance,  reliability  and  lower cost are often
addressed  through the use of components that integrate ever larger numbers of
logic  gates  onto  a single integrated circuit because such integration often
results  in  faster  speed,  smaller  size,  lower power consumption and lower
costs.    However,  while global competition is increasing the demand for more
complex products, it is also shortening product life cycles and requiring more
frequent  product  enhancements.

Xilinx  provides  programmable  logic  solutions, which combine the high logic
density  typically  associated with custom gate arrays with the time to market
advantages  of  programmable logic and the availability of a standard product.
The Company offers a broad product line of PLDs, which serve a wide variety of
applications  requiring  high  levels  of  integration,  competitive speed and
acceptable  pricing.    In  many of these applications where time to market is
important,  customer demand unpredictable and/or frequent design modifications
are  necessary  to  adapt  a  product to new markets, the flexibility achieved
through  the products' programmability features is instrumental.  Xilinx CPLDs
complement the Company's FPGA products and contribute to the Company's efforts
to  offer  comprehensive programmable logic solutions.  With FPGAs, which have
the advantages of higher density and lower power consumption, and CPLDs, which
are  typically  faster and have lower densities, the Company's products enable
electronic equipment manufacturers to rapidly bring complex products to market
in  volume.

The Xilinx software strategy is to deliver an integrated design solution for a
broad customer base ranging from customers who are not familiar with designing
systems using PLDs to the most sophisticated customers accustomed to designing
high  density,  specifically  configured  gate  arrays.    The objective is to
deliver  strategic  software  advantages  that combine ease of use with design
flexibility,  effective  silicon  utilization  and  competitive  performance.

System  designers  use  Xilinx proprietary software design tools together with
industry  standard  electronic  design  automation  (EDA) tools and predefined
system  functions delivered as cores of logic to design, develop and implement
Xilinx  programmable logic applications.  Designers define the logic functions
of the circuit and revise such functions as necessary.  Programmable logic can
often  be  designed and verified in a few days, as opposed to several weeks or
months  for  gate arrays, which are customized devices that are defined during
the  manufacturing  process.  Moreover,  programmable logic design changes can
typically  be  implemented in as little as a few hours, as compared to several
weeks  for  a custom gate array.  In addition, significant savings result from
the  elimination  of  non-recurring  engineering  costs  and  the reduction of
expenses  associated  with the redesign and testing of custom gate arrays.  By
reducing  the  cost  and  scheduling  risks  of  design iterations, PLDs allow
greater  designer  creativity,  including  the  consideration  of  design
alternatives that often lead to product improvements.  Further, since PLDs are
standard  products  and production quantities are readily available, exposures
to  obsolete  inventory  can  be  significantly  reduced.

Xilinx  was  organized in California in February 1984 and in November 1985 was
reorganized  to  incorporate its research and development limited partnership.
In  April  1990,  the  Company  reincorporated  in  Delaware.    The Company's
corporate  facilities  and  executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive,
San  Jose,  California  95124.

PRODUCTS

The  timely  introduction  of new products which address customer requirements
and  compete  effectively on the basis of price, functionality and performance
is  a  significant  factor  in  the  future success of the Company's business.
Delays  in  developing new products with anticipated technological advances or
delays  in  commencing  volume shipments of new products could have an adverse
effect  on  the  Company's  financial condition and results of operations.  In
addition,  there  can  be no assurance that such products, if introduced, will
gain  market acceptance or respond effectively to new technological changes or
new  product  introductions  by  other  companies.

     Programmable  Logic  Devices

The Company's PLD products include both FPGA and CPLD product lines.  The FPGA
products include the XC2000, XC3000 and XC3100 families, which represent first
generation  products,  as  well  as  the  XC4000,  XC4000X, XC5000 and Spartan
families,  which  represent  second generation products.  The Company's XC4000
product  family  includes  both the XC4000 and XC4000E.  The Company's XC4000X
product  family  includes  the  XC4000EX, XC4000XL and XC4000XV.  The XC4000EX
family  utilizes  the  benefits  of  the  XC4000E  architecture  and  provides
additional  routing  resources  aimed  to meet the design requirements for ICs
with  high  gate  densities.   The XC4000XL family is the industry's first 3.3
volt  FPGA  family  manufactured on 0.35 micron technology.  The family has 11
members  shipping  in  volume  ranging in density from 2,000 to 180,000 system
gates.    The  XC4000XV  utilizes  0.25  micron technology.  The Company began
sampling  one  device  in  the  XC4000XV  family  during  fiscal  1998.

The  Company's  two  newest  FPGA  product families are the Spartan and Virtex
product  lines.  The Spartan Series of FPGAs began revenue shipments in fiscal
1998  and  is  the Company's first product line that is price competitive with
high  volume  application-specific  integrated circuits (ASICs).  Derived from
the  XC4000  architecture  and spanning up to 40,000 system gates, the Spartan
Series  combines  high  performance,  on-chip  RAM,  software cores, and lower
prices.

The  Virtex  series  of  FPGAs  presently  features  leading-edge  0.25 micron
technology.   Xilinx plans to deliver a 1,000,000 system-gate Virtex device by
the  end of fiscal 1999, with first sampling to begin in the same fiscal year.
Virtex  is  intended  to  address  the  demand  for  higher  density,  higher
performance  products  in  the  telecommunication,  networking, and multimedia
market  segments.  With the Virtex family, Xilinx will deliver its first fully
programmable  alternative  to  high  density  system-level  ASIC  design.

The  two  preceding  paragraphs  contain  forward-looking statements which are
subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties  including those discussed in Item 7 in
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation  -  Factors  Affecting  Future  Results."

The  Company's  CPLD  products  include  the  XC7000 and XC9500 families.  The
XC9500  family  utilizes  a Flash-based CPLD architecture and offers in-system
programmability.    This  family  delivers  high  speeds,  while  giving  the
flexibility  of  an  enhanced,  customer-proven  pin-locking  architecture and
direct  interface  to  both  3.3  and  5  volt  systems.

PLDs  are  available  in  a wide variety of plastic and ceramic package types,
including  pin-grid  array,  surface  mount and quad flat pack configurations.
These  devices  meet  the  industry  standard  operating temperature ranges of
commercial,  industrial  and  military  users.

The  Company's  HardWire  ASICs offer a low cost migration path from FPGAs for
high  volume  applications.    Once  a programmable logic design is finalized,
customers  can  take  advantage  of  HardWire products, which are specifically
configured  during  the  manufacturing  process.  The Company's HardWire ASICs
offer  a  complete turn-key conversion solution, which reduces the engineering
and  risk  burden  normally  associated  with  conventional gate arrays.  Each
Hardwire  ASIC is completely interchangeable with its FPGA counterpart and for
each  current  Xilinx  FPGA  family,  there  is a corresponding HardWire ASIC;
except  for  the  Spartan  family,  which  would  not  benefit  from  HardWire
conversion.

In  order  to  minimize  the  printed circuit board area required for external
storage  of  the  FPGA configuration program, the Company provides a family of
erasable  programmable read-only memories (EPROMs).  These devices are sold by
the  Company  in  conjunction  with  its  FPGAs.

     Software  design  tools

Xilinx  offers  complete  software  design  tool  solutions,  which enable the
implementation of designs in Xilinx PLDs.  These software design tools combine
powerful  technology  with a flexible, easy to use graphical interface to help
achieve  the  best  possible  designs within each customer's project schedule,
regardless  of  the  designer's  experience  level.

The  Company  offers  two  complementary  software design tool solutions.  The
Foundation  Series  provides  designers  with  a complete, ready-to-use design
solution  based on industry-standard hardware description languages (HDLs) and
is  easy  to learn and use.  For those customers new to designing with PLDs or
desiring  a  low  cost  approach,  the  Company  offers  this fully integrated
software  solution.    The  Alliance  Series is for designers who want maximum
flexibility  to  integrate  programmable  logic design into their existing EDA
environment  and  methodology.    With interfaces to over 50 EDA vendors, this
product allows users to select tools with which they are most familiar thereby
shortening  their  design  cycle.

The  Company also offers more than 75 pre-implemented, fully verified, drop-in
cores  of  logic  for  commonly  used complex functions such as digital signal
processing (DSP), bus interfaces, processors and peripheral interfaces.  Using
logic cores, available from the Company and third party AllianceCORE partners,
customers can shorten development time, reduce design risk and obtain superior
performance  for  their  designs.  Additionally, the Company's CORE Generator,
announced  during  the  fourth  quarter of fiscal 1998, is an easy to use tool
that  delivers  parameter-based  cores  optimized  for the Company's FPGAs and
features  an interface to third-party system level DSP design tools.  The CORE
Generator  is  shipped  with  the  Company's  software  design  tools.

Xilinx's  software  design  tools  operate  on  desktop  computer  platforms,
including  personal computers using Windows 95 and Windows NT and workstations
from  IBM,  HP, DEC and Sun Microsystems.  Through March 31, 1998, the Company
had  sold  over  42,000  software  design  systems  worldwide.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Xilinx's  research  and  development activities are primarily directed towards
the  design  of  new  integrated  circuits,  the  development  of  advanced
semiconductor  manufacturing processes, the development of new software design
tools  and  cores  of  logic  and  ongoing  cost  reductions  and  performance
improvements  in  existing  products.    The Company's recent primary areas of
focus  have  been:  to  increase  the Company's CPLD market share; to maintain
density/performance  leadership  with its newest FPGA product lines, including
the  XC4000X,  Spartan  and  Virtex families; to give its customers a low-cost
migration  path  for high-volume applications with its specifically configured
HardWire ASICs and to support all its product families with easy-to-use, fully
automated  software design tools and cores of logic.  However, there can be no
assurance  that  any  of the Company's development efforts will be successful,
timely  or  cost-effective.

Xilinx  believes  that  software  design  tools  and logic cores are important
factors  in  expanding  the  use of programmable logic devices.  The Company's
research and development challenge is to continue to develop new products that
create  cost-effective  solutions  for  customers.   In fiscal 1998, 1997, and
1996,  the  Company's  research  and  development expenses were $80.5 million,
$71.1  million  and  $64.6 million, respectively.  The Company expects that it
will  continue  to  spend  substantial funds on research and development.  The
Company  believes that technical leadership is essential to its future success
and is committed to continuing a significant level of research and development
effort.

MARKETING AND SALES

Xilinx  sells  its  products  through several channels of distribution: direct
sales  to  manufacturers  by  independent  sales  representative  firms, sales
through  franchised  domestic  distributors,  and  sales  through  foreign
distributors.  Xilinx also utilizes a direct sales management organization and
field  applications engineers (FAEs) as well as manufacturer's representatives
and  distributors to reach a broad base of potential customers.  The Company's
independent  representatives generally address larger OEM customers and act as
a  direct  sales  force, while distributors serve the balance of the Company's
customer base.  The Company's sales and customer support personnel support all
channels and consult with customers about their plans, ensuring that the right
software  and  devices  are selected at the beginning of a customer's project.

In  North  America,  Hamilton-Hallmark,  Marshall  Industries,  and  Insight
Electronics,  Inc.  distribute  the  Company's  products  nationwide,  and  Nu
Horizons Electronics provides additional regional sales coverage.  The Company
believes  that distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching certain
customers.    Since  the  Company's  PLDs  are  standard products, they do not
present many of the inventory risks to distributors as compared to custom gate
arrays,  and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support.

Revenue  from  product  sales  direct to customers and foreign distributors is
generally  recognized  upon  shipment.    However,  the  Company  defers  the
recognition  of  revenue  and  the  related  cost  of  revenue on shipments to
domestic  distributors that have certain rights of return and price protection
privileges  on  unsold  product  until  the  distributor  sells  the  product.

BACKLOG AND CUSTOMERS

As  of  March 28, 1998, the Company's backlog of purchase orders scheduled for
delivery  within  the  next  three  months  was  $97.2 million.  Because of an
overall  slowdown  in  the semiconductor market and a widespread perception by
customers  that  product is readily available, many of the Company's customers
are  currently placing orders for near-term delivery and providing the Company
relatively  limited  visibility  to demand for products further out than three
months.    Backlog  as  of March 29, 1997 was $84.4.  Backlog amounts for both
years include orders to distributors, which may receive price adjustments upon
sale  to  end  customers.    Also,  orders  constituting the Company's current
backlog  are subject to changes in delivery schedule or to cancellation at the
option  of  the  purchaser without significant penalty.  Accordingly, although
useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be
a  reliable  measure  of  revenues  for  any  future  period.

No  single  end customer accounted for more than 5% of revenues in fiscal 1998
or  1997  or  6%  in  1996.    See  Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  in  Item  8  for  Industry  and  Geographic  Information.

WAFER FABRICATION

The  Company  does not manufacture the wafers used for its products.  Over the
last  two  years,  the  majority  of  wafers  purchased  by  the  Company were
manufactured  by  Seiko  Epson  Corporation  (Seiko  Epson)  and  United
Microelectronics Corporation, (UMC).  Precise terms with respect to the volume
and  timing  of  wafer  production and the pricing of wafers produced by Seiko
Epson  and UMC are determined by periodic negotiations between the Company and
these  wafer  foundry  partners.

Xilinx's  strategy  is  to  focus  its  resources  on  creating new integrated
circuits  and  software  design tools and on market development rather than on
wafer  fabrication.    The  Company  continuously  evaluates  opportunities to
enhance  foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from both its
main  suppliers  as  well  as  other  suppliers  of  leading-edge  process
technologies.    As a result, the Company has entered into agreements with UMC
and  Seiko  Epson  as  discussed  below.

The  Company,  UMC  and  other  parties  have  entered into a joint venture to
construct a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan, known as United Silicon Inc.
(USIC).    See  Notes 4 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item  8.    The Company invested an additional $67.4 million in fiscal 1998 to
bring  the  total  cumulative  investment  to  $101.7  million.    The Company
currently  holds a 25% equity ownership and the right to receive 31.25% of the
wafer  capacity  from  this  facility.   Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company  may  be  required  to  make  a  third  equity installment of up to an
additional  $30  million  in  the USIC joint venture if warranted based on the
capital  and operational requirements of the joint venture.  UMC has committed
to  and  is  supplying  the  Company  with  wafers  manufactured  in  existing
facilities  until  capacity  is  available  in  the  new  facility.

In  fiscal 1997, the Company signed an agreement with Seiko Epson.  See Note 2
of  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  This agreement was
amended  in  fiscal  1998 and provides for an advance to Seiko Epson of $150.0
million.   In conjunction with the agreement, $60.0 million was paid in fiscal
1997  and  an  additional $90.0 million was paid in fiscal 1998.  Repayment of
this advance is in the form of wafer deliveries, which began during the fourth
quarter  of fiscal 1998.  Specific wafer pricing is in US dollars and is based
upon  the  prices  of  similar  wafers  manufactured  by  other,  specifically
identified,  leading-edge  foundry  suppliers.   The advance payment provision
also  provides  for  interest  to  be  paid to the Company in the form of free
wafers.

SORT, ASSEMBLY AND TEST

Wafers  purchased  by the Company are sorted by the wafer foundry, independent
sort  subcontractors  or  by  the  Company.    Sorted  wafers are assembled by
subcontractors  in  facilities  in Pacific Rim countries.  During the assembly
process,  the  wafers are separated into individual integrated circuits, which
are  then  assembled  into  various  package  types.   Following assembly, the
packaged  units  are  tested  by  independent test subcontractors or by Xilinx
personnel  at  the  Company's  San  Jose  or  Ireland  facilities.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

Through  March  28,  1998, the Company held over 200 United States patents and
maintains  an  active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of
software,  IC  architecture  and  design.    The Company intends to vigorously
protect  its  intellectual  property.    The  Company believes that failure to
enforce  its patents or to effectively protect its trade secrets could have an
adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements  in  Item  8.

Xilinx has acquired various software licenses that permit the Company to grant
object  code  sublicenses  to  its  customers for certain third party software
programs  licensed  with the Company's software design tools. In addition, the
Company  has  licensed  certain  software  for internal use in product design.

EMPLOYEES

Xilinx's  employee  population  has  grown  by 9% during the past year.  As of
March 28, 1998, Xilinx had 1,391 employees compared to 1,277 at the end of the
prior year.  None of the Company's employees are represented by a labor union.
The  Company  has  not experienced any work stoppages and believes it has good
relations  with  its  employees.

COMPETITION

The  Company's  FPGAs and CPLDs compete in the programmable logic marketplace,
with  a  substantial  majority of the Company's revenues derived from its FPGA
product  families.  The industries in which the Company competes are intensely
competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, rapid product
obsolescence  and continuous price erosion.  The Company expects significantly
increased  competition  both  from  existing  competitors and from a number of
companies  that  may  enter  its  market.

Xilinx  believes  that important competitive factors in the programmable logic
market  include  price,  product  performance and reliability, adaptability of
products  to  specific applications, ease of use and functionality of software
design  tools,  functionality  of predefined cores of logic and the ability to
provide  timely  customer  service  and  support.   The Company's strategy for
expansion  in the programmable logic market includes continued introduction of
new product architectures, which address high volume, low cost applications as
well  as  high  performance,  leading-edge  density applications and continued
price  reductions  proportionate  with  the  ability  to  lower  the  cost  of
manufacture for established products.  However, there can be no assurance that
the  Company  will  be  successful  in  achieving  these  strategies.

The  Company's major sources of competition are comprised of several elements:
the  manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers of high density
programmable  logic  products  characterized  by  FPGA-type  architectures,
providers  of high speed, low density CPLDs devices and other providers of new
or  emerging  programmable  logic  products.  The Company competes with custom
gate  array  manufacturers  on  the  basis  of  lower  design  costs,  shorter
development  schedules and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of
custom  gate  arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in
high  volumes.    The  Company  continues  to develop lower cost architectures
intended  to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs
(in  high  volumes)  and PLD production costs.  The Company competes with high
density  programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance, the ability
to  deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers, voltage and customer support,
taking  advantage  of  the  primary  characteristics  of  flexible, high speed
implementation  and  quick  time-to-market  capabilities  of the Company's PLD
product  offerings.    Competition  among CPLD suppliers is based primarily on
price,  performance,  design,  software  utility  and  the  ability to deliver
complete  solutions  to  customers.    In  addition, the Company competes with
manufacturers  of  new or emerging programmable logic products on the basis of
price,  performance,  customer  support,  software  utility and the ability to
deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers.  Some of the Company's current or
potential  competitors  have  substantially  greater financial, manufacturing,
marketing  and  technical  resources  than  Xilinx.    To the extent that such
efforts  to  compete are not successful, the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

The  benefits  of  programmable  logic have attracted a number of companies to
this  market,  competing primarily on the basis of speed, performance, design,
price,  software  utility  or  cost.    Xilinx  recognizes  that  different
applications  require  different programmable technologies, and the Company is
developing  architectures,  processes  and  products  to  meet  these  varying
customer  needs.    Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software
solutions, Xilinx has developed common software design tools that supports the
full  range  of  integrated circuit products.  Xilinx believes that automation
and  ease  of  design  are significant competitive factors in the programmable
logic  market.

Several  companies, both large and small, have introduced products competitive
with  those  of  the  Company  or have announced their intention to enter this
market.   Some of the Company's competitors may possess innovative technology,
which  could  prove  superior to Xilinx's technology in some applications.  In
addition,  the  Company  anticipates  potential  competition from suppliers of
logic  products  based  on new technologies.  Some of the Company's current or
potential  competitors  have  substantially  greater financial, manufacturing,
marketing  and  technical  resources  than Xilinx. This additional competition
could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  financial  condition  and results of
operations.

Xilinx  also  faces  competition from its licensees.  Under a license from the
Company,  Lucent  Technologies  is  manufacturing  and marketing the Company's
non-proprietary  XC3000  FPGA  products  and  is  employing that technology to
provide  additional  FPGA  products  offering higher density.  Seiko Epson has
rights  to  manufacture  the  Company's  products and market them in Japan and
Europe  but  is not currently doing so.  Advanced Micro Devices is licensed to
use  certain of the Company's patents to manufacture and market products other
than  SRAM-based  FPGAs.

ITEM  2.          PROPERTIES

Xilinx's  corporate offices, which include the administrative, sales, customer
support,  marketing,  research  and  development  and final testing groups are
located  in  San  Jose,  California.    The  site  includes adjacent buildings
providing  335,000  square  feet  of available space, which are leased through
1999.    The  Company  has  entered  into  lease  agreements relating to these
facilities  which  would  allow the Company to purchase these facilities on or
before  the  lease  expiration  dates  in December 1999.  The Company has also
entered  into  an  agreement  whereby an 180,000 square foot facility is being
constructed  on  property adjacent to the Company's corporate facilities.  The
Company  will  have the option to purchase the building after an initial lease
term.    See  Note  6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

In  addition,  the  Company has a 100,000 square foot administrative, research
and development and final testing facility in the metropolitan area of Dublin,
Ireland  and  a  60,000  square foot facility in Boulder, Colorado.  The Irish
facility is being used to service the Company's customer base outside of North
America,  while the Boulder facility is the primary location for the Company's
software  efforts  in the areas of research and development, manufacturing and
quality control.  Additionally, the Company purchased a 59-acre parcel of land
located  in  Longmont,  Colorado, near the Company's current Boulder, Colorado
facility.    Plans  for  infrastructure  and the future development of the new
property  have  not  been  finalized.

The  Company  also  maintains  domestic  sales offices in twenty-two locations
which  include  the  metropolitan  areas  of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver,
Dallas,  Los  Angeles, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Raleigh and San Jose as well
as  nine  international  sales  offices  located  in the metropolitan areas of
London,  Munich,  Paris, Stockholm, Milan, Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul and Hong Kong.

ITEM  3.          LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS

On June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in
the  United  States District Court for the Northern District of California for
infringement  of certain of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera filed
suit  against  the  Company  alleging  that  certain of the Company's products
infringe  certain  Altera  patents.    Fact  and  expert  discovery  have been
completed  in  both cases, which have been consolidated.  In October 1997, the
Court held a hearing with respect to construction of the claims of the various
patents  in  suit.

On  April  20,  1995,  Altera  filed an additional suit against the Company in
Federal  District  Court in Delaware alleging that the Company's XC5200 family
infringes  an  Altera  patent.  The Company answered the Delaware suit denying
that  the  XC5200  family  infringes  the  patent  in  suit, asserting certain
affirmative  defenses  and  counterclaiming  that  the  Altera Max 9000 family
infringes certain of the Company's patents.  The Delaware suit was transferred
to  the  United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
Discovery  has  not  begun.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot be determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has meritorious defenses to such claims and is
defending  them  vigorously, and has not recorded a provision for the ultimate
outcome  of  these  matters  in  its financial statements.  The foregoing is a
forward  looking  statement subject to risks and uncertainties, and the future
outcome  could differ materially due to the uncertain nature of the litigation
with  Altera  and  because  the  lawsuits  are  still  in the pre-trial stage.

There are no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company  is  a  party  or  of  which  any of its property is the subject.  The
Company  knows  of  no  legal  proceedings  contemplated  by  any governmental
authority  or  agency.

ITEM  4.          SUBMISSION  OF  MATTERS  TO  A  VOTE  OF  SECURITY  HOLDERS

No  matters  were  submitted  to  a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter  of  the  fiscal  year  covered  by  this  report.

(In thousands)      1998  Change       1997  Change       1996
- --------------  --------  -------  --------  -------  --------
Revenues        $613,593     8.0%  $568,143     1.3%  $560,802

</TABLE>

The  Company's 8.0% revenue increase in 1998 was primarily attributable to the
revenue  growth of the XC4000X product family, which includes the XC4000EX and
XC4000XL devices, as well as revenue growth from the XC5200 and XC9500 product
families.    The  revenue  growth  from these products was offset by decreased
revenues from the Company's first generation products, including the Company's
XC3000  product  family  and  the  Company's  XC4000  family,  a mature second
generation product line.  New products, which include the XC4000X, Spartan and
XC9500  families,  contributed  nearly  $70  million in revenue in fiscal 1998
compared  to approximately $7 million in fiscal 1997.  Despite the significant
growth  in new product revenues, fiscal 1998 revenues increased only 8.0% over
fiscal  1997  as  revenues  were  impacted  by  an  overall  slowdown  in  the
semiconductor market, increased price competition, inventory reductions at end
customers  and a general economic downturn in the Asia Pacific region.  Fiscal
1997  revenues,  as  compared  to  fiscal 1996, were significantly impacted by
price  competition  as  well as a semiconductor industry inventory correction,
which  reduced  customer  demand.

Revenue  contribution  by  programmable  logic  product  line  reflected a mix
between  increased  customer  demand  for  low  cost,  medium  range  density
programmable  logic  devices  (PLDs)  and  the  functionality  and performance
provided  by  the Company's higher density and higher speed programmable logic
devices.    Revenues  from  proprietary products, for which there is no second
source  competitor,  increased  from  91.0% of aggregate revenues in 1997 to a
record  94.1%  in 1998. Deriving revenues from leading-edge programmable logic
solutions has been emphasized by the Company.  The Company's corporate pricing
strategy  aims  to expand the market for its products by reducing sales prices
proportional  to  cost  reductions  achieved  in  the  manufacturing  of these
products.    The  Company intends to continue to actively pursue a strategy of
broadening  the  markets  it serves through the enhancement of software design
tools,  availability  of  pre-defined  cores  of  logic,  the  introduction of
architectures  offering  new  functionality,  and  the  reduction of IC prices
through  continuous  advancements  in  the  silicon  manufacturing  process.

Revenues  for  the  Company's  first  generation  products,  which include the
XC2000,  XC3000  and  XC3100  families, represented 25.5% of total revenues in
fiscal  1998,  as  compared  to  32.2%  in  fiscal 1997.  The Company's second
generation  products,  including  the  XC4000,  XC4000X  and  XC5200 families,
represented  58.3%  of  total revenues in fiscal 1998, as compared to 53.2% in
fiscal  1997.  Combined revenues from the Company's XC4000 and XC4000X product
lines  represented 49.0% of total revenues in fiscal 1998 compared to 46.5% in
fiscal  1997,  a  dollar  increase  of 13.7% to $300.7 million.  Revenues from
other  programmable  logic  products, which include the XC7000 and XC9500 CPLD
families,  HardWire  and  serial proms, increased from 11.6% to 13.5% of total
revenues  in  fiscal  1998  as  compared  to the prior year, mostly due to the
increased  revenue  from  the  XC9500  family.  Revenue from the XC9500 family
increased  from  $2.3 million in 1997 to $13.9 million in 1998.  No single end
customer  accounted  for more than 5% of revenues in fiscal years 1998 or 1997
or  6%  of  revenues  in  1996.

During  fiscal  1998,  the  Company's  total  PLD unit sales increased 28%, as
compared  to  fiscal 1997.The average selling price for the highest volume PLD
products  decreased over 30% from fiscal 1997 prices while individual products
within  certain  families  experienced price decreases in excess of 50% during
the  year.    The  Company  believes  that price decreases are instrumental in
expanding  market share to the extent that the Company can maintain acceptable
returns.    Price  erosion  has  been common in the semiconductor industry, as
advances  in  both  architecture  and  manufacturing  process  technology have
permitted  continual  reductions in cost.  The Company relies upon introducing
new  products, which incorporate advanced features and other price/performance
factors  such  that  higher  average  selling  prices  and  higher margins are
achievable  despite  the  price  erosion  on  mature  product  lines.

Xilinx's  software  design  tools  are  used  by  the  Company's  customers to
implement  designs  in  the  Company's programmable logic devices.  Cumulative
licenses  for  proprietary software design tools sold to customers through the
end  of  1998 totaled approximately 42,000 units, as compared to approximately
30,000  and  24,000  units  at  the  end  of 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The
increase  in  software  revenue seats resulted primarily from increased demand
for  the  Company's  lower  cost,  easier  to  use  Foundation Series software
introduced  in fiscal 1997.  Software revenues decreased from $17.1 million in
both  fiscal 1996 and 1997 to $16.5 million in fiscal 1998.  Although software
seats  increased,  software  revenue  decreased  3.4% due to the change in the
sales  mix  towards  lower  priced  products  as  well as price reductions for
specific  products.    Software  sales  as  a  percentage  of  total  revenues
represented  approximately  3%  of  revenues  in  all  years  presented.

International  revenues  represented  approximately  38%, 36% and 35% of total
revenues  for  1998,  1997 and 1996, respectively.  International revenues are
derived  from  customers in Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific/Rest of World which
represented  approximately  23%,  10% and 5% of the Company's worldwide sales,
respectively,  in fiscal 1998.  Revenue growth in Europe and Asia Pacific/Rest
of  World  over the past year was 11.9% and 26.6%, respectively. Revenues from
Japan  were  adversely  impacted  by  the  weakening  yen,  as yen denominated
revenues  increased  approximately  16% year-to-year but grew approximately 6%
when  translated  into  US  dollars  at  the  then  prevailing exchange rates.

     GROSS  MARGIN

Gross margin                $382,903    9.8%*  $348,806*   (2.5%)  $357,610 
    Percentage of revenue       62.4%             61.4%*               63.8%

<FN>

* Includes write-off of discontinued product family of $5 million.  Gross
margin as a percentage of revenues was 62.3% excluding this charge.

</TABLE>

The  gross  margin  percentage  remained  consistent from fiscal 1997 to 1998,
excluding  the  impact of a $5.0 million write-off of the discontinued product
family, as the selling price reductions were offset by the favorable impact of
lower  wafer  prices  from  wafer  suppliers, manufacturing process technology
improvements,  the  impact of the strengthened US dollar exchange rate against
the  yen,  and  improved  yields.    The increase in the cost of revenues as a
percentage  of revenues in 1997 as compared to 1996 was primarily attributable
to  selling  price  reductions and increased inventory reserves relating to an
expanded level of inventory, partially offset by the favorable impact of lower
wafer  costs  and improved yields.  Over the past three years, Xilinx has also
been  able  to  offset much of the erosion in gross margin percentages on more
mature  integrated  circuits  with  increased  volumes  of newer, proprietary,
higher  margin  products,  although no assurance can be given that the Company
will  do  so  in  the  future.    The  Company  recognizes  that ongoing price
reductions  for its integrated circuits are a significant element in expanding
the  market  for  its products.  Company management believes that gross margin
objectives  in  the  range  of  60%  to  62%  of  revenues are consistent with
expanding  market share while realizing acceptable returns, although there can
be  no  assurance  that  future  gross  margins  will  be  in  this  range.

During  fiscal  1997,  the  Company discontinued the XC8100 family of one-time
programmable  antifuse  devices.    As a result, the Company recorded a pretax
charge against earnings of $5.0 million.  This charge primarily related to the
write-off  of  inventory  and  for  termination  charges  related  to purchase
commitments  to  foundry  partners  for  work-in-process  wafers which had not
completed  the  manufacturing  process.

     RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

Research and development    $80,456     13.2%  $71,075     10.0%  $64,600 
    Percentage of revenue      13.1%              12.5%              11.5%

</TABLE>

The  Company  continued  to  increase  the  amount  spent  on  research  and
development,  as it has done in each year of its fourteen-year history. During
fiscal  1998,  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily
attributable  to  the increased costs associated with designing and developing
new  product  architectures  of  complex,  high  density  devices  as  well as
labor-related  expenses.    The  increase in research and development expenses
from fiscal 1996 to 1997 was primarily attributable to increased headcount and
labor  expenses,  increased  purchases  of  engineering  wafers  and increased
facility  and  support  costs associated with an expanded scope of operations.
The  Company  remains  committed  to  a  significant  level  of  research  and
development  effort  in  order  to  continue  to  compete  aggressively in the
programmable  logic  marketplace.    Through  March  31, 1998, the Company has
received  more  than  200 US patents and maintains an active program of filing
for  additional  patents in the areas of software, IC architecture and design.
As  of  March  31,  1998,  research  and  development  personnel  were  split
approximately  45%  for software development and 55% for IC design and process
development.   Xilinx has not capitalized any of the costs associated with its
software  development.

     MARKETING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE

<TABLE>

    Percentage of revenue       21.0%               20.9%               19.2%

</TABLE>

The  8.4% increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses in fiscal
1998 was primarily attributable to increases in headcount and related employee
expenses  and  to  a  lessor  extent an increase in legal expenses.  Sales and
support  expenses  have  increased  each  year due to increasing personnel and
labor  costs  and greater commission expenses associated with higher revenues.
Sales and support expenses increased in fiscal 1997 over 1996 due to increased
personnel  and  labor  costs  and  increased commissions due to changes in the
revenue  channel  mix.    The  Company  remains  committed  to  controlling
administrative expenses.  However, the timing and extent of future legal costs
associated with the ongoing enforcement of the Company's intellectual property
rights are not readily predictable and may significantly increase the level of
general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  future.

     NON-RECURRING  CHARGES

During  fiscal  1996,  the  Company  incurred  a  $19.4  million non-recurring
write-off of in-process technology relating to the acquisition of NeoCAD, Inc.
See  Note  3  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.

</TABLE>

The  decrease  in  operating  income  as a percentage of revenues in 1998 from
1997, before consideration of the write-off, is primarily a result of the 8.0%
revenue  growth  in  1998  in  comparison  to a 13.2% increase year-to-year in
research  and development spending, and an 8.4% increase in marketing, general
and  administrative spending.  The decrease in operating income in fiscal 1997
from  1996  was  primarily  a  result  of  the  1.3% revenue growth in 1997 in
comparison  to  10%  increases  year-to-year  in both research and development
spending and marketing, general and administrative spending.  Operating income
as a percentage of revenues could be adversely impacted in future years by the
factors  discussed  throughout  this  document,  particularly  those  noted in
"Factors  Affecting  Future  Operating  Results".

</TABLE>

The  Company  earns  interest income on its cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments  and  restricted  investments.  The amount of interest earned is a
function of the balance of cash invested as well as prevailing interest rates.
The  Company  incurs  interest  expense on the $250 million 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated  notes  issued  in  November  1995.    The  Company's  investment
portfolio  contains  tax-advantaged  municipal  securities,  which have pretax
yields  that  are  less than the interest rate on the convertible subordinated
notes.   For financial reporting purposes, the Company effectively records the
difference  between  the  pretax  and  tax-equivalent yields as a reduction in
provision  for  taxes  on  income.

Interest  and  other  income  for  1998 remained consistent with the amount in
1997.    In  1998,  average  cash and investment balances and average interest
rates  remained fairly consistent with the prior year, resulting in comparable
net  interest  and  other  income  over  both years.  The increase in interest
income in fiscal 1997 over the prior year was primarily attributable to higher
investment portfolio balances and joint venture equity income.  As a result of
the  difference  in  interest income and expense yields and future uses of the
Company's  investment portfolio, levels of net interest and other income could
decrease  in  the  future.

<FN>

 * Includes  non-recurring  write-off  of in-process technology relating to the
acquisition  of  NeoCAD.  Excluding the write-off of in-process technology, in
fiscal  1996  the  Company's  effective  tax  rate  was  36.5%.

</TABLE>

The  tax  rate  for fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997, as well as the tax
rate  for  fiscal  1997  as compared to fiscal 1996, was favorably impacted by
legislation  reinstating  the  R&D  Tax Credit as well as increased profits in
foreign  operations  where  the  tax  rate  is  lower  that  the  US  rate.

     JOINT  VENTURE  EQUITY  INCOME

The Company records its 25% proportional ownership of the net income of United
Silicon  Inc.  (USIC), a wafer fabrication joint venture located in Taiwan, as
joint  venture  equity  income.    To  date,  USIC's  net  income has resulted
primarily  from  favorable foreign currency exchange gains as well as interest
earned on its investment portfolio. Through the second quarter of fiscal 1998,
equity  income  was  immaterial and remains classified in "Interest income and
other".   The Company expects to incur joint venture equity losses during most
of  fiscal  1999  as  the  USIC  wafer  fabrication facility begins to ramp up
production.   Many of the expenses associated with full foundry operation will
be incurred in the early stages of limited production, and the Company expects
that  profitability  of  the joint venture will occur, if at all, only after a
sufficient  volume  of  wafer  production  is  obtained.

     INFLATION

To  date,  the  effects of inflation upon the Company's financial results have
not  been  significant.

FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The  Company's  financial  condition at March 31, 1998 remained strong.  Total
current  assets  exceeded  total current liabilities by 4.8 times, compared to
6.2  times  at  March  31,  1997.  Since its inception, the Company has used a
combination  of  equity  and  debt  financing and cash flow from operations to
support  on-going  business  activities,  make acquisitions and investments in
complementary  technologies,  obtain  facilities  and  capital  equipment  and
finance  inventory  and  accounts  receivable.

     CASH,  CASH  EQUIVALENTS  AND  SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS

Xilinx's  cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $63.7
million  in  1998 as cash was used to fund investing and financing activities.
Cash,  cash  equivalents and short-term investments represented 38.5% of total
assets  at  March 31, 1998.  The Company generated cash flow of $218.4 million
from  operating  activities in 1998, offset by $200.8 million of cash used for
investing  activities  and  $66.6  million  used  in  financing  activities.
Investing  activities  during  fiscal 1998 included expenditures for property,
plant  and equipment together with a deposit for a facility under construction
on  the  San Jose corporate campus, an additional investment in the USIC joint
venture  and  additional  advances  to  Seiko  Epson  for  wafer  purchases.
Investment  proceeds  were  received  from  the  net  maturity  of  short-term
investments.    Financing  activities  during  1998  included $93.8 million to
acquire  treasury  stock  offset  by  $27.2  million in proceeds from sales of
common  stock  under  employee  option  and  stock  purchase  plans.

     RECEIVABLES

Receivables  decreased  15.7%  from  $72.2 million at the end of 1997 to $60.9
million at the end of 1998.  In addition, days sales outstanding at the end of
each  year  decreased from 43 days in 1997 to 36 days in 1998.  In fiscal 1998
receivables  decreased as the Company increased collection efforts relating to
international  sales  as  well as increased allowances for pricing adjustments
and  customer  returns.

     INVENTORIES

Inventories  decreased 11.3% from $62.4 million at March 1997 to $55.3 million
at  March  1998.    Inventory  levels  at  March 31, 1998 represent 86 days of
inventory,  which  is  in  line with the Company's objective of 70 to 90 days,
compared  to  96  days  at  March 31, 1997.  Inventory levels decreased during
fiscal  1998  as  both  architecture  and  manufacturing  process  technology
improvements  have  permitted  continued  cost reductions as well as continued
improvement  of  inventory  management.    The  Company  seeks  to balance two
contradictory  objectives  with  regard  to  inventory management.  On the one
hand, the Company believes that its standard, off-the-shelf products should be
available  for  prompt  shipment  to  customers.   Accordingly, it attempts to
maintain  sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed
configurations  to  meet  estimates of customer demand.  At the same time, the
Company also wishes to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining
higher  inventory  levels  and  to  realize  fully  the opportunities for cost
reductions  associated  with  architecture  and  manufacturing  process
advancements.  The Company continually strives to balance these two objectives
so  as  to  provide  excellent  customer  response  at  a  competitive  cost.

     ADVANCES  FOR  WAFER  PURCHASES

In  fiscal  1997,  the Company signed an agreement with Seiko Epson, a primary
wafer  supplier.    This agreement was amended in fiscal 1998 and now provides
for  an  advance  to  Seiko  Epson of $150.0 million.  In conjunction with the
agreement,  $60.0  million  was  paid  in  fiscal 1997 and an additional $90.0
million  was paid in fiscal 1998.  Repayment of this advance is in the form of
wafer  deliveries,  which  began  during  the  fourth  quarter of fiscal 1998.
Specific wafer pricing is based upon the prices of similar wafers manufactured
by  other,  specifically  identified,  leading-edge  foundry  suppliers.   The
advance payment provision also provides for interest to be paid to the Company
in  the  form  of  free  wafers.

     PROPERTY,  PLANT  AND  EQUIPMENT

During  1998,  Xilinx  invested  $29.7  million  in property and equipment, as
compared to $26.8 million in 1997.  During 1998, the Company purchased land in
Longmont,  Colorado  for  approximately  $7 million and continued to invest in
software  development  tools  and semiconductor design, test and manufacturing
equipment  at  each  of  its  manufacturing  locations.

     CURRENT  LIABILITIES

Current  liabilities  increased  from  $97.3  million in fiscal 1997 to $125.7
million  at  the  end  of 1998.  The increase was primarily attributable to an
increase  in  deferred  income  on  shipments to distributors due to increased
sales  through  distribution  as  well  as  distributor demand for new product
lines.

     LONG-TERM  DEBT  AND  LINES  OF  CREDIT

In  November 1995, the Company issued $250 million in convertible subordinated
notes. The Company has credit line facilities for up to $46.2 million of which
$6.2  million  is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements for
the  Company's Ireland manufacturing facility.  At March 31, 1998 and 1997, no
borrowings were outstanding under the lines of credit.  See Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.

     STOCKHOLDERS'  EQUITY

Stockholders' equity grew by 12.1% in 1998 to $550.2 million.  The increase of
$59.5  million  was primarily attributable to $126.6 million in net income and
$43.3 million related to the issuance of common stock and the tax benefit from
stock  options, partially offset by the $93.8 million used to acquire treasury
stock.  Subsequent to March 31, 1998, the Company began an additional treasury
stock  program  to purchase up to approximately 3 million shares as market and
business  conditions  warrant.   Stockholders' equity as a percentage of total
assets  was  58.5%  for  1998  and  57.9%  for  1997.

     COMMITMENTS

The  Company invested an additional $67.4 million in the USIC joint venture in
fiscal 1998 to bring the total investment in USIC at the end of fiscal 1998 to
$101.7  million.    The Company currently holds a 25% equity ownership in USIC
and  the  right  to  receive  31.25% of the wafer capacity from this facility.
Under  the  terms  of the agreement entered into between the Company and USIC,
the  Company  may  be  required to make a third equity installment of up to an
additional $30.0 million in the joint venture during fiscal 1999, if warranted
based  on  the  capital  and  operational  requirements  of the joint venture.
United  Microelectronics  Corporation  (UMC) has committed to and is supplying
the Company with wafers manufactured in an existing facility until capacity is
available  in the USIC facility. The Company is accounting for this investment
using  the equity method.  See further discussion in Notes 4 and 6 of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  As  the  US  dollar  increased  in value
relative to the New Taiwan dollar during fiscal 1998, adjustments were made to
the  carrying  value  of the investment of approximately $17 million since its
inception.    Offsetting  amounts  were recorded to the cumulative translation
adjustment  account  within  stockholders'  equity.

     EMPLOYEES

During  1998, Xilinx experienced a 9% increase in the number of its employees.
The Company had 1,391 employees at the end of fiscal 1998 as compared to 1,277
at  the  end  of  the  prior  year.


The  Company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from
operations  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy the Company's cash needs for the
foreseeable  future.   The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities for
investments  to  obtain  additional  wafer  supply  capacity,  procurement  of
additional  capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and
potential  acquisitions  of  businesses,  products  or technologies that would
complement  the  Company's  businesses  and  may  use  available cash or other
sources  of  funding  for  such  purposes.

FACTORS  AFFECTING  FUTURE  OPERATING  RESULTS

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical market patterns characterized by
diminished  product  demand, limited visibility to demand for products further
out  than  three to nine months, accelerated erosion of average selling prices
and  overcapacity.  The Company's results of operations are affected by a wide
variety of factors, including general economic conditions, conditions relating
to  technology  companies,  conditions specific to the semiconductor industry,
decreases  in  average selling prices over the life of any particular product,
the  timing  of new product introductions (by the Company, its competitors and
others),  the  ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product
in  a  timely  manner,  the  timely  implementation  of  new  manufacturing
technologies,  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from
competitors,  and the impact of new technologies resulting in rapid escalation
of demand for some products in the face of equally steep decline in demand for
others.  Market demand for the Company's products, particularly for those most
recently  introduced,  can  be  difficult  to  predict, especially in light of
customers'  demands  to  shorten  product  lead  times  and minimize inventory
levels.    Unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if the
Company  were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in
a  given  quarter.  In  addition,  any  difficulty in achieving targeted wafer
production yields could adversely impact the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations.    The Company attempts to identify changes in market
conditions  as  soon  as  possible;  however,  the dynamics of the market make
prediction  of  and  timely  reaction  to  such  events difficult.  Due to the
foregoing  and  other factors, past results, including those described in this
report,  are  much  less reliable predictors of the future than is the case in
many  older,  more  stable  and less dynamic industries.  Based on the factors
noted  herein,  the  Company  may  experience  substantial  period-to-period
fluctuations  in  future  operating  results.

The Company's future success depends in large part on the continued service of
its  key  technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel and on its
ability  to  continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly
important  are  those  highly  skilled  design,  process,  software  and  test
engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development
of new products and processes.  The competition for such personnel is intense,
and  the  loss  of  key  employees could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

Sales and operations outside of the United States subject the Company to risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.    The  Company's  financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in
which it does significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates  affecting  those  countries.    Specifically, the Company has sales and
operations  in  the  Asian  markets.    The  recent  instability  in the Asian
financial  markets  has adversely impacted sales and may continue to adversely
impact  sales  in  those  markets in several ways, including reduced access to
sources  of  capital  needed  by  customers  to  make  purchases and increased
exchange  rate  differentials that may adversely effect the customer's ability
to  purchase  or  the  Company's  ability  to  sell at competitive prices.  In
addition, the instability may increase credit risks as the recent weakening of
certain  Asian  currencies  may  impair  customers'  ability to repay existing
obligations.    Depending  on the situation in Asia in coming quarters, any or
all  of these factors could adversely impact the Company's financial condition
and  results  of  operations  in  the  near  future.

Additionally,  risks  include  government  regulation  of exports, tariffs and
other  potential  trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual property
rights  in some countries, and generally longer receivable collection periods.
The  Company's  business  is  also  subject  to  the risks associated with the
imposition  of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import
or  export  of  semiconductor  products.    The Company cannot predict whether
quotas,  duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the
United  States  or  other countries upon the importation or exportation of the
Company's  products  in  the future or what, if any, effect such actions would
have  on  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

In  order  to expand international sales and service, the Company will need to
maintain  and  expand  existing  foreign  operations  or establish new foreign
operations.    This  entails  hiring  additional  personnel and maintaining or
expanding  existing  relationships  with  international distributors and sales
representatives.    This  will  require  significant  management attention and
financial  resources  and  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.    There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign
operations,  in  its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts
to  maintain  or  expand  its relationships with international distributors or
sales  representatives.

Many  of  the  Company's operations are centered in an area of California that
has been seismically active.  Should there be a major earthquake in this area,
the  Company's  operations  may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the
Company to manufacture or ship products in a timely manner, thereby materially
adversely  affecting  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.

In  addition,  the  securities  of  many  high  technology  companies  have
historically  been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may
adversely  affect  the  market  price  of  the  Company's  common  stock.

     DEPENDENCE  UPON  INDEPENDENT  MANUFACTURERS  AND  SUBCONTRACTORS

The Company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products.  During the
past  two  years, most of the Company's wafers have been manufactured by Seiko
Epson  Corporation (Seiko Epson) and UMC.  The Company has depended upon these
suppliers  and  others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost
attributes,  including  transitioning  to  advanced  manufacturing  process
technologies,  producing  wafers  at acceptable yields, and delivering them to
the  Company  in  a timely manner.  While the timeliness, yield and quality of
wafer  deliveries have met the Company's requirements to date, there can be no
assurance  that  the  Company's  wafer  suppliers  will  not experience future
manufacturing  problems,  including  delays  in  the  realization  of advanced
manufacturing process technologies.  Additionally, disruption of operations at
these  foundries  for any reason, including natural disasters such as fires or
earthquakes  as  well as disrupted access to adequate supplies of electricity,
natural  gas  or  water  would  cause  delays  in  shipments  of the Company's
products, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations.    The  Company  is  also  dependent  on subcontractors to provide
semiconductor  assembly services.  Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or
assembly  services  with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate
yields  or  timely  deliveries from these manufacturers and subcontractors, or
any  other  circumstance  that  would  require the Company to seek alternative
sources  of  supply, could delay shipments, and have a material adverse effect
on  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

The  Company's  growth  will  depend in large part on the Company's ability to
obtain  increased  wafer  fabrication  capacity  and  assembly  services  from
suppliers  which  are  cost  effective.    In order to secure additional wafer
capacity,  the  Company  from  time to time considers alternatives, including,
without  limitation,  equity  investments  in,  or  loans,  deposits, or other
financial commitments to, independent wafer manufacturers to secure production
capacity,  or  the  use  of  contracts  which  commit  the Company to purchase
specified quantities of wafers over extended periods.  Although the Company is
currently  able  to  obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner,
the  Company  has  at  times  been unable, and may in the future be unable, to
fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints, including the
ability  of  suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services in
satisfaction of customer delivery dates, as well as the ability of the Company
to  process  products  for  shipment.   In addition, a significant increase in
general  industry  demand  or  any  interruption  of  supply  could reduce the
Company's  supply  of  wafers  or  increase the Company's cost of such wafers.
Such  events  could  have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

     LITIGATION

The  Company is currently engaged in patent litigation with Altera Corporation
(Altera).    See  Note  11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined  at  this  time.
Management  believes  that  it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted
against  it  and  is  defending  them  vigorously.  The foregoing is a forward
looking  statement  subject to risks and uncertainties, and the future outcome
could  differ  materially  due  to the uncertain nature of the litigation with
Altera  and  because  the  lawsuits  are  still  in  the  pre-trial  stage.

     DEPENDENCE  ON  NEW  PRODUCTS

The  Company's  future success depends in large part on its ability to develop
and  introduce  on  a  timely  basis  new  products  which  address  customer
requirements  and compete effectively on the basis of price, functionality and
performance.    The  success  of  new  product introductions is dependent upon
several  factors,  including  timely  completion  of  new product designs, the
ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies, achievement of
acceptable  yields,  availability  of  supporting  software  design  tools,
utilization  of predefined cores of logic and market acceptance.  No assurance
can be given that the Company's product development efforts will be successful
or that its new products will achieve market acceptance.  Revenues relating to
some  of  the Company's mature products are expected to continue to decline in
the  future  as a percentage of total revenues.  As a result, the Company will
be  increasingly  dependent  on  revenues  derived  from  newer  products.  In
addition,  the  average  selling  price  for  any  particular product tends to
decrease  rapidly  over  the  product's  life.   To offset such decreases, the
Company  relies  primarily  on  obtaining yield improvements and corresponding
cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new
products  which  incorporate  advanced  features  and  other price/performance
factors  such  that  higher  average  selling  prices  and  higher margins are
achievable  relative  to  mature  product lines.  To the extent that such cost
reductions  and  new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or
the  Company's products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher
margins,  the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be
materially  adversely  affected.

     COMPETITION

The  Company's field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable
logic  devices  (CPLDs)  compete in the programmable logic marketplace, with a
substantial  majority  of the Company's revenues derived from its FPGA product
families.    The  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are intensely
competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, rapid product
obsolescence  and continuous price erosion.  The Company expects significantly
increased  competition  both  from  existing  competitors and from a number of
companies  that  may  enter  its  market.

Xilinx  believes  that important competitive factors in the programmable logic
market  include  price,  product  performance and reliability, adaptability of
products  to  specific applications, ease of use and functionality of software
design  tools,  functionality  of predefined cores of logic and the ability to
provide  timely  customer  service  and  support.   The Company's strategy for
expansion  in the programmable logic market includes continued introduction of
new  product architectures which address high volume, low cost applications as
well  as  high  performance,  leading  edge density applications and continued
price  reductions  proportionate  with  the  ability  to  lower  the  cost  of
manufacture for established products.  However, there can be no assurance that
the  Company  will  be  successful  in  achieving  these  strategies.

The  Company's major sources of competition are comprised of several elements:
the  manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers of high density
programmable  logic  products  characterized  by  FPGA-type  architectures,
providers  of high speed, low density CPLDs devices and other providers of new
or  emerging  programmable  logic  products.  The Company competes with custom
gate  array  manufacturers  on  the  basis  of  lower  design  costs,  shorter
development  schedules and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of
custom  gate  arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in
high  volumes.    The  Company  continues  to develop lower cost architectures
intended  to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs
(in  high  volumes)  and PLD production costs.  The Company competes with high
density  programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance, the ability
to  deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers, voltage and customer support,
taking  advantage  of  the  primary  characteristics  of  flexible, high speed
implementation  and  quick  time-to-market  capabilities  of the Company's PLD
product  offerings.    Competition  among CPLD suppliers is based primarily on
price,  performance,  design,  software  utility  and  the  ability to deliver
complete  solutions  to  customers.    In  addition, the Company competes with
manufacturers  of  new or emerging programmable logic products on the basis of
price,  performance,  customer  support,  software  utility and the ability to
deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers.  Some of the Company's current or
potential  competitors  have  substantially  greater financial, manufacturing,
marketing  and  technical  resources  than  Xilinx.    To the extent that such
efforts  to  compete are not successful, the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

     INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY

The  Company  relies upon patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to
protect  its  intellectual  property.    There  can  be no assurance that such
intellectual  property  rights  can  be successfully asserted in the future or
will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  From time to time, third
parties, including competitors of the Company, have asserted patent, copyright
and  other  intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to
the  Company.    There  can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement  claims  against  the  Company  in the future, that assertions by
third  parties  will not result in costly litigation or that the Company would
prevail  in  such  litigation  or  be  able to license any valid and infringed
patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially reasonable terms.  Litigation,
regardless  of  its outcome, could result in substantial cost and diversion of
resources  of the Company.  Any infringement claim or other litigation against
or  by  the  Company could materially adversely affect the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

     YEAR  2000  COMPLIANCE

As  is the case with most other companies using computers in their operations,
the  Company  is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year
2000  on  the  processing  of  date-sensitive  information  by  the  Company's
computerized  information  systems,  as  well  as  the  vendor  and  customer
date-sensitive  computerized  information  electronically  transferred  to the
Company.  The year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written
using two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable year.  Any of the
Company's  systems  that  have  time-sensitive software may recognize the year
"00" as 1900 rather than the year 2000, which could result in miscalculations,
classification  errors  or system failures.  Based on preliminary information,
costs  of  addressing  potential problems are not currently expected to have a
material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position, results of
operations  or  cash  flows  in  future periods.  However, if the Company, its
customers  or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues on a timely
basis,  the  Company's  financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely  affected.    Accordingly, the Company plans to devote the necessary
resources  to  resolve  all  significant  year 2000 issues in a timely manner.

     MARKET  RATE  RISKS

Interest  Rate  Risk  -  The  Company's exposure to interest rate risk relates
primarily  to  the  Company's  investment  portfolio  and  long-term  debt
obligations.    See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
Company's  primary  aim  with  its investment portfolio is to invest available
cash  while  preserving  principal and meeting liquidity needs.  The portfolio
includes tax-advantaged municipal bonds, tax-advantaged auction rate preferred
municipal  bonds,  corporate bonds, and US Treasury securities.  In accordance
with the Company's investment policy, the Company places investments with high
credit  quality  issuers  and  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer.   These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease
in  value  if  market  interest rates increase.  All securities have remaining
maturities  less  than  one year as of the balance sheet date, and the Company
believes  it  has  the  ability  to  hold  its  investments  until  maturity.
Therefore,  the  Company  does  not  expect  to recognize an adverse impact on
income  or  cash  flows,  although  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  this.

The  Company  is  also  subject  to  interest rate risk related to outstanding
long-term  debt.    If long-term market interest rates decrease, the effective
cost  of the debt will increase. In order to mitigate the interest rate risks,
the  long-term debt fixed interest rate liability has been matched against the
Company's  short-term  variable  interest  rate  assets  through  a  liability
interest  rate  swap  agreement.  The liability swap exchanges one half of the
underlying  debt  amount  based  on  a fixed interest rate for the same amount
based  on  variable  interest  rates.  If interest rates rise by 10%, the cash
flow impact of the swap would continue to be immaterial and would be offset by
the  increase  in  short-term  investment  interest  rates.  This contract was
entered  into  for a two and a half-year period and will end in November 1998.
As the long-term debt may be outstanding until November 2002, the Company will
continue  to  evaluate  its  strategy  related  to  the  fixed  rate  debt.

The  table  below  summarizes the Company's investment, debt and interest rate
swap  notional  amounts  as  of  March  31,  1998  as well as weighted average
interest  rates  by  year  of maturity for the next four years and thereafter.
The  fair  value  as  of  March  31,  1998  is  also  shown.

</TABLE>


Foreign  currency  risk - Through fiscal year 1998, the Company's purchases of
processed silicon wafers from Japanese foundries have been denominated in yen.
To  help  offset  the  Company's exposure for yen denominated liabilities, the
Company's  sales  to  Japanese  customers  through  fiscal 1998 have also been
denominated  in  yen.  The Company has periodically hedged its net exposure to
fluctuations in the yen-to-US dollar exchange rates through the use of forward
exchange  or option contracts.  However, beginning in fiscal 1999, most wafers
purchased  from  Japanese  suppliers  will  be denominated in US dollars.  The
Company  also  intends  to  begin  invoicing  Japanese customers in US dollars
during  the  second half of fiscal 1999.  For a period of time, wafers will be
purchased  in  US dollars and invoicing to Japanese customers will continue to
be in yen, resulting in a yen exposure.  However, after invoicing begins in US
dollars,  the  Company  believes  that  its  net  yen  exposure  relating  to
fluctuations  in  the  yen-to-US dollar exchange rate should decline, although
there  can  be  no  assurance  that  this  will be the case.  As a result, the
Company plans to adjust its future hedging strategy.  In addition, the Company
entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in fiscal 1997 to minimize the
impact  of future exchange fluctuations relating to its fiscal 1998 investment
in  the  USIC  joint venture, which was denominated in New Taiwan dollars.  No
currency  forward  or  option contracts were outstanding as of March 31, 1998.

The  Company  has  several  subsidiaries  and an equity investment in the USIC
joint venture whose financial statements are recorded in currencies other than
the  US dollar.  As these foreign currency financial statements are translated
at each month end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between
the foreign currency and the US dollar increase or decrease the value of those
investments.  If permanent changes occur in exchange rates after an investment
is  made, the investment's value will increase or decrease accordingly.  These
fluctuations  are  recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity as
cumulative  translation  adjustments.    To  date,  the USIC joint venture has
recorded  approximately  $17 million as cumulative translation adjustments, as
the  New Taiwan dollar has decreased in value against the US dollar.  Also, as
the  Company's  subsidiaries  and  the USIC joint venture maintain investments
denominated  in  other  than local currencies, exchange rate fluctuations will
occur.   USIC's net income to date has resulted largely from favorable foreign
currency  exchange  gains  on  its  US  dollar  denominated  investments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Xilinx  designs,  develops  and markets complete programmable logic solutions,
including  advanced  integrated  circuits,  software  design tools, predefined
system  functions  delivered  as cores of logic and field engineering support.
The  wafers  used  to  manufacture  the  Company's  products are obtained from
independent  wafer  manufacturers, located primarily in Japan and Taiwan.  The
Company is dependent upon these manufacturers to produce and deliver wafers on
a  timely  basis.  The Company is also dependent on subcontractors, located in
the  Asia  Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly services.  Xilinx
is  a  global  company  with manufacturing facilities in the United States and
Ireland and sales offices throughout the world.  The Company derives more than
one-third  of  its  revenues from international sales, primarily in Europe and
Japan.

NOTE  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

     Basis  of  presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  after  elimination  of  all
intercompany accounts and transactions.  The Company's fiscal year ends on the
Saturday  nearest  March  31.    For  ease  of presentation, March 31 has been
utilized as the fiscal year-end for all financial statement captions.  Certain
amounts  from  the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current
year  presentation.    Reclassifications  had no effect on previously reported
statements  of  financial  position  or  results  of  operations.

     Cash  equivalents  and  investments

Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  deposit  with  banks,
tax-advantaged  municipal  bonds,  and investments in money market instruments
with  insignificant  interest  rate  risk  and  original maturities at date of
acquisition  of  90  days  or  less.    Short-term  investments  consist  of
tax-advantaged  municipal  bonds,  tax-advantaged  auction  rate  preferred
municipal  bonds  and corporate bonds with maturities greater than 90 days but
less  than  one  year  from  the  balance  sheet date.  Restricted investments
consist  of  US  Treasury Securities held as collateral relating to leases for
the  Company's  facilities.    See  Note  6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.    The  Company  invests its cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments  through  various banks and investment banking institutions.  This
diversification  of  risk  is  consistent  with  Company  policy  to  maintain
liquidity  and  ensure  the  safety  of  principal.

Management classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at
the  time  of  purchase  and  re-evaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet  date, although classification is generally not changed.  Securities are
classified  as  held-to-maturity  when the Company has the positive intent and
the  ability  to  hold  the  securities  until  maturity.    Held-to-maturity
securities  are  carried  at  cost  adjusted  for amortization of premiums and
accretion  of  discounts  to  maturity.    Such  amortization,  as well as any
interest  on  the  securities, is included in interest income.  Securities not
classified  as  held-to-maturity  are  classified  as  available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale  securities  are  carried at fair value with the unrealized
gains or losses, net of tax, included as a separate component of stockholders'
equity.    Realized  gains  and  losses  and  declines  in  value judged to be
other-than-temporary  on  available-for-sale  securities are included in other
income.    The fair values for marketable debt and equity securities are based
on  quoted  market prices.  The cost of securities matured or sold is based on
the  specific  identification  method.

     Inventories

Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market
(estimated  net  realizable value) and are comprised of the following at March
31,  1998  and  1997:

     Advances  for  wafer  purchases

In  fiscal  1997,  the Company signed an agreement with Seiko Epson, a primary
wafer  supplier.    This agreement was amended in fiscal 1998 and now provides
for  an  advance  to  Seiko  Epson of $150.0 million.  In conjunction with the
agreement,  $60.0  million  was  paid  in  fiscal 1997 and an additional $90.0
million  was paid in fiscal 1998.  Repayment of this advance is in the form of
wafer  deliveries,  which  began  during  the  fourth  quarter of fiscal 1998.
Specific  wafer  pricing  is  in  US  dollars  and is based upon the prices of
similar  wafers  manufactured  by other, specifically identified, leading-edge
foundry  suppliers.   The advance payment provision also provides for interest
to  be  paid  to  the  Company  in  the  form  of  free  wafers.

     Property,  Plant  and  Equipment

Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation for financial
reporting  purposes  is  computed  using  the  straight-line  method  over the
estimated  useful  lives  of  the assets of three to five years for machinery,
equipment,  furniture  and  fixtures  and  up  to  thirty years for buildings.

     Revenue  Recognition

Net revenues are stated net of discounts and allowances.  Revenue from product
sales  direct  to  customers  and foreign distributors is generally recognized
upon shipment.  However, the Company defers the recognition of revenue and the
related  cost  of  revenue  on  shipments  to  domestic distributors that have
certain  rights  of  return  and price protection privileges on unsold product
until  the  distributor  sells  the  product.

     Foreign  currency  translation

The  US  dollar  is  the  functional  currency  for  the  Company's  Ireland
manufacturing  facility.    Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in
the  functional  currency  are  remeasured  into US dollars, and the resulting
gains  or  losses  are included in net income.  The functional currency is the
local  currency  for  each of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries and the
USIC  joint  venture.    Assets  and  liabilities  are translated at month-end
exchange  rates,  and  statements  of operations are translated at the average
exchange  rates  during  the  year.    Exchange  gains  or losses arising from
translation  of  foreign  currency  denominated  assets  and  liabilities  are
included  as  a  component  of  stockholders'  equity.

     Derivative  financial  instruments

As  part of its ongoing asset and liability management activities, the Company
periodically  enters  into certain derivative financial arrangements to reduce
financial market risks.  These instruments are used to hedge foreign currency,
equity  and  interest  rate  market  exposures  of  underlying  assets  and
liabilities.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments
for  trading  purposes.

The  Company  periodically enters into currency forward or option contracts to
minimize  foreign exchange risk relating to the Company's wafer purchases that
are  denominated  in  yen.   These contracts are accounted for as identifiable
hedges  against wafer purchases.  Realized gains or losses are recognized upon
maturity of the contracts and are included in cost of sales.  The Company also
periodically  enters  into  foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the
impact  of  future exchange fluctuations in foreign currency firm commitments.
A  forward  foreign  exchange  contract  obligates  the  Company  to  exchange
predetermined  amounts  of  specified foreign currencies at specified exchange
rates  on  specified dates or to make an equivalent US dollar payment equal to
the value of such exchange.  These contracts are accounted for as hedges of an
identifiable  foreign  currency  commitment.    Realized  gains  or losses are
recognized  upon  maturity of the contracts and offset the underlying asset or
liability.

The  Company  has  entered  into  an  interest rate swap agreement in order to
mitigate  the  interest  rate  risks whereby the long-term debt fixed interest
rate  liability  is matched against the Company's short-term variable interest
rate assets.  The liability interest rate swap agreement involves the exchange
of  fixed  interest rate payments for variable interest rate payments over the
life  of  the  agreement  without  an  exchange  of  the notional amount.  The
differential  to  be paid or received as the variable interest rate changes is
accrued  and  recognized  as interest expense.  The related amounts payable or
receivable  from  the  third party is included in other liabilities or assets.
The fair value of the swap agreement and changes in the fair value as a result
of  changes in market interest rates are not material.  See Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.

     Employee  stock  plans

The Company accounts for its stock option and employee stock purchase plans in
accordance with provisions of the Accounting Principles Board's Opinion No. 25
(APB 25), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  In addition the Company
discloses  pro  forma  information  related  to  its  stock plans according to
Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  Statement  No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation"  (FASB  123).   See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements.

     Use  of  estimates

The  preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting  principles  requires  management to make estimates and assumptions
that  affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements and the
reported  amounts  of  net  revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Such  estimates  relate  to  the  useful  lives of fixed assets and intangible
assets,  allowances  for  doubtful  accounts,  pricing  adjustments,  customer
returns, inventory reserves, potential reserves relating to litigation matters
as  well  as other accruals or reserves.  Actual results may differ from those
estimates,  and  such differences may be material to the financial statements.

     New  Accounting  Pronouncements

In  June  1997,  the  Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 130 (FASB 130), "Reporting Comprehensive
Income".  FASB  130  establishes standards for the reporting and disclosure of
comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in  a full set of general-purpose
financial statements.  Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity
(net  assets)  during  the  period  from  non-owner  sources.   The Company is
required  to  adopt  FASB  130  in  fiscal 1999. Reclassification of financial
statements  for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required.
The  adoption  of  FASB  130 will have no impact on the Company's consolidated
results  of  operations,  financial  position  or  cash  flows.

Also  in  June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  131  (FASB 131), "Disclosures about
Segments  of an Enterprise and Related Information". FASB 131 revises previous
standards  related  to  the  way  public  companies  report  information about
operating  segments  in  annual  financial  statements and requires that those
companies  report  selected  information  about  operating segments in interim
financial  reports  issued to shareholders.  It also establishes standards for
related  disclosures  about products and services, geographic areas, and major
customers.    The  Company  is required to adopt FASB 131 in fiscal 1999.  The
adoption of FASB 131 will have no impact on the Company's consolidated results
of  operations,  financial  position  or  cash  flows.

     Concentrations  of  credit  risk

The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade
receivables  with  respect  to the high-technology industry with the Company's
credit  evaluation  process,  relatively  short  collection terms, distributor
agreements,  sales  among  various  end-user  applications  throughout  the
high-technology  market and the geographical dispersion of sales.  The Company
generally  does  not  require  collateral.    Bad  debt  write-offs  have been
insignificant  for  all  years  presented.

     Concentration  of  other  risks

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical  market patterns.  The Company's
results  of  operations  are  affected by a wide variety of factors, including
general  economic  conditions,  conditions  relating  to technology companies,
conditions  specific  to  the  semiconductor  industry,  decreases  in average
selling  prices  over  the  life  of any particular product, the timing of new
product  introductions  (by  the  Company,  its  competitors  and others), the
ability  to  manufacture  sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely
manner,  the  timely implementation of new manufacturing process technologies,
the  ability  to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors,
and the impact of new technologies resulting in rapid escalation of demand for
some  products  in  the  face  of  equally steep decline in demand for others.
Based  on  the  factors  noted  herein, the Company may experience substantial
period-to-period  fluctuations  in  future  operating  results.

NOTE  3.  ACQUISITION

In  April  1995, the Company acquired NeoCAD, Inc. (NeoCAD), a private company
engaged  in the design, development and sale of FPGA software design tools for
programmable  electronic  technologies,  for  $35.0  million  in  cash.    The
transaction  was  treated  as a purchase for accounting purposes; accordingly,
the  purchase  price  was  allocated  to  the  assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values.  NeoCAD's financial results from
the  date  of acquisition are included in the Company's consolidated financial
results.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of liabilities
assumed,  net  of  tangible  assets  acquired,  was  allocated  to  in-process
technology  ($19.4  million),  the  assembled  workforce  ($0.7  million), and
developed technology ($15.7 million).  The amount of in-process technology was
written-off  as  a  non-recurring  item  during  fiscal  1996.   The assembled
workforce  asset was amortized over two years and was completed in fiscal year
1997.   The developed technology asset is being amortized over six years, $2.6
million  of  which was recorded as amortization in fiscal 1998, for cumulative
amortization  to  date  of  $7.8  million.

NOTE  4.  JOINT  VENTURE

The  Company, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and other parties have
entered  into  a  joint  venture  to construct a wafer fabrication facility in
Taiwan,  known  as  United  Silicon  Inc.  (USIC).    The  Company invested an
additional  $67.4  million  in  USIC  during  fiscal  1998  to bring the total
cumulative  investment  to  $101.7 million.  The Company currently holds a 25%
equity  ownership  and  the right to receive 31.25% of the wafer capacity from
this  facility.  UMC has committed to and is supplying the Company with wafers
manufactured  in  an existing facility until capacity is available in the USIC
facility.    The  Company  is  accounting for this investment using the equity
method.    To  date,  USIC's  net income has resulted primarily from favorable
foreign  currency  exchange gains as well as interest earned on its investment
portfolio.  Through  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  1998, equity income was
immaterial  and  remained  classified  in  "Interest  income  and other".  See
further  discussion  in  Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

All  investments classified as "available-for-sale securities" have maturities
due  in  one  year  or  less.    Realized  gains  or  losses  from  sales  of
available-for-sale  securities  were  immaterial  for  all  periods presented.

Held-to-maturity  securities  of $36.3 million at March 31, 1998 and March 31,
1997, represent investments in US Treasury Securities for which amortized cost
approximates  estimated  fair  value.    Held-to-maturity securities relate to
certain  collateral  requirements  for  lease  agreements  associated with the
Company's  corporate  facilities  and have maturities due in one year or less.
See  Note  6  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.

     Derivatives

In fiscal 1997, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to
minimize  the  impact of future exchange fluctuations on the US dollar cost of
investing  in  the  USIC joint venture.  The contracts required the Company to
exchange  US  dollars for New Taiwan dollars and matured within one year.  The
contracts  were  accounted  for as a hedge of an identifiable foreign currency
commitment.    Realized  losses,  which  were immaterial, were recognized upon
maturity  of  the  contracts  in  fiscal  1998  and included in the USIC joint
venture  investment.

The  Company  has  entered  into  an interest rate swap agreement with a third
party  in  order to reduce risk related to movements in interest rates.  Under
the  agreement,  which  was  effective  starting in May 1996 and terminates in
November  1998,  the  Company  effectively  converted  the fixed rate interest
payments  related  to $125 million of the Company's convertible long-term debt
to  variable  rate  interest  payments  without the exchange of the underlying
principal  amounts.   The Company receives fixed interest rate payments (equal
to  5.935%)  from  the  third  party  and  is  obligated to make variable rate
payments  (equal  to the three month Libor rate) to the third party during the
term of the agreement.  The fair value of the interest rate swap is immaterial
based  on  market  exchange  rates.

At  March  31,  1998,  no commitments under foreign currency forward or option
contracts  were  outstanding.

     Long-Term  Debt  and  Lines  of  Credit

In  November  1995,  the Company completed a private placement of $250 million
aggregate  principal  convertible  subordinated  notes  under Rule 144A of the
Securities  Act  of 1933.  The notes, which mature in 2002, are convertible at
the option of the note holders into the Company's common stock at a conversion
price  of  $51 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain
events.    The  conversion price represented a 24.77% premium over the closing
price  of  the  Company's  stock  on  November  7,  1995.  Interest is payable
semi-annually  at  5.25%  per  annum.    As of November 4, 1997, the notes are
redeemable  at  the  option  of  the Company at an initial redemption price of
103.75%  of  the  principal  amount.   However, prior to November 3, 1998, the
notes  are  not  redeemable  unless  the closing price of the Company's common
stock  has  exceeded  $71.40 (40% premium over the conversion price) per share
for  twenty  trading  days within a period of thirty consecutive trading days.
Redemption  prices  as a percentage of the principal amount are 103%, 102.25%,
101.50% and 100.75% in the years beginning November 1, 1998, November 1, 1999,
November  1,  2000 and November 1, 2001, respectively.  Debt issuance costs of
$6.1  million  incurred  in  conjunction  with  issuance  of  the  convertible
subordinated  notes are being amortized over the seven-year life of the notes.
In 1998, the Company recorded debt issuance cost amortization of $0.9 million.
At  March  31,  1998, the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes was
approximately  $255  million  based  on quoted market prices.  The Company has
reserved  4,901,961  shares of common stock for the conversion of these notes.

The Company has $40 million available under a syndicated bank revolving credit
line agreement, which expires in March 2001.  Under this agreement, borrowings
bear  interest at the prime rate or 0.625% over the Libor rate.  Additionally,
the  Company's  Ireland  manufacturing facility has an additional $6.2 million
available  under  a multicurrency credit line, which expires in November 1999.
Under  this  agreement, borrowings bear interest at the bank's prime rate.  At
March  31,  1998,  no borrowings were outstanding under any credit lines.  The
Company  is  in  full  compliance  with the agreement's required covenants and
financial  ratios.    The  agreements  prohibit  the payment of cash dividends
without  prior  bank  approval.

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS

The  Company  leases  its  manufacturing and office facilities under operating
leases  that  expire at various dates through December 2014.  Lease agreements
for  certain  corporate facilities contain payment provisions, which allow for
changes  in  rental amounts based upon interest rate changes.  The approximate
future  minimum  lease  payments  under  operating  leases  are  as  follows:

Rent expense was approximately $4.5 million for the years ended March 31, 1998
and  1997  and  approximately  $4.3 million for the year ended March 31, 1996.

The  Company  has  entered into lease agreements relating to certain corporate
facilities  which  would  allow  the  Company to purchase the facilities on or
before the end of the lease term in December 1999.  If at the end of the lease
term the Company does not purchase the property under lease or arrange a third
party  purchase,  then  the  Company  would  be  obligated to the lessor for a
guarantee  payment  equal  to a specified percentage of the Company's purchase
price for the property.  The Company would also be obligated to the lessor for
all  or  some  portion  of this amount if the price paid by the third party is
below  a specified percentage of the Company's purchase price.  The Company is
also  required to comply with certain covenants and maintain certain financial
ratios.    As  of  March  31,  1998,  the  total  amount related to the leased
facilities  for  which  the  Company  is contingently liable is $39.8 million.
Under  the  terms  of  the  agreements,  the  Company  is required to maintain
collateral  (restricted  investments)  of approximately $36 million during the
lease  term.

During fiscal 1998, the Company entered into an agreement for a facility to be
built  on  property  adjacent to the Company's corporate facilities.  Building
construction  is  expected  to  be completed in fiscal 1999.  Upon signing the
lease  agreement,  the  Company paid the lessor $31.3 million for prepaid rent
and  an  option to purchase the facility.  The rent prepayment covers one year
and  was  discounted  to  its  present  value.   Additionally, the Company can
exercise  the  lease agreement's purchase option between the sixth and twelfth
month  following  the  commencement  date  of  the lease term.  If the Company
elects  to exercise the option, the prepaid purchase option will be considered
payment in full.  However, if the Company decides not to exercise the purchase
option, the prepaid option will be returned without interest at the end of the
first  year  of  the  lease.

Under  the  terms  of the agreement entered into between the Company and USIC,
the  Company  may  be  required to make a third equity installment of up to an
additional  $30  million  in the USIC joint venture, if warranted based on the
capital  and  operational  requirements  of  the  joint  venture.

NOTE 7. NET INCOME PER SHARE

During  the quarter ended December 27, 1997, the Company adopted the Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board's  Statement  No.  128  (FASB 128), "Earnings per
Share".    The  new standard required the Company to change the method used to
compute  net  income  per  share  and  to  restate all prior periods.  The new
requirement  includes  a  calculation  of  "basic" net income per share, which
excludes the dilutive effect of stock options.   Basic net income per share is
computed  by  dividing  net  income  available  to  common stockholders by the
weighted  average  number  of common shares outstanding during the period.  In
computing diluted net income per share, the average stock price for the period
is  used  in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the
exercise  of  stock options.  Diluted earnings per share is computed using the
weighted  average  common  and  dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding,
plus  other  dilutive  shares  which  are  not  common  equivalent  shares.

The  computation  of  basic  net  income  per share for all years presented is
derived  from  the  information on the face of the income statement, and there
are  no  reconciling  items  in  either  the  numerator  or  denominator.
Additionally,  there are no reconciling items in the numerator used to compute
diluted net income per share.  The total shares used in the denominator of the
diluted  net  income  per  share calculation includes 6,269,000, 6,859,000 and
7,863,000  incremental  common  shares attributable to outstanding options for
fiscal  years  1998,  1997  and  1996,  respectively.

The shares issuable upon conversion of long-term debt to equity, approximately
4.9 million shares, were not included in the calculation of diluted net income
per  share  as  their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect for all
periods presented.  In addition, outstanding options to purchase approximately
1.9  million,  1.0  million and 0.6 million shares, for the fiscal years 1998,
1997  and  1996,  respectively, under the Company's Stock Option Plan were not
included  in the treasury stock calculation to derive diluted income per share
as  their  inclusion  would  have  had  an  anti-dilutive  effect.

NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

The  Company's Certificate of Incorporation provides for 300 million shares of
common  stock  and  2  million  shares  of  undesignated  preferred  stock.

     Treasury  Stock

The Company authorized a stock buyback program in September 1996 whereby up to
2  million  shares  of  the  Company's common stock were purchased in the open
market  from  time  to time as market and business conditions warranted.  This
program  was  completed  in  November  1997.    In December 1997 an additional
program  was  authorized to buyback up to an additional 2 million shares.  The
Company has reissued treasury shares repurchased in response to Employee Stock
Option  exercises  and  Employee  Qualified  Stock Purchase Plan requirements.
During  fiscal 1998 and 1997, the Company repurchased a total of 2,330,000 and
877,500  shares  of  common  stock  for  $93.8  million  and  $32.0  million,
respectively.    In  fiscal  1998  and  1997,  921,000 and 837,000 shares were
reissued,  respectively.    As  a  result,  the  Company was holding 1,449,500
treasury  stock  shares  at  March  31,  1998.

     Stockholder  Rights  Plan

In  October 1991, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a
dividend  distribution of one common stock purchase right for each outstanding
share  of  common  stock.    The  rights  become  exercisable  based  upon the
occurrence  of  certain  conditions  including  acquisitions of Company stock,
tender or exchange offers and certain business combination transactions of the
Company.  In the event one of the conditions is triggered, each right entitles
the  registered  holder  to purchase a number of shares of common stock of the
Company  or,  under  limited  circumstances,  of the acquirer.  The rights are
redeemable  at  the  Company's  option, under certain conditions, for $.01 per
right  and  expire  on  October  4,  2001.

     Employee  Stock  Option  Plan

Under  existing  stock option plans (Option Plan), options reserved for future
issuance  to  employees  and directors of the Company total 18,410,000 shares.
Options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock under the Option Plan
are  granted  at  100%  of  the  fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant.    Options granted to date expire ten years from date of grant and vest
at  varying  rates  over  four  or  five  years.

</TABLE>

At March 31, 1997, 5.7 million options were exercisable.

     Employee  Qualified  Stock  Purchase  Plan

Under  the  Company's  1990  Employee  Qualified  Stock  Purchase  Plan (Stock
Purchase  Plan),  qualified  employees  can  elect to have up to 15 percent of
their  annual  earnings  withheld, up to a maximum of $21,250, to purchase the
Company's  common  stock  at  the  end  of  six-month enrollment periods.  The
purchase  price  of  the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value at
the  beginning  of the twenty-four month offering period or at the end of each
six-month  purchase period.  Almost all employees are eligible to participate.
Under  this plan, 361,359 and 535,360 shares were issued during 1998 and 1997,
respectively,  and  815,331  shares  were  available for issuance at March 31,
1998.

     Stock-Based  Compensation

As  permitted  under  FASB  Statement  No.  123,  "Accounting  for Stock-Based
Compensation"  (FASB  123),  the  Company  has  elected  to continue to follow
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees"  (APB  25)  and  related  Interpretations  in  accounting  for  its
stock-based  awards  to  employees.    Under  APB  25,  the  Company generally
recognizes  no  compensation  expense  with  respect  to  such  awards.

Pro  forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by FASB 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for awards
to employees under the fair value method of FASB 123.  The fair value of stock
options  and  stock  purchase  plan  rights  under  the  Option Plan and Stock
Purchase  Plan  was  estimated  as  of  the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model was originally developed for use
in  estimating  the  fair  value  of  traded options and requires the input of
highly  subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility.  The
Company's  stock  options  and stock purchase plan rights have characteristics
significantly  different  from  those  of  traded  options, and changes in the
subjective  input  assumptions  can materially affect the fair value estimate.
The  fair  value  of  stock  options and stock purchase plan rights granted in
fiscal  years  1998, 1997 and 1996 was estimated at the date of grant assuming
no  expected  dividends  and  the  following  weighted  average  assumptions.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of stock-based
awards  is amortized against pro forma net income over the stock-based awards'
vesting  period.   Because FASB 123 is applicable only to the Company's awards
granted  subsequent  to March 31, 1995, its pro forma effect will not be fully
reflected  until  approximately  fiscal  2000.   Had the Company accounted for
stock-based awards to employees under FASB 123, the Company's net income would
have  been  $95.6  million,  $87.4 million and $86.2 million in 1998, 1997 and
1996,  respectively.   Basic net income per share would have been $1.30, $1.20
and  $1.21  in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, while diluted net income per
share  would  have  been  $1.25,  $1.12  and  $1.10,  respectively.

Calculated  under  FASB  123,  the  weighted-average  fair  value of the stock
options  granted  during 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $21.38, $15.91 and $14.41 per
share, respectively.  The weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights
granted  under the Stock Purchase Plan during 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $14.50,
$14.47  and  $16.68  per  share,  respectively.

The  tax  benefits  associated  with  the  disqualifying dispositions of stock
options  or employee stock purchase plan shares reduce taxes currently payable
by  $16.1  million,  $16.7 million, and $7.9 million for 1998, 1997, and 1996,
respectively.    Such benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital when
realized.    Pretax  income  from  foreign operations was $55.5 million, $36.1
million  and $11.5 million for fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Unremitted  foreign  earnings  that  are considered to be permanently invested
outside  the  United States and on which no deferred taxes have been provided,
accumulated to approximately $32.9 million as of March 31, 1998.  The residual
US  tax  liability, if such amounts were remitted, would be approximately $8.2
million.

The  provision  for income taxes reconciles to the amount obtained by applying
the  Federal statutory income tax rate to income before provision for taxes as

No  single end customer accounted for more than 5% of revenues in 1998 or 1997
or  6%  of  revenues  in  1996.  Approximately 14%, 15% and 13% of net product
revenues were made through the Company's largest domestic distributor in 1998,
1997  and  1996,  respectively.    A second domestic distributor accounted for
approximately  11%  of  net  product  revenues  in  fiscal  1998  and  a third
distributor  accounted  for approximately 10% of net product revenues in 1996.

NOTE  11.  LITIGATION

On June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in
the  United  States District Court for the Northern District of California for
infringement  of certain of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera filed
suit  against  the  Company  alleging  that  certain of the Company's products
infringe  certain  Altera  patents.    Fact  and  expert  discovery  have been
completed  in  both cases, which have been consolidated.  In October 1997, the
Court held a hearing with respect to construction of the claims of the various
patents  in  suit.

On  April  20,  1995,  Altera  filed an additional suit against the Company in
Federal  District  Court in Delaware alleging that the Company's XC5200 family
infringes  an  Altera  patent.  The Company answered the Delaware suit denying
that  the  XC5200  family  infringes  the  patent  in  suit, asserting certain
affirmative  defenses  and  counterclaiming  that  the  Altera Max 9000 family
infringes certain of the Company's patents.  The Delaware suit was transferred
to  the  United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
Discovery  has  not  begun.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot be determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has meritorious defenses to such claims and is
defending  them  vigorously, and has not recorded a provision for the ultimate
outcome  of  these  matters  in  its financial statements.  The foregoing is a
forward  looking  statement subject to risks and uncertainties, and the future
outcome  could differ materially due to the uncertain nature of the litigation
with  Altera  and  because  the  lawsuits  are  still  in the pre-trial stage.

In  addition, in the normal course of business, the Company receives and makes
inquiries  with  regard  to  possible  patent  infringement.    Where  deemed
advisable,  the  Company may seek or extend licenses or negotiate settlements.
Outcomes  of  such  negotiations may not be determinable at any point in time;
however,  management  does not believe that such licenses or settlements will,
individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  material adverse effect on the
Company's  financial  position  or  results  of  operations.

NOTE  12.  WRITE-OFF  OF  DISCONTINUED  PRODUCT  FAMILY

During  fiscal  1997,  the  Company discontinued the XC8100 family of one-time
programmable  antifuse  devices.    As a result, the Company recorded a pretax
charge  against  earnings of $5 million.  This charge primarily related to the
write-off  of  inventory  and  for  termination  charges  related  to purchase
commitments  to  foundry  partners  for  work-in-process  wafers which had not
completed  the  manufacturing  process.

REPORT  OF  ERNST  &  YOUNG  LLP,  INDEPENDENT  AUDITORS

The  Board  of  Directors  and  Stockholders
Xilinx, Inc.

We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc.
as  of  March  31,  1998  and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended March 31, 1998.  Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a).  These financial statements and
schedule  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.    Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion on these financial statements and
schedule  based  on  our  audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted auditing
standards.    Those  standards  require  that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for  our  opinion.

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present  fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of  Xilinx,  Inc.  at March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated results of
its  operations  and  its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  March  31,  1998,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted accounting
principles.    Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when  considered  in  relation  to  the  basic financial statements taken as a
whole,  presents  fairly  in  all  material respects the information set forth
therein.

This schedule contains summary information extracted from Xilinx, Inc.'s 
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS and is 
qualified in its entirety by reference to such financial statements.  During 
the quarter ended December 27, 1997, the Company adopted the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 128 (FASB 128), "Earnings per 
Share".  The new standard required the Company to change the method used to 
compute net income per share and to restate all prior periods. The table below
shows the restated earnings per share numbers.
