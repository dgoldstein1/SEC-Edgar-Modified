3.          The Company, United Microelectronics Corporation ("UMC") and other
parties  have  entered  into  a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication
facility  in  Taiwan, known as United Silicon Inc. ("USI").  In July 1997, the
Company  invested additional equity of $67.4 million in USI.  The Company will
retain  its  25%  equity ownership in the joint venture.  UMC has committed to
and  is supplying the Company with wafers manufactured in an existing facility
until  capacity  is  available  in  the  new  facility.

4.          In  February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement  No.  128, Earnings per Share, which the Company will be required to
adopt  during the quarter ending December 31, 1997.  At that time, the Company
will be required to change the method currently used to compute net income per
share  and  to restate all prior periods.  The new requirements will include a
calculation  of  "basic" net income per share, which will exclude the dilutive
effect  of  stock  options.  The restated calculations of basic net income per
share for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 1998 result in net
income  per  share  of $0.42 and $0.87 respectively.  Fiscal 1997's comparable
periods  resulted in net income per share of $0.29 and $0.74, respectively.  A
calculation of "diluted" net income per share will also be required.  However,
this  calculation  is  not  expected to differ materially from the primary net
income  per  share  amounts  reported  for  the  periods  presented.

5.          The Company is currently involved in patent litigation with Altera
Corporation  (see  Part  II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings).  Due to the uncertain
nature of the litigation with Altera and because the lawsuits are still in the
pre-trial stage, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at
this  time.   Management believes that it has meritorious defenses to Altera's
claims, is defending them vigorously, and has not recorded a provision for the
ultimate  outcome of these matters in its financial statements.  The foregoing
is  a  forward-looking  statement  subject to risks and uncertainties, and the
future  outcome  could  differ  materially  due to the uncertain nature of the
litigation  with  Altera  and  because the lawsuits are still in the pre-trial
stage.

6.          Subsequent to September 27, 1997, the Company entered into a lease
agreement  for  a  facility  to be built on property adjacent to the Company's
corporate  facilities.   Building construction and occupancy is expected to be
completed  in  calendar  1998.   Upon signing the lease agreement, the Company
paid the lessor $31.3 million for prepaid rent and an option to purchase.  The
rent prepayment covers one full year, and was discounted to its present value.
Additionally,  the  Company can exercise the lease agreement's purchase option
between  the  sixth  and  twelfth month following the commencement date of the
lease  term.    If  the  Company  elects  to  exercise the option, the prepaid
purchase  option  will be considered payment in full.  However, if the Company
decides  not  to  exercise  the  purchase  option,  the prepaid option will be
returned  without  interest  at  the  end  of  the  first  year  lease.



Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations



The  following  discussion  contains  forward-looking statements which involve
numerous  risks  and  uncertainties.    Actual  results may differ materially.
Certain  of  these risks and uncertainties are discussed under "Risk Factors".


RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  -  SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 1998
COMPARED  TO  THE  SECOND  QUARTER  AND  FIRST  SIX  MONTHS  OF  FISCAL  1997


Revenues
- --------

Revenues  for  the  second  quarter  of fiscal 1998 were $150.3 million, which
represented  a $19.7 million, or 15.1%, increase from the corresponding period
of fiscal 1997.  In addition, revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1998
were  $311.0  million,  up  10.8%  from the corresponding period of 1997.  The
revenue  increase  during the second quarter of fiscal 1998 as compared to the
same  quarter in the prior year was primarily attributable to increases in the
volume  of  shipments relating to each of the Company's XC4000, XC4000X (which
includes  the  Company's  XC4000EX  and  XC4000XL  devices)  and  XC5200 field
programmable  gate  array  ("FPGA") product families.  The XC4000, XC4000X and
XC5200  integrated  circuits  represented  60.2%  of aggregate revenues in the
second  quarter  of  fiscal 1998 as compared to 51.5% of aggregate revenues in
the  comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year.  The year to year percentage
increase  was  primarily  due  to  the  growth  in  the Company's XC4000EX and
XC4000XL  devices.    These high density devices were shipped in volume in the
third  quarter  of  fiscal  1997  and  in  the  first  quarter of fiscal 1998,
respectively, and together represented $11.7 million during the second quarter
of  fiscal  1998.    In  comparison  to the immediately preceding quarter, the
133.0%  sequential  growth  in  revenues  achieved  by  the  Company's XC4000X
products  only  partially  offset the decline in revenues and unit volumes for
the Company's older XC4000 products.  Revenues for the XC4000 family decreased
$12.3  million,  or  16.5%, in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 1998.
The  decrease  from  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal 1998 is a function of the
slowing  requirements  for these mature products and the increasing demand for
the  functionality  and  performance  provided  by  the higher density XC4000X
products.   Total revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 1998 as compared to
the  immediately  preceding quarter decreased $10.5 million, or 6.5%, and were
adversely impacted by a general slowdown in the global CMOS programmable logic
industry,  a  seasonal  slowdown  in  Europe, reduced demand for the Company's
mature  FPGA products, distributor inventory balancing and continued decreases
in  selling  prices.

Revenues  for  the  Company's  XC2000,  XC3000  and  XC3100  product families,
represented  26.7% of aggregate revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 1998,
compared  to  36.8% of aggregate revenues during the comparable quarter of the
prior fiscal year.  The decrease is a function of the slowing requirements for
these products and the increasing demand for the functionality and performance
provided  by  the  Company's  higher  density  FPGA  devices.

Other  products, consisting primarily of the complex programmable logic device
("CPLD")  families,  HardWire  Arrays  and  serial proms, represented 13.1% of
aggregate  revenues  in the second quarter of fiscal 1998 compared to 11.7% of
aggregate  revenues for the comparable quarter of the prior year.  Proprietary
products  constituted 94.4% of revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1998,
as  compared  to  88.9%  in  the  comparable quarter last year.  Additionally,
software  revenues  represented  approximately  3%  of  total revenues for the
second quarter of 1998, representing approximately 2200 revenue seats.  In the
second  quarter of fiscal 1997, software revenues represented approximately 3%
of  total  revenues,  representing  approximately  1100  revenue  seats.   The
increase  in revenue seats from the prior year quarter resulted from increased
demand for the Company's lower cost, easier to use Foundation Series software,
and  increased  demand  in  the  software utilized to design high volume logic
devices,  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  average  selling  prices.

International  revenues constituted approximately 37% of total revenues in the
second  quarter of fiscal 1998 in comparison to approximately 36% in the prior
year  quarter.  International revenues are primarily derived from customers in
Europe,  Japan  and Southeast Asia, which represent approximately 21%, 11% and
5%  of  the  Company's  worldwide  sales, respectively.  Revenue growth in the
European,  Japanese  and  Southeast  Asian markets was 11.4%, 19.2% and 56.1%,
respectively,  in the second quarter of 1998 as compared to the second quarter
in  1997.

Gross  Margin
- -------------

Cost  of  revenues was $56.0 million, or 37.3% of revenues, and $117.0 million
or  37.6%  of  revenues  for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal
1998,  respectively.    Costs of revenues for the comparable periods of fiscal
1997 were $50.7 million, or 38.8% of revenues, and $104.0 million, or 37.0% of
revenues,  respectively,  excluding  the impact of a $5.0 million write-off of
the  XC8100  product  family  of  one-time  programmable antifuse devices (see
below).  The decrease in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from
the  prior  year  second  quarter  was primarily attributable to ongoing yield
improvements  and  the  favorable  impact  of lower wafer costs, including the
impact  of  favorable  movement  in the yen exchange rate, partially offset by
selling  price  reductions.   In the past, Xilinx has also been able to offset
much  of  the  erosion  in  gross margin percentages on more mature integrated
circuits with increased volumes of newer, proprietary, higher margin products.
The  Company  recognizes  that  ongoing  manufacturing cost reductions for its
integrated  circuits, which assist the Company in its efforts to lower selling
prices  while  maintaining historical margins, represent a significant element
in  expanding  the  market for its products.  Company management believes that
future  gross  margin  objectives  in  the range of 60% to 62% of revenues are
consistent  with  expanding  market  share while realizing acceptable returns,
although  there  can be no assurance that future gross margins will be in this
range.

During  the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company discontinued the XC8100
family  of  one-time  programmable antifuse devices.  As a result, the Company
recorded  a  pretax  charge  against  earnings  of  $5.0 million.  This charge
primarily  related  to  the write-off of inventory and for termination charges
related to purchase commitments to foundry partners for work-in-process wafers
which  had  not  completed  the  manufacturing  process.

Research  and  Development
- --------------------------

Research  and  development  expenditures  were  $20.0  million  for the second
quarter  and  $39.9  million for the first six months of fiscal 1998, or 13.3%
and  12.8%  of  revenues,  respectively.   The expenditures for the comparable
periods  in  the prior year were $16.7 million and $34.6 million, or 12.8% and
12.3% of revenues, respectively.  The 19.1% and 15.3% increase in expenditures
over  the  prior  year  second  quarter  and  six month periods, respectively,
resulted  primarily  from  increased  testing  of  development  products  and
labor-related  expenses  partially  offset  by  a decline in engineering wafer
purchases.    The Company remains committed to a significant level of research
and  development  effort  in  order to continue to compete aggressively in the
programmable  logic  marketplace.

Marketing,  General  and  Administrative
- ----------------------------------------

Marketing,  general  and  administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of
revenue  from 22.0% and 20.7% of revenues, or $28.7 million and $58.3 million,
respectively, during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 1997 to
20.8% and 20.5% of revenues, or $31.2 million and $63.9 million, respectively,
during the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 1998.  These expenses
have  increased  in  amount  primarily  as  a result of increased staffing and
labor-related  expenses  as well as increased legal costs. The Company remains
committed  to  controlling  administrative  expenses and believes that most of
these  expenses should grow at a lower rate than revenue growth.  However, the
timing  and  extent  of  future  legal  costs  associated  with  the  ongoing
enforcement  of  the  Company's  intellectual  property rights are not readily
predictable  and  may  significantly  increase  the  level  of  general  and
administrative  expenses  in  the  future.


Operating  Income
- -----------------

Operating  income of $43.0 million, or 28.6% of revenues, was generated during
the second quarter of fiscal 1998, an increase of 46.1% from the $29.5 million
or  22.6%  of  revenues,  for the prior year comparable period.  Excluding the
impact  of  the  $5.0  million  non-recurring  write-off of the XC8100 product
family in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the second quarter of fiscal 1998
operating income increased 24.9% from $34.5 million, or 26.4% of revenues.  In
addition,  operating  income for the first six months of fiscal 1998 increased
14.4%  to  $90.3 million, or 29.0% of revenues, from $79.0 million or 28.1% of
revenues  in  the  comparable fiscal 1997 period.  Excluding the impact of the
$5.0  million  non-recurring  write-off,  the  first six months of fiscal 1998
operating  income was 7.6% higher than the operating income for the comparable
prior  year period.  The increase in operating income in the second quarter of
1998 compared to the second quarter of 1997 is primarily a result of the 15.1%
revenue  growth, the impact of the non-recurring write-off and lower growth in
marketing,  general  and  administrative  expenses.    Operating  income  as a
percentage  of  revenues  could  be  adversely impacted in future years by the
factors  noted  under  "Risk  Factors".

Interest  and  Other,  net
- --------------------------

The  Company  earns  interest income on its cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments  and  restricted  investments.  The amount of interest earned is a
function of the balance of cash invested as well as prevailing interest rates.
The  Company incurs interest expense on the $250 million of 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated  notes  issued  in  November  1995.    The  Company's  investment
portfolio  contains  tax-advantaged  municipal  securities,  which have pretax
yields  that  are  less than the interest rate on the convertible subordinated
notes.   For financial reporting purposes, the Company effectively records the
difference  between  the  pretax  and  tax-equivalent yields as a reduction in
provision  for  taxes  on  income.

The Company also records 25% of the net income of United Silicon Inc. ("USI"),
a  wafer fabrication joint venture in which the Company participates, as joint
venture  equity income.  To date, USI's net income has resulted primarily from
interest  earned on its investment portfolio.  The Company expects that as the
USI wafer fabrication facility begins to ramp up operations over the next year
the  Company  may  incur  joint  venture  equity  losses.

Net interest and other income was relatively constant in the second quarter of
fiscal  1998 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 1997.  For the first six
months of fiscal 1998, net interest income was up $1.2 million to $4.1 million
as  compared  to  the prior year six-month period.  The increased interest and
other  income  for  the  first  six  months of fiscal 1998 over the prior year
period  is primarily attributable to joint venture equity income.  As a result
of  the  difference  in interest income and expense yields, future uses of the
Company's  investment  portfolio  and operating results for USI, levels of net
interest  and  other  income  could  decrease  in  the  future.

Provision  for  Income  Taxes
- -----------------------------

The  Company recorded a tax provision of $13.9 million (31.0% of income before
taxes)  for  the  second  quarter  of fiscal 1998 as compared to $10.2 million
(32.5%  of  income before taxes) in the comparable prior year period.  For the
first  six  months  of  fiscal  1998 the Company recorded a provision of $30.0
million  (31.8% of income before taxes) as compared to $28.1 million (34.3% of
income  before  taxes) for the first six months of fiscal 1997.  The lower tax
rate  for  the first six months of fiscal 1998 is primarily due to legislation
extending  the  R&D  Tax  Credit  as  well  as  increased  profits  in foreign
operations.


RISK  FACTORS

The  following  risk  factors  are  associated  with  the  Company's business:

Factors  Affecting  Future  Operating  Results
- ----------------------------------------------

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical  market patterns.  The Company's
results  of  operations  are  affected by a wide variety of factors, including
general  economic  conditions,  conditions  relating  to technology companies,
conditions  specific  to  the  semiconductor  industry,  decreases  in average
selling  prices  over  the  life  of any particular product, the timing of new
product  introductions  (by  the  Company,  its  competitors  and others), the
ability  to  manufacture  sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely
manner,  the  timely  implementation  of  new  manufacturing technologies, the
ability  to  safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors, and
the  impact  of  new  technologies resulting in rapid escalation of demand for
some  products  in  the  face  of  equally steep decline in demand for others.
Market demand for the Company's products, particularly for those most recently
introduced,  can  be  difficult  to predict, especially in light of customers'
demands  to  shorten  product  lead  times  and  minimize  inventory  levels.
Unpredictable  market  demand  could lead to revenue volatility if the Company
were  unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in a given
quarter.  In  addition,  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production
yields could adversely impact the Company's financial condition and results of
operations.   The Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as
soon  as  possible; however, the dynamics of the market make prediction of and
timely  reaction  to  such  events  difficult.  Due to the foregoing and other
factors, past results, including those described in this report, are much less
reliable  predictors of the future than is the case in many older, more stable
and  less  dynamic industries.  Based on the factors noted herein, the Company
may  experience  substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating
results.

The  semiconductor  industry has historically been cyclical and subject to, at
various  times,  significant  economic  downturns  characterized by diminished
product  demand,  limited  visibility  to demand for products further out than
three  to  six  months,  accelerated  erosion  of  average  selling prices and
overcapacity.  The  Company  may  experience  substantial  period-to-period
fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry
conditions,  overall  economic  conditions  or  other  factors.

The Company's future success depends in large part on the continued service of
its  key  technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel and on its
ability  to  continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly
important are those highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved
in  the  manufacture  of existing products and the development of new products
and processes.  The competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of
key employees could have a material, adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

Sales and operations outside of the United States subject the Company to risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.    The  Company's  financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in
which it does significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates  affecting  those  countries.    Additionally,  risks include government
regulation  of  exports,  tariffs  and other potential trade barriers, reduced
protection  for  intellectual property rights in some countries, and generally
longer  receivable collection periods.  The Company's business is also subject
to  the  risks  associated  with the imposition of legislation and regulations
relating  specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products.  The
Company  cannot  predict  whether  quotas,  duties,  taxes or other charges or
restrictions  will be imposed by the United States or other countries upon the
importation or exportation of the Company's products in the future or what, if
any,  effect  such actions would have on the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations.

In  order  to expand international sales and service, the Company will need to
maintain  and  expand  existing  foreign  operations  or establish new foreign
operations.    This  entails  hiring  additional  personnel and maintaining or
expanding  existing  relationships  with  international distributors and sales
representatives.    This  will  require  significant  management attention and
financial  resources  and  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.    There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign
operations,  in  its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts
to  maintain  or  expand  its relationships with international distributors or
sales  representatives.

Many  of  the  Company's operations are centered in an area of California that
has been seismically active.  Should there be a major earthquake in this area,
the  Company's  operations  may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the
Company  to  ship  products  in  a timely manner, thereby materially adversely
affecting  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

In  addition,  the  securities  of  many  high  technology  companies  have
historically  been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may
adversely  affect  the  market  price  of  the  Company's  common  stock.

Dependence  Upon  Independent  Manufacturers
- --------------------------------------------

The Company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products.  During the
past  two  years, most of the Company's wafers have been manufactured by Seiko
Epson  Corporation  ("Seiko  Epson")  and  United Microelectronics Corporation
("UMC").   The Company has depended upon these suppliers and others to produce
wafers  with  competitive  performance  and  cost  attributes,  including
transitioning to advanced process technologies, producing wafers at acceptable
yields,  and  delivering  them  to  the Company in a timely manner.  While the
timeliness,  yield  and  quality  of  wafer  deliveries have met the Company's
requirements  to  date,  there  can  be  no assurance that the Company's wafer
suppliers  will not experience future manufacturing problems, including delays
in  the  realization  of  advanced  process technologies.  The Company is also
dependent  on  subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly services.  Any
prolonged  inability  to  obtain  wafers or assembly services with competitive
performance  and  cost  attributes,  adequate yields or timely deliveries from
these  manufacturers/subcontractors,  or  any  other  circumstance  that would
require  the  Company  to  seek  alternative  sources  of  supply, could delay
shipments,  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect on the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

The  Company's  long-term  growth  will  depend in large part on the Company's
ability  to  obtain  increased  wafer  fabrication capacity from suppliers.  A
significant  increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply
could  reduce the Company's supply of wafers or increase the Company's cost of
such  wafers,  thereby  materially adversely affecting the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

In  order  to  secure additional wafer capacity, the Company from time to time
considers  alternatives, including, without limitation, equity investments in,
or  loans,  deposits,  or  other  financial  commitments to, independent wafer
manufacturers  to  secure  production  capacity, or the use of contracts which
commit  the  Company  to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended
periods.    Although  the  Company  is  currently  able  to obtain wafers from
existing  suppliers  in a timely manner, the Company has at times been unable,
and  may  in the future be unable, to fully satisfy customer demand because of
production  constraints, including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors
to  provide materials and services in satisfaction of customer delivery dates,
as  well  as the ability of the Company to process products for shipment.  The
Company's  future  growth  will  depend  in  part on its ability to locate and
qualify  additional  suppliers  and  subcontractors  and  to  increase its own
capacity to ship products, and there can be no assurance that the Company will
be  able  to  do  so.    Any  increase  in  these constraints on the Company's
production  could  result  in  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the Company's
financial  condition  and  results of operations.  In this regard, the Company
has  entered  into  the USI joint venture with UMC and other parties to obtain
wafer capacity from a new wafer fabrication facility.  However, there are many
risks  associated with the construction of a new facility, and there can be no
assurance  that such facility will become operational and/or cost effective in
a  timely manner.  In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement with
Seiko  Epson  to  obtain  additional  capacity from a facility currently under
construction  and expected to provide wafers in calendar 1998.  If the Company
requires  additional capacity and such capacity is unavailable, or unavailable
on  reasonable  terms,  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

Litigation
- ----------

The  Company is currently engaged in patent litigation with Altera Corporation
("Altera").    See  "Legal  Proceedings"  in  Part  II.

Dependence  on  New  Products
- -----------------------------

The  Company's  future success depends in large part on its ability to develop
and  introduce  on  a  timely  basis  new  products  which  address  customer
requirements  and  compete  effectively on the basis of price and performance.
The  success  of  new product introductions is dependent upon several factors,
including  timely  completion  of  new product designs, the ability to utilize
advanced  process technologies, achievement of acceptable yields, availability
of  supporting  design  software  and  market acceptance.  No assurance can be
given  that  the  Company's  product development efforts will be successful or
that  its  new  products will achieve market acceptance.  Revenues relating to
the  Company's mature FPGA products are expected to continue to decline in the
future  as  a  percentage  of  aggregate  revenues,  and  the  Company will be
increasingly  dependent  on  revenues  derived  from  newer product generation
FPGAs,  other  existing products and future generation products.  In addition,
the average selling price for any particular product tends to decrease rapidly
over  the  product's  life.    To  offset  such  decreases, the Company relies
primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in
the  manufacture  of  existing  products and on introducing new products which
incorporate  advanced  features  and other price/performance factors such that
higher  average  selling  prices and higher margins are achievable relative to
mature product lines.  To the extent that such cost reductions and new product
introductions  do  not  occur in a timely manner, or the Company's products do
not  achieve  market  acceptance  at prices with higher margins, the Company's
financial  condition  and  results  of operations could be adversely affected.

Competition
- -----------

The  Company's  FPGA  and  CPLD  products  compete  in  the programmable logic
marketplace,  with  a  substantial  majority of the Company's revenues derived
from  its FPGA product families.  The industries in which the Company competes
are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change,
rapid  product obsolescence and continuous price erosion.  The Company expects
significantly  increased competition both from existing competitors and from a
number  of  companies  that  may  enter  its  market.

Xilinx  believes  that important competitive factors in the programmable logic
market  include  price,  product  performance and reliability, adaptability of
products  to  specific  applications,  ease of use and functionality of design
software, and the ability to provide timely customer service and support.  The
Company's  strategy  for  expansion  in the programmable logic market includes
continued  price reductions commensurate with the ability to lower the cost of
manufacture for established products and continued introduction of new product
architectures which address high volume, low cost applications as well as high
performance,  leading  edge  density  applications.   However, there can be no
assurance  that  the Company will be successful in achieving these strategies.

The  Company's  major  sources of competition are comprised of three elements:
the  manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers of high density
programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures and other
providers  of  programmable  logic products.  The Company competes with custom
gate  array  manufacturers  on  the  basis  of  lower  design  costs,  shorter
development  schedules and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of
custom  gate  arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in
high  volumes.    The  Company  continues  to develop lower cost architectures
intended  to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs
(in  high  volumes) and FPGA production costs.  The Company competes with high
density  programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance, the ability
to  deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers  and  customer support, taking
advantage  of  the  primary  characteristics  of  flexible,  high  speed
implementation  and  quick  time-to-market  capabilities  of the Company's PLD
product  offerings.    In addition, the Company competes with manufacturers of
other  programmable  logic products on the basis of price, performance, design
and  software utility.  Some of the Company's current or potential competitors
have  substantially  greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and technical
resources  than  Xilinx.    To the extent that such efforts to compete are not
successful,  the Company's financial condition and results of operations could
be  materially  adversely  affected.

Intellectual  Property
- ----------------------

The  Company  relies upon patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to
protect  its  intellectual  property.    There  can  be no assurance that such
intellectual  property  rights  can  be successfully asserted in the future or
will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  From time to time, third
parties, including competitors of the Company, have asserted exclusive patent,
copyright  and  other  intellectual  property  rights to technologies that are
important  to  the Company.  There can be no assurance that third parties will
not  assert  infringement  claims  against  the  Company  in  the future, that
assertions  by  third parties will not result in costly litigation or that the
Company  would  prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and
infringed  patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially  reasonable  terms.
Litigation,  regardless  of  its outcome, could result in substantial cost and
diversion  of  resources  of  the  Company.    Any infringement claim or other
litigation  against  or  by the Company could materially, adversely affect the
Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.



FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The  Company's  financial  condition  at  September  27, 1997 remained strong.
Total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by 5.6 times, compared
to  6.2  times at March 29, 1997.  Since its inception, the Company has used a
combination  of  equity  and  debt  financing and cash flow from operations to
support  on-going  business  activities,  make acquisitions and investments in
complementary  technologies,  obtain  facilities  and  capital  equipment  and
finance  inventory  and  accounts  receivable.

The  Company  continued  to generate positive cash flow from operations during
the  first  six  months of fiscal 1998.  As of September 27, 1997, the Company
had  cash,  cash  equivalents and short-term investments of $434.6 million and
working  capital  of  $523.1  million.  Cash generated by operations of $116.4
million  for the first six months of fiscal 1998 was $36.1 million higher than
the  $80.4  million  generated  for  the first six months of fiscal 1997.  The
increase in cash generated by operations during the first six months of fiscal
1998  over  the  comparable  fiscal  1997  period  resulted primarily from the
favorable  cash  flow  impact  of  net  income,  changes in deferred income on
shipments to distributors and reduced inventories, which were partially offset
by  the  unfavorable  cash flow impact of changes in accounts payable, accrued
liabilities  and  income  taxes  payable.

Cash  flows  used  for investing activities for the six months ended September
27, 1997, included an additional equity investment of $67.4 million in the USI
joint  venture  (see  Note  3  of  Notes  to  Consolidated Condensed Financial
Statements),  a  $30.0 million advance to Seiko Epson for wafer purchases, and
$10.6  million  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  acquisitions, which were
partially  offset  by  the  net  maturities  of  $35.7  million  in short-term
investments.    In  the  first six months of fiscal 1997, investing activities
used funds for an advance to Seiko Epson for wafer purchases of $30.0 million,
in  addition  to net purchases of $43.1 million in short-term investments, and
acquisitions  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  of $17.2 million.  Capital
additions  in  the first six months of fiscal 1998 decreased $6.6 million from
the  comparable  fiscal  1997  period,  primarily  due to reduced expenditures
relating to the Company's facility constructed last year in Boulder, Colorado.

Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $0.4 million in the first
six  months  of  fiscal 1998 as the proceeds from the issuance of common stock
under  employee  stock plans of $15.5 million were almost completely offset by
the  acquisition  of  Treasury  Stock  during  the  six  month period of $15.2
million.  For the comparable fiscal 1997 period, financing activities included
$13.6  million in proceeds from issuance of common stock under corporate stock
plans.

Stockholders'  equity  increased  by  $71.4  million  at  September  27, 1997,
principally  as  a result of the net income for the six months ended September
27,  1997.    In  addition,  proceeds  from the issuance of common stock under
employee  stock  plans and related tax benefits from stock options contributed
to  the increase in equity, which was partially offset by the foreign exchange
cumulative  translation  adjustment  in  the  period.  The increase during the
first  six months of fiscal 1998 of $3.6 million in the cumulative translation
adjustment  resulted  primarily  from  changes in the exchange rate of the New
Taiwan  dollar  and  the resulting impact on the USI financial statements upon
translation  from  New  Taiwan  dollars  into  U.S.  dollars.

The  Company  has  available credit line facilities for up to $46.2 million of
which $6.2 million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements
for  the  Company's  wholly owned Irish subsidiary.  At September 27, 1997, no
borrowings  were  outstanding  under  the  lines  of  credit.

In  July 1997, the Company invested additional equity of $67.4 million towards
the  construction  of  the  USI wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan.  UMC has
committed  to  supply  the  Company  with  wafers  manufactured in an existing
facility  until  capacity  is  available  in  the new facility.  Subsequent to
September  27,  1997,  a fire occurred at a UMC related facility.  The Company
currently  does  not anticipate that this event will have an adverse effect on
its  ability to obtain wafers from UMC in the near future, nor that this event
will  adversely  impact  the  USI  joint  venture,  although  there  can be no
assurance  of  this.

In  addition,  during  the  second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company entered
into  an agreement with Seiko Epson.  The agreement provides for an advance to
Seiko  Epson of up to $200.0 million to be used in the construction of a wafer
fabrication  facility  in  Japan.  Through September 27, 1997, the Company has
advanced  a  total  of  $90.0  million  to  Seiko  Epson  under the agreement.
Additional  $30.0 million installments are currently scheduled for November 1,
1997  and  February 1, 1998 or upon the start of mass production, whichever is
later.   The final installment for the advance payment of $50.0 million is due
on  or after the later of April 1, 1998 or the date the outstanding balance of
the  advance  payment  is  less  than  $125.0  million, as a function of wafer
deliveries against the amounts advanced.  In addition to the advance payments,
the  Company  may also provide further funding to Seiko Epson in the amount of
$100.0  million.    This  additional  funding  would  be  paid after the final
installment  of  the  advance  and  the form of the additional funding will be
negotiated  at  that  time.


The  Company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from
operations  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy the Company's cash needs for the
foreseeable  future.  The  Company will continue to evaluate opportunities for
investments  to  obtain  additional  wafer supply capacity, procure additional
capital  equipment  and  facilities,  develop  new  products,  and  potential
acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies that would complement the
Company's  businesses  and  may use available cash or other sources of funding
for  such  purposes.



Part II.    OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings


On  June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation ("Altera")
in  the  United  States District Court for the Northern District of California
for  infringement  of  certain of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera
filed  suit  against  the  Company,  alleging  that  certain  of the Company's
products  infringe certain Altera patents.  Fact and expert discovery has been
completed  in  both  cases,  which have been consolidated.  On April 20, 1995,
Altera  filed  an  additional suit against the Company in the Federal District
Court  in  Delaware,  alleging  that  the Company's XC5200 family infringes an
Altera patent.  The Company answered the Delaware suit denying that the XC5200
family  infringes  the  patent in suit, asserting certain affirmative defenses
and  counterclaiming  that the Altera Max 9000 family infringes certain of the
Company's  patents.    The  Delaware suit was transferred to the United States
District  Court for the Northern District of California and is also before the
same  judge.    In  October  1997,  the  Court  held a hearing with respect to
construction  of  the  claims  of  the  various patents in suit.  The ultimate
outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined  at this time.  Management
believes that it has meritorious defenses to such claims and is defending them
vigorously.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement subject to risks and
uncertainties,  and  the  future  outcome  could  differ materially due to the
uncertain  nature  of  the litigation with Altera and because the lawsuits are
still  in  the  pre-trial  stage.

There are no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company  is  a  party  or  of  which  any  of  its  property  is  the subject.

Lessor,  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  therein  office,  research  and

legal  activity;  and for no other purpose without obtaining the prior written
consent  of  Lessor.

PREMISES:  The  real  property  with  appurtenances as shown on Exhibit A (the
"Premises")  situated in the City of San Jose, County of Santa Clara, State of
California,  and  more  particularly  described  as  follows:

     The  Premises  includes  180,000  square  feet of building, including all
improvements thereto, as shown on Exhibit A including the right to use all the
parking  spaces  at the Premises.  The address for the Premises is _____ Logic
Drive, San Jose, California.  Lessee's pro-rata share of the Premises is 100%.

TERM:  The  term  shall be for one hundred twenty (120) months unless extended
pursuant  to  Section  35  of this Lease (the "Lease Term"), commencing on the
Commencement  Date as defined in Section 1 and ending one hundred twenty (120)
months  thereafter.

RENT:  Base  rent  shall  be  payable  in  monthly  installments  as  follows:


                               Base rent
                               ---------
Months 1 through 12            $253,350

Monthly base rent to increase by 3% on the annual anniversary of the
Commencement Date each year during the Lease Term over the prior year's rent.

Base  rent  as  scheduled  above  shall be payable in advance on or before the
first  day  of each calendar month during the Lease Term.  The term "Rent," as
used  herein,  shall be deemed to be and to mean the base monthly rent and all
other  sums required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to the terms of this Lease.
Rent  shall  be  paid in lawful money of the United States of America, without
offset  or  deduction,  and shall be paid to Lessor at such place or places as
may  be designated from time to time by Lessor.  Rent for any period less than
a calendar month shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly installment.  Upon
execution  of  this  Lease,  Lessee  shall  deposit with Lessor the sum of Two
Million  Nine  Hundred  Forty-Nine  Thousand Dollars ($2,949,000) representing
full  payment  of  the  first  year's  rent,  discounted  to  present  value.

LATE CHARGES: Lessee hereby acknowledges that a late payment made by Lessee to
Lessor  of  Rent and other sums due hereunder will cause Lessor to incur costs
not  contemplated  by  this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely
difficult  to  ascertain.    Such  costs  include,  but  are  not  limited to,
processing  and  accounting charges, and late charges, which may be imposed on
Lessor  according  to  the  terms  of  any mortgage or trust deed covering the
Premises.    Accordingly, if any installment of Rent or any other sum due from
Lessee  is  not  received  by Lessor or Lessor's designee within ten (10) days
after  such  amount  is due, Lessee shall pay to Lessor a late charge equal to
five  (5%) percent of such overdue amount.  The parties hereby agree that such
late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will
incur  by  reason  of  late  payments made by Lessee.  Acceptance of such late
charges  by  Lessor  shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's default
with  respect  to  such  overdue  amount,  nor  shall  it  prevent Lessor from
exercising  any  of  the  other  rights  and  remedies  granted  hereunder.
Notwithstanding  the  above, Lessee shall not be required to pay a late charge
if  it  is  the  result  of a non-recurring unusual event such as a accounting
error.

SECURITY  DEPOSIT:  Lessee  shall  deposit  with Lessor the sum of Two Hundred
Fifty-Three  Thousand  Three  Hundred  Fifty Dollars ($253,350) (the "Security
Deposit").    The Security Deposit shall be held by Lessor as security for the
faithful  performance by Lessee of all of the terms, covenants, and conditions
of  this  Lease applicable to Lessee.  If Lessee commits a default as provided
for  herein,  including  but  not  limited  to  a  default with respect to the
provisions  contained herein relating to the condition of the Premises, Lessor
may (but shall not be required to) use, apply or retain all or any part of the
Security  Deposit  for  the  payment  of  any amount which Lessor may spend by
reason  of  default  by  Lessee.  If any portion of the Security Deposit is so
used  or applied, Lessee shall, within ten days after written demand therefor,
deposit  cash  with  Lessor  in  an  amount sufficient to restore the Security
Deposit  to its original amount.  Lessee's failure to do so shall be a default
by  Lessee.  Any attempt by Lessee to transfer or encumber its interest in the
Security Deposit shall be null and void.  Upon execution of this Lease, Lessee
shall  deposit  with  Lessor  the Security Deposit. Notwithstanding the above,
Lessor  agrees  to waive the requirement for Lessee to make a Security Deposit
provided  Lessee's  shareholder's equity exceeds $100 million.  If at any time
during  this  Lease,  Lessee's shareholder's equity is less than $100 million,
Lessee  shall deposit with Lessor the Security Deposit referenced above within
ten  days  after  the issuance of Lessee's financial statements indicating the
reduction in shareholder's equity below $100 million.  If Lessee fails to make
the  Security Deposit as required, Lessee shall be deemed to be in default per
Section  14.1  (a)  of  this  Lease.

QUIET  ENJOYMENT:  Lessor  covenants  and  agrees with Lessee that upon Lessee
paying  Rent  and  performing  its  covenants and conditions under this Lease,
Lessee  shall  and may peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Premises
for  the  Lease  Term,  subject,  however,  to  the  rights reserved by Lessor
hereunder.

last  day  of  the  Lease Term, or on the sooner termination of this Lease, to
surrender the Premises to Lessor in Good Condition and Repair.  Good Condition

suitable  for  occupancy  by  a  reasonable lessee.  The interior walls of all
office  and warehouse areas, the floors of all office and warehouse areas, all

which  the  subject Premises are located or allow any sale by auction upon the
Premises, or allow the Premises to be used for any improper, immoral, unlawful
or objectionable purpose, or place any loads upon the floor, walls, or ceiling
which may endanger the structure, or use any machinery or apparatus which will
in  any  manner vibrate or shake the Premises or the building of which it is a
part, or place any harmful liquids in the drainage system of the building.  No
waste materials or refuse shall be dumped upon or permitted to remain upon any
part  of the Premises outside of the building proper.  No materials, supplies,
equipment,  finished  products  or  semi-finished  products,  raw materials or
articles  of  any  nature  shall  be stored upon or permitted to remain on any

consents  to  Lessee's  use  of  materials which are incidental to the normal,
day-to-day  operations  of  any  office  user, such as copier fluids, cleaning
materials,  etc.,  but  this does not relieve Lessee of any of its obligations
not  to  contaminate  the  Premises  and  related real property or violate any
Hazardous  Materials  Laws.

alteration  or  addition  to  said  Premises, or any part thereof, without the

deemed  as  trade  fixtures  shall  include  HVAC  systems,  lighting systems,
electrical  systems,  partitioning, carpeting, or any other installation which
has  become  an integral part of the Premises.  Lessee agrees that it will not
proceed  to  make  such alterations or additions until all required government
permits have been obtained and after having obtained consent from Lessor to do
so,  until  five (5) days from the receipt of such consent, so that Lessor may
post  appropriate  notices  to  avoid any liability to contractors or material
suppliers  for  payment  for Lessee's improvements.  Lessee shall at all times
permit  such notices to be posted and to remain posted until the completion of
work.    At  the  end  of the Lease Term or earlier termination of this Lease,
Lessee  shall  remove  and  shall  be  required  to  remove its special tenant
improvements,  all  related  equipment,  and  any  additions  or  alterations
installed  by  Lessee  at or during the Lease Term and Lessee shall return the

improvements.    Notwithstanding  the  above,  Lessor  agrees  to  allow  any
reasonable  alterations  and  improvements  and  will  use its best efforts to
notify  Lessee at the time of approval if such improvements or alterations are
to  be  removed  at  the end of the Lease Term  or earlier termination of this
Lease.    Notwithstanding  the  above, Lessee shall have the right, during the
term  of  this  Lease, to make improvements to the Premises at their sole cost
and  expense of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) with no approval from

but  not  limited  to  liens  arising  out  of  any  work performed, materials
furnished, or obligations incurred by Lessee.  However, the Lessor shall allow
Lessee  to  contest  a lien claim, so long as the claim is discharged prior to
any  foreclosure  proceeding being initiated against the property and provided
Lessee  provides  Lessor  a  bond  if  the  lien  exceeds  $5,000.

9.  COMPLIANCE  WITH  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS: Lessee shall, at its sole cost
and  expense,  comply  with  all  of the requirements of all local, municipal,
state  and  federal  authorities  now  in  force, or which may hereafter be in
force,  pertaining  to   the Premises, and shall faithfully observe in the use
and occupancy of the Premises all local and municipal ordinances and state and
federal  statutes  now  in  force  or  which  may  hereafter  be  in  force.

10.  INTENTIONALLY  OMITTED.

11.  ADVERTISEMENTS  AND SIGNS: Lessee shall not place or permit to be placed,
in,  upon  or  about  the  Premises any unusual or extraordinary signs, or any
signs  not  approved  by  the  city, local, state, federal or other applicable
governing  authority.  Lessee shall not place, or permit to be placed upon the
Premises,  any signs, advertisements or notices without the written consent of
the  Lessor,  and  such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  A sign so
placed on the Premises shall be so placed upon the understanding and agreement
that  Lessee  will  remove  same  at  the  end  of  the  Lease Term or earlier
termination  of  this  Lease  and  repair any damage or injury to the Premises
caused thereby, and if not so removed by Lessee, then Lessor may have the same
removed  at  Lessee's  expense.

12.  UTILITIES:  Lessee  shall  pay  for  all  water, gas, heat, light, power,
telephone and other utilities supplied to the Premises.  Any charges for sewer
usage,  PG&E,  and  telephone  site  service  or  related  fees  shall  be the
obligation  of  Lessee  and  paid for by Lessee.  If any such services are not
separately  metered to Lessee, Lessee shall pay a reasonable proportion of all
charges  which  are  jointly  metered,  the determination to be made by Lessor
acting  reasonably  and  on any equitable basis.  Lessor and Lessee agree that
Lessor  shall not be liable to Lessee for any disruption in any of the utility
services  to  the  Premises.

13.  ATTORNEY'S FEES: In case suit should be brought for the possession of the
Premises,  for the recovery of any sum due hereunder, because of the breach of
any  other  covenant  herein,  or  to enforce, protect, or establish any term,
conditions,  or covenant of this Lease or the right of either party hereunder,
the  losing party shall pay to the Prevailing Party reasonable attorney's fees
which  shall  be deemed to have accrued on the commencement of such action and
shall  be  enforceable  whether  or not such action is prosecuted to judgment.
The  term  "Prevailing Party" shall mean the party that received substantially
the  relief  requested,  whether  by  settlement, dismissal, summary judgment,
judgment,  or  otherwise.

14.1  DEFAULT:  The  occurrence  of  any  of  the following shall constitute a
default  and  breach  of this Lease by Lessee: a) Any failure by Lessee to pay
Rent or to make any other payment required to be made by Lessee hereunder when
due  if  not cured within ten (10) days after written notice thereof by Lessor
to  Lessee; b) The abandonment or vacation of the Premises by Lessee except as
provided in Section 7; c) A failure by Lessee to observe and perform any other
provision  of  this  Lease  to  be observed or performed by Lessee, where such
failure  continues  for  thirty days after written notice thereof by Lessor to
Lessee; provided, however, that if the nature of such default is such that the
same  cannot  be  reasonably  cured within such thirty (30) day period, Lessee
shall  not  be  deemed  to  be in default if Lessee shall, within such period,
commence such cure and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion;
d)  The  making  by  Lessee  of  any  general  assignment  for  the benefit of
creditors;  the  filing  by  or  against  Lessee  of a petition to have Lessee
adjudged  a  bankrupt or of a petition for reorganization or arrangement under
any law relating to bankruptcy; e) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to
take  possession  of substantially all of Lessee's assets or Lessee's interest
in  this  Lease,  or  the  attachment,  execution or other judicial seizure of
substantially  all  of  Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's
interest  in  this  Lease.

14.2  SURRENDER  OF LEASE: In the event of any such default by Lessee, then in
addition to any other remedies available to Lessor at law or in equity, Lessor
shall  have the immediate option to terminate this Lease before the end of the
Lease  Term  and  all  rights of Lessee hereunder, by giving written notice of
such  intention  to terminate.  In the event that Lessor terminates this Lease
due  to a default of Lessee, then Lessor may recover from Lessee: a) the worth
at  the  time of award of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of
such  termination; plus b) the worth at the time of award of unpaid Rent which
would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeding the
amount  of  such rental loss that the Lessee proves could have been reasonably
avoided;  plus  c)  the  worth at the time of award of the amount by which the
unpaid  Rent for the balance of the Lease Term after the time of award exceeds
the  amount  of  such  rental  loss  that  the  Lessee  proves could have been
reasonably  avoided;  plus  d) any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor
for  all  the  detriment proximately caused by Lessee's failure to perform his
obligations  under  this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would
be likely to result therefrom; and e) at Lessor's election, such other amounts
in  addition  to  or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to
time  by  applicable California law.  As used in (a) and (b) above, the "worth
at  the  time  of award" is computed by allowing interest at the rate of Wells
Fargo's prime rate plus two percent (2%) per annum.  As used in (c) above, the
"worth  at  the  time  of award" is computed by discounting such amount at the
discount  rate  of  the  Federal  Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of
award  plus  one  percent  (1%).

14.3  RIGHT  OF ENTRY AND REMOVAL: In the event of any such default by Lessee,
Lessor  shall  also have the right, with or without terminating this Lease, to
re-enter  the  Premises and remove all persons and property from the Premises;
such  property may be removed and stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at
the  cost  of  and  for  the  account  of  Lessee.

14.4  ABANDONMENT:  In  the  event  of  the vacation or abandonment, except as
provided  in  Section 7, of the Premises by Lessee or in the event that Lessor
shall  elect  to  re-enter  as  provided in paragraph 14.3 above or shall take
possession  of  the  Premises  pursuant to legal proceeding or pursuant to any
notice  provided  by law, and Lessor does not elect to terminate this Lease as
provided  in  Section  14.2  above, then Lessor may from time to time, without
terminating this Lease, either recover all Rent as it becomes due or relet the
Premises  or  any part thereof for such term or terms and at such rental rates
and  upon  such  other terms and conditions as Lessor, in its sole discretion,
may  deem  advisable  with  the  right  to make alterations and repairs to the
Premises.    In  the event that Lessor elects to relet the Premises, then Rent
received by Lessor from such reletting shall be applied; first, to the payment
of  any  indebtedness  other  than  Rent  due hereunder from Lessee to Lessor;
second, to the payment of any cost of such reletting; third, to the payment of
the  cost  of  any  alterations  and  repairs  to the Premises; fourth, to the
payment  of  Rent  due and unpaid hereunder; and the residue, if any, shall be
held  by  Lessor  and  applied  to  the payment of future Rent as the same may
become  due  and payable hereunder.  Should that portion of such Rent received
from  such reletting during any month, which is applied by the payment of Rent
hereunder  according to the application procedure outlined above, be less than
the  Rent payable during that month by Lessee hereunder, then Lessee shall pay
such  deficiency  to  Lessor immediately upon demand therefor by Lessor.  Such
deficiency  shall  be  calculated  and paid monthly.  Lessee shall also pay to
Lessor,  as  soon as ascertained, any costs and expenses incurred by Lessor in
such  reletting  or  in making such alterations and repairs not covered by the
rentals  received  from  such  reletting.

14.5  NO IMPLIED TERMINATION: No re-entry or taking possession of the Premises
by  Lessor  pursuant  to  Section  14.3 or Section 14.4 of this Lease shall be
construed  as  an  election to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of
such intention is given to Lessee or unless the termination thereof is decreed
by  a  court of competent jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding any reletting without
termination by Lessor because of any default by Lessee, Lessor may at any time
after  such  reletting  elect  to  terminate  this Lease for any such default.

15.  SURRENDER  OF  LEASE:  The  voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by
Lessee,  or a mutual cancellation thereof, shall not work a merger, and shall,
at  the  option  of  Lessor,  terminate  all  or any existing subleases or sub
tenancies, or may, at the option of Lessor, operate as an assignment to him of
any  or  all  such  subleases  or  sub  tenancies.

16.  TAXES: Lessee shall pay and discharge punctually and when the same shall
become  due  and  payable  without  penalty,  all  real estate taxes, personal
property  taxes,  taxes  based  on  vehicles  utilizing  parking  areas in the
Premises,  taxes computed or based on rental income (other than federal, state
and  municipal  net  income taxes), environmental surcharges, privilege taxes,
excise  taxes, business and occupation taxes, school fees or surcharges, gross
receipts  taxes,  sales and/or use taxes, employee taxes, occupational license
taxes,  water  and  sewer  taxes,  assessments (including, but not limited to,
assessments  for  public  improvements  or  benefit),  assessments  for local
improvement and maintenance districts, and all other govern-mental impositions
and  charges  of  every kind and nature whatsoever, regardless of whether now
customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto and regardless of
whether  resulting  from  increased  rate  and/or  valuation,  or  whether
extraordinary  or  ordinary,  general  or  special, unforeseen or foreseen, or
similar  or  dissimilar  to  any  of the foregoing (all of the foregoing being
hereinafter  collectively  called  "Tax" or "Taxes") which, at any time during
the  Lease  Term, shall be applicable or against the Premises, or shall become
due  and  payable and a lien or charge upon the Premises under or by virtue of
any  present  or  future  laws,  statutes,  ordinances,  regulations, or other
requirements  of  any  governmental  authority  whatsoever.    The  term
"Environmental  Surcharge"  shall include any and all expenses, taxes, charges
or  penalties  imposed  by  the  Federal  Department  of  Energy,  Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Clean Air Act, or any regulations
promulgated  thereunder,  or  any  other  local, state or federal governmental
agency  or  entity  now  or  hereafter  vested with the power to impose taxes,
assessments  or other types of surcharges as a means of controlling or abating
environmental  pollution  or the use of energy in regard to the use, operation
or  occupancy  of  the  Premises.    The  term  "Tax"  shall  include, without
limitation,  all  taxes,  assessments,  levies,  fees,  impositions or charges
levied,  imposed, assessed, measured, or based in any manner whatsoever (i) in
whole  or in part on the Rent payable by Lessee under this Lease, (ii) upon or
with  respect  to  the  use,  possession,  occupancy,  leasing,  operation  or
management  of  the  Premises,  (iii) upon this transaction or any document to
which  Lessee is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in
the  Premises,  (iv)  upon  Lessee's  business  operations  conducted  at the
Premises,  (v)  upon,  measured  by or reasonably attributable to the cost or
value  of  Lessee's equipment, furniture, fixtures and other personal property
located  on  the  Premises  or the cost or value of any leasehold improvements
made  in  or  to the Premises by or for Lessee, regardless of whether title to
such  improvements  shall  be  in  Lessor  or  Lessee,  or  (vi) in lieu of or
equivalent  to  any  Tax  set forth in this Section 16.  In the event any such
Taxes are payable by Lessor and it shall not be lawful for Lessee to reimburse
Lessor  for such Taxes, then the Rent payable thereunder shall be increased to
net  Lessor  the same net rent after imposition of any such Tax upon Lessor as
would have been payable to Lessor prior to the imposition of any such Tax.  It
is  the intention of the parties that Lessor shall be free from all such Taxes
and  all other governmental impositions and  charges of every kind and nature
whatsoever.    However,  nothing  contained  in  this Section 16 shall require
Lessee  to  pay  any Federal or State income, franchise, estate, inheritance,
succession,  transfer  or  excess  profits  tax  imposed upon Lessor.   If any
general  or  special  assessment  is levied and assessed against the Premises,
Lessor  agrees  to  use its best reasonable efforts to cause the assessment to
become a lien on the Premises securing repayment of a bond sold to finance the
improvements  to which the assessment relates which is payable in installments
of  principal  and  interest  over  the  maximum  term al-lowed by law.  It is
understood  and  agreed  that Lessee's obligation under this paragraph will be
prorated  to  reflect the Commencement Date and the end of the Lease Term.  It
is  further  understood  that  if Taxes cover the Premises and Lessee does not
occupy  the entire Premises, the Taxes will be allocated to the portion of the
Premises  occupied  by  Lessee  based  on  a  pro-rata square footage or other
equitable  basis,  as  determined  by  Lessor.

Subject  to  any limitations or restrictions imposed by any deeds of trust or
mortgages  now  or  hereafter covering or affecting the Premises, Lessee shall
have  the  right  to  contest  or  review the amount or validity of any Tax by
appropriate  legal  proceedings  but which is not to be deemed or construed in
any way as relieving, modifying or extending Lessee's covenant to pay such Tax
at  the  time and in the manner as provided in this Section 16.  However, as a
condition  of  Lessee's  right  to  contest, if such contested Tax is not paid
before such contest and if the legal proceedings shall not operate to prevent
or  stay  the  collection  of  the  Tax  so  contested,  Lessee  shall, before
instituting  any  such  proceeding,  protect  the Premises and the interest of
Lessor  and  of  the  beneficiary  of  a  deed  of trust or the mortgagee of a
mortgage  affecting  the  Premises  against  any  lien upon the Premises by a
surety  bond,  issued  by  an insurance company acceptable to Lessor and in an
amount  equal  to  one  and one-half (1 1/2) times the amount contested or, at
Lessor's  option,  the  amount  of  the  contested  Tax  and  the interest and
penalties  in connection therewith.  Any contest as to the validity or amount
of  any  Tax,  whether  before  or  after  payment, shall be made by Lessee in
Lessee's own name, or if required by law, in the name of Lessor or both Lessor
and Lessee.  Lessee shall defend, indemnify  and hold harmless Lessor from and
against  any  and  all  costs  or  expenses,  including  attorneys'  fees,  in
connection  with  any  such  proceedings brought by Lessee, whether in its own
name  or  not.  Lessee  shall  be  entitled  to  retain any refund of any such
contested  Tax  and  penalties  or  interest  thereon  which have been paid by
Lessee.   Nothing contained herein shall be construed as affecting or limiting
Lessor's  right  to  contest  any  Tax  at  Lessor's  expense.

17.  NOTICES: Unless otherwise provided for in this Lease, any and all written
notices or other communication (the "Communication") to be given in connection
with  this  Lease  shall  be  given  in writing and shall be given by personal
delivery, facsimile transmission or by mailing by registered or certified mail

sealed  envelope  addressed  to  the  intended  recipient  as  follows:

or  such  other addresses, facsimile number or individual as may be designated
by  a  Communication  given by a party to the other parties as aforesaid.  Any
Communication  given by personal delivery shall be conclusively deemed to have
been  given and received on a date it is so delivered at such address provided
that  such  date  is  a  business  day,  otherwise  on  the first business day
following  its  receipt,  and if given by registered or certified mail, on the
day  on  which delivery is made or refused or if given by recognized overnight
courier,  on  the  first  business  day  following deposit with such overnight
courier  and  if  given  by facsimile transmission, on the day on which it was
transmitted  provided  such  day is a business day, failing which, on the next
business  day  thereafter.

18.  ENTRY  BY LESSOR: Lessee shall permit Lessor and its agents to enter into
and  upon  said  Premises  at all reasonable times using the minimum amount of
interference and inconvenience to Lessee and Lessee's business, subject to any
security  regulations of Lessee, for the purpose of inspecting the same or for
the  purpose  of maintaining the building in which said Premises are situated,
or  for  the  purpose of making repairs, alterations or additions to any other
portion  of  said  building,  including  the  erection and maintenance of such
scaffolding, canopies, fences and props as may be required, without any rebate
of  Rent  and  without  any  liability to Lessee for any loss of occupation or
quiet  enjoyment  of  the Premises; and shall permit Lessor and his agents, at
any  time within ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Lease Term, to place
upon  said  Premises any usual or ordinary "For Sale" or "For Lease" signs and
exhibit  the  Premises  to  prospective  tenants  at  reasonable  hours.

19. DESTRUCTION OF PREMISES: In the event of a partial destruction of the said
Premises  during  the  Lease  Term from any cause which is covered by Lessor's
property  insurance,  Lessor  shall  forthwith  repair the same, provided such
repairs  can  be made within ninety (90) days after receipt of building permit
under  the  laws  and  regulations  of  State,  Federal,  County, or Municipal
authorities,  but  such partial destruction shall in no way annul or void this
Lease,  except  that  Lessee shall be entitled to a proportionate reduction of
Rent  while  such repairs are being made to the extent of payments received by
Lessor  under  its  Loss  of  Rents  Insurance  coverage.  With respect to any
partial destruction which Lessor is obligated to repair or may elect to repair
under  the terms of this paragraph, the provision of Section 1932, Subdivision
2,  and  of  Section  1933,  Subdivision  4, of the Civil Code of the State of
California  are waived by Lessee.  In the event that the building in which the
subject  Premises  may  be  situated  is  destroyed  to an extent greater than
thirty-three  and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the replacement cost thereof,
Lessor  may,  at  its  sole option, elect to terminate this Lease, whether the
subject  Premises  is  insured or not.  A total destruction of the building in
which  the  subject  Premises  are  situated  shall  terminate  this  Lease.
Notwithstanding  the  above,  Lessor is only obligated to repair or rebuild to
the  extent  of  available insurance proceeds including any deductible amount.
Should  Lessor  determine  that  insufficient  or  no  insurance  proceeds are
available  for  repair  or  reconstruction  of  Premises,  Lessor, at its sole
option,  may  terminate the Lease.  Lessee shall have the option of continuing
this  Lease  by  agreeing  to  pay  all  repair costs to the subject Premises.

20.  ASSIGNMENT  AND  SUBLETTING:  Lessee  shall not assign this Lease, or any
interest  therein, and shall not sublet the said Premises or any part thereof,
or  any  right  or privilege appurtenant thereto, or cause any other person or
entity  (a  bona fide subsidiary or affiliate of Lessee excepted) to occupy or
use  the Premises, or any portion thereof, without the advance written consent
of  Lessor.    Any such assignment or subletting without such consent shall be
void,  and  shall,  at  the  option of the Lessor, terminate this Lease.  This
Lease  shall  not,  or  shall  any  interest therein, be assignable, as to the
interest  of  Lessee,  by  operation  of  law,  without the written consent of
Lessor.    Notwithstanding Lessor's obligation to provide reasonable approval,
Lessor  reserves  the right to withhold its consent for any proposed sublessee
or  assignee  of  Lessee  if  the  proposed sublessee or assignee is a user or
generator  of  Hazardous  Materials.    If Lessee desires to assign its rights
under  this  Lease or to sublet, all or a portion of the subject Premises to a
party  other  than a bona fide subsidiary or affiliate of Lessee, Lessee shall
first notify Lessor of the proposed terms and conditions of such assignment or
subletting.    Lessor  shall  have  the right of first refusal to enter into a
direct  Lessor-lessee  relationship  with such party under such proposed terms
and  conditions,  in  which  event Lessee shall be relieved of its obligations
hereunder to the extent of the Lessor-lessee relationship entered into between
Lessor and such third party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may assign
this  Lease  to  a  successor  in  interest, whether by merger or acquisition,
provided  there  is no substantial reduction in the net worth of the resulting
entity  and  the  resulting  entity  is  not  a user or generator of Hazardous
Materials.    Whether  or  not Lessor's consent to a sublease or assignment is
required,  in  the  event  of  any sublease or assignment, Lessee shall be and
shall  remain  primarily  liable  for  the  performance  of  all  conditions,
covenants,  and obligations of Lessee hereunder and, in the event of a default
by  an assignee or sublessee, Lessor may proceed directly against the original
Lessee  hereunder  and/or  any other predecessor of such assignee or sublessee
without  the  necessity  of  exhausting  remedies  against  said  assignee  or
sublessee.    Notwithstanding  the above, Lessor hereby agrees that Lessee may
sublease up to 90,000 square feet of the Premises without Lessor's approval on
a one time basis for a maximum period of sixty (60) months with no extensions.

21. CONDEMNATION: If any part of the Premises shall be taken for any public or
quasi-public  use,  under any statute or by right of eminent domain or private
purchase  in  lieu thereof, and a part thereof remains which is susceptible of
occupation  hereunder,  this Lease shall as to the part so taken, terminate as
of  the  date  title vests in the condemnor or purchaser, and the Rent payable
hereunder  shall  be  adjusted so that the Lessee shall be required to pay for
the  remainder of the Lease Term only that portion of Rent as the value of the
part  remaining.  The rental adjustment resulting will be computed at the same
Rental  rate  for the remaining part not taken; however, Lessor shall have the
option  to terminate this Lease as of the date when title to the part so taken
vests  in  the  condemnor  or purchaser.  If all of the Premises, or such part
thereof  be  taken  so  that  there  does not remain a portion susceptible for
occupation  hereunder, this Lease shall thereupon terminate.  If a part or all
of  the  Premises be taken, all compensation awarded upon such taking shall be
payable  to  the  Lessor.  Lessee may file a separate claim and be entitled to
any  award  granted  to  Lessee.

22. EFFECTS OF CONVEYANCE: The term "Lessor" as used in this Lease, means only
the  owner  for  the  time  being  of  the  land and building constituting the
Premises,  so  that,  in the event of any sale of said land or building, or in
the  event of a Lease of said building, Lessor shall be and hereby is entirely
freed  and  relieved of all covenants and obligations of Lessor hereunder, and
it  shall  be  deemed  and  construed,  without  further agreement between the
parties  and  the  purchaser  of any such sale, or the Lessor of the building,
that  the  purchaser or lessor of the building has assumed and agreed to carry
out  any  and  all  covenants and obligations of the Lessor hereunder.  If any
security  is  given by Lessee to secure the faithful performance of all or any
of  the covenants of this Lease on the part of Lessee, Lessor may transfer and
deliver  the  security,  as  such,  to  the  purchaser at any such sale of the
building,  and  thereupon  the  Lessor  shall  be  discharged from any further
liability.

23. SUBORDINATION: This Lease, in the event Lessor notifies Lessee in writing,
shall  be  subordinate  to  any  ground  lease,  deed  of  trust,  or  other
hypothecation  for  security now or hereafter placed upon the real property at
which the Premises are a part and to any and all advances made on the security
thereof  and  to renewals, modifications, replacements and extensions thereof.
Lessee  agrees  to  promptly  execute  any  documents which may be required to
effectuate  such  subordination. Notwithstanding such subordination, if Lessee
is  not  in  default  and so long as Lessee shall pay the Rent and observe and
perform  all  of  the  provisions  and  covenants  required  under this Lease,
Lessee's  right  to quiet possession of the Premises shall not be disturbed or
effected  by  any  subordination.

24.  WAIVER:  The  waiver  by  Lessor  of  any breach of any term, covenant or
condition,  herein  contained  shall  not  be construed to be a waiver of such
term,  covenant or condition or any subsequent breach of the same or any other
term,  covenant  or condition therein contained.  The subsequent acceptance of
Rent hereunder by Lessor shall not be deemed to be a waiver of Lessee's breach
of  any  term,  covenant,  or  condition  of  the  Lease.

25.  HOLDING  OVER:  Any holding over after the end of the Lease Term requires
Lessor's  written  approval  prior  to  the  end  of  the  Lease  Term, which,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Lease, Lessor may withhold.  Such
holding  over  shall  be construed to be a tenancy at sufferance from month to
month.  Lessee shall pay to Lessor monthly base rent equal to one and one-half
(1.5)  times  the  monthly  base rent installment due in the last month of the
Lease Term and all other additional rent and all other terms and conditions of
the  Lease  shall apply, so far as applicable.  Holding over by Lessee without
written  approval  of  Lessor  shall  subject  Lessee  to  the liabilities and
obligations  provided for in this Lease and by law, including, but not limited
to  those  in Section 2 of this Lease.  Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor
harmless  against  any  loss  or  liability resulting from any delay caused by
Lessee  in surrendering the Premises, including without limitation, any claims
made  or penalties incurred by any succeeding lessee or by Lessor.  No holding
over  shall  be  deemed or construed to exercise any option to extend or renew
this  Lease in lieu of full and timely exercise of any such option as required
hereunder.

26.  LESSOR'S  LIABILITY:  If  Lessee  should recover a money judgment against
Lessor  arising in connection with this Lease, the judgment shall be satisfied
only out of the Lessor's interest in the Premises and neither Lessor or any of
its  partners  shall  be  liable  personally  for  any  deficiency.

27.  ESTOPPEL  CERTIFICATES:  Lessee  shall at any time during the Lease Term,
upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice from Lessor, execute and
deliver  to  Lessor  a  statement  in  writing  certifying that, this Lease is
unmodified  and  in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature
of  such  modification) and the dates to which the Rent and other charges have
been  paid  in  advance,  if  any,  and  acknowledging  that there are not, to
Lessee's  knowledge,  any  uncured defaults on the part of Lessor hereunder or
specifying  such  defaults  if  they  are  claimed.  Any such statement may be
conclusively  relied  upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of the
Premises.  Lessee's failure to deliver such a statement within such time shall
be conclusive upon the Lessee that (a) this Lease is in full force and effect,
without  modification except as may be represented by Lessor; (b) there are no
uncured  defaults  in  Lessor's  performance.

28.  TIME:  Time  is  of  the  essence  of  the  Lease.

29. CAPTIONS: The headings on titles to the paragraphs of this Lease are not a
part  of  this  Lease  and  shall  have  no  effect  upon  the construction or
interpretation  of  any  part  thereof.    This instrument contains all of the
agreements  and  conditions  made  between  the  parties hereto and may not be
modified  orally or in any other manner than by an agreement in writing signed
by  all  of  the  parties  hereto  or their respective successors in interest.

30.  PARTY  NAMES:  Landlord  and Tenant may be used in various places in this
Lease  as  a  substitute  for  Lessor  and  Lessee  respectively.

31.  EARTHQUAKE  INSURANCE:  As  a  condition  of Lessor agreeing to waive the
requirement  for  earthquake  insurance,  Lessee  agrees  that it will pay, as
additional  Rent, which shall be included in the monthly CAC, an amount not to
exceed  Seventy-Two  Thousand  Dollars  ($72,000)  per  year  for  earthquake
insurance if Lessor desires to obtain some form of earthquake insurance in the
future,  if and when available, on terms acceptable to Lessor as determined in
the  sole  and  absolute  discretion  of  Lessor.

32.  HABITUAL  DEFAULT:  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 14 herein, Lessor and Lessee agree that if Lessee shall have defaulted
in  the payment of Rent for three or more times during any twelve month period
during  the  Lease Term, then such conduct shall, at the option of the Lessor,
represent a separate event of default which cannot be cured by Lessee.  Lessee
acknowledges  that  the  purpose  of  this  provision is to prevent repetitive
defaults  by  the  Lessee  under the Lease, which constitute a hardship to the
Lessor  and  deprive  the  Lessor  of  the  timely  performance  by the Lessee
hereunder.

agrees  to  indemnify  and  hold  Lessee  harmless  against  any  claim, cost,
liability or cause of action asserted by any broker or finder claiming through

35.  OPTION  TO  EXTEND
A.  Option:  Lessor hereby grants to Lessee one (1) option to extend the Lease
Term,  with  the  extended  term  to be for a period of five (5) years, on the
following  terms  and  conditions:

(i)  Lessee  shall give Lessor written notice of its exercise of its option to
extend  no  earlier  than twenty-four (24) calendar months, nor later than six
(6)  calendar  months  before  the Lease Term would end but for said exercise.
Time  is  of  the  essence.

(ii)  Lessee  may  not extend the Lease Term pursuant to any option granted by
this  Section 35 if Lessee is in default as of the date of the exercise of its
option.   If Lessee has committed a default by Lessee as defined in Section 14
or  32 that has not been cured or waived by Lessor in writing by the date that
any extended term is to commence, then Lessor may elect not to allow the Lease
Term to be extended, notwithstanding any notice given by Lessee of an exercise
of  this  option  to  extend.

(iii)  All  terms and conditions of this Lease shall apply during the extended
term,  except  that  the base rent and rental increases for each extended term
shall  be  determined  as  provided  in  Section  35  (B)  below

(iv)  Lessee  must provide Lessor written notice of its exercise of its option
as provided hereunder at least nine (9) months before the Lease Term would end
but  for  said  exercise for purposes of negotiating rental terms.  Lessee may
withdraw its notice of exercise of an extension option for any reason prior to
six  (6)  months  before  the  Lease  Term  would  end  but for said exercise.
Lessor  shall  provide Lessee with Lessor's proposed base monthly rent for the
option  period  within twenty (20) days of Lessee's written request.  However,
once  Lessee  delivers  a  notice of exercise of an option to extend the Lease
Term it may not be withdrawn unless notice in writing is provided to Lessor at
least  six  (6)  months  before the Lease Term would end but for said exercise
and,  subject  to the provisions of this Section 35, such notice shall operate
to  extend  the Lease Term.   Upon any extension of the Lease Term pursuant to
this  Section 35, the term "Lease Term" as used in this Lease shall thereafter
include  the  then  extended  term.

(v)  The  option  rights  of  Xilinx,  Inc.  granted under this Section 35 are
granted  for  Xilinx,  Inc.'s  personal  benefit  and  may  not be assigned or
transferred  by Xilinx, Inc. or exercised if Xilinx, Inc. is not occupying the
Premises  at  the  time  of  exercise.

B.  Extended  Term  Rent  -  Option  Period: The monthly Rent for the Premises
during  the  extended  term  shall equal ninety-five percent (95%) of the fair
market  monthly  Rent  for  the  Premises  as  of the commencement date of the
extended term, but in no case, less than the Rent during the last month of the
prior  Lease  term.   Promptly upon Lessee's exercise of the option to extend,
Lessee  and  Lessor shall meet and attempt to agree on the fair market monthly
Rent  for  the  Premises as of the commencement date of the extended term.  In
the  event  the  parties fail to agree upon the amount of the monthly Rent for
the  extended  term  prior  to  commencement thereof, the monthly Rent for the
extended  term  shall  be  determined by appraisal in the manner hereafter set
forth;  provided,  however,  that  in  no event shall the monthly Rent for the
extended  term  be  less  than in the immediate preceding period.  Annual base
rent  increases during the extended term shall be three percent (3%) per year.
In  the  event it becomes necessary under this paragraph to determine the fair
market monthly Rent of the Premises by appraisal, Lessor and Lessee each shall
appoint  a  real  estate  appraiser  who  shall  be  a  member of the American
Institute  of  Real  Estate Appraiser ("AIREA") and such appraisers shall each
determine  the  fair  market monthly Rent for the Premises taking into account
the value of the Premises and the amenities provided by the outside areas, the
common areas, and the Building, and prevailing comparable Rentals in the area.
Such  appraisers  shall,  within  twenty  (20)  business  days  after  their
appointment,  complete  their appraisals and submit their appraisal reports to
Lessor  and  Lessee.    If  the  fair  market  monthly  Rent  of  the Premises
established  in  the two (2) appraisals varies by five percent (5%) or less of
the  higher  Rent,  the average of the two shall be controlling.  If said fair
market  monthly  Rent  varies  by  more  than  five percent (5%) of the higher
Rental,  said  appraisers,  within  ten (10) days after submission of the last
appraisal,  shall appoint a third appraiser who shall be a member of the AIREA
and  who  shall  also  be  experienced  in  the  appraisal  of Rent values and
adjustment  practices  for  commercial  properties  in  the  vicinity  of  the
Premises.   Such third appraiser shall, within twenty (20) business days after
his  appointment,  determine  by appraisal the fair market monthly Rent of the
Premises  taking  into  account the same factors referred to above, and submit
his  appraisal  report  to  Lessor  and  Lessee.  The fair market monthly Rent
determined  by  the  third  appraiser  for  the Premises shall be controlling,
unless  it  is  less  than  that  set  forth in the lower appraisal previously
obtained,  in  which case the value set forth in said lower appraisal shall be
controlling,  or  unless  it  is  greater  than  that  set forth in the higher
appraisal  previously  obtained  in which case the Rent set for in said higher
appraisal  shall  be controlling.  If either Lessor or Lessee fails to appoint
an  appraiser, or if an appraiser appointed by either of them fails, after his
appointment  to  submit his appraisal within the required period in accordance
with  the  foregoing,  the  appraisal  submitted  by  the  appraiser  properly
appointed  and  timely  submitting his appraisal shall be controlling.  If the
two appraisers appointed by Lessor and Lessee are unable to agree upon a third
appraiser  within  the  required  period  in  accordance  with  the foregoing,
application  shall be made within twenty (20) days thereafter by either Lessor
or  Lessee to AIREA, which shall appoint a member of said institute willing to
serve  as appraiser.  The cost of all appraisals under this subparagraph shall
be  borne  equally  be  Lessor  and  Lessee.

36.  APPROVALS:  Whenever  in  this  Lease the Lessor's or Lessee's consent is
required,  such  consent  shall not be unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld or
delayed.  In the event that the Lessor or Lessee does not respond to a request
for any consents which may be required of it in this Lease within ten business
days  of  the request of such consent in writing by the Lessee or Lessor, such
consent  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  given  by  the  Lessor  or Lessee.

37. AUTHORITY: Each party executing this Lease represents and warrants that he
or  she  is  duly authorized to execute and deliver the Lease.  If executed on
behalf  of  a  corporation,  that the Lease is executed in accordance with the
by-laws  of  said  corporation (or a partnership that the Lease is executed in
accordance  with the partnership agreement of such partnership), that no other
party's  approval  or  consent to such execution and delivery is required, and
that  the  Lease is binding upon said individual, corporation (or partnership)
as  the  case  may  be  in  accordance  with  its  terms.

38.  INDEMNIFICATION  OF  LESSOR:  Except  to  the  extent  caused by the sole
negligence  or  willful  misconduct of Lessor or Lessor's Agents, Lessee shall
defend,  indemnify  and  hold  Lessor  harmless  from  and against any and all
obligations,  losses,  costs,  expenses,  claims,  demands,  attorney's  fees,
investigation  costs  or liabilities on account of, or arising out of the use,
condition or occupancy of the Premises or any act or omission to act of Lessee
or  Lessee's  Agents  or  any  occurrence  in, upon, about or at the Premises,
including,  without limitation, any of the foregoing provisions arising out of
the  use,  generation, manufacture, installation, release, discharge, storage,
or  disposal  of  Hazardous  Materials  by  Lessee  or Lessee's Agents.  It is
understood  that  Lessee  is  and  shall  be  in control and possession of the
Premises  and  that  Lessor shall in no event be responsible or liable for any
injury  or damage or injury to any person whatsoever, happening on, in, about,
or  in  connection  with  the  Premises,  or  for  any injury or damage to the
Premises  or  any  part  thereof.    This Lease is entered into on the express
condition  that  Lessor  shall  not be liable for, or suffer loss by reason of
injury  to  person  or  property, from whatever cause, which in any way may be
connected  with  the  use,  condition or occupancy of the Premises or personal
property  located  herein.  The  provisions of this Lease permitting Lessor to
enter  and  inspect  the  Premises  are  for the purpose of enabling Lessor to
become informed as to whether Lessee is complying with the terms of this Lease
and  Lessor  shall  be  under  no  duty to enter, inspect or to perform any of
Lessee's  covenants  set forth in this Lease.  Lessee shall further indemnify,
defend  and  hold  harmless Lessor from and against any and all claims arising
from  any  breach  or default in the performance of any obligation to Lessee's
part to be performed under the terms of this Lease.  The provisions of Section
38  shall  survive  the  Lease  Term or earlier termination of this Lease with
respect  to  any  damage,  injury  or  death  occurring during the Lease Term.

40.  OPTION  TO  PURCHASE:  Lessor  grants to Lessee an option to purchase the
Premises  in  accordance  with  the  following  terms  and  conditions:

(a) In order to exercise this option to purchase, Lessee must notify Lessor in
writing  of  such  exercise between the sixth and twelfth months following the
Commencement  Date  of  the  initial  Lease Term of any property.  This option
shall be null and void if not exercised as stated herein before the expiration
of  the  twelfth  month  of  the  initial  Lease  Term.

 (b)  The  purchase  price  shall  be  payable  in  cash  or other immediately
available  funds,  at  close  of escrow, which shall occur on a date chosen by
Lessor  but in any event (i) no earlier than thirty (30) days after Lessee has
exercised its option to purchase and (ii) not later than the sixth month after
Lessee  has  exercised  its  option  to  purchase.

(c)  Upon payment of said purchase price, Lessor shall deliver title to Lessee
by  grant  deed,  free  and  clear  of  all  claims,  liens,  restrictions and
encumbrances,  other than current taxes, assessments, easements (all as of the
date  of  Lessee's  exercise  of  its option) and anything of record or not of
record  resulting from the acts or omissions of Lessee, and such other matters
as  Lessor  and  Lessee  may  mutually  agree  upon.

(d)  Upon  execution of this Lease, Lessee shall deposit with Lessor an amount
equal  to  Twenty-Eight  Million  Three  Hundred  Fifty-One  Thousand  Dollars
($28,351,000)  (the  "Option  Deposit").  This deposit shall be in addition to
all  other  deposits  required  hereunder.   If Lessee elects to exercise this
option  to purchase, the purchase price shall be $28,351,000, and Lessor shall
credit  the Option Deposit against such purchase price as payment in full.  In
addition,  if  Lessee  elects to exercise this option to purchase, the prepaid
first  year's  rent  shall  be  forfeited  to Lessor, and Lessor shall have no
obligation to refund any of such prepaid rent to Lessee regardless of when the
close  of  escrow shall occur.  If Lessee elects not to exercise the option to
purchase,  Lessor  shall  refund  the  Option Deposit in full to Lessee on the
first  anniversary  of  the  Commencement  Date,  without  interest.

(e)  Both Lessor and Lessee agree to cooperate with each other in effectuating
a  tax-deferred  exchange  of  the  Property  pursuant  to Section 1031 of the
Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended.    Each party agrees to fully
cooperate with any such exchange, provided that each party's obligation to the
other  shall  be  limited to its purchase or sale of the Property, as the case
may  be,  in  accordance  with  this  paragraph  40  and the purchase and sale
agreement  to  be  executed  by  the parties as herein provided; neither party
shall  have  any  greater  or different obligations and no lesser or different
rights  from  those  set  forth  in  this paragraph and such purchase and sale
agreement;    neither  party shall be put to any additional cost or expense on
account  of any such exchange undertaken by the other party; and neither party
shall have any responsibility whatsoever for the tax or nontax consequences of
an  exchange  undertaken  by  the other party, or any liability arising out of
holding  title  to  facilitate  such  exchange (for which the exchanging party
shall  indemnify  the cooperating party), including without limitation whether
the  tax  effects  of  any such exchange contemplated by such party and/or any
third  party  to  the  exchange  are  in  fact successfully realized.  No such
exchange  shall  delay  or  excuse  any  of the time periods specified in this
paragraph  or in the purchase and sale agreement to be executed by the parties
as  herein  provided.  Accordingly, if an exchange is contemplated but is not,
for  whatever reason, completed on the closing date agreed upon by the parties
for  the  consummation  of  the  sale  of  the  Premises,  the party which has
undertaken  such  exchange  (or  both parties, if both parties have undertaken
exchanges)  nevertheless  shall be obligated to close on the purchase and sale
of  the  Premises at the time and in the manner such close would have occurred
had  such party (or both parties, if both parties have undertaken an exchange)
not  undertaken  an  exchange.

(f)  There  shall  be no prorations as of the close of escrow and Lessee shall
assume any assessments and Lessee shall pay all closing costs, transfer taxes,
and  escrow  fees.

(g)  Lessee  shall  purchase  the  Premises  in  an  "as is" condition without
warranty  or  representation  from  Lessor.

(h) Concurrently herewith Lessee and Lessor have entered an Option to Purchase
which  will  be  recorded  by  Lessor.

40.  SUCCESSORS  AND  ASSIGNS:  The  covenants and conditions herein contained
shall,  subject  to  the  provisions  as  to assignment, apply to and bind the
heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns of all of the parties
hereto;  and  all  of the parties hereto shall be jointly and severally liable
hereunder.

41. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS: All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative
and  not alternative to the extent permitted by law and are in addition to all
other  rights  or  remedies  in  law  and  in  equity.

42.  CHOICE  OF LAW:  This lease shall be construed and enforced in accordance
with  the  substantive  laws  of the State of California.  The language of all
parts  of  this  lease shall in all cases be construed as a whole according to
its  fair  meaning  and  not  strictly for or against either Lessor or Lessee.

43. ENTIRE AGREEMENT:  This Lease is the entire agreement between the parties,
and  there  are no agreements or representations between the parties except as
expressed  herein.    Except  as  otherwise provided for herein, no subsequent
change or addition to this Lease shall be binding unless in writing and signed
by  the  parties  hereto.

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  Lessor and Lessee have executed these presents, the day
and  year  first  above  written.
