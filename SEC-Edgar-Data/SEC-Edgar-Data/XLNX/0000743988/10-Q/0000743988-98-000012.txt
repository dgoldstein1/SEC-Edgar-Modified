            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.        The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been
prepared  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles and
should  be  read  in conjunction with the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company)
consolidated  financial  statements  for the fiscal year ended March 28, 1998.
The  balance  sheet  at  March  28,  1998  is  derived  from audited financial
statements.    The  interim financial statements are unaudited but reflect all
adjustments  which  are,  in the opinion of management, of a normal, recurring
nature  necessary  to  present  fairly  the  statements of financial position,
results  of  operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.  The
results  for  the three-month period ended October 3, 1998 are not necessarily
indicative  of  the  results  that  may be expected for the fiscal year ending
April  3,  1999, the Saturday nearest March 31.  The three-month and six-month
periods  ended  October  3, 1998 consisted of fourteen and twenty-seven weeks,
respectively.   The three-month and six-month periods ended September 27, 1997
consisted  of  thirteen  and  twenty-six  weeks,  respectively.

2.        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market  (estimated  net realizable value).  Inventories at October 3, 1998 and
March  28,  1998  are  as  follows:

3.       The computation of basic net income per share for all years presented
is derived from the information on the face of the income statement, and there
are  no  reconciling  items  in  either  the  numerator  or  denominator.
Additionally,  there are no reconciling items in the numerator used to compute
diluted net income per share.  The total shares used in the denominator of the
diluted  net income per share calculation includes 3.0 million and 3.5 million
incremental  common  shares attributable to outstanding options for the second
quarter and first six months of fiscal year 1999, respectively, as compared to
7.5  million  and  7.7  million  in  the  comparable  fiscal  1998  periods,
respectively.

The shares issuable upon conversion of long-term debt to equity, approximately
4.9 million shares, were not included in the calculation of diluted net income
per  share  as  their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect for all
periods presented.  In addition, outstanding options to purchase approximately
5.8 million and 4.4 million shares for the second quarter and first six months
of  fiscal  year 1999, respectively, and 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares in
the  comparable  fiscal  1998 periods, respectively, under the Company's Stock
Option  Plan  were  not  included  in the treasury stock calculation to derive
diluted  income  per  share as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive
effect.

4.     The Company has adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  130  (FASB 130), "Reporting Comprehensive Income" in the first quarter of
fiscal  1999.  FASB 130 established standards for the reporting and disclosure
of  comprehensive  income  and  its components; however, the disclosure has no
impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position
or  cash  flows.  Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a
company  during  a period resulting from certain transactions and other events
and circumstances, excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners
and  distributions  to  owners.    The  difference  between  net  income  and
comprehensive  income  for  Xilinx  is  from  foreign  currency  translation
adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's available-for-sale
securities.

The  components  of  comprehensive  income for the three and six month periods
ended  October  3,  1998  and  September  27,  1997  are  as  follows:

5.        The Company is currently involved in various legal proceedings, (see
Part  II,  Item  1,  Legal  Proceedings).    The legal proceedings with Altera
Corporation  and  Joseph  Ward are of an uncertain nature and the lawsuits are
still  in the pre-discovery or pre-trial stage, therefore the ultimate outcome
of  these matters cannot be determined at this time.  Management believes that
it  has  meritorious  defenses to each claim and is defending them vigorously.
In  addition,  on  July  31, 1998, the Lemelson Foundation Partnership filed a
lawsuit  in  the  United States District Court in Phoenix, Arizona against the
Company  and  twenty-five (25) other United States semiconductor companies for
infringement  of  certain of its patents.  The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot  be  determined  at  this time.  However, management does not currently
expect  that  this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.    The  foregoing  is  a
forward-looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties, and the ultimate
outcome  of this matter could differ materially due to the uncertain nature of
the  litigation.

6.          The  Company,  United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and other
parties  have  entered  into  a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication
facility  in  Taiwan,  known as United Silicon Inc. (USIC).  During the second
quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company invested additional equity of $5.4 million
in  USIC.  However, as other parties increased their equity in USIC during the
most  recent  investment,  the  Company decreased its equity ownership to 20%.
The  Company  will  still  receive up to 31.25% of the wafers produced in this
facility.

7.          During  the  second quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company's Board of
Directors  authorized another stock repurchase program whereby up to 3,000,000
shares  of  its  common stock may be purchased in the open market from time to
time  as  market  and  business  conditions warrant.  The Company plans to use
shares  repurchased  from  this  program  and  all  previous  stock repurchase
programs  to  meet  the  stock  requirements of the Company's Stock Option and
Employee  Qualified Stock Purchase plans.  During the quarter ended October 3,
1998,  the Company repurchased a total of 1,375,000 shares of common stock for
$51.8  million, and reissued 462,000 shares during the period for Stock Option
exercises  and  Stock  Purchase Plan requirements.  As of October 3, 1998, the
Company  was  holding  approximately  2.9  million  shares  of treasury stock.


Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations


The  following  discussion  contains forward-looking statements, which involve
numerous  risks  and  uncertainties.    Actual  results may differ materially.
Certain  of  these  risks  and  uncertainties  are  discussed  under  "Factors
Affecting  Future  Operating  Results".

RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS:    SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 1999
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPARED  TO  THE  SECOND  QUARTER  AND  FIRST  SIX  MONTHS  OF  FISCAL  1998
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

REVENUES

Revenues  of $156.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 1999 represented a
4.1%  increase  from  the  comparable  prior  year  quarter.  The increase was
primarily  attributable  to  the  revenue  growth  of  the Company's XC4000EX,
XC4000XL  and  XC9500 product lines.  The increase was partially offset by the
decreased  revenues  relating to the Company's mature XC4000 family.  Revenues
for  the  first  six  months of fiscal 1999 were $308.0 million, a 1% decrease
from the $311.0 million achieved in the prior year comparable period.  Despite
the  growth  in  second quarter revenues, revenues for the first six months of
fiscal  1999 were impacted by the overall slowdown in the semiconductor market
and  the  economic  environment  in  Japan  and  Southeast  Asia.  The Company
believes that these factors, as well as others described in "Factors Affecting
Future Operating Results," could continue to impact revenues in the near term.

The  Company  currently classifies its product offerings into four categories.
The  Base  products  consist of the Company's mature product families that use
technology  greater than 0.6 micron; this includes the XC2000, XC3000, XC3100,
XC4000  and  XC7000 families.  Revenues for Base products represented 22.8% of
total  revenues  in the second quarter of fiscal 1999, as compared to 42.2% in
the second quarter of fiscal 1998.  Mainstream products use 0.5 and 0.6 micron
technology and include the XC4000E, XC4000EX, XC5200 and XC9500 product lines.
Mainstream  products represented 43.6% of total revenues in the second quarter
of  fiscal  1999 and 39.3% of total revenues in the prior year second quarter.
Mainstream  product revenues were primarily driven by the revenue increases in
the  XC4000EX  and XC9500 product lines.  Advanced products include our newest
technologies  on  .35  micron and smaller which include the XC4000XL, XC4000XV
and  Spartan  product  lines.  Advanced products represented 20.6% and 6.0% of
total  revenues  in  the second quarter of fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The  revenue  increase for the Advanced products was driven primarily from the
XC4000XL product family.  The Company's Support products make up the remainder
of  the  product  offerings  and  include serial proms, HardWire and software.
Support  products  represented 13.0% and 12.5% of total revenues in the second
quarter  of  fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The Company has historically
been  able  to  offset much of the revenue declines of its mature technologies
with  increased revenues from newer technologies, although no assurance can be
given  that  the  Company  will  continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.

International  revenues represented approximately 31% of total revenues in the
second  quarter  of fiscal year 1999 in comparison to approximately 37% in the
prior  year  quarter.    International  revenues are derived from customers in
Europe,  Japan  and Asia Pacific/Rest of World which represented approximately
21%,  6%  and  4%  of  the  Company's worldwide revenues, respectively, in the
second  quarter of fiscal 1999 as compared to approximately 21%, 11% and 6% of
worldwide  revenues,  respectively,  in the second quarter of the prior fiscal
year.    Japan  and Asia Pacific/Rest of World experienced revenue declines in
the  second  quarter of fiscal 1999 as compared to the same quarter a year ago
primarily  as  a  result  of  the  weak economic environment in those regions.
Relative  to  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  1998,  Japan  related revenues
experienced a decrease in both yen and equivalent US dollars.  A comparison of
the  erosion  in  the  yen to US dollar exchange rate resulted in a decline of
approximately  $1.5  million  in the second quarter fiscal 1999 as compared to
the  second  quarter  of  the  prior  fiscal  year.

GROSS  MARGIN

Gross  margin  was  $97.6  million, or 62.4% of revenues and $192.4 million or
62.5%  of revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 1999,
respectively.    Gross  margin  for the comparable periods of fiscal 1998 were
$94.2 million, or 62.7% of revenues, and $194.1 million, or 62.4% of revenues,
respectively.  The  stable  gross margin percentages from the prior year three
and  six  month periods were due to the favorable impact of lower wafer prices
from  wafer  suppliers,  manufacturing  process  technology  improvements, and
improved  yields  that  offset continued selling price reductions. The Company
recognizes  that  ongoing  price  reductions for its integrated circuits are a
significant  element  in  expanding  the  market  for its products. Management
believes  that  gross margin objectives in the range of 60% to 62% of revenues
are consistent with expanding market share while realizing acceptable returns,
although  there  can  be  no assurance that future gross margins can remain in
this  range.

RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

Research  and  development  expenditures  were  $22.6  million  for the second
quarter  and  $43.4  million for the first six months of fiscal 1999, or 14.4%
and  14.1%  of revenues, respectively.   Research and development expenditures
for  the  comparable  periods  in  the prior year were $20.0 million and $39.9
million,  or  13.3%  and  12.8%  of  revenues,  respectively.  The increase in
expenditures  over  the  prior  year periods was primarily attributable to the
increased  costs  associated  with  designing  and  developing  new  product
architectures  of  complex,  high  density  devices  including  increased
labor-related  costs  and  testing  of new products.  Specifically, additional
costs  are  being incurred in connection with the Company's development of its
Virtex  (XC4000XV)  family  members.    The  Company  remains  committed  to a
significant  level  of research and development effort in order to continue to
maintain  its  technology  leadership  in  the programmable logic marketplace.

MARKETING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE

Marketing,  general  and  administrative  expenses  increased  3.9%,  to $32.4
million  in  the  second  quarter  of fiscal 1999 as compared to $31.2 million
incurred  in the comparable prior year quarter, and remain consistent at $63.9
million  for  the  first  six  months  of  fiscal 1999 as compared to the same
periods  from  the  prior  fiscal  year.    The increase in the second quarter
expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to  increased  labor-related costs and
increased  marketing  expenses for new product introductions.  As a percentage
of  revenues,  marketing,  general  and administrative expenses were 20.7% for
both  the  second  quarter  and first six months of fiscal 1999 as compared to
20.8%  and  20.5%  for  the  comparable prior year periods, respectively.  The
Company  remains  committed  to controlling administrative expenses.  However,
the  timing  and  extent  of  future  legal  costs associated with the ongoing
enforcement  of  the  Company's  intellectual  property rights are not readily
predictable and may significantly increase the level of marketing, general and
administrative  expenses  in  the  future.

OPERATING  INCOME

Operating  income  of  $42.6  million  and $85.2 million represented 27.2% and
27.6%  of  revenues  in  the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal
1999,  respectively,  as compared to $43.0 million and $90.3 million, or 28.6%
and  29.0%  of revenues, respectively, from the comparable prior year periods.
Operating  income  could  be adversely impacted in future years by the factors
discussed  throughout  this  report,  particularly  those  noted  in  "Factors
Affecting  Future  Operating  Results".

INTEREST  AND  OTHER,  NET

Interest  and other income for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 declined $0.6
million  from  the  amount  in the second quarter of fiscal 1998 and decreased
$2.5  million  for  the  first  six months of the current fiscal year over the
prior  years'  comparable  period.   Average cash and investment balances have
decreased  in  both  the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 1999 as
compared  to  the  prior  year  periods  resulting in lower interest and other
income.    In  addition,  the  weakening  of the yen relative to the US dollar
resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange losses in both the second quarter and
first  six  months  of  fiscal  1999 as compared to the same periods in fiscal
1998.  The amount of net interest and other income in the future will continue
to  be  impacted  by  the  level  of the Company's average cash and investment
balance,  prevailing  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency  exchange rates.

PROVISION  FOR  INCOME  TAXES

The  company  recorded a tax provision of $13.6 million for the second quarter
of  fiscal  1999  as  compared  to $13.9 million in the same prior year period
representing  an effective tax rate of 31.0% for both periods.   For the first
six  months  of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a provision of $26.9 million
as  compared  to  $30.0  million  for  the  first  six  months  of fiscal 1998
representing  an  effective  tax  rate  of 31.0% and 31.8%, respectively.  The
lower  tax rate is primarily due to legislation reinstating the R&D Tax Credit
through June 1998 as well as increased profits in foreign operations where the
tax  rate  is  lower  than  the  US  rate.

JOINT  VENTURE  EQUITY  INCOME

The  Company  records  its  proportional ownership of the net income (loss) of
United  Silicon  Inc.  (USIC),  a  wafer  fabrication joint venture located in
Taiwan,  as  joint  venture  equity  income (loss).  The Company recorded $2.4
million  and  $5.0 million net losses for the second quarter and the first six
months  of  fiscal  1999, respectively as the wafer fabrication facility began
ramping  up  production.    Many  of the expenses associated with full foundry
operations  are  being incurred during the early stages of limited production,
and the Company expects that profitability of the joint venture will occur, if
at  all,  only after a sufficient volume of wafer production and shipments are
obtained.

HEDGING

Through  fiscal year 1998, the Company's purchases of processed silicon wafers
from  Japanese  suppliers  were denominated in yen.  Beginning in fiscal 1999,
most  wafers  purchased  from  Japanese  suppliers have been denominated in US
dollars.    The  Company  continues  to  invoice  Japanese  customers  in yen,
resulting  in  a  net  yen  exposure.   The Company is currently using hedging
instruments  to  limit  its  net  yen  related  exposure.   The use of hedging
instruments  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the Company's results of
operations  for  the  three  and  six-month periods ended October 3, 1998.  At
October  3,  1998,  the  unrealized  gain  or  loss on all outstanding hedging
instruments  was  immaterial.

INFLATION

To  date,  the  effects of inflation upon the Company's financial results have
not  been  significant.


FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES
- ---------------------------------------------------------

The  Company's  financial condition at October 3, 1998 remained strong.  Total
current  assets  exceeded  total current liabilities by 4.2 times, compared to
4.8  times  at  March  28,  1998.  Since its inception, the Company has used a
combination  of  equity  and  debt  financing and cash flow from operations to
support  on-going  business activities, fund acquisitions and make investments
in  complementary  technologies,  obtain  facilities and capital equipment and
finance  inventory  and  accounts  receivable.

The  Company  continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during
the  first  six months of fiscal 1999.  As of October 3, 1998, the Company had
cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  of  $358.1 million and
working  capital  of  $457.8  million.  Cash generated by operations of $104.8
million  for  the first six months of fiscal 1999 was $11.6 million lower than
the  $116.4  million generated from the first six months of fiscal 1998.  This
decrease  in  cash generated by operations resulted primarily from an increase
in  accounts  receivable,  the  cash  flow  impact of reduced net income and a
decrease  in  deferred income taxes and other partially offset by the decrease
in  cash  spent  on  inventory  as  inventory receipts continue to be received
against the advance for wafer purchases.  The $13.2 million, or 21.6% increase
in  accounts  receivable  was  primarily  a  result of the Company's continued
efforts  to move domestic distributors to longer payment terms in exchange for
elimination of prompt payment discounts.  One distributor switched over to the
new  terms  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1999.

Cash  flows  used for investing activities during the six months ended October
3,  1998, included net short-term investment purchases of $92.9 million, $17.3
million  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and an additional $5.4 million
equity  investment  in  the  USIC  joint  venture.  In the first six months of
fiscal  1998,  investing  activities  included  an  equity investment of $67.4
million  in  the USI joint venture, a $30.0 million advance to Seiko Epson for
wafer  purchases,  and  $10.6  million  of  property,  plant  and  equipment
acquisitions,  which  were  partially  offset  by  the net maturities of $35.7
million  in  short-term  investments.

Net  cash  flows  used by financing activities were $86.0 million in the first
six  months  of  fiscal  1999, as the acquisition of treasury stock during the
period  of  $105.4 million was only partially offset by proceeds received from
the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $19.4 million.  For
the comparable fiscal 1998 period, financing activities included $15.5 million
in  proceeds from employee stock plans, which were almost completely offset by
the  acquisition  of  treasury  stock  during  the  period  of  $15.2 million.

Stockholders'  equity decreased by $27.7 million during the first six month of
fiscal  1999,  principally as a result of the Company's stock buyback programs
whereby  approximately 2.6 million shares were purchased during the six months
ended  October  3,  1998.  Partially offsetting the treasury stock repurchases
was  the  net  income  during the period and the proceeds from the issuance of
common  stock  under  employee stock plans and related tax benefits from stock
options.

The  Company  has  available credit line facilities for up to $46.2 million of
which $6.2 million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements
for  the  Company's  wholly  owned  Irish  subsidiary.  At October 3, 1998, no
borrowings  were  outstanding  under  the  lines  of  credit.

The  Company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from
operations  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy the Company's cash needs for the
foreseeable  future.  The  Company  will continue to evaluate opportunities to
obtain  additional  wafer  capacity,  procure additional capital equipment and
facilities,  develop  new  products,  and  acquire  businesses,  products  or
technologies  that  would  complement  the  Company's  businesses  and may use
available  cash  or  other  sources  of  funding  for  such  purposes.

FACTORS  AFFECTING  FUTURE  OPERATING  RESULTS
- ----------------------------------------------

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical market patterns characterized by
diminished  product  demand, limited visibility of demand for products further
out  than  three to nine months, accelerated erosion of average selling prices
and  overcapacity.  The Company's results of operations are affected by a wide
variety of factors, including general economic conditions, conditions relating
to  technology  companies,  conditions specific to the semiconductor industry,
decreases  in  average selling prices over the life of any particular product,
the  timing  of new product introductions (by the Company, its competitors and
others),  the  ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product
in  a  timely  manner,  the  timely  implementation  of  new  manufacturing
technologies,  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from
competitors,  and the impact of new technologies resulting in rapid escalation
of demand for some products in the face of equally steep decline in demand for
others.  Market demand for the Company's products, particularly for those most
recently  introduced,  can  be  difficult  to  predict, especially in light of
customers'  demands  to  shorten  product  lead  times  and minimize inventory
levels.    Unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if the
Company  were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in
a  given  quarter.  In  addition,  any  difficulty in achieving targeted wafer
production yields could adversely impact the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations.    The Company attempts to identify changes in market
conditions  as  soon  as  possible;  however,  the dynamics of the market make
prediction  of  and  timely  reaction  to  such  events difficult.  Due to the
foregoing  and  other factors, past results, including those described in this
report,  are  much  less reliable predictors of the future than is the case in
many  older,  more  stable  and less dynamic industries.  Based on the factors
noted  herein,  the  Company  may  experience  substantial  period-to-period
fluctuations  in  future  operating  results.

The Company's future success depends in large part on the continued service of
its  key  technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel and on its
ability  to  continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly
important  are  those  highly  skilled  design,  process,  software  and  test
engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development
of new products and processes.  The competition for such personnel is intense,
and  the  loss  of  key  employees could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

Sales and operations outside of the United States subject the Company to risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.    The  Company's  financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in
which it does significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates  affecting  those  countries.    Specifically, the Company has sales and
operations  in  the  Asian  markets,  including Southeast Asia and Japan.  The
recent  instability  in  the  Asian  financial  markets has adversely impacted
revenues  and  may  continue  to adversely impact revenues in those markets in
several  ways,  including  reduced  access  to  sources  of  capital needed by
customers to make purchases and increased exchange rate differentials that may
adversely  effect  the customer's ability to purchase or the Company's ability
to  sell  at  competitive  prices.   In addition, the instability may increase
credit  risks  as  the recent weakening of certain Asian currencies may impair
customers'  ability to repay existing obligations.  Depending on the situation
in Asia in coming quarters, any or all of these factors could adversely impact
the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations in the near
future.

Also, the Company's financial condition and results of operations are becoming
increasingly  dependent  on  a  global  economy.  The increased instability in
worldwide  economic  environments  could  lead  to  a  contraction  of capital
spending.    Additionally,  risks  include  government  regulation of exports,
tariffs  and  other  potential  trade  barriers,  reduced  protection  for
intellectual  property  rights  in  some  countries,  and  generally  longer
receivable  collection periods.  The Company's business is also subject to the
risks  associated  with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating
specifically  to  the import or export of semiconductor products.  The Company
cannot  predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions
will  be  imposed by the United States or other countries upon the importation
or exportation of the Company's products in the future or what, if any, effect
such  actions  would  have on the Company's financial condition and results of
operations.

In  order  to expand international sales and service, the Company will need to
maintain  and  expand  existing  foreign  operations  or establish new foreign
operations.    This  entails  hiring  additional  personnel and maintaining or
expanding  existing  relationships  with  international distributors and sales
representatives.    This  will  require  significant  management attention and
financial  resources  and  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.    There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign
operations,  in  its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts
to  maintain  or  expand  its relationships with international distributors or
sales  representatives.

Many  of  the  Company's operations are centered in an area of California that
has been seismically active.  Should there be a major earthquake in this area,
the  Company's  operations  may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the
Company to manufacture or ship products in a timely manner, thereby materially
adversely  affecting  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.

In  addition,  the  securities  of  many  high  technology  companies  have
historically  been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may
adversely  affect  the  market  price  of  the  Company's  common  stock.

DEPENDENCE  UPON  INDEPENDENT  MANUFACTURERS  AND  SUBCONTRACTORS

The Company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products.  During the
past  several  years,  most  of the Company's wafers have been manufactured by
Seiko  Epson Corporation (Seiko Epson) and UMC.  The Company has depended upon
these  suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and
cost  attributes,  including  transitioning  to advanced manufacturing process
technologies,  producing  wafers  at acceptable yields, and delivering them to
the  Company  in  a timely manner.  While the timeliness, yield and quality of
wafer  deliveries have met the Company's requirements to date, there can be no
assurance  that  the  Company's  wafer  suppliers  will  not experience future
manufacturing  problems,  including  delays  in  the  realization  of advanced
manufacturing process technologies.  Additionally, disruption of operations at
these  foundries  for any reason, including natural disasters such as fires or
earthquakes  as  well as disrupted access to adequate supplies of electricity,
natural  gas  or  water  could  cause  delays  in  shipments  of the Company's
products, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations.    The  Company  is  also  dependent  on subcontractors to provide
semiconductor  assembly services.  Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or
assembly  services  with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate
yields  or  timely  deliveries from these manufacturers and subcontractors, or
any  other  circumstance  that  would  require the Company to seek alternative
sources  of  supply, could delay shipments, and have a material adverse effect
on  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

The  Company's  growth  will  depend in large part on the Company's ability to
obtain  increased  wafer  fabrication  capacity  and  assembly  services  from
suppliers  which  are  cost  effective.    In order to secure additional wafer
capacity,  the  Company  from  time to time considers alternatives, including,
without  limitation,  equity  investments  in,  or  loans,  deposits, or other
financial commitments to, independent wafer manufacturers to secure production
capacity,  or  the  use  of  contracts  which  commit  the Company to purchase
specified quantities of wafers over extended periods.  Although the Company is
currently  able  to  obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner,
the  Company  has  at  times  been unable, and may in the future be unable, to
fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints, including the
ability  of  suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services in
satisfaction of customer delivery dates, as well as the ability of the Company
to  process  products  for  shipment.   In addition, a significant increase in
general  industry  demand  or  any  interruption  of  supply  could reduce the
Company's  supply  of  wafers  or  increase the Company's cost of such wafers.
Such  events  could  have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

DEPENDENCE  ON  NEW  PRODUCTS

The  Company's  future success depends in large part on its ability to develop
and  introduce  on  a  timely  basis  new  products  which  address  customer
requirements  and compete effectively on the basis of price, functionality and
performance.    The  success  of  new  product introductions is dependent upon
several  factors,  including  timely  completion  of  new product designs, the
ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies, achievement of
acceptable  yields,  availability  of  supporting  software  design  tools,
utilization  of predefined cores of logic and market acceptance.  No assurance
can be given that the Company's product development efforts will be successful
or that its new products will achieve market acceptance.  Revenues relating to
some  of  the Company's mature products are expected to continue to decline in
the  future.    As  a  result,  the  Company will be increasingly dependent on
revenues  derived from newer products.  In addition, the average selling price
for  any particular product tends to decrease rapidly over the product's life.
To  offset  such  decreases,  the  Company relies primarily on obtaining yield
improvements  and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing
products  and  on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features
and  other  price/performance  factors such that higher average selling prices
and  higher  margins  are achievable relative to mature product lines.  To the
extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in
a timely manner, or the Company's products do not achieve market acceptance at
prices  with  higher margins, the Company's financial condition and results of
operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

COMPETITION

The  Company's field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable
logic  devices  (CPLDs)  compete in the programmable logic marketplace, with a
substantial  majority  of the Company's revenues derived from its FPGA product
families.    The  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are intensely
competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, rapid product
obsolescence  and continuous price erosion.  The Company expects significantly
increased  competition  both from existing competitors and from companies that
may  enter  its  market.

Xilinx  believes  that important competitive factors in the programmable logic
market  include  price,  product  performance and reliability, adaptability of
products  to  specific applications, ease of use and functionality of software
design  tools,  functionality  of predefined cores of logic and the ability to
provide  timely  customer  service  and  support.   The Company's strategy for
expansion  in the programmable logic market includes continued introduction of
new  product architectures which address high volume, low cost applications as
well  as  high  performance,  leading  edge density applications and continued
price  reductions  proportionate  with  the  ability  to  lower  the  cost  of
manufacture for established products.  However, there can be no assurance that
the  Company  will  be  successful  in  achieving  these  strategies.

The Company's major sources of competition fall into four main categories: the
manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers  of  high  density
programmable  logic  products  characterized  by  FPGA-type  architectures,
providers  of  high  speed,  low  density  CPLDs and other providers of new or
emerging  programmable  logic products.  The Company competes with custom gate
array  manufacturers  on  the basis of lower design costs, shorter development
schedules  and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of custom gate
arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in high volumes.
The  Company  continues to develop lower cost architectures intended to narrow
the  gap  between current custom gate array production costs (in high volumes)
and PLD production costs.  The Company competes with high density programmable
logic  suppliers  on the basis of performance, voltage, the ability to deliver
complete solutions to customers, and customer support, taking advantage of the
primary  characteristics  of  flexible,  high  speed  implementation and quick
time-to-market  capabilities  of  the  Company's  PLD  product  offerings.
Competition  among  CPLD  suppliers  is based primarily on price, performance,
design,  software  utility  and  the  ability to deliver complete solutions to
customers.    In  addition,  the Company competes with manufacturers of new or
emerging  programmable  logic  products  on  the  basis of price, performance,
customer  support,  software  utility  and  the  ability  to  deliver complete
solutions  to  customers.    Some  of  the  Company's  current  or  potential
competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and
technical  resources  than Xilinx.  To the extent that such efforts to compete
are  not  successful,  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY

The  Company  relies upon patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to
protect  its  intellectual  property.    There  can  be no assurance that such
intellectual  property  rights  can  be successfully asserted in the future or
will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  From time to time, third
parties, including competitors of the Company, have asserted patent, copyright
and  other  intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to
the  Company.    There  can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement  claims  against  the  Company  in the future, that assertions by
third  parties  will not result in costly litigation or that the Company would
prevail  in  such  litigation  or  be  able to license any valid and infringed
patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially reasonable terms.  Litigation,
regardless  of  its outcome, could result in substantial cost and diversion of
resources  of the Company.  Any infringement claim or other litigation against
or  by  the  Company could materially adversely affect the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

COMPUTER  INFORMATION  SYSTEMS

In  order  to  compete  effectively  in  an  industry  characterized  by rapid
technological  change,  intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical  market
patterns,  the Company continually evaluates its computer information systems.
As  a  result,  the  Company  has  recently implemented information systems or
system  enhancements relating to its semiconductor manufacturing and financial
applications.    In  addition,  the  Company is in the process of implementing
computer  information systems relating to its software manufacturing and order
entry  applications.  The Company currently expects that these systems will be
implemented  by  the middle of calendar 1999.  The time period for which these
systems  are expected to be implemented represents a forward-looking statement
subject  to  risks  and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially
from  those  described  above  due  to  a  number of risk factors.  These risk
factors  include,  but  are  not  limited to, the complexity of the conversion
process  and  the new systems themselves, the transfer of data from old to new
systems  and  the need for employee training in connection with adopting these
new  systems.    Implementation of these new systems could potentially require
the  Company  to  be  without certain capabilities critical to normal business
operation  (including  processing  customer orders and shipping product) for a
period  of  time  until  the  new  systems  are operational.  In addition, the
Company could encounter problems after implementation of these systems.  There
can  be no assurance that these risks would not have a material adverse impact
on  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

As is the case with most other companies using computer information systems in
their  operations,  the  Company is currently working to resolve the potential
impact of the Year 2000 on the processing of date-sensitive information by the
Company's computerized information systems, as well as the vendor and customer
date-sensitive  computerized  information  electronically  transferred  to the
Company.  The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written
using two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable Year.  Any of the
Company's  systems  that  have  time-sensitive software may recognize the year
"00" as 1900 rather than the year 2000, which could result in miscalculations,
classification  errors  or  system  failures.

The  Company  has performed a thorough review of its internal use software and
hardware  applications  and  software  products  in  order  to  identify those
applications  and  products  that  are  not Year 2000 compliant. Currently the
Company's Year 2000 efforts have been focused on implementing the upgrades for
the  software  and  hardware  applications identified in the review as well as
assessing  its  outside  suppliers  and other critical business partners.  The
Company  believes  that  its  internal  computer  system  implementation  or
enhancement efforts principally conducted to improve competitive and operating
efficiencies,  as  described  above,  will  also address some of the Company's
internal Year 2000 compliance issues.  Additional internal information systems
are also currently being upgraded.   Electronic data interchange modifications
have  been  completed  that  are  intended  to  ensure  all  dates are handled
properly,  although  there  can  be  no assurance of this.  With regard to all
information  technology  hardware,  including desktops, networking and telecom
equipment, and servers, the Company has completed its assessment, has begun to
make  the  necessary  upgrades  and  expects  to  complete the upgrades by mid
calendar  1999,  although  there  can  be  no  assurance of this.  The Company
believes that its release M1.5 software is Year 2000 compliant, except for the
Japanese  version,  although  there can be no assurance of this.  The Japanese
version  of  release  M1.5  is  currently  expected  to be released during the
quarter  ending  January  2, 1999, although there can be no assurance of this.
However, some of the Company's customers are running product versions that are
not  Year  2000 compliant.  The Company has been encouraging such customers to
migrate  to  the  current  product version.  The Company plans to take several
steps  to  minimize  any  Year  2000  effects  such  as  miscalculations,
classification  errors  or  system  failures.   Internal preparedness includes
specific  steps that will be taken in anticipation of the Year 2000 as well as
relying  on a contingency plan which would include the ability to utilize both
the  San  Jose  and  Ireland  manufacturing facilities for shipment and having
multiple  vendors  who  can provide critical wafer, assembly and test products
and  services.

The  time  periods provided above represent forward-looking statements subject
to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those
described  above  due to a number of risk factors.  These factors include, but
are  not limited to, the complexity of identifying potential Year 2000 issues,
the ability to allocate and/or obtain qualified resources to resolve Year 2000
issues,  the  ability  to  work  effectively  with  vendors and other critical
business  partners and the Company's effectiveness at encouraging customers to
migrate  towards  its  current  software  product  version.    There can be no
assurance  that  the Company will be able to successfully, in a timely manner,
modify  all  systems and products to comply with Year 2000 requirements, which
could  have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations.

The  costs directed solely towards Year 2000 compliance are not incremental to
the  Company, but represent a reallocation of existing resources.  To date the
Company has incurred less than $1.0 million on efforts directed solely towards
Year  2000  compliance  and expects to incur a total of less than $2.0 million
when  the  process has been completed, although there can be no assurance that
this  will  be  the case.  Although the costs of addressing potential problems
are  not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's
financial  position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods, if
the  Company,  its  customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing
issues  on  a  timely  basis, the Company's financial condition and results of
operations  could  be  adversely  affected. 

EURO  CURRENCY

Effective  January  1,  1999  11  member  countries  of the European Union are
scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign
currencies  and  the  Euro  and adopt the Euro as their common legal currency.
During  the  three  year  transition,  the Euro will be available for non-cash
transactions  and  legacy currencies will remain legal tender.  The Company is
assessing  the Euro impact on its business including the ability to handle the
conversion in the accounting and other information systems, ability of foreign
banks  to report on dual currencies, the legal and contractual implications of
contracts,  and  reviewing  pricing  strategies.      The Company expects that
modifications  to  its  operations  and  systems will be completed on a timely
basis  and does not believe the conversion will have a material adverse impact
on  the  Company's  operations.    However, there can be no assurance that the
Company  will  be  able  to  successfully  modify all systems and contracts to
comply  with  Euro  requirements  on  a  timely  basis.

LITIGATION

The Company is currently engaged in several lawsuits.  See "Legal Proceedings"
in  Part  II.


PART  II.    OTHER  INFORMATION

Item  1.          Legal  Proceedings

On June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in
the  United  States District Court for the Northern District of California for
infringement  of certain of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera filed
suit  against  the  Company,  alleging  that certain of the Company's products
infringe certain Altera patents.  Fact and expert discovery has been completed
in  both cases, which have been consolidated.  On April 20, 1995, Altera filed
an  additional  suit  against  the  Company  in  the Federal District Court in
Delaware,  alleging  that  the  Company's  XC5200  family  infringes an Altera
patent.  The Company answered the Delaware suit denying that the XC5200 family
infringes  the  patent  in  suit,  asserting  certain affirmative defenses and
counterclaiming  that  the  Altera  Max  9000  family infringes certain of the
Company's  patents.    The  Delaware suit was transferred to the United States
District  Court for the Northern District of California and is also before the
same  judge.    On October 25, 1998, both Altera and the Company filed motions
with  the  Court  for  summary judgement with respect to certain of the issues
pending  in  the  litigation.

On  July  22,  1998,  the  Company  filed a suit for injunctive relief against
Altera and Joseph Ward, a former Xilinx employee, in the Circuit Court of Cook
County,  Illinois,  to  prevent  disclosure  of  certain  Company confidential
information.    On  the  same  day,  Altera  filed suit against the Company in
Superior  Court  in  Santa  Clara  County,  California,  arising from the same
events.    Altera's  suit  requests  declaratory relief and claims the Company
engages  in  unfair  business  practices  and  interference  with  contractual
relations.    On  September  10,  1998  the Company filed cross claims against
Altera  and  Ward  for  unfair competition and breach of contract, among other
claims,  in  the  California  action.  Subsequently, the Company dismissed its
suit  for injunctive relief in Illinois.  On October 20, 1998, Altera and Ward
filed  crossclaims  against  the  Company  for  malicious prosecution of civil
action  and  defamation.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot be determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has meritorious defenses to such claims and is
defending  them  vigorously.    The  foregoing  is a forward-looking statement
subject  to  risks  and uncertainties, and the future outcome of these matters
could  differ  materially due to the uncertain nature of each legal proceeding
and  because  the lawsuits are still in the pre-discovery or pre-trial stages.

On  July  31,  1998,  the  Lemelson  Foundation Partnership (Lemelson) filed a
lawsuit  in  the  United States District Court in Phoenix, Arizona against the
Company  and  twenty-five (25) other United States semiconductor companies for
infringement  of  certain of its patents.  The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot  be  determined  at  this time.  However, management does not currently
expect  that  this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.    The  foregoing  is  a
forward-looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties, and the ultimate
outcome  of this matter could differ materially due to the uncertain nature of
the  litigation.

There are no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company  is  a  party  or  of  which  any of its property is the subject.  The
Company  knows  of  no  legal  proceedings  contemplated  by  any governmental
authority  or  agency.
