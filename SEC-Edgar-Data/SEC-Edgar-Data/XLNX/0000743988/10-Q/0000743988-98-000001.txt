            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.        The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been
prepared  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles and
should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Xilinx,  Inc.  ("Xilinx"  or the
"Company")  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the year ended March 29,
1997.    The balance sheet at March 29, 1997 is derived from audited financial
statements,  although  certain  prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 1998 presentation.  The interim financial statements are
unaudited  but  reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management
of  a  normal,  recurring nature necessary to present fairly the statements of
financial  position,  results  of  operations  and  cash flows for the interim
periods  presented.   The results for the nine-month period ended December 27,
1997  are  not  necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the  year  ending  March  28,  1998.

2.        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market (estimated net realizable value).  Inventories at December 27, 1997 and
March  29,  1997  are  as  follows:

3.          In  October 1997, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a
facility  to  be  built  on  property  adjacent  to  the  Company's  corporate
facilities.    Building construction and occupancy is expected to be completed
in  calendar  1998.    Upon  signing the lease agreement, the Company paid the
lessor  $31.3 million for prepaid rent and an option to purchase the facility.
The  rent  prepayment covers one year and was discounted to its present value.
Additionally,  the  Company can exercise the lease agreement's purchase option
between  the  sixth  and  twelfth month following the commencement date of the
lease  term.    If  the  Company  elects  to  exercise the option, the prepaid
purchase  option  will be considered payment in full.  However, if the Company
decides  not  to  exercise  the  purchase  option,  the prepaid option will be
returned  without  interest  at  the  end  of  the  first  year  lease.

4.          The Company, United Microelectronics Corporation ("UMC") and other
parties  have  entered  into  a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication
facility  in  Taiwan,  known as United Silicon Inc. ("USIC").  In fiscal 1998,
the  Company  invested additional equity of $67.4 million in USIC in which the
Company  now holds a 25% equity ownership.  UMC has committed to supply and is
currently  supplying  the  Company  with  wafers  manufactured  in an existing
facility  until  capacity  is  available  in  the  new  facility.

The  Company  records  25%  of  the net income of USIC as joint venture equity
income.    To  date,  USIC's  net income has resulted primarily from favorable
exchange  gains on its foreign currency investments as well as interest earned
on  its  investment  portfolio.  Net joint venture equity income for the third
quarter of fiscal 1998 was $2.6 million.  This amount was largely attributable
to  foreign  exchange  gains  incurred  by  USIC  relating  to  its  US dollar
denominated  investments.  All prior period amounts were immaterial and remain
classified  as  "Interest  income  and  other".

5.         In May 1996 the Company entered into an agreement with Seiko Epson.
This agreement was amended in December 1997 and now provides for an advance to
Seiko  Epson  of  $150.0  million  to  be  used in the construction of a wafer
fabrication  facility  in  Japan.   Through December 27, 1997, the Company has
advanced  a  total  of $120.0 million to Seiko Epson under the agreement.  The
final  installment  of  $30.0  million  was  paid  on  February  2,  1998.

6.         During the quarter ended December 27, 1997, the Company adopted the
Financial  Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share.
The new standard requires the Company to change the method used to compute net
income  per  share  and  to  restate  all  prior periods.  The new requirement
includes  a  calculation  of  "basic" net income per share, which excludes the
dilutive  effect  of stock options.  The calculations of basic and diluted net
income  per  share  for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 1998
and  fiscal  1997  are  shown  below.

The shares issuable upon conversion of long-term debt to equity, approximately
4.9 million shares, are not included in the calculation of diluted net income
per share as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect for all
periods presented.  In addition, outstanding options to purchase approximately
3.4 million and 1.0 million shares, for the third quarter of fiscal 1998 and
1997, respectively, under the Company's Stock Option Plan were not included in
the treasury stock calculation to derive diluted income per share as their
inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

7.          The Company is currently involved in patent litigation with Altera
Corporation  (see  Part  II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings).  Due to the uncertain
nature of the litigation with Altera and because the lawsuits are still in the
pre-trial stage, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at
this  time.   Management believes that it has meritorious defenses to Altera's
claims, is defending them vigorously, and has not recorded a provision for the
ultimate  outcome of these matters in its financial statements.  The foregoing
is  a  forward-looking  statement  subject to risks and uncertainties, and the
future  outcome  could  differ  materially  due to the uncertain nature of the
litigation  with  Altera  and  because the lawsuits are still in the pre-trial
stage.

Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations



The  following  discussion  contains forward-looking statements, which involve
numerous  risks  and  uncertainties.    Actual  results may differ materially.
Certain  of  these risks and uncertainties are discussed under "Risk Factors".


RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS   - THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 1998
COMPARED  TO  THE  THIRD  QUARTER  AND  FIRST  NINE  MONTHS  OF  FISCAL  1997


Revenues
- --------

Revenues  for  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal 1998 were $148.7 million, which
represented  a  $13.1 million, or 9.7%, increase from the corresponding period
of  fiscal  1997.    In addition, revenues for the first nine months of fiscal
1998 were $459.8 million, up 10.4% from the corresponding period of 1997.  The
revenue  increase  during the third quarter of fiscal 1998, as compared to the
comparable  quarter  of  fiscal  1997, was primarily attributable to increased
demand  for the Company's XC4000X product family, which includes revenues from
the  XC4000EX  and  XC4000XL devices, as well as the XC5200 and XC9500 product
families.    The  increase  was  offset  primarily  by  reduced demand for the
Company's  XC3000  and XC4000 families.  The XC4000X and XC9500 devices, which
constitute  the  Company's  newest  product  families,  represented  13.0%  of
revenues  during  the  third quarter of fiscal 1998 as compared to 1.7% in the
comparable  quarter  in  the  prior  year.

Revenues  relating  to  first  generation  products, which include the XC2000,
XC3000  and  XC3100  product  families,  represented  26.1% and 26.6% of total
revenues  during  the  third  quarter  and  first  nine months of fiscal 1998,
respectively,  as  compared  to  31.4%  and 33.4% of total revenues during the
third  quarter  and  first nine months of fiscal 1997, respectively.  Revenues
relating  to  second  generation  products, which include the XC4000, XC4000X,
XC5200  and  XC6200  product  families,  represented  56.8% and 57.5% of total
revenues  during  the  third  quarter  and  first  nine months of fiscal 1998,
respectively,  as  compared  to  53.0%  and 51.7% of total revenues during the
third  quarter  and  first  nine  months  of  fiscal  1997, respectively.  The
increase  in  revenues  relating  to second generation products is primarily a
function  of the decreasing requirements for first generation products and the
increasing  demand  for  the functionality and performance provided by devices
within  the  second  generation  product  families.   Additionally, within the
second  generation products, demand is increasing for the newer product family
members,  including  the  XC4000X  devices, and decreasing for mature devices,
including  the  XC4000  product  family.

Revenues  relating to other products, which include HardWire, serial proms and
the  XC7000  and XC9500 product families, represented 14.1% and 13.1% of total
revenues  during  the  third  quarter  and  first  nine months of fiscal 1998,
respectively,  as  compared  to  12.2%  and 11.7% of total revenues during the
third  quarter  and  first  nine  months  of  fiscal  1997,  respectively.
Additionally, software revenues represented approximately 3% of total revenues
for  both  the  third quarter and first nine month periods of both fiscal 1998
and  fiscal  1997.    Software revenues include the sale of approximately 4000
revenue  seats  for  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  1998  as  compared  to
approximately 1300 revenue seats for the comparable period in the prior fiscal
year.   The increase in revenue seats resulted primarily from increased demand
for  the  Company's  lower  cost,  easier  to  use  Foundation Series software
introduced  in  April  1996,  as  well  as  increased  demand for the software
utilized  to  design  high  volume  logic devices.  The percentage increase in
software  revenues was less than the proportional increase in software revenue
seats  due  primarily  to  the  change  in  the sales mix towards lower priced
products.

International  revenues constituted approximately 38% of total revenues in the
third  quarter  of  both  fiscal  1998  and  fiscal  1997.    Additionally,
international  revenues were approximately 38% of total revenues for the first
nine months of fiscal 1998 as compared to approximately 37% for the prior year
comparable  period.    International  revenues  are  primarily  derived  from
customers in Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia/Rest of World, which represented
approximately  22%,  10% and 6% of the Company's worldwide sales, respectively
in  the  December  quarter.    Revenue  growth  in  the European and Southeast
Asian/Rest  of  World  markets was 13.6% and 38.5%, respectively, in the third
quarter  of  1998  as  compared  to the third quarter in 1997.  When comparing
revenues  in  Japan  over the same periods, yen denominated revenues increased
approximately  4%  but were adversely impacted by the change in exchange rates
relative  to  the  prior  year  period,  resulting  in  an  overall decline of
approximately  4%  in  US  dollar  equivalent  revenues.

Gross  Margin
- -------------

Costs  of  revenues  were  $55.7  million,  or  37.4%  of revenues, and $172.6
million,  or 37.5% of revenues, for the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal  1998,  respectively.   Costs of revenues for the comparable periods of
fiscal  1997  were $52.2 million, or 38.5% of revenues, and $156.1 million, or
37.5%  of  revenues,  respectively,  excluding  the impact of the $5.0 million
non-recurring  write-off of the XC8100 product family in the second quarter of
fiscal 1997.  The decrease in the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues
from  the prior year third quarter was primarily attributable to ongoing yield
improvements  and  the  favorable  impact  of lower wafer costs, including the
impact  of  favorable  movements in the yen exchange rate, partially offset by
selling  price  reductions.  Historically, Xilinx has been able to offset much
of  the erosion in gross margin percentages on more mature integrated circuits
with increased volumes of newer, proprietary, higher margin products, although
there can be no assurance that this will occur in future periods.  The Company
recognizes  that  ongoing  manufacturing  cost  reductions  for its integrated
circuits,  which  assist  the  Company  in its efforts to lower selling prices
while  maintaining  historical  margins,  represent  a  significant element in
expanding  the  market  for  its  products.   Company management believes that
future  gross  margin  objectives  in  the range of 60% to 62% of revenues are
consistent  with  expanding  market  share while realizing acceptable returns,
although  there  can be no assurance that future gross margins will be in this
range.

Research  and  Development
- --------------------------

Research and development expenditures were $19.5 million for the third quarter
and $59.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 1998, or 13.1% and 12.9%
of revenues, respectively.  The expenditures for the comparable periods in the
prior  year  were  $17.7  million  and  $52.3  million,  or 13.1% and 12.6% of
revenues, respectively.  The 10.4% and 13.7% increase in expenditures over the
prior  year  third  quarter  and  nine  month  periods, respectively, resulted
primarily  from increased testing of products in development and labor-related
expenses  partially  offset  by a decline in engineering wafer purchases.  The
Company  remains  committed to a significant level of research and development
effort  in order to continue to compete aggressively in the programmable logic
marketplace.

Marketing,  General  and  Administrative
- ----------------------------------------

Marketing,  general  and  administrative expenses increased as a percentage of
revenue  to  21.8%  and 21.0% of revenues, or $32.5 million and $96.4 million,
respectively,  during  the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 1998,
up  from  21.3%  and  20.9%  of  revenues, or $28.8 million and $87.1 million,
respectively,  during  the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 1997.
These  expenses  have increased in percentage and amount primarily as a result
of  increased  staffing  and labor-related expenses as well as increased legal
costs.    The Company remains committed to controlling administrative expenses
and  believes  that,  over time, most of these expenses should grow at a lower
rate  than revenue growth, although there can be no assurance that the Company
will  be  successful  in  achieving these strategies.  However, the timing and
extent  of  future  legal costs associated with the ongoing enforcement of the
Company's  intellectual  property  rights  are not readily predictable and may
significantly increase the level of general and administrative expenses in the
future.

Operating  Income
- -----------------

Operating  income of $41.1 million, or 27.6% of revenues, was generated during
the  third quarter of fiscal 1998, an increase of 11.3% from the $36.9 million
or  27.2%  of  revenues,  for  the comparable prior year period.  In addition,
operating  income  for the first nine months of fiscal 1998 increased 13.4% to
$131.4 million, or 28.6% of revenues, from $115.9 million or 27.8% of revenues
in  the  comparable  fiscal  1997  period.    Excluding the impact of the $5.0
million  non-recurring  write-off  of the discontinued product family, for the
first  nine  months  of  fiscal 1998 operating income was 8.7% higher than the
operating  income  for  the  comparable  prior  year period.  This increase in
operating income in the third quarter of 1998 compared to the third quarter of
1997  is  primarily  a  result of the 9.7% revenue growth and the level of all
other  expenses.    Operating  income  as  a  percentage  of revenues could be
adversely  impacted in future years by the factors noted under "Risk Factors".

Interest  and  Other,  net
- --------------------------

The  Company  earns  interest income on its cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments  and  restricted  investments.  The amount of interest earned is a
function of the balance of cash invested as well as prevailing interest rates.
The  Company incurs interest expense on the $250 million of 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated  notes  issued  in  November  1995.    The  Company's  investment
portfolio  contains  tax-advantaged  municipal  securities,  which have pretax
yields  that  are  less than the interest rate on the convertible subordinated
notes.   For financial reporting purposes, the Company effectively records the
difference  between  the  pretax  and  tax-equivalent yields as a reduction in
provision  for  taxes  on  income.

Net  interest  and  other  income declined in the third quarter of fiscal 1998
compared  to  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  1997 primarily due to decreased
interest  income  resulting  from  lower  investment portfolio balances and to
separate  disclosure  of  joint  venture  equity income beginning in the third
quarter  of  fiscal  1998.    See  additional information under "Joint Venture
Equity  Income".    For the first nine months of fiscal 1998, net interest and
other  income  was  consistent  with  the  comparable prior year period.  As a
result of the difference in interest income and expense yields and future uses
of the Company's investment portfolio, levels of net interest and other income
could  decrease  in  the  future.

Provision  for  Income  Taxes
- -----------------------------

The  Company recorded a tax provision of $13.0 million (31.0% of income before
taxes  and  equity  in  joint venture) for the third quarter of fiscal 1998 as
compared  to  $12.6  million (32.5% of income before taxes and equity in joint
venture)  in  the  comparable prior year period.  For the first nine months of
fiscal 1998 the Company recorded a provision of $43.0 million (31.5% of income
before  taxes and equity in joint venture) as compared to $40.7 million (33.8%
of  income before taxes and equity in joint venture) for the first nine months
of  fiscal  1997.  The lower tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 1998
is  primarily  due  to  legislation  extending  the  R&D tax credit as well as
increased  profits  in  foreign  operations.

Joint  Venture  Equity  Income
- ------------------------------

The  Company  records 25% of the net income of United Silicon Inc. ("USIC"), a
wafer  fabrication  joint  venture  located in Taiwan, as joint venture equity
income.    To  date,  USIC's  net income has resulted primarily from favorable
exchange  gains on its foreign currency investments as well as interest earned
on  its  investment  portfolio.  Net joint venture equity income for the third
quarter of fiscal 1998 was $2.6 million.  This amount was largely attributable
to  foreign  exchange  gains  incurred  by  USIC  relating  to  its  US dollar
denominated  investments.  All prior period amounts were immaterial and remain
classified in "Interest income and other".  The Company expects to incur joint
venture equity losses as the USIC wafer fabrication facility begins to ramp up
production,  as  many  of  the expenses associated with full foundry operation
will  be  incurred  in  the  early  stages of limited production.  The Company
expects  that  profitability  will  occur,  if at all, only after a sufficient
volume  of  wafer  production  is  obtained.

RISK  FACTORS

The  following  risk  factors  are  associated  with  the  Company's business:

Factors  Affecting  Future  Operating  Results
- ----------------------------------------------

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical  market patterns.  The Company's
results  of  operations  are  affected by a wide variety of factors, including
general  economic  conditions,  conditions  relating  to technology companies,
conditions  specific  to  the  semiconductor  industry,  decreases  in average
selling  prices  over  the  life  of any particular product, the timing of new
product  introductions  (by  the  Company,  its  competitors  and others), the
ability  to  manufacture  sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely
manner,  the  timely  implementation  of  new  manufacturing technologies, the
ability  to  safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors, and
the  impact  of  new  technologies resulting in rapid escalation of demand for
some  products  in  the  face  of  equally steep decline in demand for others.
Market demand for the Company's products, particularly for those most recently
introduced,  can  be  difficult  to predict, especially in light of customers'
demands  to  shorten  product  lead  times  and  minimize  inventory  levels.
Unpredictable  market  demand  could lead to revenue volatility if the Company
were  unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in a given
quarter.  In  addition,  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production
yields could adversely impact the Company's financial condition and results of
operations.   The Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as
soon  as  possible; however, the dynamics of the market make prediction of and
timely  reaction  to  such  events  difficult.  Due to the foregoing and other
factors, past results, including those described in this report, are much less
reliable  predictors of the future than is the case in many older, more stable
and  less  dynamic industries.  Based on the factors noted herein, the Company
may  experience  substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating
results.

The  semiconductor  industry has historically been cyclical and subject to, at
various  times,  significant  economic  downturns  characterized by diminished
product  demand,  limited  visibility  to demand for products further out than
three  to  nine  months,  accelerated  erosion  of  average selling prices and
overcapacity.  The  Company  may  experience  substantial  period-to-period
fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry
conditions,  overall  economic  conditions  or  other  factors.

The Company's future success depends in large part on the continued service of
its  key  technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel and on its
ability  to  continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly
important are those highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved
in  the  manufacture  of existing products and the development of new products
and processes.  The competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of
key employees could have a material, adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

Sales and operations outside of the United States subject the Company to risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.    The  Company's  financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in
which it does significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates  affecting  those  countries.    Specifically, the Company has sales and
operations  in  the  Asian  markets.    The  recent  instability  in the Asian
financial markets appears to have adversely impacted sales and may continue to
adversely  impact  sales  in those markets in several ways, including reducing
access  to  sources  of  capital  needed  by  customers  to make purchases and
creating  exchange rate differentials that may adversely effect the customer's
ability  to  purchase  or the Company's ability to sell at competitive prices.
In addition, the instability may increase credit risks as the recent weakening
of  certain  Asian  currencies may impair customers' ability to repay existing
obligations.    Depending  on the situation in Asia in coming quarters, any or
all  of these factors could adversely impact the Company's financial condition
and  results  of  operations  in  the  near  future.

Additionally,  risks  include  government  regulation  of exports, tariffs and
other  potential  trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual property
rights  in some countries, and generally longer receivable collection periods.
The  Company's  business  is  also  subject  to  the risks associated with the
imposition  of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import
or  export  of  semiconductor  products.    The Company cannot predict whether
quotas,  duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the
United  States  or  other countries upon the importation or exportation of the
Company's  products  in  the future or what, if any, effect such actions would
have  on  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

In  order  to expand international sales and service, the Company will need to
maintain  and  expand  existing  foreign  operations  or establish new foreign
operations.    This  entails  hiring  additional  personnel and maintaining or
expanding  existing  relationships  with  international distributors and sales
representatives.    This  will  require  significant  management attention and
financial  resources  and  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.    There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign
operations,  in  its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts
to  maintain  or  expand  its relationships with international distributors or
sales  representatives.

Many  of  the  Company's operations are centered in an area of California that
has been seismically active.  Should there be a major earthquake in this area,
the  Company's  operations  may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the
Company to manufacture or ship products in a timely manner, thereby materially
adversely  affecting  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.

In  addition,  the  securities  of  many  high  technology  companies  have
historically  been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may
adversely  affect  the  market  price  of  the  Company's  common  stock.

Dependence  Upon  Independent  Manufacturers  and  Subcontractors
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

The Company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products.  During the
past  two  years, most of the Company's wafers have been manufactured by Seiko
Epson  Corporation  ("Seiko  Epson")  and  United Microelectronics Corporation
("UMC").   The Company has depended upon these suppliers and others to produce
wafers  with  competitive  performance  and  cost  attributes,  including
transitioning to advanced process technologies, producing wafers at acceptable
yields,  and  delivering  them  to  the Company in a timely manner.  While the
timeliness,  yield  and  quality  of  wafer  deliveries have met the Company's
requirements  to  date,  there  can  be  no assurance that the Company's wafer
suppliers  will not experience future manufacturing problems, including delays
in  the  realization  of  advanced  process technologies.  The Company is also
dependent  on  subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly services.  Any
prolonged  inability  to  obtain  wafers or assembly services with competitive
performance  and  cost  attributes,  adequate yields or timely deliveries from
these  manufacturers/subcontractors,  or  any  other  circumstance  that would
require  the  Company  to  seek  alternative  sources  of  supply, could delay
shipments,  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect on the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

The  Company's  long-term  growth  will  depend in large part on the Company's
ability  to  obtain increased wafer fabrication capacity and assembly services
from  suppliers.    A  significant  increase in general industry demand or any
interruption of supply could reduce the Company's supply of wafers or increase
the  Company's cost of such wafers, thereby materially adversely affecting the
Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

In  order  to  secure additional wafer capacity, the Company from time to time
considers  alternatives, including, without limitation, equity investments in,
or  loans,  deposits,  or  other  financial  commitments to, independent wafer
manufacturers  to  secure  production  capacity, or the use of contracts which
commit  the  Company  to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended
periods.    Although  the  Company  is  currently  able  to obtain wafers from
existing  suppliers  in a timely manner, the Company has at times been unable,
and  may  in the future be unable, to fully satisfy customer demand because of
production  constraints, including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors
to  provide materials and services in satisfaction of customer delivery dates,
as  well  as the ability of the Company to process products for shipment.  The
Company's  future  growth  will  depend  in  part on its ability to locate and
qualify  additional  suppliers  and  subcontractors  and  to  increase its own
capacity to ship products, and there can be no assurance that the Company will
be  able  to  do  so.    Any  increase  in  these constraints on the Company's
production  could  result  in  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the Company's
financial  condition  and  results of operations.  In this regard, the Company
has  entered  into the USIC joint venture with UMC and other parties to obtain
wafer capacity from a new wafer fabrication facility.  However, there are many
risks  associated with the construction of a new facility, and there can be no
assurance  that such facility will become operational and/or cost effective in
a  timely manner.  In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement with
Seiko  Epson  to  obtain  additional  capacity from a facility currently under
construction  and expected to provide wafers in calendar 1998.  If the Company
requires  additional capacity and such capacity is unavailable, or unavailable
on  reasonable  terms,  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

Litigation
- ----------

The  Company is currently engaged in patent litigation with Altera Corporation
("Altera").    See  "Legal  Proceedings"  in  Part  II.

Dependence  on  New  Products
- -----------------------------

The  Company's  future success depends in large part on its ability to develop
and  introduce  on  a  timely  basis  new  products  which  address  customer
requirements  and  compete  effectively on the basis of price and performance.
The  success  of  new product introductions is dependent upon several factors,
including  timely  completion  of  new product designs, the ability to utilize
advanced  process technologies, achievement of acceptable yields, availability
of  supporting  design  software  and  market acceptance.  No assurance can be
given  that  the  Company's  product development efforts will be successful or
that  its  new  products will achieve market acceptance.  Revenues relating to
the  Company's  mature  products  are  expected  to continue to decline in the
future  as  a  percentage  of  aggregate  revenues,  and  the  Company will be
increasingly  dependent  on  revenues  derived  from  newer  or future product
generation devices.  In addition, the average selling price for any particular
product  tends  to  decrease  rapidly over the product's life.  To offset such
decreases,  the  Company  relies primarily on obtaining yield improvements and
corresponding  cost  reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on
introducing  new  products  which  incorporate  advanced  features  and  other
price/performance  factors  such that higher average selling prices and higher
margins  are  achievable relative to mature product lines.  To the extent that
such  cost  reductions  and new product introductions do not occur in a timely
manner,  or  the Company's products do not achieve market acceptance at prices
with  higher  margins,  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations  could  be  adversely  affected.

Competition
- -----------

The  Company's field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable
logic  devices  (CPLDs)  compete in the programmable logic marketplace, with a
substantial  majority  of the Company's revenues derived from its FPGA product
families.    The  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are intensely
competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, rapid product
obsolescence  and continuous price erosion.  The Company expects significantly
increased  competition  both  from  existing  competitors and from a number of
companies  that  may  enter  its  market.

Xilinx  believes  that important competitive factors in the programmable logic
market  include  price,  product  performance and reliability, adaptability of
products  to  specific  applications,  ease of use and functionality of design
software, and the ability to provide timely customer service and support.  The
Company's  strategy  for  expansion  in the programmable logic market includes
continued  price reductions commensurate with the ability to lower the cost of
manufacture for established products and continued introduction of new product
architectures which address high volume, low cost applications as well as high
performance,  leading  edge  density  applications.   However, there can be no
assurance  that  the Company will be successful in achieving these strategies.

The  Company's  major  sources of competition are comprised of three elements:
the  manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers of high density
programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures and other
providers  of  programmable  logic products.  The Company competes with custom
gate  array  manufacturers  on  the  basis  of  lower  design  costs,  shorter
development  schedules and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of
custom  gate  arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in
high  volumes.    The  Company  continues  to develop lower cost architectures
intended  to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs
(in  high  volumes) and FPGA production costs.  The Company competes with high
density  programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance, the ability
to  deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers  and  customer support, taking
advantage  of  the  primary  characteristics  of  flexible,  high  speed
implementation  and  quick  time-to-market  capabilities  of the Company's PLD
product  offerings.    In addition, the Company competes with manufacturers of
other  programmable  logic products on the basis of price, performance, design
and  software utility.  Some of the Company's current or potential competitors
have  substantially  greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and technical
resources  than  Xilinx.    To the extent that such efforts to compete are not
successful,  the Company's financial condition and results of operations could
be  materially  adversely  affected.

Intellectual  Property
- ----------------------

The  Company  relies upon patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to
protect  its  intellectual  property.    There  can  be no assurance that such
intellectual  property  rights  can  be successfully asserted in the future or
will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  From time to time, third
parties, including competitors of the Company, have asserted exclusive patent,
copyright  and  other  intellectual  property  rights to technologies that are
important  to  the Company.  There can be no assurance that third parties will
not  assert  infringement  claims  against  the  Company  in  the future, that
assertions  by  third parties will not result in costly litigation or that the
Company  would  prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and
infringed  patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially  reasonable  terms.
Litigation,  regardless  of  its outcome, could result in substantial cost and
diversion  of  resources  of  the  Company.    Any infringement claim or other
litigation  against  or  by the Company could materially, adversely affect the
Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

Year  2000  Compliance
- ----------------------

As  is the case with most other companies using computers in their operations,
the  Company  is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year
2000  on  the  processing  of  date-sensitive  information  by  the  Company's
computerized  information  systems,  as  well  as  the  vendor  and  customer
date-sensitive  computerized  information  electronically  transferred  to the
Company.  The year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written
using two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable year.  Any of the
Company's  programs  that  have time-sensitive software may recognize the year
"00" as 1900 rather than the year 2000, which could result in miscalculations,
classification  errors  or system failures.  Based on preliminary information,
costs  of  addressing  potential problems are not currently expected to have a
material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position, results of
operations  or  cash  flows  in  future periods.  However, if the Company, its
customers  or  vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues timely, it
could  result in a material financial risk.  Accordingly, the Company plans to
devote  the necessary resources to resolve all significant year 2000 issues in
a  timely  manner.


FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Company's financial condition at December 27, 1997 remained strong.  Total
current  assets  exceeded  total current liabilities by 5.3 times, compared to
6.2  times  at  March  29,  1997.  Since its inception, the Company has used a
combination  of  equity  and  debt  financing and cash flow from operations to
support  on-going  business  activities,  make acquisitions and investments in
complementary  technologies,  obtain  facilities  and  capital  equipment  and
finance  inventory  and  accounts  receivable.

The  Company  continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during
the  first  nine  months of fiscal 1998.  As of December 27, 1997, the Company
had  cash,  cash  equivalents and short-term investments of $417.6 million and
working  capital  of  $518.4  million.  Cash generated by operations of $165.6
million for the first nine months of fiscal 1998 was $76.9 million higher than
the  $88.7  million  generated  for the first nine months of fiscal 1997.  The
increase  in  cash  generated  by  operations  during the first nine months of
fiscal 1998 over the comparable fiscal 1997 period resulted primarily from the
favorable  cash  flow  impact  of  net  income,  changes in deferred income on
shipments  to  distributors  and  the  impact of reduced cash expenditures for
inventories.

Cash  flows  used  for investing activities for the nine months ended December
27,  1997,  included  an  additional equity investment of $67.4 million in the
USIC  joint  venture  (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial
Statements), $60.0 million in advances to Seiko Epson for wafer purchases, and
$17.9  million  of  property,  plant  and  equipment acquisitions along with a
building  deposit  of  $28.4  million  (see  Note  3  of Notes to Consolidated
Condensed  Financial  Statements),  which  were  partially  offset  by the net
investment  maturities  of  $35.9  million  in short-term investments.  In the
first nine months of fiscal 1997, investing activities used funds for advances
to  Seiko  Epson  for wafer purchases of $60.0 million (see Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated  Condensed  Financial  Statements)  and acquisitions in property,
plant  and  equipment  of  $22.3  million,  partially offset by net investment
maturities  of $31.5 million in short-term investments.  Significant increases
in  investing  activities when comparing the first nine months of 1997 to 1998
are  primarily  attributable to the additional $67.4 million investment in the
USIC  joint  venture  and  the  $28.4  million  building  deposit.

Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $0.4 million in the first
nine  months of fiscal 1998, as the proceeds from the issuance of common stock
under  employee  stock plans of $23.1 million were substantially offset by the
acquisition  of  treasury stock during the nine month period of $22.7 million.
For  the  comparable  fiscal  1997 period, financing activities included $22.7
million  in proceeds from issuance of common stock under corporate stock plans
partially  offset  by  the  acquisition of treasury stock during the period of
$15.7  million.

Stockholders'  equity  increased  by  $93.6  million  at  December  27,  1997,
principally  as  a result of the net income for the nine months ended December
27,  1997.    In  addition,  proceeds  from the issuance of common stock under
employee  stock  plans and related tax benefits from stock options contributed
to  the  increase  in equity, which was partially offset by the acquisition of
treasury  stock  and the cumulative translation adjustment in the period.  The
increase  during  the first nine months of fiscal 1998 of $15.5 million in the
cumulative  translation  adjustment  resulted  primarily  from  changes in the
exchange  rate  of  the  New  Taiwan  dollar  relative  to  the  U.S. dollars.

The  Company  has  available credit line facilities for up to $47.0 million of
which $7.0 million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements
for  the  Company's  wholly  owned Irish subsidiary.  At December 27, 1997, no
borrowings  were  outstanding  under  the  lines  of  credit.

Subsequent to December 27, 1997, the Company purchased a 59-acre business park
located  in  Longmont,  Colorado, near the Company's current Boulder, Colorado
facility.    The land was purchased for approximately $7.0 million.  Plans for
infrastructure  and  the  future development of the new property have not been
finalized.

In  July 1997, the Company invested additional equity of $67.4 million towards
the  construction  of  the USIC wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan.  UMC has
committed  to  supply  the  Company  with  wafers  manufactured in an existing
facility  until capacity is available in the new facility.  In October 1997, a
fire  occurred  at  a  UMC  related  facility.  The Company currently does not
anticipate  that  this  event  will  have  an adverse effect on its ability to
obtain  wafers from UMC in the near future, or adversely impact the USIC joint
venture,  although  there  can  be  no  assurance  of  this.

In  May  1996  the  Company  entered into an agreement with Seiko Epson.  This
agreement  was  amended  in  December  1997 and now provides for an advance to
Seiko  Epson  of  $150.0  million  to  be  used in the construction of a wafer
fabrication  facility  in  Japan.   Through December 27, 1997, the Company has
advanced  a  total  of $120.0 million to Seiko Epson under the agreement.  The
final  installment  of  $30.0  million  was  paid  on  February  2,  1998.

The  Company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from
operations  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy the Company's cash needs for the
foreseeable  future.  The  Company  will continue to evaluate opportunities to
obtain  additional  wafer  capacity,  procure additional capital equipment and
facilities,  develop  new  products,  and  acquire  businesses,  products  or
technologies  that  would  complement  the  Company's  businesses  and may use
available  cash  or  other  sources  of  funding  for  such  purposes.



Part II.    OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings

On  June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation ("Altera")
in  the  United  States District Court for the Northern District of California
for  infringement  of  certain of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera
filed  suit  against  the  Company,  alleging  that  certain  of the Company's
products  infringe certain Altera patents.  Fact and expert discovery has been
completed  in  both  cases,  which have been consolidated.  On April 20, 1995,
Altera  filed  an  additional suit against the Company in the Federal District
Court  in  Delaware,  alleging  that  the Company's XC5200 family infringes an
Altera patent.  The Company answered the Delaware suit denying that the XC5200
family  infringes  the  patent in suit, asserting certain affirmative defenses
and  counterclaiming  that the Altera Max 9000 family infringes certain of the
Company's  patents.    The  Delaware suit was transferred to the United States
District  Court for the Northern District of California and is also before the
same  judge.    In  October  1997,  the  Court  held a hearing with respect to
construction  of  the  claims  of  the  various patents in suit.  The ultimate
outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined  at this time.  Management
believes that it has meritorious defenses to such claims and is defending them
vigorously.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement subject to risks and
uncertainties,  and  the  future  outcome  could  differ materially due to the
uncertain  nature  of  the litigation with Altera and because the lawsuits are
still  in  the  pre-trial  stage.

There are no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company  is  a  party  or  of  which  any  of  its  property  is  the subject.

                             AGREEMENT OF PURCHASE AND SALE


     THIS AGREEMENT OF PURCHASE AND SALE ("Agreement") is dated for reference
purposes November 24, 1997, and is made and entered into by and between
MICHAEL D. DOLLAGHAN, an individual ("Seller"), and XILINX, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer").

1.    PROPERTY.
      --------

1.1     SITE PLAN. Seller is the owner of the real property situated in the
        ---------
City of Longmont, Boulder County, State of Colorado, containing approximately
58.81 acres, which property is commonly known as the Gateway Center and is
labeled "Property" and outlined in RED on the site plan attached hereto as
Exhibit A and made a part hereof (the "Property").
- ---------

1.2     LEGAL DESCRIPTION.  The legal description of the Property is attached
        -----------------
to the site plan as Exhibit A-1.  Such description shall be used in the Deed.
                    -----------

1.3     WATER RIGHTS.  Seller is also the owner of two (2) shares in the Union
        ------------
Reservoir Company (the "Water Rights").

2.    TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE;  DEPOSIT.
      -------------------------------

2.1     TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE.  The purchase price for the Property and the
        --------------------
Water Rights is SIX MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($6,400,000) (the
"Total Purchase Price"). The Total Purchase Price shall be payable in part by
the Deposit, with the balance payable at the Closing in immediately available
U.S. funds.

2.2     DEPOSIT.
        -------

2.2.1     Within five (5) days after the execution of this Agreement, Buyer
shall deliver to Escrow Agent by check or draft the sum of FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($500,000) as a deposit towards the Total Purchase Price
(said deposit, together with any interest thereon, is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Deposit").  The Deposit shall be invested by Escrow Agent in
an interest-bearing liquid bank or money market account approved by Seller and
Buyer.  The Deposit shall be applied towards the Total Purchase Price and/or
shall be released from Escrow in accordance with this Agreement.

2.2.2     In the event that Buyer terminates this Agreement under Section 4.1,
                                                                  -----------
the Deposit shall be refunded to Buyer.  In the event that Buyer does not
terminate this Agreement on or before December 8, 1997, the Deposit shall be
deemed earned by Seller on account of Seller's obligations hereunder prior to
the Closing and shall be non-refundable to Buyer except for default of Seller
and except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

3.    ESCROW; TITLE.
      -------------

3.1     ESCROW.  Longmont Title Company, 850 23rd Avenue, Suite E, Longmont,
        ------
Colorado 80501 ("Escrow Agent") shall hold the Deposit and shall be the
closing agent as provided for herein.   Buyer and Seller shall each from time
to time execute whatever instructions to the Escrow Agent as are reasonably
requested by the other to cause the Escrow Agent to hold and disburse the
Deposit in accordance with this Agreement.  At the Closing, Escrow Agent shall
act as the closing agent for the Property and shall conduct the Closing in
accordance with its normal practices and any specific instructions executed
jointly by Buyer and Seller.  Escrow Agent's services as closing agent shall
include the recording of the Deed and any other documents which require
recording at the Closing.

3.2     TITLE COMMITMENT.  A current title commitment, together with legible
        ----------------
copies of all record documents referred to in Schedule B thereto (together the
"Title Commitment") of the Property has already been issued to Buyer by First
American Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company"), through the Escrow
Agent.

3.3     SURVEY.  Buyer acknowledges receipt of a copy of the survey previously
        ------
prepared on the Property for Seller.  Buyer shall proceed promptly with any
additional work required to convert Seller's existing survey into an ALTA
survey of the Property (the "Survey") meeting Buyer's requirements and shall
cause the Survey to be completed on or before December 8, 1997.

3.4     TITLE DEFECTS.  On or before December 4, 1997, Buyer shall give Seller
        -------------
notice of all title defects shown in the Commitment which are not accepted by
Buyer as Permitted Exceptions and shall notify Seller at the earliest
practical time of any defects or exceptions shown by the Survey which are not
accepted by Buyer as Permitted Exceptions.  Any and all exceptions affecting
all or any portion of the Property disclosed by the Commitment (as exceptions,
requirements, or otherwise) which are not the subject of a notice from Buyer
to Seller given within the applicable period of time, shall be deemed accepted
by Buyer as Permitted Exceptions and shall be listed in the deed as exceptions
to the warranty of title contained in the Deed.  In the event Buyer notifies
Seller of any title defects shown by the Commitment or the Survey which are
not accepted, and have not previously been accepted, by Buyer as Permitted
Exceptions, Seller may cure such defects in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Buyer; provided that Seller shall not be obligated hereby to cure any such
defects or to incur any expense in connection with any such cure.  For
purposes hereof, a title defect or exception shall be deemed cured if the
Title Company deletes the defect from the Title Commitment.  If each of the
defects objected to by Buyer has not been cured on or before December 8, 1997,
Buyer may, by written notice delivered to Seller on or before December 8,
1997, either (a) terminate this Agreement or (b) waive such defects and accept
the same as Permitted Exceptions.  In the event Buyer does not notify Seller
of its decision to terminate or waive on or before December 8, 1997, Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived its objection to such defects and to have
accepted such defects as Permitted Exceptions and shall be deemed to have
waived and accepted as Permitted Exceptions any defects and exceptions shown
by the Survey, even if not previously made the subject of a notice to Seller.

3.5     SUBSEQUENT TITLE DEFECTS.  If this Contract continues in effect after
        ------------------------
December 8, 1997, and any update or endorsement to the Title Commitment
discloses defects or exceptions (the "New Exceptions") which were not
disclosed to Buyer before noon on December 8, 1997 and which are not Permitted
Exceptions and Buyer objects to any such New Exceptions, Buyer shall give
Seller notice of the New Exceptions to which Buyer objects promptly, and in
any event, within five business days after the receipt of the update or
endorsement to the Title Commitment first disclosing such New Exceptions.  Any
and all New Exceptions affecting all or any portion of the Property disclosed
by any such update or endorsement to the Commitment (as exceptions,
requirements, or otherwise) which are not objected to by Buyer in such a
notice from Buyer to Seller given within the applicable period of time shall
be deemed accepted by Buyer as Permitted Exceptions and shall be listed in the
Deed as exceptions to the warranty of title contained in the Deed.  In the
event Buyer notifies Seller of any New Exceptions shown by the Commitment or
by the Survey which are not accepted, and have not previously been accepted,
by Buyer as Permitted Exceptions, Seller may cure such New Exceptions in a
manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer; provided that Seller shall not be
obligated hereby to cure any such defects or to incur any expense in
connection with any such cure.    For purposes hereof, a New Exception shall
be deemed cured if the Title Company deletes the same from the Title
Commitment.   If each of the New Exceptions so objected to by Buyer has not
been cured on or before the Closing, Buyer may, by written notice delivered to
Seller on or before the Closing, either (a) terminate this Agreement or (b)
waive such New Exceptions and accept the same as Permitted Exceptions.  If
Buyer does not notify Seller of its decision to terminate or waive at or
before the Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its objection to such
New Exceptions and to have accepted such New Exceptions as Permitted
Exceptions.

3.6     DEEDS OF TRUST.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
        --------------
Agreement, Seller shall be required to cause to be released from the Property
at or before the Closing the two deeds of trust (the "Deeds of Trust")
encumbering the Property for the benefit of Colorado Community First State
Bank recorded on March 17, 1997, as Reception No. 1683715 and recorded on
February 7, 1996, as Reception No. 1583215, and Buyer shall not be required to
give Seller notice of the Deeds of Trust to require Seller to release the
Deeds of Trust and the failure to give any such notice or to terminate this
Agreement shall not render the Deeds of Trust to be Permitted Exceptions.
Seller may use the proceeds of the Closing to pay off and/or release the Deeds
of Trust and the loan(s) secured thereby.

3.7     TITLE.  At the Closing, Seller shall convey to Buyer marketable and
        -----
insurable fee simple title to the Property, subject to the Permitted
Exceptions, by general warranty deed (the "Deed").   Promptly after the
Closing, Seller shall cause Escrow Agent to issue the standard ALTA Owner's
Extended Coverage Policy of Title Insurance ("Title Policy") of First American
Title Insurance Company pursuant to the Title Commitment, insuring marketable
fee simple title to the Property in Buyer, subject only to the Permitted
Exceptions, in the full amount of the Total Purchase Price.  The "Permitted
Exceptions" shall mean only (i) the standard printed exceptions contained in
the Title Policy, except for the standard printed exceptions for mechanic's
and materialmen's liens not of record and not created by, through, or under
Buyer, and for bankruptcy or insolvency claims, which shall be removed, (ii) a
lien to secure payment of real property taxes not delinquent, (iii) matters
affecting the condition of title created by, through, or under Buyer or with
the written consent of Buyer, and (iv) exceptions which are disclosed by the
Title Commitment and Survey and which are approved or deemed approved by Buyer
in accordance with Section 3.4 or Section 3.5.
                   -----------    -----------

3.8     CLOSING DATE.  The closing (the "Closing") of the sale of the Property
        ------------
and the Water Rights from Seller to Buyer (the "Closing Date") shall be
January 15, 1998, or such earlier date (which shall not, without Seller's
consent, which Seller may withhold in his discretion, be before January 1,
1998) as Buyer shall specify by notice to Seller given at least three business
days before such earlier Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.8, in the event of damage to the Property of the
                   -----------
type which would give Buyer the right to terminate under Section 6.1, the
                                                         -----------
Closing Date shall be extended until the tenth day after the occurrence of
such damage; provided that the Closing Date shall not, in any event, be
extended under this Section 3.8 beyond January 26, 1998.
                    -----------

3.9     PRORATIONS;  ESCROW EXPENSES.  Rents and water charges, if any, and
        ----------------------------
real property taxes for the year of the Closing shall be prorated as of the
Closing Date.  Other charges and costs shall be allocated as follows:   If the
Property is subject to any special improvement district, for improvements
completed or partially completed prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Seller shall pay the same at or before the Closing.   Seller shall
pay the costs of releasing and recording the releases of the Deeds of Trust
and the premium for the Title Policy (excluding any premium for ALTA extended
coverage and any costs of any special endorsements).  Buyer shall pay any
document preparation fees, the documentary transfer tax, any premium for ALTA
extended coverage and any costs of special endorsements and the cost of
recording the Deed. Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half of the Escrow
fee.

4.    PURCHASE CONDITIONS.
      -------------------

4.1     INSPECTION PERIOD.  Buyer shall have until December 8, 1997 to
        -----------------
evaluate the Property for its purposes and to determine whether the Property
is suitable for Buyer's use.  Buyer may (i) terminate this Agreement for any
reason by notice given to Seller at any time on or before 5:00 p.m. Denver
time on December 8, 1997, or (ii) elect to proceed, in which event Buyer's
right to terminate under this Section 4.1 shall be waived.    In order to
                              -----------
elect to proceed, Buyer shall be required to give notice to Seller and the
Escrow Agent, on or before December 8, 1997, that it has elected to proceed
and that its right to terminate under this Section 4.1 has been waived.  If
                                           -----------
Buyer fails to elect either to terminate or to proceed, Buyer shall be deemed
to have elected to terminate this Agreement.  Buyer's determination to proceed
and not to terminate shall waive any cause of action Buyer may have against
Seller for breach of this Agreement.

4.2     EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  In the event that Buyer terminates this
        ---------------------
Agreement in accordance with any of Sections 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 5.3, or 6.1, (i)
                                    -----------------------------------

been obtained by Buyer, copies of all reports, studies, and tests prepared by
or for Buyer relating to the physical characteristics of the Property, (ii)
the Deposit shall be paid to Seller or Buyer as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, and (iii) both parties shall thereupon be relieved of all further
obligation hereunder, except for any obligations of Buyer arising under any of
Sections 3.1, 5.2.2, 7.1, 7.3, 10.6, 13.1, 13.3, 13.7, or 13.8, all of which

all remedies available at law or in equity, and except for any obligations of
Seller under Sections 3.1, 7.3, 10.6, 13.1, and 13.3, all of which shall
             ------------
continue in full force and effect and be enforceable by Buyer by all remedies
available at law or in equity.


5.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

5.1     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   Seller hereby represents and warrants
        -------------------------------

5.1.1     To Seller's Knowledge, there are no, and Seller has received no
notification of any, suits (including, without limitation, condemnation or
eminent domain proceedings or actions), hearings, governmental investigations
or other legal proceedings (collectively "Proceeding") pending or threatened
against Seller, before any court or governmental department or agency in any
way relating to the Property.  As used herein, the term "Proceeding" shall not
include any proceedings to obtain zoning, annexation, or other governmental
approvals with respect to the Property which do not involve the possibility of
claims for liability or damages against Seller or the Property.   To Seller's
Knowledge, there is no pending or threatened proceeding in eminent domain
relating to or affecting the Property.  Seller has not received any offer

thereof or interest therein which might lead to a proceeding in eminent domain
with respect to the Property.  Seller has received no notification
("Notification") that Seller is subject to or in default with respect to, any
order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental department or
agency directed specifically to Seller relating to the use of the Property.
Seller shall give Buyer immediate written notice of any Proceeding, Offer or
Notification which may occur prior to the Closing.

5.1.2     Seller is not the subject of any insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings at law or in equity or otherwise, the result of which might affect
title to the Property or the right of Seller to transfer and convey, or cause
to be transferred and conveyed, the Property to Buyer.

5.1.3     There are no leases, subleases or licenses or occupancy agreements
of any kind affecting the Property, other than leases made by Seller to family
members in connection with the formation of a business improvement district

Property as the result of the activities of Buyer, its employees, agents,

immediately take steps to remove any mechanic's lien filed against the
Property as the result of its activities, and to indemnify, defend and hold
Seller harmless from damages arising to Seller or its Property as a result of
such liens, including attorneys' fees.

5.3     CERTIFICATE AT CLOSING.  At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
        ----------------------
a written certificate (the "Certificate") certifying to Buyer, as of the date
of the Closing, with such modifications and exclusions as shall be necessary
to make the Certificate accurate when given, the accuracy of the matters
represented and warranted to in Sections 5.1 and 12.3, except that, as used in
                                ------------     ----
the Certificate, "Seller's Knowledge" shall mean as of the Closing Date.  If
the Certificate delivered by Seller at the Closing modifies or excludes any of
such matters, Buyer may either (i) terminate this Agreement or (ii) accept the
Certificate in the form delivered by Seller.  If Buyer proceeds to close,
Buyer shall be deemed to have elected the option described in clause (ii)
above.  By accepting the Certificate at the Closing, Buyer shall be deemed to
have waived, released, and forever relinquished any and all claims or causes
of action arising under the warranties and representations contained in
Sections 5.1 and 12.3 but not those contained in the Certificate.  Any and all
- ------------     ----
claims or causes of action under the Certificate shall be asserted or
commenced by Buyer within one year after the date of the Closing and any and
all claims or causes of action under the Certificate which are not asserted or
commenced within such period of time shall be deemed waived, released, and
forever relinquished by Buyer.

5.4     PROPERTY SOLD AS IS.  Except for the warranties and representations
        -------------------
set forth in Sections 5.1 and 12.3, as restated in the Certificate, Buyer is
             ------------     ----
relying upon its own inspection of the Property to evaluate the condition of
the Property and the suitability of the Property for Buyer's intended use and
development.  Except as specifically set forth in Sections 5.1 and 12.3, (i)
                                                  ------------     ----
Buyer understands and agrees that the Property will be sold and conveyed to
Buyer hereunder as is, without any representation or warranty by Seller of any
kind or nature whatsoever, and Buyer hereby acknowledges that Seller hereby
disclaims any and all express or implied warranties regarding the Property or
the condition thereof, including, without limitation, the fitness of the
Property for any particular purpose and (ii) Buyer shall have no remedy or
cause of action whatsoever, and Buyer hereby waives any remedies and causes of
action otherwise available, against Seller arising from or in any way related
to the condition of the Property.  Seller shall have no obligation to improve
or otherwise alter any portion of the Property from its current condition in
any manner whatsoever.

      ------------

6.1     RISK OF LOSS.  Seller shall give Buyer prompt notice of any material
        ------------
or substantial damage to the Property which occurs after the date hereof.  If,
prior to the Closing, the Property is totally damaged or suffers such material
and substantial damage that it cannot thereafter reasonably be used for the
purposes for which Buyer intends to use it, Buyer shall have the option, which
shall be exercised within ten (10) days after receipt of notice from Seller of
such damage or destruction, either (1) to accept the Property in its damaged
condition, in which event any insurance proceeds payable to Seller shall be
assigned to Buyer, or (2) to terminate this Agreement.  Failure of Buyer to
terminate within such period shall be deemed to be the election of the
alternative set forth in clause (1), not to terminate and to continue this
Agreement in full force and effect.

written notice to Buyer and Escrow Agent.  Upon such termination, the Escrow
Agent shall pay the Deposit to Seller and Seller shall be entitled to retain
the Deposit as liquidated damages for Buyer's failure to close.   In no event
shall Buyer be liable for specific performance or for consequential damages
for Buyer's failure to close the purchase of the Property and Water Rights.

notice of such failure to Seller, in addition to whatever other remedies are
available to Buyer at law or in equity, including the right to have specific
performance of this Agreement, Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written
notice to Seller.  Upon such termination, the Deposit shall be paid to and

terms and conditions of this Agreement and, if this Agreement is terminated by
Buyer, Buyer's reasons for terminating confidential and to avoid disclosing
any of the same except as is otherwise reasonably required in the reasonable
and ordinary conduct of Buyer's business.  Seller shall, as an ethical
commitment to Buyer but not as a legally binding obligation, use reasonable
good faith efforts to keep all the terms and conditions of this Agreement
confidential until the Closing except as is reasonably and necessarily
required in connection with Seller's normal activities (including financing
activities) with respect to the Property and as shall reasonably be required
to perform his obligations hereunder and prepare for and consummate the

covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the close of Escrow and the conveyance of the Property

be deemed to include each other gender.  The captions and headings of the
Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, and shall

13.6     EXECUTION AND MODIFICATION.  It is understood and agreed that until
         --------------------------
this Agreement is fully executed and delivered by the authorized partners,
corporate officers or other individuals, as applicable, of the parties hereto,
there is not and shall not be an agreement of any kind between the parties
hereto upon which any commitment, undertaking or obligation can be founded.

any entity that is owned or controlled by Buyer or (ii) any limited
partnership in which Buyer, or any entity owned or controlled by Buyer, is the

assignment of this Agreement.  No assignment of this Agreement shall be
effective until Buyer has delivered to Seller the written agreement of the
proposed assignee, in form reasonably acceptable to Seller, assuming all
obligations of Buyer arising hereunder both prior to and after the assignment.
Notwithstanding such assumption, Buyer shall remain liable to Seller for all,
and shall not be released from any, obligations of Buyer arising hereunder
either prior to or after the assignment.  Any assignment, transfer, or
encumbrance of this Agreement or any interest of Buyer herein by Buyer in
violation hereof shall be a material default by Buyer.

Buyer may have against Seller for any wrongful failure of Seller to close the
sale of the Property hereunder which is made in a lawsuit filed and served
within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such wrongful failure by
Seller.  Any claim which Buyer might otherwise have hereunder, or which is
otherwise available at law or in equity, which is not commenced by Buyer
within such ninety-day period shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer.

13.9     DAYS.  If the date for any performance hereunder falls on a day which

parties hereto, this Agreement shall be fully binding and effective, just as
if all of the parties hereto had executed and delivered a single counterpart
hereof.  Without limiting the manner in which execution of this Agreement may

Security Interest as of January 15, 1998 and against any costs and expenses
which would be incurred in paying off the NW Loan and releasing the NW
Security Interest as of January 15, 1998.

     1.3     Survival.  The obligations of the parties under this Section 1
             --------
shall survive the Closing.

     2.     Effect.  Except as specifically provided in Section 1 of this
            ------
Amendment, the Sale Agreement shall not be modified or amended hereby.  As

                           ADVANCE PAYMENT AGREEMENT


AREAS MARKED "***" REPRESENT SECTIONS FOR WHICH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS
BEEN REQUESTED.  THESE OMITTED SECTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
COMMISSION.


THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED ADVANCE PAYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is
entered into as of December 12, 1997, by and between SEIKO EPSON CORPORATION,
a Japanese corporation having its principal place of business at 3-5, Owa
3-chome, Suwa-shi, Nagano-ken 392, Japan ("Epson"), Xilinx, Inc., a Delaware
corporation having its principal place of business at 2100 Logic Dr., San
Jose, CA 95124, U.S.A. ("Xilinx US"), and Xilinx Ireland, a company formed
under the laws of Ireland, having its principal place of business at Logic
Drive, City West Business Campus, Saggart, Dublin, Ireland ("Xilinx Ireland").
Xilinx US and Xilinx Ireland are collectively referred to herein as "Xilinx".

1     Background
      ----------

1.1     Epson. Epson is in the business of designing, manufacturing, testing
        -----
and selling semiconductor devices, among other products. Epson manufactures
such semiconductor devices at its plant located at 281 Fujimi, Fujimi-machi,
Suwa-gun, Nagano-ken 399-02, Japan (the "Fujimi Facility") and its plant
located at 166-3 Jurizuka, Sakata-shi, Yamagata-ken 998-01, Japan (the "Sakata
Facility").

1.2     Xilinx. Xilinx is in the business of designing, developing and
        ------
marketing CMOS programmable logic devices and related development system
software.

1.3     Prior Agreement. Epson and Xilinx US have an ongoing business
        ---------------
relationship whereby Epson fabricates semiconductor devices for Xilinx US. The
parties entered into an advance payment agreement dated April 1, 1994 for
development and manufacture of ***. The parties desired to expand their
relationship. Specifically, Xilinx desires to develop and sell high
performance, advanced architecture semiconductor devices and Epson desires to
construct a *** process line in order to fabricate such semiconductor devices
(as hereinafter further defined the "New Facility Wafers"). Accordingly, Epson
and Xilinx US entered into an Advance Payment Agreement dated as of May 17,
1996 (the "Prior Agreement") which provided that, among other things, Xilinx
US would advance money to Epson as an advance payment to be used as a credit
to purchase New Facility Wafers from Epson over a specified period of time.

1.4     Prior Ireland Agreement.  Epson and Xilinx Ireland entered into an
        -----------------------
Agreement on Purchase and Sale of *** dated as of May 17, 1996 (the "Prior
Ireland Agreement") which provided that, among other things, Xilinx Ireland
would purchase a specified number of New Facility Wafers from Epson over a
specified period of time.

1.5     Amended Agreement.  The parties have agreed to amend certain terms of
        -----------------
the Prior Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.  This Amended and Restated
Agreement amends the Prior Agreement, and shall be a replacement for, and not
in addition to, the Prior Agreement.  Except as may be otherwise noted, all
references to the Prior Agreement shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement.
Effective on the date of this Agreement, the Prior Ireland Agreement shall be
deemed terminated and void for all purposes.

1.6     Purchase Agreement.  The ordering, fabrication, testing and delivery
        ------------------
requirements for the New Facility Wafers covered by this Agreement will be set
forth in a purchase agreement between Xilinx and Epson (as hereafter further
defined the "Purchase Agreement"). The parties acknowledge and agree that even
though their obligations with respect to the quantity of the Products sold and
purchased under this Advance Payment Agreement are stipulated in terms of
"wafers", pricing of all Products will be done on a "good die basis" under the
Purchase Agreement.

1.7     Responsibility for Process. The parties agree that each party will
        --------------------------
contribute to the design and implementation of the process line contemplated
by this Agreement. Epson expects significant contributions from Xilinx in the
construction of the *** process line described above, similar to Xilinx's
contributions to previous process generations, and Xilinx expects to be able
to make significant contributions to the process in order to optimize the
processes for Xilinx products.

the case may be, but only so long as such control exists.

2.16     "***" will mean the *** process owned, licensed or developed by Epson
which will be used at the New Facility. The *** Process will include (a) all
process flow, process steps, process conditions (and modifications thereto)

Agreement.  Each month, Epson shall review any changes in the new 6-month
forecast, and determine in good faith whether such changes are acceptable.
Xilinx agrees to try to minimize fluctuations in its forecast for the first
two months of each forecast.

6.2     Business Meetings; Long-range Forecasts.  The parties shall attempt to
        ---------------------------------------
hold business meetings to discuss issues arising under this Agreement
quarterly, but in no event less than three times annually.  At each such
meeting, Xilinx shall provide Epson with a two (2) year forecast setting forth
the estimated quantity of Products to be fabricated by Epson, and Epson will
provide Xilinx with a two (2) year forecast of its capacity plan by facility
and by process. In addition, Xilinx will provide Epson with its tape-out plans
for forecasted Products, and Epson will provide Xilinx with its forecasted
process technology road map. All of these forecasts and plans shall be
provided only for forecasting purposes and shall not bind either party
legally.

6.3     Ordering.  Xilinx shall place the Purchase Orders for the Products in
        --------
accordance with one of the two procedures mutually agreed upon by the parties
and set forth in Exhibit C.  In such Purchase Orders, Xilinx shall, in its
sole discretion, determine which of the two procedures is to be used and shall
provide Epson with reasonable notice should Xilinx decide to use the other
procedure.   Xilinx shall specifically set forth the specific type of
Products, the number of the Products to be fabricated by Epson, delivery date
in release form, delivery place, purchase order number,  and unit price of the
Products in each Purchase Order.

6.4     Delivery.  Epson shall fabricate the Products based on the Purchase
        --------
Agreement(s) and the Purchase Orders, and shall deliver the Products pursuant
to the Purchase Orders.

6.5     Supply Commitment. In the event, and only in the event, Epson and
        -----------------
Xilinx are unable to agree on the amount of Product to be ordered by Xilinx
and delivered by Epson, Epson commits to supply Xilinx with sufficient foundry
capacity to deliver the amount of Products necessary to amortize the remaining
outstanding Advance Payment over three (3) years from the date of such
disagreement, based on a linear amortization (the "Supply Commitment"), and
Xilinx shall be obligated to purchase Products in at least such capacities
until the Advance Payment has been fully credited to such purchases.

6.6     Excess Capacity. Epson will use its best efforts to provide Xilinx
        ---------------
with excess capacity in the manner specified below:

First, in the event that Xilinx desires to purchase Products in excess of its
forecast requirements, Xilinx will specify in writing the amount of capacity
required, the Product(s) it desires to purchase and the date from which such
capacity is required.

Second, Epson will then determine how much capacity is available and notify
Xilinx of its determination. Epson will give Xilinx priority over third
parties for excess capacity of the New Facility except to the extent that
Epson is already obligated to provide such third parties with capacity.

Third, the parties will then mutually agree upon a preliminary excess capacity
allocation.

In order to provide Xilinx with first priority for unused capacity, Epson
agrees to give Xilinx monthly written notice of any unused capacity for the
next six (6) months, and to provide Xilinx the first right to reserve such
unused capacity for any New Facility Wafers which Xilinx desires to purchase
in excess of its forecast requirements. Xilinx will have a reasonable time to
elect to reserve such excess capacity.

6.7     Failure to Meet Supply Commitment
        ---------------------------------

6.7.1     Failure Due to Epson. In the event that (a) Epson fails to fulfill
          --------------------
the deliver Products specified in Purchase Orders in the manner specified by
this Agreement by the end of any month or (b) Epson has reason to believe that
it will be unable to fabricate such Products by the end of such month, then
Epson will take the following measures:

First, Epson will promptly notify Xilinx in writing and describe the nature of
the difficulty.

Second, Epson will use its best efforts to remedy the difficulty in an
expeditious manner by the end of the second full month following the month in
which Epson is unable to deliver such Products (in other words, the third
month including the month in which the difficulty occurs).

Third, Epson will use its best efforts to make available during the
above-referenced three (3) month period sufficient capacity at the Sakata
Facility and the Fujimi Facility to cover the deficiency between the Products
ordered and the actual capacity subject to completion of product
qualification. The parties acknowledge, however, that Epson cannot guarantee
the use of capacity at the Sakata Facility or the Fujimi Facility.

***

Fifth, in the event that the above measures are insufficient and the parties
are unable to negotiate in good faith a resolution of the difficulty, then
Xilinx, at its option, may elect to be repaid in U.S. Dollars that portion of
the Advance Payment currently outstanding, and Xilinx shall have no further
obligations under this Agreement.

6.7.2     Failure Due to Xilinx. Notwithstanding anything contained in Article
          ---------------------
6.7 to the contrary, in the event that Epson fails to fulfill a Purchase Order
in any month due to (a) design defects in Products caused by Xilinx, (b)
design changes requested by Xilinx, (c) process flow changes requested by
Xilinx or (d) any other reason caused by Xilinx, Epson will only be required
to make reasonable efforts to fulfill the Purchase Order in such month.

6.7.3     Failure Due to Both Parties. Notwithstanding anything contained in
          ---------------------------
Article 6.7.1, or 6.7.2 to the contrary, in the event that Epson fails to
fulfill a Purchase Order (and Xilinx fails to fulfill the Purchase Commitment)
due to difficulties caused jointly by Xilinx and Epson, the parties will
mutually agree in writing upon a fair and equitable solution.

6.7.4     Failure Due to Catastrophe. In the event that any fire, flood,
          --------------------------
earthquake, explosion or any other catastrophe prevents Epson from fabricating
Products for Xilinx, (a) Epson will immediately implement the measures
required by Article 6.7.1, (b) Epson will permit Xilinx to inspect the New
Facility or such other facilities as may be necessary, and (c) the parties
will begin good faith negotiations to agree on a corrective action plan.

6.8     Coordination. Xilinx US and Xilinx Ireland agree to work with each
        ------------
other to make sure that all forecasts and other directions given to Epson are
coordinated  with each other and do not create any conflicts.  If any such
conflicts occur, all parties will work together to resolve them.

      ------------------------------------------------

8.1     General Terms and Conditions. The terms and conditions for the
        ----------------------------
prototype wafer fabrication, wafer fabrication, order and acceptance,
shipping, insurance and warranty for the Products will be set forth in the
Purchase Agreements. The parties hereby express their good-faith commitment to
sign all Purchase Agreements required to implement the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Epson agrees to provide all Products covered by this Agreement
in the manner required by the Purchase Agreements. The parties acknowledge
that a best estimation and target of defect densities as at the date of this
Agreement is set forth in Exhibit E attached hereto, which will be reviewed
and amended from time to time by the parties hereto, and will be incorporated
into all Purchase Agreements.

8.2     Start of Production. Qualification testing for the Products will be
        -------------------
conducted in the manner mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties. Once
any Product has been qualified, Epson will begin mass production of such
Product.

8.3     Turn Around Time. The parties acknowledge that the lead time for
        ----------------
shipment of Products, defined as the time from Xilinx's process release until
delivery of Products to assembler, known as "turn around time", is of the
essence, and agree that the parties shall set annual target turn around time
and make their joint efforts to achieve such target in accordance with Exhibit
F ("Turn Around Time").

9     Wafer Pricing and Payment
      -------------------------

9.1     Determination of Price. The parties have already expressly agreed to
        ----------------------
(a) certain procedures to annually determine prices of Products (the "Price")
and (b) certain procedures of determining the price of all Products on a per
die basis, as described in Exhibit D. The Price herein shall be applicable
until Xilinx has received a credit against the full Advance Payment for
purchase of Products under the terms of this Agreement.

9.2     Shipping, Insurance, Taxes, Duties and Other Fees. Epson will deliver
        -------------------------------------------------
the Products to Xilinx's designated facility in Japan or Xilinx's designated
carrier in Japan on an F.O.B. basis. Epson will be responsible for paying, in
connection with such sale and delivery in Japan (a) all domestic freight,
insurance and other shipping expenses and (b) sales, use, excise, ad valorem,
withholding or other taxes. The risk of loss will pass to Xilinx at F.O.B.
point in Japan. Further, Xilinx will be responsible for paying all freight,
insurance, fees, expenses, taxes, tariffs and duties required in connection
with the export of the Products from F.O.B. point in Japan and the import into
any other country.

9.3     Payment. Other than through offset of the Advance Payment, Xilinx will
        -------
not be required to pay for any Products delivered under this Agreement or any
Purchase Agreement until the Advance Payment has been fully offset and
reduced, including the receipt of any applicable ***. Once the Advance Payment
is fully offset and reduced, Xilinx will be required to pay Epson in the
manner specified in the Purchase Agreements based on the Price for any
additional Products purchased.

9.4     Die Based Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
        ---------------------
contained herein, the parties acknowledge and agree that all purchases made
pursuant to Purchase Agreements, starting with the purchase of *** devices,
will be made on a "good die basis" even though the Supply Commitment, the
Purchase Commitment and other obligations of this Agreement are described on a
wafer basis. Such "good die basis" transaction shall be made in reference to
"Die Pricing Mechanism" in Exhibit D and "Defect Density Goal" in Exhibit E.

10     Additional Funding by Xilinx
       ----------------------------

Subsequent to the final payment of the Advance Payment pursuant to Article 4.1
above, the parties shall meet to review and discuss the terms and conditions
of future funding by Xilinx and purchases of Products.  Neither party has
agreed or committed to any such terms, and neither party shall be bound unless
and until an agreement on such subsequent terms and conditions is reached.

11     Technical Cooperation and Support
       ---------------------------------

The parties desire to engage in various types of joint development and
technical cooperation activities required to fabricate Products and to
effectuate the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The parties agree to
negotiate in good faith a joint development and technical cooperation
agreement in the future. Also the parties will continue to develop jointly new
state of the art CMOS logic processes under the terms of separate agreements
to be executed between the parties from time to time for specific projects or
product development work.

12     Intellectual Property Rights
       ----------------------------

Epson warrants that it has all necessary rights to develop, manufacture and
sell to Xilinx the Products. Epson will indemnify and hold harmless Xilinx
from any loss, damage or expense (including attorney's fees) arising from
claims that the sale or use of the Products infringes on the intellectual
property rights of third parties except where such infringement is caused by
Xilinx's instruction or specifications thereto.
