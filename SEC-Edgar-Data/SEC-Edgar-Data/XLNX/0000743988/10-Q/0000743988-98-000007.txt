             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.        The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been
prepared  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles and
should  be  read  in conjunction with the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company)
consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year ended March 28, 1998.  The
balance  sheet at March 28, 1998 is derived from audited financial statements,
although certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
fiscal  1999 presentation.  The interim financial statements are unaudited but
reflect  all  adjustments  which are in the opinion of management of a normal,
recurring  nature  necessary  to  present  fairly  the statements of financial
position,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  for  the interim periods
presented.  The results for the three-month period ended June 27, 1998 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
April  3,  1999.

2.        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market  (estimated  net  realizable  value).  Inventories at June 27, 1998 and
March  28,  1998  are  as  follows:

3.       The computation of basic net income per share for all years presented
is derived from the information on the face of the income statement, and there
are  no  reconciling  items  in  either  the  numerator  or  denominator.
Additionally,  there are no reconciling items in the numerator used to compute
diluted net income per share.  The total shares used in the denominator of the
diluted  net income per share calculation includes 4.0 million and 7.8 million
incremental  common  shares  attributable to outstanding options for the first
quarter  of  fiscal  year  1999  and  1998,  respectively.

The shares issuable upon conversion of long-term debt to equity, approximately
4.9 million shares, were not included in the calculation of diluted net income
per  share  as  their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect for all
periods presented.  In addition, outstanding options to purchase approximately
3.1  million and 0.5 million shares, for the first quarter of fiscal year 1999
and  1998,  respectively,  under  the  Company's  Stock  Option  Plan were not
included  in the treasury stock calculation to derive diluted income per share
as  their  inclusion  would  have  had  an  anti-dilutive  effect.

4.     The Company has adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  130  (FASB 130), "Reporting Comprehensive Income" in the first quarter of
fiscal  1999.  FASB 130 establishes standards for the reporting and disclosure
of  comprehensive  income  and  its components; however, the disclosure has no
impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position
or  cash  flows.  Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a
company  during  a period resulting from certain transactions and other events
and circumstances, excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners
and  distributions  to  owners.    The  difference  between  net  income  and
comprehensive  income  for  Xilinx  is  from  foreign  currency  translation
adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on the Company's available-for-sale
securities.

5.     The Company is currently involved in litigation with Altera Corporation
and  other  parties  (see  Part  II,  Item  1, Legal Proceedings).  Due to the
uncertain nature of the various legal proceedings and because the lawsuits are
still  in  the pre-discovery or pre-trial stage, the ultimate outcome of these
matters  cannot  be  determined at this time.  Management believes that it has
meritorious  defenses to each claim, is defending them vigorously, and has not
recorded  a  provision  for  the  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters in its
financial statements.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement subject to
risks and uncertainties, and the future outcome could differ materially due to
the  uncertain nature of each litigation and because the lawsuits are still in
the  pre-discovery  or  pre-trial  stages.

6.          The  Company,  United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and other
parties  have  entered  into  a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication
facility  in  Taiwan, known as United Silicon Inc. (USIC).  Subsequent to June
27,  1998,  the Company invested additional equity of approximately $6 million
in  USIC.  However, as other parties increased their equity in USIC during the
most  recent  investment,  the  Company decreased its equity ownership to 20%.
The  Company  will  still  receive up to 31.25% of the wafers produced in this
facility.



Item 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


The  following  discussion  contains forward-looking statements, which involve
numerous  risks  and  uncertainties.    Actual  results may differ materially.
Certain  of  these  risks  and  uncertainties  are  discussed  under  "Factors
Affecting  Future  Operating  Results".


RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS:    FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO THE FIRST
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUARTER  OF  FISCAL  1998
- -------------------------

REVENUES

Revenues  of  $151.6  million  in the first quarter of fiscal 1998 represent a
5.7%  decrease  from  the  comparable  prior  year  quarter.  The decrease was
primarily  attributable  to  the  revenue  decline  of  the  Company's  first
generation  product  families,  as  well as the XC4000 family, a mature second
generation  product  line.  The decrease was partially offset by the Company's
newest  product  families  including  the  XC4000X  family,  comprised  of the
XC4000EX  and  XC4000XL  devices,  as  well  as the XC9500 and Spartan product
families.    Combined,  these  three  new  product  families  contributed
approximately  $39  million  in  revenue  in  the first quarter of fiscal 1999
compared  to  approximately $7 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
Despite  the  significant growth in new product revenues, first quarter fiscal
1999  revenues  were  impacted  by  the  overall slowdown in the semiconductor
market, continued price competition, inventory reductions at end customers and
the  current  economic  environment in Japan and Southeast Asia .  The Company
believes that these factors, as well as others described in "Factors Affecting
Future  Operating  Results,"  could  continue to impact future revenues in the
near  term.

Revenues  for  the  Company's  first  generation  products,  which include the
XC2000, XC3000 and XC3100 families, represented 19.2% of total revenues in the
first  quarter  of  fiscal  1999, as compared to 27.8% in the first quarter of
fiscal  1998.  The Company's second generation products, including the XC4000,
XC4000X,  XC5200  and Spartan families, represented 63.9% of total revenues in
the first quarter of fiscal 1999, as compared to 57.4% in the first quarter of
fiscal  1998.  The increase in revenues relating to second generation products
is  primarily  a  function  of  the increased demand for the functionality and
performance  provided  by  the  newer  XC4000X  devices.   Revenues from other
programmable  logic  products,  which  include  the  XC7000 and XC9500 complex
programmable  logic  devices  (CPLD)  families,  HardWire  and  serial  proms,
increased  from 12.5% to 14.8% of total revenues in fiscal 1999 as compared to
the prior year, primarily due to the increased revenue from the XC9500 family.

Proprietary  software  design tools sold to customers during the first quarter
of  fiscal 1999 totaled approximately 4,000 units amounting to $3.1 million in
revenues, as compared to approximately 1,700 units during the prior year first
quarter  and  $3.8 million in revenue.  The increase in software revenue seats
resulted  primarily from increased demand for the Company's lower cost, easier
to  use  Foundation  Series  software.    Although  software  seats increased,
software  revenue  decreased  16.7% due to the change in the sales mix towards
lower  priced  products  as  well  as  price reductions for specific products.
Software  sales as a percentage of total revenues represented approximately 2%
of  revenues  in  the  first  quarter  of  both  fiscal  years.

International  revenues represented approximately 37% of total revenues in the
first  quarter  of both fiscal year 1999 and 1998.  International revenues are
derived  from  customers in Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific/Rest of World which
represented  approximately  24%,  9%  and 4% of the Company's worldwide sales,
respectively,  in  the  first  fiscal  quarter  of  1999.    Europe  and  Asia
Pacific/Rest  of  World  experienced  revenue declines in the first quarter of
fiscal  1999  as  compared  to  the  same quarter a year ago.  Relative to the
fiscal  June  1998  quarter, Japan related revenues increased approximately 7%
when stated in yen, but declined approximately 3% when translated in US dollar
equivalent  revenues  due to the erosion in the yen to US dollar exchange rate
over  the  past  year.

GROSS  MARGIN

Gross  margin  was  $94.8  million,  or 62.5% of revenues, for the first three
months  of fiscal 1999 as compared to $99.9 million, or 62.1% of revenues, for
the  first  three  months  of  fiscal  1998.  The slight increase in the gross
margin  percentage over the prior year quarter was due to the favorable impact
of  lower  wafer prices from wafer suppliers, manufacturing process technology
improvements,  and  improved  yields  that  more  than  offset  selling  price
reductions.   Over the past years, Xilinx has also been able to offset much of
the erosion in gross margin percentages of its more mature integrated circuits
with increased volumes of newer, proprietary, higher margin products, although
no  assurance  can  be  given  that  the Company will continue to do so in the
future.    The  Company  recognizes  that  ongoing  price  reductions  for its
integrated  circuits are a significant element in expanding the market for its
products.    Company  management  believes that gross margin objectives in the
range  of  60%  to  62% of revenues are consistent with expanding market share
while  realizing  acceptable  returns, although there can be no assurance that
future  gross  margins  will  be  in  this  range.

RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

The  Company continues to invest in research and development and increased its
expenditures 4.3% in the first three months of fiscal 1999 over the comparable
period  in  the  prior year from $19.9 million, or 12.4% of revenues, to $20.8
million,  or  13.7%  of  revenues.    The increase in research and development
expenses  was  primarily  attributable  to the increased costs associated with
designing  and  developing  new product architectures of complex, high density
devices.  The Company remains committed to a significant level of research and
development  effort in order to continue to maintain its technology leadership
in  the  programmable  logic  marketplace.

MARKETING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE

Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% to $31.4 million
in  the  first  three months of fiscal 1999 as compared to the same quarter in
the prior fiscal year.  The decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to
decreased  sales  commissions  on a lower level of revenue partially offset by
increased  labor-related  costs.    As  a  percentage  of revenues, marketing,
general  and  administrative expenses were 20.7% and 20.3%, respectively, when
comparing  the  same  periods.   The increase as a percentage of revenue was a
function  of  the lower revenues achieved, despite the cost controls in place.
The  Company  remains  committed  to  controlling  administrative  expenses.
However,  the  timing  and  extent  of  future legal costs associated with the
ongoing  enforcement  of  the  Company's  intellectual property rights are not
readily  predictable  and  may  significantly increase the level of marketing,
general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  future.

OPERATING  INCOME

Operating  income  of  $42.5 million represented 28.1% of revenue in the first
quarter of fiscal 1999 as compared to $47.3 million or 29.4% of revenue in the
prior  year  quarter.   Operating income could be adversely impacted in future
years  by  the  factors  discussed  throughout this report, particularly those
noted  in  "Factors  Affecting  Future  Operating  Results".

INTEREST  AND  OTHER,  NET

Interest  and  other income for the first quarter of fiscal 1999 declined $1.9
million from the amount in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.  Although average
cash  and  investment  balances  and  average  interest  rates remained fairly
consistent  with  the  prior year, the weakening of the yen relative to the US
dollar  resulted  in unfavorable foreign exchange losses.  Beginning in fiscal
1999,  most  wafers purchased from Japanese suppliers have been denominated in
US dollars.  However, the Company is currently invoicing Japanese customers in
yen, resulting in a yen exposure.  The Company is using hedging instruments to
limit  future  yen  related  exposure.    The amount of net interest and other
income  in  the  future  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by the level of the
Company's investment portfolio, prevailing interest rates and foreign currency
exchange  rates.

PROVISION  FOR  INCOME  TAXES

The company recorded a tax provision of $13.3 million for the first three
months of fiscal 1999 as compared to $16.1 million in the same period in the
prior year representing an effective tax rate of 31.0% and 32.5%,
respectively.  The lower tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 1999 was
favorably impacted by legislation reinstating the R&D Tax Credit through June
1998 as well as increased profits in foreign operations where the tax rate is
lower than the US rate.

JOINT  VENTURE  EQUITY  INCOME

The Company records its 25% proportional ownership of the net income (loss) of
United  Silicon  Inc.  (USIC),  a  wafer  fabrication joint venture located in
Taiwan,  as  joint venture equity income.  The Company recorded a $2.6 million
net  loss  for  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1999 as the wafer fabrication
facility  began  ramping  up production.  Many of the expenses associated with
full  foundry  operation  are  being  incurred  in the early stages of limited
production,  and  the  Company expects that profitability of the joint venture
will  occur,  if at all, only after a sufficient volume of wafer production is
obtained.

INFLATION

To  date,  the  effects of inflation upon the Company's financial results have
not  been  significant.


FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES
- ---------------------------------------------------------

The  Company's  financial  condition  at June 27, 1998 remained strong.  Total
current  assets  exceeded  total current liabilities by 4.7 times, compared to
4.8  times  at  March  28,  1998.  Since its inception, the Company has used a
combination  of  equity  and  debt  financing and cash flow from operations to
support  on-going  business  activities,  make acquisitions and investments in
complementary  technologies,  obtain  facilities  and  capital  equipment  and
finance  inventory  and  accounts  receivable.

The  Company  continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during
the  first  three months of fiscal 1999.  As of June 27, 1998, the Company had
cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  of  $361.6 million and
working  capital  of  $487.9  million.   Cash generated by operations of $45.9
million for the first three months of fiscal 1999 was $27.8 million lower than
the  $73.7  million generated for the first three months of fiscal 1998.  This
decrease  in  cash generated by operations resulted primarily from an increase
in accounts receivable, the cash flow impact of reduced net income, a decrease
in  accounts  payable,  accrued  liabilities  and  income  taxes payable and a
decrease  in  deferred  income  taxes  and  other.   The $17.0 million, or 28%
increase  in  accounts  receivable  was  primarily  a  result of the Company's
efforts  to move domestic distributors to longer payment terms in exchange for
elimination of prompt payment discounts.  One distributor switched over to the
new  terms  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1999.    In addition, another
distributor's  semi-monthly  payment  was  received  after  quarter  end.

Cash  flows  used  for investing activities during the three months ended June
27,  1998,  included  net short-term investment purchases of $32.2 million and
$7.8  million  of property, plant and equipment.  In the first three months of
fiscal  1998,  investing activities used funds for advances to Seiko Epson for
wafer  purchases  of  $30.0  million,  net  short-term investment purchases of
$125.1  million  and  acquisitions  in  property,  plant and equipment of $5.4
million.

Net  cash  flows  used by financing activities were $38.5 million in the first
three  months  of fiscal 1999, as the acquisition of treasury stock during the
period  of  $53.7  million  was  only  partially  offset  by proceeds from the
issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $15.1 million.  For the
comparable  fiscal 1998 period, financing activities included $10.3 million in
proceeds  from  issuance of common stock under corporate stock plans partially
offset by the acquisition of treasury stock during the period of $8.9 million.

Stockholders'  equity  decreased by $7.2 million at June 27, 1998, principally
as  a  result  of  the  Company's  existing  stock  buyback  program  whereby
approximately  1.3 million shares were purchased during the three months ended
June  27,  1998.   Partially offsetting the treasury stock repurchases was the
net  income  during  the  period  and the proceeds from the issuance of common
stock  under employee stock plans and related tax benefits from stock options.

The  Company  has  available credit line facilities for up to $46.2 million of
which $6.2 million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements
for  the  Company's  wholly  owned  Irish  subsidiary.    At June 27, 1998, no
borrowings  were  outstanding  under  the  lines  of  credit.

The  Company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from
operations  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy the Company's cash needs for the
foreseeable  future.  The  Company  will continue to evaluate opportunities to
obtain  additional  wafer  capacity,  procure additional capital equipment and
facilities,  develop  new  products,  and  acquire  businesses,  products  or
technologies  that  would  complement  the  Company's  businesses  and may use
available  cash  or  other  sources  of  funding  for  such  purposes.


FACTORS  AFFECTING  FUTURE  OPERATING  RESULTS
- ----------------------------------------------

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical market patterns characterized by
diminished  product  demand, limited visibility of demand for products further
out  than  three to nine months, accelerated erosion of average selling prices
and  overcapacity.  The Company's results of operations are affected by a wide
variety of factors, including general economic conditions, conditions relating
to  technology  companies,  conditions specific to the semiconductor industry,
decreases  in  average selling prices over the life of any particular product,
the  timing  of new product introductions (by the Company, its competitors and
others),  the  ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product
in  a  timely  manner,  the  timely  implementation  of  new  manufacturing
technologies,  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from
competitors,  and the impact of new technologies resulting in rapid escalation
of demand for some products in the face of equally steep decline in demand for
others.  Market demand for the Company's products, particularly for those most
recently  introduced,  can  be  difficult  to  predict, especially in light of
customers'  demands  to  shorten  product  lead  times  and minimize inventory
levels.    Unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if the
Company  were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products in
a  given  quarter.  In  addition,  any  difficulty in achieving targeted wafer
production yields could adversely impact the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations.    The Company attempts to identify changes in market
conditions  as  soon  as  possible;  however,  the dynamics of the market make
prediction  of  and  timely  reaction  to  such  events difficult.  Due to the
foregoing  and  other factors, past results, including those described in this
report,  are  much  less reliable predictors of the future than is the case in
many  older,  more  stable  and less dynamic industries.  Based on the factors
noted  herein,  the  Company  may  experience  substantial  period-to-period
fluctuations  in  future  operating  results.

The Company's future success depends in large part on the continued service of
its  key  technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel and on its
ability  to  continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly
important  are  those  highly  skilled  design,  process,  software  and  test
engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development
of new products and processes.  The competition for such personnel is intense,
and  the  loss  of  key  employees could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

Sales and operations outside of the United States subject the Company to risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.    The  Company's  financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in
which it does significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates  affecting  those  countries.    Specifically, the Company has sales and
operations  in  the  Asian  markets,  including Southeast Asia and Japan.  The
recent  instability  in  the  Asian  financial  markets has adversely impacted
revenues  and  may  continue  to adversely impact revenues in those markets in
several  ways,  including  reduced  access  to  sources  of  capital needed by
customers to make purchases and increased exchange rate differentials that may
adversely  effect  the customer's ability to purchase or the Company's ability
to  sell  at  competitive  prices.   In addition, the instability may increase
credit  risks  as  the recent weakening of certain Asian currencies may impair
customers'  ability to repay existing obligations.  Depending on the situation
in Asia in coming quarters, any or all of these factors could adversely impact
the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations in the near
future.

Additionally,  risks  include  government  regulation  of exports, tariffs and
other  potential  trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual property
rights  in some countries, and generally longer receivable collection periods.
The  Company's  business  is  also  subject  to  the risks associated with the
imposition  of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import
or  export  of  semiconductor  products.    The Company cannot predict whether
quotas,  duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the
United  States  or  other countries upon the importation or exportation of the
Company's  products  in  the future or what, if any, effect such actions would
have  on  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

In  order  to expand international sales and service, the Company will need to
maintain  and  expand  existing  foreign  operations  or establish new foreign
operations.    This  entails  hiring  additional  personnel and maintaining or
expanding  existing  relationships  with  international distributors and sales
representatives.    This  will  require  significant  management attention and
financial  resources  and  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.    There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in its maintenance or expansion of existing foreign
operations,  in  its establishment of new foreign operations or in its efforts
to  maintain  or  expand  its relationships with international distributors or
sales  representatives.

Many  of  the  Company's operations are centered in an area of California that
has been seismically active.  Should there be a major earthquake in this area,
the  Company's  operations  may be disrupted resulting in the inability of the
Company to manufacture or ship products in a timely manner, thereby materially
adversely  affecting  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations.

In  addition,  the  securities  of  many  high  technology  companies  have
historically  been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may
adversely  affect  the  market  price  of  the  Company's  common  stock.

DEPENDENCE  UPON  INDEPENDENT  MANUFACTURERS  AND  SUBCONTRACTORS

The Company does not manufacture the wafers used for its products.  During the
past  several  years,  most  of the Company's wafers have been manufactured by
Seiko  Epson Corporation (Seiko Epson) and UMC.  The Company has depended upon
these  suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and
cost  attributes,  including  transitioning  to advanced manufacturing process
technologies,  producing  wafers  at acceptable yields, and delivering them to
the  Company  in  a timely manner.  While the timeliness, yield and quality of
wafer  deliveries have met the Company's requirements to date, there can be no
assurance  that  the  Company's  wafer  suppliers  will  not experience future
manufacturing  problems,  including  delays  in  the  realization  of advanced
manufacturing process technologies.  Additionally, disruption of operations at
these  foundries  for any reason, including natural disasters such as fires or
earthquakes  as  well as disrupted access to adequate supplies of electricity,
natural  gas  or  water  would  cause  delays  in  shipments  of the Company's
products, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations.    The  Company  is  also  dependent  on subcontractors to provide
semiconductor  assembly services.  Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or
assembly  services  with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate
yields  or  timely  deliveries from these manufacturers and subcontractors, or
any  other  circumstance  that  would  require the Company to seek alternative
sources  of  supply, could delay shipments, and have a material adverse effect
on  the  Company's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

The  Company's  growth  will  depend in large part on the Company's ability to
obtain  increased  wafer  fabrication  capacity  and  assembly  services  from
suppliers  which  are  cost  effective.    In order to secure additional wafer
capacity,  the  Company  from  time to time considers alternatives, including,
without  limitation,  equity  investments  in,  or  loans,  deposits, or other
financial commitments to, independent wafer manufacturers to secure production
capacity,  or  the  use  of  contracts  which  commit  the Company to purchase
specified quantities of wafers over extended periods.  Although the Company is
currently  able  to  obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner,
the  Company  has  at  times  been unable, and may in the future be unable, to
fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints, including the
ability  of  suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services in
satisfaction of customer delivery dates, as well as the ability of the Company
to  process  products  for  shipment.   In addition, a significant increase in
general  industry  demand  or  any  interruption  of  supply  could reduce the
Company's  supply  of  wafers  or  increase the Company's cost of such wafers.
Such  events  could  have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

LITIGATION

The Company is currently engaged in several lawsuits.  See "Legal Proceedings"
in  Part  II.

DEPENDENCE  ON  NEW  PRODUCTS

The  Company's  future success depends in large part on its ability to develop
and  introduce  on  a  timely  basis  new  products  which  address  customer
requirements  and compete effectively on the basis of price, functionality and
performance.    The  success  of  new  product introductions is dependent upon
several  factors,  including  timely  completion  of  new product designs, the
ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies, achievement of
acceptable  yields,  availability  of  supporting  software  design  tools,
utilization  of predefined cores of logic and market acceptance.  No assurance
can be given that the Company's product development efforts will be successful
or that its new products will achieve market acceptance.  Revenues relating to
some  of  the Company's mature products are expected to continue to decline in
the  future.    As  a  result,  the  Company will be increasingly dependent on
revenues  derived from newer products.  In addition, the average selling price
for  any particular product tends to decrease rapidly over the product's life.
To  offset  such  decreases,  the  Company relies primarily on obtaining yield
improvements  and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing
products  and  on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features
and  other  price/performance  factors such that higher average selling prices
and  higher  margins  are achievable relative to mature product lines.  To the
extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in
a timely manner, or the Company's products do not achieve market acceptance at
prices  with  higher margins, the Company's financial condition and results of
operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

COMPETITION

The  Company's field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable
logic  devices  (CPLDs)  compete in the programmable logic marketplace, with a
substantial  majority  of the Company's revenues derived from its FPGA product
families.    The  industries  in  which  the  Company  competes  are intensely
competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, rapid product
obsolescence  and continuous price erosion.  The Company expects significantly
increased  competition  both from existing competitors and from companies that
may  enter  its  market.

Xilinx  believes  that important competitive factors in the programmable logic
market  include  price,  product  performance and reliability, adaptability of
products  to  specific applications, ease of use and functionality of software
design  tools,  functionality  of predefined cores of logic and the ability to
provide  timely  customer  service  and  support.   The Company's strategy for
expansion  in the programmable logic market includes continued introduction of
new  product architectures which address high volume, low cost applications as
well  as  high  performance,  leading  edge density applications and continued
price  reductions  proportionate  with  the  ability  to  lower  the  cost  of
manufacture for established products.  However, there can be no assurance that
the  Company  will  be  successful  in  achieving  these  strategies.

The Company's major sources of competition fall into four main categories: the
manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers  of  high  density
programmable  logic  products  characterized  by  FPGA-type  architectures,
providers  of high speed, low density CPLDs devices and other providers of new
or  emerging  programmable  logic  products.  The Company competes with custom
gate  array  manufacturers  on  the  basis  of  lower  design  costs,  shorter
development  schedules and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of
custom  gate  arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in
high  volumes.    The  Company  continues  to develop lower cost architectures
intended  to narrow the gap between current custom gate array production costs
(in  high  volumes)  and PLD production costs.  The Company competes with high
density  programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance, the ability
to  deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers, voltage and customer support,
taking  advantage  of  the  primary  characteristics  of  flexible, high speed
implementation  and  quick  time-to-market  capabilities  of the Company's PLD
product  offerings.    Competition  among CPLD suppliers is based primarily on
price,  performance,  design,  software  utility  and  the  ability to deliver
complete  solutions  to  customers.    In  addition, the Company competes with
manufacturers  of  new or emerging programmable logic products on the basis of
price,  performance,  customer  support,  software  utility and the ability to
deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers.  Some of the Company's current or
potential  competitors  have  substantially  greater financial, manufacturing,
marketing  and  technical  resources  than  Xilinx.    To the extent that such
efforts  to  compete are not successful, the Company's financial condition and
results  of  operations  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY

The  Company  relies upon patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to
protect  its  intellectual  property.    There  can  be no assurance that such
intellectual  property  rights  can  be successfully asserted in the future or
will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  From time to time, third
parties, including competitors of the Company, have asserted patent, copyright
and  other  intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to
the  Company.    There  can be no assurance that third parties will not assert
infringement  claims  against  the  Company  in the future, that assertions by
third  parties  will not result in costly litigation or that the Company would
prevail  in  such  litigation  or  be  able to license any valid and infringed
patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially reasonable terms.  Litigation,
regardless  of  its outcome, could result in substantial cost and diversion of
resources  of the Company.  Any infringement claim or other litigation against
or  by  the  Company could materially adversely affect the Company's financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

YEAR  2000  COMPLIANCE

As  is the case with most other companies using computers in their operations,
the  Company  is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year
2000  on  the  processing  of  date-sensitive  information  by  the  Company's
computerized  information  systems,  as  well  as  the  vendor  and  customer
date-sensitive  computerized  information  electronically  transferred  to the
Company.  The year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written
using two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable year.  Any of the
Company's  systems  that  have  time-sensitive software may recognize the year
"00" as 1900 rather than the year 2000, which could result in miscalculations,
classification  errors  or system failures.  Based on preliminary information,
costs  of  addressing  potential problems are not currently expected to have a
material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position, results of
operations  or  cash  flows  in  future periods.  However, if the Company, its
customers  or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues on a timely
basis,  the  Company's  financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely  affected.    Accordingly, the Company plans to devote the necessary
resources  to  resolve  all  significant  year 2000 issues in a timely manner.

PART  II.    OTHER  INFORMATION

Item  1.          LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS

On June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in
the  United  States District Court for the Northern District of California for
infringement  of certain of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera filed
suit  against  the  Company,  alleging  that certain of the Company's products
infringe certain Altera patents.  Fact and expert discovery has been completed
in  both cases, which have been consolidated.  On April 20, 1995, Altera filed
an  additional  suit  against  the  Company  in  the Federal District Court in
Delaware,  alleging  that  the  Company's  XC5200  family  infringes an Altera
patent.  The Company answered the Delaware suit denying that the XC5200 family
infringes  the  patent  in  suit,  asserting  certain affirmative defenses and
counterclaiming  that  the  Altera  Max  9000  family infringes certain of the
Company's  patents.    The  Delaware suit was transferred to the United States
District  Court for the Northern District of California and is also before the
same  judge.

On  July  22,  1998,  the  Company  filed a suit for injunctive relief against
Altera and Joseph Ward, a former Xilinx employee, in the Circuit Court of Cook
County,  Illinois,  to  prevent  disclosure  of  certain  Company confidential
information.    On  the  same  day,  Altera  filed suit against the Company in
Superior  Court  in  Santa  Clara  County,  California,  arising from the same
events.    Altera's  suit  requests  declaratory relief and claims the Company
engages  in  unfair  business  practices  and  interference  with  contractual
relations.

On  July  31, 1998, the Lemelson Foundation Partnership filed a lawsuit in the
United  States  District  Court  in  Phoenix, Arizona against Xilinx, Inc. and
twenty-five  (25) other Unites States semiconductor companies for infringement
of  certain  of  its  patents.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot be determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has meritorious defenses to such claims and is
defending  them  vigorously.    The  foregoing  is a forward-looking statement
subject  to  risks  and uncertainties, and the future outcome of these matters
could  differ  materially due to the uncertain nature of each legal proceeding
and  because  the lawsuits are still in the pre-discovery or pre-trial stages.

There are no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company  is  a  party  or  of  which  any of its property is the subject.  The
Company  knows  of  no  legal  proceedings  contemplated  by  any governmental
authority  or  agency.
