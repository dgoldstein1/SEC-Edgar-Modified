              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)
                                  JUNE 30, 2000

       1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

       The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
       have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
       principles for interim financial information and with Article 10 of
       Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
       and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for
       complete financial statements. All adjustments which, in the opinion of
       management, are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
       results of operations for the periods shown are of a normal recurring
       nature and have been reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated
       financial statements. The results of operations for the periods presented
       are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full
       fiscal year or for any future period. The information included in these
       unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
       conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
       Condition and Results of Operations contained in this report and the
       consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the
       Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
       fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.

       2.    USE OF ESTIMATES

       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
       accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed
       consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. While the
       Company believes that such estimates are fair when considered in
       conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial position and
       results of operations taken as a whole, the actual amount of such
       estimates, when known, will vary from these estimates.

       3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION

       Revenue is recognized when earned. The Company's revenue recognition
       policies are in compliance with the American Institute of Certified
       Public Accountants Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2 (as amended by SOP
       98-4 and SOP 98-9) "Software Revenue Recognition." Product revenues are
       recognized upon shipment of the software product only if no significant
       Company obligations remain, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
       collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable. Revenue from
       packaged product sales to distributors and resellers is recorded when
       related products are shipped. In software arrangements that include
       rights to multiple software products, post-contract customer support
       ("PCS"), and/or other services, the Company allocates the total
       arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value
       of each of the deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence
       ("VSOE"). The Company sells software and PCS separately and VSOE is
       determined by the price charged when each element is sold separately.
       Product returns and sales allowances, including stock rotations, are
       estimated and provided for at the time of sale. Non-recurring engineering
       fees are recognized ratably as the work is performed. Revenues from
       training and consulting are recognized when the services are performed.
       Service and subscription revenues from customer maintenance fees for
       ongoing customer support and product updates and upgrades are based on
       the price charged or derived value of the undelivered elements and are
       recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically
       twelve months. Service revenues, which are immaterial when compared to
       net revenues, are included in net revenues on the face of the
       consolidated statements of income.

        4.   EARNINGS PER SHARE

       Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of
       common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
       is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive
       common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common
       share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock
       options. The shares related to the Company's convertible subordinated
       debentures were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
       share due to of their antidilutive effect.

       All share and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect
       the two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on March
       25, 1999 to stockholders of record as of March 17, 1999, and the
       two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on February
       16, 2000 to stockholders of record as of January 31, 2000.

       The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
       earnings per share:

       5.  ACQUISITION

       In February 2000, the Company acquired all of the operating assets of the
       Innovex Group, Inc. ("Innovex"), a privately owned e-business consulting
       services organization specializing in the design, development and
       implementation of Web-based solutions and systems integration, for
       approximately $47.8 million, of which $28.7 million was paid at the
       closing date and the balance is payable, in equal installments 18 and 24
       months after the closing date, contingent on future events, as set forth
       in the acquisition agreement.

       The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The cost in excess of
       net tangible assets acquired was approximately $26.1 million, of which
       $9.0 million was allocated to the acquired workforce and $17.1 million
       was allocated to goodwill. The cost associated with the acquired
       workforce and goodwill are both being amortized on a straight-line basis
       over six and four years, respectively. The results of operations of
       Innovex are included in the Company's results of operations from the date
       of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price was based on an
       independent report. Contingent payments to be made at future dates, if
       any, will be accounted for as additional purchase price and amortized
       over the remaining life of the intangible assets acquired.

       6. SEGMENT INFORMATION

       The Company operates in a single market consisting of the design,
       development, marketing and support of client and server-based computing
       software for enterprise applications. Design, development, marketing and
       support operations outside of the United States are conducted through
       subsidiaries located primarily in Europe and the Asia Pacific region.

       The Company tracks revenue and gross margin by geography and product
       category but does not track operating expenses nor identifiable assets on
       a product category basis. The Company does not engage in intercompany
       transfers between segments. The Company's management evaluates
       performance based primarily on revenues and profit in the geographic
       locations in which the Company operates. Segment profit for each segment
       includes sales and marketing expenses directly attributable to the
       segment and excludes certain expenses which are managed outside the
       reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment profit primarily consist
       of cost of revenues, research and development costs, interest, corporate
       expenses, including income taxes, as well as non-recurring charges for
       purchased in-process technology, and overhead costs, including rent,
       utilities, depreciation and amortization. Corporate expenses are
       comprised primarily of corporate marketing costs, operations and other
       general and administrative expenses which are separately managed.
       Accounting policies of the segments are the same as the Company's
       consolidated accounting policies.

       Net revenues and segment profit, classified by the major geographic areas
       in which the Company operates, are as follows:

8. INCOME TAXES

In July 1999, the Company changed its organizational structure whereby it moved
certain operational and administrative processes to overseas subsidiaries. The
restructuring resulted in foreign earnings being taxed at lower foreign tax
rates. Effective January 1, 2000, these earnings will be permanently reinvested
overseas in order to fund the Company's growth in overseas markets. As a result,
the Company's effective tax rate was reduced to 30% for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2000 from 36% for the same periods in the prior year.

9. CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

In March 1999, the Company completed a private placement of $850.0 million
principal amount at maturity of its zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures (the "debentures") due March 22, 2019. The debentures were priced
with a yield to maturity of 5.25% and resulted in net proceeds to the Company of
approximately $291.9 million, net of original issue discount and net of debt
issuance costs of $9.6 million. Except under limited circumstances, no interest
will be paid on the debentures prior to maturity. The debentures are convertible
at the option of the security holder at any time on or before the maturity date
at a conversion rate of 14.0612 shares of the Company's common stock for each
$1,000 principal amount at maturity of debentures, subject to adjustment in
certain events. The Company may redeem the debentures on or after March 22,
2004. Holders may require the Company to repurchase the debentures, at set
redemption prices (equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue
discount) beginning on March 22, 2004. Interest expense related to the
debentures was $4.2 million and $4.1 million for the three month periods ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Interest expense related to the debentures
was $8.4 million and $4.5 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2000
and 1999, respectively. In March and April of 2000, holders of an aggregate face







                                       10
<PAGE>   11
value amount of $200,000 of debentures converted the notes into approximately
2,810 shares of the Company's common stock. The Company made immaterial payments
in connection with these conversions.

10.  OTHER REVENUES

In May 1997, the Company entered into an agreement, as amended (the
"Agreement"), with Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), which provides for the
licensing of certain of the Company's multi-user software enhancements and for
the cooperation between the parties for the development of certain future
software. At the time of the agreement, Microsoft held in excess of 5% of the
Company's outstanding common stock and also had a representative on the
Company's Board of Directors. Microsoft is no longer a significant shareholder
and no longer has Board representation. Amounts arising from the Agreement are
designated as other revenue. Deferred revenue at June 30, 2000 and December 31,
1999 includes $73.9 million and $93.8 million, respectively, related to this
agreement which is being recognized ratably over the five year term of the
Agreement, which began in May 1997.

11. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

On April 15, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program
authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's common stock.
Purchases, if any, will be made from time to time in the open market and paid
out of general corporate funds. As of June 30, 2000, none of the Company's
outstanding common stock had been repurchased under this program. As of August
8, 2000, the Company purchased 1,050,000 shares of outstanding common stock on
the open market at an average price $15.12 per share.

On August 8, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with a counterparty in
a private transaction to purchase up to 5.8 million shares of the Company's
common stock at various times through the third quarter of 2002. Pursuant to the
terms of the agreement, $100 million will be paid to the counterparty in August
2000. The ultimate number of shares repurchased will depend on market
conditions. Shares received under the agreement will be recorded as treasury
stock.

12. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In June 2000, the Company and certain of its officers and directors were named
as defendants in several securities class action lawsuits filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. These actions, which
were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock during the
period October 20, 1999 to June 9, 2000, generally allege that, during the class
period, the defendants made misstatements to the investing public about the
Company's financial condition and prospects. The complaints seek unspecified
damages. The Company believes the plaintiffs' claims lack merit and intends to
vigorously defend the lawsuits.

13. RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications have been made for consistent presentation.

14. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 137,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement 133. The Statement defers the effective date of
SFAS 133 to fiscal 2001. Management is evaluating SFAS 133 and does not believe
that adoption of the Statement will have a material impact on its financial
statements.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements." SAB 101 summarizes the requirements that must be met in order to
recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure of revenue recognition
policies. In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB No. 101B which delays the
implementation date of SAB 101 until no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal


                                       11
<PAGE>   12




2000. The Company does not expect the adoption of SAB 101 to have a material
effect on its financial position or results of operation.

In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44 ("FIN 44"), "Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation", an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"). FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB 25 with
respect to: the definition of an employee for the purposes of applying APB 25,
the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory
plan, the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a
previously fixed stock option or awards, and the accounting for an exchange of
stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1,
2000, but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either
December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The Company does not expect the adoption
of FIN 44 to have a material effect of its financial position or results of
operation.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

      The Company develops, markets, sells and supports innovative client and
server-based computing software that enables effective and efficient deployment
and management of enterprise applications that are designed for Microsoft
Windows(R) operating systems. The Company's Windows Application Servers, which
comprise the largest source of the Company's revenue, primarily consist of the
MetaFrame(TM) product line and related options. The MetaFrame product line,
which began shipping in the second quarter of 1998, permits organizations to
deploy Windows applications without regard to location, network connection, or
type of client hardware platforms.

      On May 9, 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into a License,
Development and Marketing Agreement, as amended (the "Development Agreement"),
which provides for the licensing to Microsoft of certain of the Company's
multi-user software enhancements to Microsoft's Windows NT Server and for the
cooperation between the parties for the development of certain future multi-user
versions of Microsoft Windows NT Server, including Microsoft Windows NT Server,
Terminal Server Edition and Microsoft Windows 2000 (collectively, "NT Server").
As a result of the Development Agreement, the Company continues to support the
Microsoft Windows NT platform, but the MetaFrame products and later releases
will no longer directly incorporate Windows NT technology. The Company plans to
continue developing enhancements to its MetaFrame product line and expects that
this product and associated options will constitute a majority of its revenues
for the foreseeable future.

      The Company's revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position ("SOP")
97-2 (as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9) and related interpretations,
"Software Revenue Recognition" as described in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

      In February 2000, the Company acquired all of the operating assets of the
Innovex Group, Inc. ("Innovex"), a privately owned e-business consulting

</TABLE>


      NET REVENUES. Net revenues are presented below in five categories: Windows
Application Servers, Management Services Products, Computing Appliances
Products, Microsoft Royalties and Other Revenue. Windows Application Servers
revenue represents fees related primarily to the licensing of the Company's
MetaFrame product, subscription for product updates and upgrades and additional
user licenses. Computing Appliances Products revenue consists of license fees
and royalties from OEMs who are granted a license to incorporate and/or market
the Company's multi-user technologies in their own product offerings. Management
Services Products consist of system option products such as Load Balancing
Services, Resource Management Services and other options. Microsoft royalties
represent fees recognized in connection with the Development Agreement.

      With respect to product mix, the increase in net revenues for the three
months ended June 30, 2000 compared to the three months ended June 30, 1999 was
primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of shipments of Management
Services Products and an increase in Windows Application Servers revenue which
was due to an increase in the number of MetaFrame licenses sold. The increase in
Windows Application Servers revenue was partially offset by a decrease in
revenue from the WinFrame product line. The increase in net revenues was also
due to an increase in other revenue due mainly to customer support revenue. The
Company anticipates Management Services Products will continue to account for an
increasing percentage of net revenues.

      The increase in net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2000
compared to the six months ended June 30, 1999 was primarily attributable to an
increase in Windows Application Servers revenue due primarily to an increase in
the number of MetaFrame licenses sold. To a lesser extent, the increase in net
revenues was due to an increase in the volume of shipments of Management
Services Products, specifically, Load Balancing Services and Resource Management
Services Products.

</TABLE>


      SEGMENT REVENUES. The increase in net revenues by operating segment was
primarily due to the Company's increased sales and marketing efforts in Europe,
Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and in the Americas however, revenue by
operating segment as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively constant
for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000 compared to the same
periods in 1999.

     An analysis of net revenues by operating segment is presented in the table
below:

</TABLE>

       (1) Primarily represents royalty fees earned in connection with the
Development Agreement and OEM revenue.

      With respect to operating segments, the increase in net revenues for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2000 was primarily attributable to continued
demand for Citrix products in the Americas and EMEA regions and larger scale
MetaFrame implementations in these regions. Other revenue has remained
relatively stable, from the second quarter of 1999 to the second quarter of
2000, but has decreased as a percentage of net revenues due to the growth of the
other segments.

      The Company expects to continue investing in international markets and
expanding its international operations by establishing additional foreign
operations, hiring personnel, expanding its international sales force and
continuing to add third party channel partners.

      COST OF REVENUES. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of
royalties, product media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials and
shipping expense. All development costs incurred in connection with the
Development Agreement were expensed as incurred as a separate component of cost
of revenues. The Company's cost of revenues excludes amortization of core
technology. Cost of revenues also consists of compensation and other
personnel-related costs for consulting services.

      GROSS MARGIN. Gross margin decreased for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2000 primarily due to a reserve for obsolete inventory. To a lesser
extent, the decrease in gross margin was attributable to costs associated with
the Innovex acquisition as the consultants obtained in that acquisition are not
yet fully integrated into the Company's consulting services business. The
Company anticipates gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will increase
from current levels but will remain below historical levels as the Company
increases its consulting services offering which has a lower gross profit margin
than that associated with the sale of software licenses.







                                       15
<PAGE>   16



      RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses
consisted primarily of personnel-related costs. All development costs included
in the research and development of software products and enhancements to
existing products have been expensed as incurred except for certain intangible
assets related to certain acquisitions and licensing arrangements. The increase
in research and development expenses resulted primarily from additional
staffing, associated salaries and related expenses required to expand and
enhance the Company's product lines.

      SALES, MARKETING AND SUPPORT EXPENSES. The increase in sales, marketing
and support expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2000 resulted
primarily from increased advertising and corporate branding and marketing
activities directed at customer and business partner acquisition and retention.
The increase was also due to higher headcount levels of sales, services and
marketing staff and associated salaries, commissions and related expenses in
order to increase the Company's sales, consulting and marketing efforts.

      GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. The increase in general and
administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2000 was
primarily due to increased expenses associated with additional staff, associated
salaries and related expenses necessary to support overall increases in the
scope and geographical diversity of the Company's operations. The increase was
also due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts resulting from
the reserve of specific customers' accounts receivable balances, an increase in
consulting fees for information systems projects and an increase in legal fees
relating to litigation defense. The Company is in the early stages of an
enterprise resource planning implementation project. While a significant portion
of the costs associated with this project will be capitalized, certain costs
will be expensed during the course of the project, which is expected to continue
through 2001.

      AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. The increase in amortization of
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets is primarily due to the acquisition
of ViewSoft, Inc. ("ViewSoft") in July 1999 and Innovex in February 2000 which
resulted in additional goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of $31.1
million and $26.7 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2000, the Company had
net goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of $75.4 million associated with
these and other transactions which will be fully amortized over two to six
years. The Company anticipates that amortization of goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets will increase as the Company continues to search for suitable
acquisition candidates.

      IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. In connection with the acquisition of
certain in-process software technologies from ViewSoft, the Company allocated
$2.3 million of the purchase price to In-Process Research and Development
("IPR&D"). During 1998, the Company completed acquisitions of certain in-process
software technologies in which it allocated a portion of the purchase price to
IPR&D. The Company allocated $10.7 million and $2.4 million for IPR&D related to
the APM Ltd ("APM") and VDOnet Corporation, Ltd ("VDOnet") acquisitions,
respectively.

      Since the respective dates of acquisition, the Company has used the
acquired in-process technology to develop new product offerings and
enhancements, which have or will become part of the Company's suite of products
when completed. Functionality included in products using the acquired in-process
technology have been introduced at various times following the respective
transaction dates of the acquired assets. The Company currently expects to
complete the development of the remaining projects at various dates in 2000.
Upon completion, the Company has offered and intends to offer the related
products to its customers.

      The nature of the efforts required to develop and integrate the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products or features and
functionalities within the Citrix suite of existing products principally relate
to the completion of all planning, designing and testing activities that are
necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design
requirements, including functions, features and technical performance
requirements. The Company currently expects that products utilizing the acquired





                                       16
<PAGE>   17




in-process technology will be successfully developed, but there can be no
assurance that commercial viability of any of these products will be achieved.
Furthermore, future developments in the software industry, particularly the
server-based computing environment, changes in technology, changes in other
products and offerings or other developments may cause the Company to alter or
abandon product plans.

      Failure to complete the development of these projects in their entirety,
or in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's
financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given that
actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired in-process
research and development will not deviate from the projections used to value
such technology in connection with each of the respective acquisitions. Ongoing
operations and financial results for acquired assets, and the Company as a
whole, are subject to a variety of factors which may not have been known or
estimable at the date of such transactions, and the estimates discussed below
should not be considered the Company's current projections for operating results
for the acquired assets or the Company as a whole.

      A description of the in-process research and development and the estimates
made by the Company for APM, VDOnet, and ViewSoft is summarized below. After the
acquisition of each technology, the Company has continued the development of
these in-process projects. The updated status of completion for each project is
set forth in the table below.

APM

      The in-process research and development acquired in the APM acquisition
consisted primarily of one significant research and development project. The
project is a Windows NT-based application server which runs Java applications.
At the date of the acquisition, APM was shipping a Java application server
solution that allowed an enterprise user to access Java-applets from the
Internet and execute these applets outside the corporate firewall in a
server-based computing configuration in a fashion that was transparent to the
enterprise user. APM was in the process of modifying its software product to
incorporate changes necessary for it to interface with Java 2.0, which was a
major new release that included significant rewrites to the Java desktop.
Following the acquisition, the Company planned on continuing the process of
incorporating changes necessary to interface with Java 2.0, and in addition,
planned on further developing the software product into an application server
for Java 2.0 that would operate in a MetaFrame server environment.

In the second quarter of 2000, management changed the Java application server to
a Java Performance Pack product, which adds performance enhancements and
management tools to other Citrix products. The remaining efforts to complete the
project are primarily the continuing incorporation of changes necessary to
interface with Java 2.0 and the utilization of acquired technology to develop a
Java Performance Pack product that will operate in a MetaFrame server
environment. The research and development risks associated with this project
relate primarily to updating the acquired technology to be compatible with Sun
Microsystems' Java 2.0 application, integrating and porting such technology into
a variety of server-based computing architectures.

VDONET

      The in-process research and development acquired in the VDOnet acquisition
consisted primarily of one significant research and development project, ICA
Video Services. This project allows video applications and applications
containing video to be viewed on an ICA client, and is targeted for the
server-based computing market. At the date of the acquisition, VDOnet was
shipping a client server video streaming product that was not operational in a
Windows NT or in a MetaFrame environment. VDOnet was in the process of modifying
its software to be operational in a Windows NT environment. In addition, VDOnet
was developing enhancements that would provide for a live camera feed and
multicast, which is intended to direct a video stream to multiple client devices





                                       17

simultaneously. Following the acquisition, the Company continued the process of
modifying the VDOnet software to be operational in a Windows NT environment and
is continuing the development of enhancements that would provide for live camera
feed and multicast. In addition, the Company plans on further developing the
software to be operational in a MetaFrame environment.

      The remaining efforts to complete the project are primarily the continuing
modification of the VDOnet software to be operational in a Windows NT
environment and the continuation of enhancements that provide for live camera
feed and multicast functionality and the utilization of acquired technology to
develop a video server that is operational in a MetaFrame server environment.
The research and development risks associated with this project relate primarily
to integrating this product into the server-based computing environment.

VIEWSOFT

      The in-process research and development acquired in the ViewSoft
acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development
project, ViewSoft Internet 4.0. This project enables multi-tier, Web-based
application development and deployment. At the date of the valuation, ViewSoft
was in development with this product. The product was intended to operate in the
multi-tier web application market and was not intended to operate in a MetaFrame
environment.

      The remaining efforts to complete the project relate primarily to on-going
stress testing and, to a lesser extent, bug fixes and documentation. The
research and development risks associated with this project relate primarily to
potential design flaws revealed during testing.

      The actual and estimated costs to complete and completion dates of the
in-process and core technology acquired for each acquisition are as follows:

</TABLE>


      The estimated completion date of the in-process and core technology
related to the APM acquisition has been extended from the originally anticipated
completion date as certain personnel working on this project have been allocated
to other projects and as development efforts of the APM technology have been
redirected from a Java application server to a Java Performance Pack to
accommodate changes in the development of the Java market. The completion date
of the in-process and core technology acquired from VDOnet has been delayed from
the originally anticipated completion date due to changes in the development of
these technologies resulting from end user feedback. The estimated completion
date of the ViewSoft project has been delayed from the originally anticipated
completion date due to increases in project scope and a longer testing period.
The Company is currently unable to determine the impact of such delays on its





                                       18

business, future results of operations and financial condition. There can be no
assurance that the Company will not incur additional charges in subsequent
periods to reflect costs associated with completing these projects or that the
Company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further develop these
technologies.

      INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME. The increase in interest and other income for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2000 was primarily due to interest
earned on the invested net proceeds from the issuance of the zero coupon
convertible subordinated debentures in March 1999 and from an increase in cash
from operations. The Company may acquire or make investments in companies it
believes are related to its strategic objectives. Such investments will reduce
the Company's cash and/or investment balances and therefore may reduce interest
income.

      INTEREST EXPENSE. The increase in interest expense for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2000 was primarily due to interest related to the zero
coupon convertible subordinated debentures issued in March 1999.

      INCOME TAXES. In July 1999, the Company changed its organizational
structure whereby it moved certain operational and administrative processes to
overseas subsidiaries. The restructuring resulted in foreign earnings being
taxed at lower foreign tax rates. These earnings will be permanently reinvested
overseas in order to fund the Company's growth in overseas markets. As a result
of these organizational changes, the Company's effective tax rate amounted to
30% for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 36% for the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 1999.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

      During the six months ended June 30, 2000, the Company generated positive
operating cash flows of approximately $116.7 million. Cash provided by operating
activities was derived primarily from net income of $53.5 million, adjusted for,
among other things, tax benefits from the exercise of non-statutory stock
options and disqualifing dispositions of incentive stock options of $72.5
million, non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $23.0 million,
offset by a net decrease of $55.1 from changes in operating assets and
liabilities. Cash used in investing activities of $32.0 million related
primarily to the purchase of investments of $90.8 million, net cash paid for the
acquisition of Innovex of $28.1 million and the purchase of property and
equipment of $19.2 million. These cash outflows were offset by cash inflows from
the sale of investments of approximately $106.1 million. Cash provided by
financing activities of $50.1 million is a result of the proceeds from the
issuance of common stock under the Company's stock option plan.

      As of June 30, 2000, the Company had approximately $888.3 million in cash
and investments and $643.2 million of working capital. The Company's cash and
cash equivalents are invested in investment grade, highly liquid securities to
minimize interest rate risk and allow for flexibility in the event of immediate
cash needs. At June 30, 2000, the Company had approximately $57.3 million in
accounts receivable, net of allowances, and $110.9 million of deferred revenues,
of which the Company anticipates $76.8 million will be earned over the next
twelve months.

      On April 15, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase
program authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's common





                                       19
<PAGE>   20



stock. Purchases will be made from time to time in the open market and paid out
of general corporate funds. As of June 30, 2000, none of the Company's
outstanding common stock had been repurchased under this program. As of August
8, 2000, the Company purchased 1,050,000 shares of outstanding common stock on
the open market at an average price $15.12 per share.

      On August 8, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with a
counterparty in a private transaction to purchase up to 5.8 million shares of
the Company's common stock at various times through the third quarter of 2002.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, $100 million will be paid to the
counterparty in August 2000. The ultimate number of shares repurchased will
depend on market conditions.

      In February 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the
operating assets of Innovex for approximately $47.8 million, of which $28.1
million was paid in cash at the closing date and the balance is payable, in
equal installments, 18 and 24 months after the closing date, contingent upon
future events.

      The Company believes existing cash and investments together with cash flow
expected from operations will be sufficient to meet operating and capital
expenditures requirements through 2000. The Company may from time to time seek
to raise additional funds through public or private financing. The Company may
also acquire or make investments in companies it believes are related to its
strategic objectives. Such investments will reduce the Company's available
working capital.

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE

      Last year, the Company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to
become Year 2000 ready. In late 1999, the Company completed its identification
and testing of systems. As a result of those efforts, the Company experienced no
significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and
non-information technology systems and believes those systems successfully
responded to the Year 2000 date change. The Company has not incurred any
material expenditure in connection with identifying or evaluating Year 2000
compliance issues. The Company estimates it will not incur any material levels
of expenditure on this issue during 2000 to support its compliance initiatives.
The Company is not aware of any material problems resulting from Year 2000
issues, either with its products, its internal systems, or the products and
services of third parties. The Company will continue to monitor its computer
systems and those of its suppliers and vendors to ensure that any latent Year
2000 matters that may arise are addressed promptly.

CERTAIN FACTORS WHICH MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

      We do not provide financial performance forecasts. Our operating results
and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary
significantly depending on a number of factors. Except for the historical
information in this report, the matters contained in this report include
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The following
factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report. Such factors,
among others, may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

OUR SUCCESS IS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP
WITH MICROSOFT

      Microsoft is the leading provider of desktop operating systems. We depend
upon the license of key technology from Microsoft, including certain source and
object code licenses, and technical support. We also depend upon our strategic
alliance agreement with Microsoft pursuant to which Citrix and Microsoft have
agreed to cooperate to develop advanced operating systems. Our relationship with
Microsoft is subject to the following risks and uncertainties:

o     COMPETITION WITH MICROSOFT. NT Server is, and future product offerings by
      Microsoft may be, competitive with our current MetaFrame products, and any
      future product offerings by Citrix.

o     EXPIRATION OF MICROSOFT'S ENDORSEMENT OF THE ICA PROTOCOL. Microsoft's
      obligation to endorse only our ICA protocol as the preferred method to
      provide multi-user Windows access for devices other than Windows clients
      expired in November 1999. Microsoft may now market or endorse other
      methods to provide multi-user Windows access to non-Windows client
      devices.

o     DEPENDENCE ON MICROSOFT FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. Our ability to successfully
      commercialize our MetaFrame product depends on Microsoft's ability to
      market NT Server products. We do not have control over Microsoft or any
      of its distributors or resellers. Microsoft is not obligated to continue
      marketing specific NT Server products, and could discontinue one or more
      NT Server products at any time. Further, to our knowledge, Microsoft's
      distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from
      Microsoft.




                                       20
<PAGE>   21



o     PRODUCT RELEASE DELAYS. There may be delays in the release and shipment of
      future versions of NT Server.

o     IMPACT OF MICROSOFT ANTITRUST LITIGATION ON CITRIX INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
      The United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in the
      matter of UNITED STATES V. MICROSOFT, Civ. No. 98-1232 ET SEQ., by order
      of June 7, 2000 directed that Microsoft be required to share certain
      intellectual property with certain other firms in the information
      technology industry. The scope of the District Court's order, and its
      potential impact, if any, upon any intellectual property licensed by
      Citrix to Microsoft, have not been clarified by the District Court or
      otherwise, because the District Court, by order of June 20, 2000, stayed
      its order of June 7, 2000 until the currently pending appeals in the
      matter have been concluded, or until the District Court's stay is earlier
      vacated by an appellate court.

      If our relationship with Microsoft were terminated or adversely affected
for any reason, our business, operating results and financial condition would be
materially adversely affected.

OUR CONTINUED GROWTH DEPENDS UPON BROAD-BASED ACCEPTANCE OF OUR ICA PROTOCOL

      We believe that our success in the markets in which we compete will depend
upon our ability to make the ICA protocol a widely accepted standard for
supporting Windows applications. Microsoft includes as a component of NT
Server its Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which has certain of the capabilities
of our ICA protocol, and may offer customers a competitive solution. We believe
that our success is dependent on our ability to enhance and differentiate our
ICA protocol, and foster broad acceptance of the ICA protocol based on its
performance, scalability, reliability and enhanced features. In addition, our
ability to win broad market acceptance of our ICA protocol will depend upon the
degree of success achieved by our strategic partners in marketing their
respective product offerings, product pricing and customers' assessment of our
technical, managerial, service and support expertise. If another standard
emerges or if we otherwise fail to achieve wide acceptance of the ICA protocol
as a standard for supporting Windows applications, our business, operating
results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS ALSO DEPENDS UPON OUR STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH
PARTIES OTHER THAN MICROSOFT

      In addition to our relationship with Microsoft, we have strategic
relationships with IBM, Compaq, Hewlett Packard and others. We depend upon our
strategic partners to successfully market and promote the use of our products
and incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell such
products. If we are unable to maintain our current strategic relationships or
develop additional strategic relationships, or if any of our key strategic
partners are unsuccessful in incorporating our technology into their products or
marketing or selling such products, our business, operating results and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

      The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive. Most of our
competitors and potential competitors, including Microsoft, have significantly
greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. The
announcement of the release and the actual release of products competitive with
our existing and future product lines, such as NT Server and related
enhancements by Microsoft or third parties, could cause our existing and
potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license our product lines.
This would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial
condition. Further, our ability to market MetaFrame and other future product




                                       21
<PAGE>   22





offerings may be affected by Microsoft's licensing and pricing scheme for client
devices implementing our product offerings which attach to NT Server.

      In addition, alternative products exist for Internet commerce that
directly or indirectly compete with our products. Existing or new products that
extend website software to provide database access or interactive computing
could materially impact our ability to sell our products in this market. As
markets for our products continue to develop, additional companies, including
companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware, software
and networking industries, may enter the markets in which we compete and further
intensify competition. Finally, although we believe that price has historically
been a less significant competitive factor than product performance, reliability
and functionality, we believe that price competition may become more significant
in the future. We may not be able to maintain our historic prices, and any
inability to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

OUR RELIANCE ON A FEW PRODUCTS FOR A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

      The Company anticipates that its MetaFrame product line and related
enhancements will constitute the majority of its revenue for the foreseeable
future. The Company's ability to generate revenue from its MetaFrame product
will depend upon market acceptance of NT Server products. Declines in demand for
products based on MetaFrame technology may occur as a result of new competitive
product releases, price competition, lack of success of its strategic partners,
technological change or other factors.

FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE OUR GROWTH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

      We have recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of our operations,
the number of our employees and the geographic area of our operations. In
addition, we have recently completed certain acquisitions. Such growth and
assimilation of operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed
and may continue to place a significant strain on our managerial, operational
and financial resources. We believe we have made adequate allowances for the
costs and risks associated with these expansions. However, our systems,
procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our current or future
operations. In addition, we may not be able to effectively manage this expansion
and still achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market
opportunity for our products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner.
Our future operating results will also depend on our ability to manage our
expanding product line, expand our sales and marketing organizations and expand
our support organization commensurate with the increasing base of our installed
product. Our failure to properly manage our growth could adversely affect our
business, operating results and financial condition.

      We plan to increase our professional staff during 2000 as we implement
sales, marketing and support and product developments efforts, as well as
associated administrative systems, to support planned growth. As a result of
this planned growth in the size of our staff, we believe that we will require
additional facilities during 2000. Although we believe that the cost of such
additional facilities will not significantly impact our financial position or
results of operations, we anticipate that operating expenses will increase
during 2000 as a result of our planned growth in staff. Such an increase in
operating expenses may reduce our income from operations and cash flows from
operating activities.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY

      We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade
secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions,
to protect our proprietary rights. Our efforts to protect our proprietary
technology rights may not be successful. The loss of any material trade secret,
trademark, tradename or copyright could have a material adverse effect on us.
Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to
copy certain portions of our products or to obtain and use information regarded
as proprietary. A significant portion of our sales are derived from license




                                       22
<PAGE>   23




agreements for packaged products. Such license agreements are not signed by
licensees and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain
jurisdictions. In addition, our ability to protect our proprietary rights may be
affected by the following:

o     Differences in International Law. The laws of some foreign countries do
      not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of
      the United States and Canada.

o     Third Party Infringement Claims. Third parties may assert infringement
      claims against us in the future. This may result in costly litigation or
      require us to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of such
      third parties. Such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or
      at all.

IF WE FAIL TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS TO KEEP
UP WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE

      The markets for our products are relatively new and are characterized by:

o     rapid technological change;
o     evolving industry standards;
o     changes in customer requirements; and
o     frequent new product introductions and enhancements, including
      enhancements to certain key technology licensed from Microsoft.

      These market characteristics will require us to continuously enhance our
current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with
technological developments and respond to evolving customer requirements.
Additionally, we and others may announce new products, new product enhancements
or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing
product offerings.

     We believe we will incur additional costs and royalties associated with the
development, licensing or acquisition of new technologies or enhancements to
existing products. This will increase our cost of revenues and operating
expenses. We cannot currently quantify such increase with respect to
transactions that have not occurred. We may use a substantial portion of our
cash and investments to fund these additional costs, resulting in a decrease in
interest income, unless such decrease is offset by cash flows from future
operations.

     We may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products, product
enhancements and technologies and to fulfill our responsibilities under the
terms of the Development Agreement. If we are unable to add staff and resources,
future enhancement and additional features to our existing or future products
may be delayed, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

IF OUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN ERRORS, THEY MAY BE COSTLY TO CORRECT, REVENUE MAY BE
DELAYED, WE COULD GET SUED AND OUR REPUTATION COULD BE HARMED

     Despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers,
new products may contain errors after commencement of commercial shipments.
Additionally, our products depend upon certain third party products which may
contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them
useless. Since our products are often used in mission-critical applications,
errors in our products or the products of third parties upon which our products
rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers. The
occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial
condition.



                                       23
<PAGE>   24



OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND AND MANAGE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
AND MAJOR DISTRIBUTORS

     We rely significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the
marketing and distribution of our products. We do not control our distributors
and resellers. Additionally, our distributors and resellers are not obligated to
purchase products from us and may also represent other lines of products.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

     We intend to leverage our relationships with hardware and software vendors
and systems integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute our
products. In addition, an integral part of our strategy is to expand our large
account channels and add third-party distributors both domestically and
internationally. We are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest,
significant resources to develop these channels, which could reduce our profits.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT LARGE ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS

     We intend to attract and service large enterprise customers by expanding
our large account channels and offering consulting services. Our inability to
attract large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, large
enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer
sales cycles which could negatively impact our revenues. Further, as we attempt
to attract large enterprise customers, we may need to increase corporate
branding activities which will increase our operating expenses, but may not
proportionally increase our operating revenues.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON BROAD-BASED ACCEPTANCE OF INTERNET-BASED BUSINESS
SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS

     We intend to leverage our relationships with application service providers
("ASP") to encourage them to use our products in providing their solutions to
end users. The ASP market is in its nascent stage of development but is evolving
quickly. We cannot predict when or if the ASP market will fully evolve into a
commercially viable market. We are currently investing, and intend to continue
to invest, significant resources to develop these channels, which could reduce
our profits.

IF OUR GROWTH RATE DOES NOT CONTINUE OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE AFFECTED

     Our revenue growth rate in 2000 may not approach the levels attained in
recent years. To the extent our revenue growth continues, we believe that our
cost of revenues and certain operating expenses will also increase. A
significant portion of our expenses, such as employee compensation and rent, are
relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in
part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. Our income from
operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease
as a percentage of revenues in 2000.



                                       24
<PAGE>   25



OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE

     Our quarterly operating results have in the past varied and may in the
future vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including:

o     the success of our MetaFrame products;
o     the effects of acquisitions or licenses of additional technology;
o     the size, timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders;
o     increased competition;
o     changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors, including
      Microsoft;
o     new product introductions or enhancements by competitors;
o     delays in the introduction of products or product enhancements by us or
      our competitors;
o     customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products;
o     market acceptance of new products and technologies offered by us;
o     changes in operating expenses, including for the addition of personnel;
o     foreign currency exchange rates; and
o     general economic conditions.

     We continually re-evaluate our programs, including specific license terms
and conditions, to market our current and future products and services. We may
implement new programs, including offering specified and unspecified
enhancements to our current and future product lines. We may recognize revenues
associated with such enhancements after the initial shipment or licensing of the
software product or over the product's life cycle. We modified our licensing
fees with certain customers to a per usage basis. We may implement a different
licensing model, in certain circumstances, which would result in the recognition
of licensing fees over a longer period which may result in decreasing revenue.
The timing of the implementation of such programs, the timing of the release of
such enhancements, the timing of the implementation of a new licensing
arrangement and other factors will impact the timing of our recognition of
revenues and related expenses associated with our products, related enhancements
and services. As a result of these factors, we currently cannot quantify the
impact of the re-evaluation of our programs on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

     We operate with little order backlog because our software products
typically are shipped shortly after orders are received. In addition, like many
systems level software companies, we recognize a substantial portion of our
revenues in the last month of a quarter, with these revenues frequently
concentrated in the last weeks or days of the quarter. As a result, product
revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped
in that quarter, and revenues for any future quarter are not predictable with
any degree of certainty. We may also choose to reduce prices or increase
spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities. New
competitors, technological advances or other factors could result in lower
revenues and may require us to incur additional expenses, which, in turn, would
materially adversely affect our operating margins in the future.

INSUFFICIENT RESERVES FOR PRODUCT RETURNS AND PRICE REDUCTIONS COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT US

     We provide certain of our distributors with product return rights for stock
balancing or limited product evaluation. We also provide certain of our
distributors with price protection rights. To cover these product returns and
price protection rights, we have established reserves based on our evaluation of
historical trends and current circumstances. These reserves may not prove to be
sufficient in the future, in which case our business, operating results and
financial condition could be adversely affected.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND AND MANAGE OUR INTERNATIONAL
OPERATIONS

     Our continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of
our international operations. To successfully expand international sales, we
must establish additional foreign operations, hire additional personnel and
recruit additional international resellers. Such international operations are
subject to certain risks, such as:

o     difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
o     fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
o     compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements;
o     variability of foreign economic and political conditions;
o     changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements, tariffs or other
      trade barriers or by United States export laws;
o     costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign
      countries;
o     longer accounts receivable payment cycles;
o     potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on
      repatriation of earnings;
o     difficulties in protecting intellectual property; and
o     burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS

     The demand for our products depends in part upon the general demand for
computer hardware and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors,
including capital spending levels and general economic conditions. If capital
spending levels or general economic conditions are affected, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

POSSIBLE VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE

     The market price for our common stock has been volatile and has fluctuated
significantly to date. The trading price of our common stock is likely to
continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to
factors such as actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial
results, anticipated revenue or earnings growth, analyst reports or
recommendations and other events or factors, many of which are beyond our
control. In addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq National
Market and the market for software companies and technology companies in
particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These broad
market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price
of the common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Following
periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities
class-action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. For
example, on June 23, 2000, the Company and certain of its officers and directors
were named as defendants in several securities class action lawsuits filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. These
actions, which were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock
during the period October 20, 1999 to June 9, 2000, generally allege that,
during the class period, the defendants made misstatements to the investing
public about the Company's financial condition and prospects. The complaints
seek unspecified damages. The Company believes the plaintiffs' claims lack merit
and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuits.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The following discussion about the Company's market risk includes
"forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual
results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements.

     The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
or trading purposes. The Company maintains a non-trading investment portfolio of
investment grade, highly liquid, debt securities which limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one issue, issuer, or type of instrument. The securities
in the Company's investment portfolio are not leveraged and are generally
classified as available-for-sale and therefore are subject to interest rate
risk. The Company does not currently hedge interest rate exposure, however, the
Board of Directors adopted a Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy on July 27,
2000. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising
from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending
fair values include principal plus accrued interest, dividends and reinvestment
income. If market interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from
December 31, 1999 levels, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by
approximately $4.5 million. If market interest rates were to increase by 100
basis points from June 30, 2000 levels, the fair value of the portfolio would
decline by approximately $3.1 million.

                           PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In June 2000, the Company and certain of its officers and directors were
named as defendants in several securities class action lawsuits filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. These
actions, which were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock
during the period October 20, 1999 to June 9, 2000, generally allege that,
during the class period, the defendants made misstatements to the investing
public about the Company's financial condition and prospects. The complaints
seek unspecified damages. The Company believes the plaintiffs' claims lack merit
and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuits.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     At the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held May 18, 2000 (the
"2000 Annual Meeting"), the Company's stockholders took the following actions:

(1)      The Company's stockholders elected Edward E. Iacobucci, Michael W.
         Brown and John W. White, each as Class II directors, each to serve for
         a three-year term expiring at the Company's annual meeting of
         stockholders in 2003 or until his successor has been duly elected and
         qualified or until his early resignation or removal. Election of the
         directors was determined by a plurality of the votes cast at the 2000
         Annual Meeting. With respect to such matter, the votes were cast as
         follows: 163,070,436 shares voted for the election of Mr. Iacobucci;

         shares voted for the election of Mr. White; and 666,575 shares were
         withheld from the election of Mr. Iacobucci; 532,258 shares were
         withheld from the election of Mr. Brown and 519,339 shares were
         withheld from the election of Mr. White. No other persons were
         nominated, or received votes, for election as directors of the Company
         at the 2000 Annual Meeting. The other directors of the Company whose
         term of office continued after the annual meeting were: Robert N.
         Goldman, Tyrone F. Pike, Roger W. Roberts, Mark B. Templeton, Kevin R.
         Compton, and Stephen M. Dow.

(2)      The Company's stockholders approved and adopted an amendment to the
         Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
         amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company's
         Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 400,000,000 to
         1,000,000,000 shares. With respect to such matter, the votes were cast
         as follows: 139,634,051 shares voted for the proposal, 23,641,925
         shares voted against the proposal and 461,035 shares abstained from
         voting on the proposal.

(3)      The Company's stockholders approved the Corporation's 2000 Director and
         Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan. With respect to such matter,
         the votes were cast as follows: 68,240,919 shares voted for the
         proposal, 57,398,893 voted against the proposal, 735,858 shares
         abstained from voting on the proposal, and 35,842,601 shares did not
         vote with respect to the proposal. The Company's annual meeting of
         stockholders adjourned without voting on one proposal.

     On June 2, 2000, the Company's annual meeting of stockholders was
reconvened, and the Company's stockholders approved an amendment and restatement
to the Corporation's 1995 Stock Plan increasing from 69,945,623 (adjusted for
stock splits) to 80,000,000 the number of shares of Common stock available under






                                       28

                              CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

                           SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED
                                 1995 STOCK PLAN


         1. PURPOSE. The purpose of the Citrix Systems, Inc. Amended and
Restated 1995 Stock Plan (the "Plan") is to encourage key employees of Citrix
Systems, Inc. (the "Company") and of any present or future parent or subsidiary
of the Company (collectively, "Related Corporations") and other individuals who
render services to the Company or a Related Corporation, by providing
opportunities to participate in the ownership of the Company and its future
growth through (a) the grant of options which qualify as "incentive stock
options" ("ISOs") under Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"); (b) the grant of options which do not qualify as ISOs
("Non-Qualified Options"); (c) awards of stock in the Company ("Awards"); and
(d) opportunities to make direct purchases of stock in the Company
("Purchases"). Both ISOs and Non-Qualified Options are referred to hereafter
individually as an "Option" and collectively as "Options." Options, Awards and
authorizations to make Purchases are referred to hereafter collectively as
"Stock Rights." As used herein, the terms "parent" and "subsidiary" mean "parent
corporation" and "subsidiary corporation," respectively, as those terms are
defined in Section 424 of the Code.

         2. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

                  A. BOARD OR COMMITTEE ADMINISTRATION. The Plan shall be
         administered by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") or
         by a committee appointed by the Board (the "Committee"); provided that
         the Plan shall be administered: (i) to the extent required by
         applicable regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code, by two or more
         "outside directors" (as defined in applicable regulations thereunder)
         and (ii) to the extent required by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
         Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any successor provision ("Rule
         16b-3"), by a disinterested administrator or administrators within the
         meaning of Rule 16b-3. Hereinafter, all references in this Plan to the
         "Committee" shall mean the Board if no Committee has been appointed.
         Subject to ratification of the grant or authorization of each Stock
         Right by the Board (if so required by applicable state law), and
         subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have the
         authority to (i) determine to whom (from among the class of employees
         eligible under paragraph 3 to receive ISOs) ISOs shall be granted, and
         to whom (from among the class of individuals and entities eligible
         under paragraph 3 to receive Non-Qualified Options and Awards and to
         make Purchases) Non-Qualified Options, Awards and authorizations to
         make Purchases may be granted; (ii) determine the time or times at
         which Options or Awards shall be granted or Purchases made; (iii)
         determine the purchase price of shares subject to each Option or
         Purchase, which prices shall not be less than the minimum price
         specified in paragraph 6; (iv) determine whether each Option granted
         shall be an ISO or a Non-Qualified Option; (v) determine (subject to
         paragraph 7) the time or times when each Option shall become
         exercisable and the duration of the exercise period; (vi) extend



<PAGE>   2
                                      -2-


         the period during which outstanding Options may be exercised; (vii)
         determine whether restrictions such as repurchase options are to be
         imposed on shares subject to Options, Awards and Purchases and the
         nature of such restrictions, if any, and (viii) interpret the Plan and
         prescribe and rescind rules and regulations relating to it. If the
         Committee determines to issue a Non-Qualified Option, it shall take
         whatever actions it deems necessary, under Section 422 of the Code and
         the regulations promulgated thereunder, to ensure that such Option is
         not treated as an ISO. The interpretation and construction by the
         Committee of any provisions of the Plan or of any Stock Right granted
         under it shall be final unless otherwise determined by the Board. The
         Committee may from time to time adopt such rules and regulations for
         carrying out the Plan as it may deem advisable. No member of the Board
         or the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made
         in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Stock Right granted under
         it.

                  B. COMMITTEE ACTIONS. The Committee may select one of its
         members as its chairman, and shall hold meetings at such time and
         places as it may determine. A majority of the Committee shall
         constitute a quorum and acts of a majority of the members of the
         Committee at a meeting at which a quorum is present, or acts reduced to
         or approved in writing by all the members of the Committee (if
         consistent with applicable state law), shall be the valid acts of the
         Committee. From time to time the Board may increase the size of the
         Committee and appoint additional members thereof, remove members (with
         or without cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor,
         fill vacancies however caused, or remove all members of the Committee
         and thereafter directly administer the Plan.

                  C. GRANT OF STOCK RIGHTS TO BOARD MEMBERS. Subject to the
         provisions of the first sentence of paragraph 2(A) above, if
         applicable, Stock Rights may be granted to members of the Board. All
         grants of Stock Rights to members of the Board shall in all other
         respects be made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan
         applicable to other eligible persons. Consistent with the provisions of
         the first sentence of Paragraph 2(A) above, members of the Board who
         either (i) are eligible to receive grants of Stock Rights pursuant to
         the Plan or (ii) have been granted Stock Rights may vote on any matters
         affecting the administration of the Plan or the grant of any Stock
         Rights pursuant to the Plan, except that no such member shall act upon
         the granting to himself or herself of Stock Rights, but any such member
         may be counted in determining the existence of a quorum at any meeting
         of the Board during which action is taken with respect to the granting
         to such member of Stock Rights.

         3. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS. ISOs may be granted only to employees
of the Company or any Related Corporation. Non-Qualified Options, Awards and
authorizations to make Purchases may be granted to any employee, officer or
director (whether or not also an employee) or consultant of the Company or any
Related Corporation. The Committee may take into consideration a recipient's
individual circumstances in determining whether to grant a Stock Right. The
granting of any Stock Right to any individual or entity shall neither entitle
that individual or entity to, nor disqualify such individual or entity from,
participation in any other grant of Stock Rights.




<PAGE>   3
                                      -3-


         4. STOCK. The stock subject to Stock Rights shall be authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the
"Common Stock"), or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company in any
manner. Subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 13, the aggregate number
of shares which may be issued pursuant to the Plan is 80,000,000 (as adjusted
for stock splits which occurred prior to the amendment and restatement of this
Plan) plus, effective as of January 1, 2001 and each year thereafter, a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to five percent (5%) of the total number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on
December 31 of the preceding year. If any Stock Right granted under the Plan
shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full
or shall cease for any reason to be exercisable in whole or in part or shall be
repurchased by the Company, the shares of Common Stock subject to such Stock
Right shall again be available for grants of Stock Rights under the Plan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph 4, no more than an
aggregate of 60,000,000 shares of Common Stock (as adjusted for stock splits
which occurred prior to the amendment and restatement of this Plan) may be
issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs granted under the Plan (including shares
issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs granted under the Plan that are the
subject of disqualifying dispositions within the meaning of Sections 421, 422
and 424 of the Code and the regulations thereunder).

         No employee of the Company or any Related Corporation may be granted
Options to acquire, in the aggregate, more than 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock
(as adjusted for stock splits which occurred prior to the amendment and
restatement of this Plan) under the Plan during any fiscal year of the Company.
If any Option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any reason
without having been exercised in full or shall cease for any reason to be
exercisable in whole or in part or shall be repurchased by the Company, the
shares subject to such Option shall be included in the determination of the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock deemed to have been granted to such
employee under the Plan.

         5. GRANTING OF STOCK RIGHTS. Stock Rights may be granted under the Plan
at any time on or after September 28, 1995 and prior to September 29, 2005. The
date of grant of a Stock Right under the Plan will be the date specified by the
Committee at the time it grants the Stock Right; provided, however, that such
date shall not be prior to the date on which the Committee acts to approve the
grant. Options granted under the Plan are intended to qualify as
performance-based compensation to the extent required under Proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.162-27.

         6. MINIMUM OPTION PRICE; ISO LIMITATIONS; OTHER LIMITATIONS.

                  A. PRICE FOR NON-QUALIFIED OPTIONS, AWARDS AND PURCHASES. The
         exercise price per share specified in the agreement relating to each
         Non-Qualified Option granted shall not be less than the fair market
         value per share of Common Stock on the date of such grant, PROVIDED
         HOWEVER, that if option is expressly granted in lieu of a reasonable
         amount of salary or cash bonus, the exercise price per share specified
         in the agreement relating to each such Non-Qualified Option may be
         equal to or greater than 85% of the




<PAGE>   4
                                      -4-


         fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of such grant.
         The purchase price per share of stock granted in any Award or
         authorized as a Purchase, under the Plan shall in no event be less than
         the minimum legal consideration required therefor under the laws of any
         jurisdiction in which the Company or its successors in interest may be
         organized.

                  B. PRICE FOR ISOs. The exercise price per share specified in
         the agreement relating to each ISO granted under the Plan shall not be
         less than the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date
         of such grant. In the case of an ISO to be granted to an employee
         owning stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total
         combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any
         Related Corporation, the price per share specified in the agreement
         relating to such ISO shall not be less than one hundred ten percent
         (110%) of the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date
         of grant. For purposes of determining stock ownership under this
         paragraph, the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply.

                  C. $100,000 ANNUAL LIMITATION ON ISO VESTING. Each eligible
         employee may be granted Options treated as ISOs only to the extent
         that, in the aggregate under this Plan and all incentive stock option
         plans of the Company and any Related Corporation, ISOs do not become
         exercisable for the first time by such employee during any calendar
         year with respect to stock having a fair market value (determined at
         the time the ISOs were granted) in excess of $100,000. The Company
         intends to designate any Options granted in excess of such limitation
         as Non-Qualified Options.

                  D. DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE. If, at the time an
         Option is granted under the Plan, the Company's Common Stock is
         publicly traded, "fair market value" shall be determined as of the date
         of grant or, if the prices or quotes discussed in this sentence are
         unavailable for such date, the last business day for which such prices
         or quotes are available prior to the date of grant and shall mean (i)
         the average (on that date) of the high and low prices of the Common
         Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common
         Stock is traded, if the Common Stock is then traded on a national
         securities exchange; or (ii) the last reported sale price (on that
         date) of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, if the Common
         Stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange; or (iii)
         the closing bid price (or average of bid prices) last quoted (on that
         date) by an established quotation service for over-the-counter
         securities, if the Common Stock is not reported on the Nasdaq Stock
         Market. If the Common Stock is not publicly traded at the time an
         Option is granted under the Plan, "fair market value" shall mean the
         fair value of the Common Stock as determined by the Committee after
         taking into consideration all factors which it deems appropriate,
         including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the
         Common Stock in private transactions negotiated at arm's length.

                  E. RESTRICTED STOCK LIMITATIONS. Awards of restricted stock
         shall be subject to a vesting schedule of a minimum of three years,
         PROVIDED HOWEVER, that an Award of



<PAGE>   5
                                      -5-


         restricted stock subject to a performance based vesting schedule may be
         subject to a vesting schedule of a minimum of one year.

                  F. PROHIBITION ON REPRICING AND REGRANTS. No Option shall be
         repriced, or terminated and subsequently regranted, at a lower purchase
         price per share than the original grant, without the prior affirmative
         vote of a majority of the shares of stock of the Company present at a
         stockholders' meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote
         thereon.

         7. OPTION DURATION. Subject to earlier termination as provided in
paragraphs 9 and 10 or in the agreement relating to such Option, each Option
shall expire on the date specified by the Committee, but not more than (i) ten
years from the date of grant in the case of Options generally and (ii) five
years from the date of grant in the case of ISOs granted to an employee owning
stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power
of all classes of stock of the Company or any Related Corporation, as determined
under paragraph 6(B). Subject to earlier termination as provided in paragraphs 9
and 10, the term of each ISO shall be the term set forth in the original
instrument granting such ISO, except with respect to any part of such ISO that
is converted into a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to paragraph 16.

         8. EXERCISE OF OPTION. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 9
through 12, each Option granted under the Plan shall be exercisable as follows:

                  A. VESTING. The Option shall either be fully exercisable on
         the date of grant or shall become exercisable thereafter in such
         installments as the Committee may specify.

                  B. FULL VESTING OF INSTALLMENTS. Once an installment becomes
         exercisable it shall remain exercisable until expiration or termination
         of the Option, unless otherwise specified by the Committee.

                  C. PARTIAL EXERCISE. Each Option or installment may be
         exercised at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, for up
         to the total number of shares with respect to which it is then
         exercisable.

                  D. ACCELERATION OF VESTING. The Committee shall have the right
         to accelerate the date that any installment of any Option becomes
         exercisable; provided that the Committee shall not, without the consent
         of an optionee, accelerate the permitted exercise date of any
         installment of any Option granted to any employee as an ISO (and not
         previously converted into a Non-Qualified Option pursuant to paragraph
         16) if such acceleration would violate the annual vesting limitation
         contained in Section 422(d) of the Code, as described in paragraph
         6(C).

         9. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Unless otherwise specified in the
agreement relating to such ISO, if an ISO optionee ceases to be employed by the
Company and all Related Corporations other than by reason of death or disability
as defined in paragraph 10, no further



<PAGE>   6
                                      -6-


installments of his or her ISOs shall become exercisable, and his or her ISOs
shall terminate on the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days after the date of
termination of his or her employment, or (b) their specified expiration dates,
except to the extent that such ISOs (or unexercised installments thereof) have
been converted into Non-Qualified Options pursuant to paragraph 16. For purposes
of this paragraph 9, employment shall be considered as continuing uninterrupted
during any bona fide leave of absence (such as those attributable to illness,
military obligations or governmental service) provided that the period of such
leave does not exceed 90 days or, if longer, any period during which such
optionee's right to reemployment is guaranteed by statute. A bona fide leave of
absence with the written approval of the Committee shall not be considered an
interruption of employment under this paragraph 9, provided that such written
approval contractually obligates the Company or any Related Corporation to
continue the employment of the optionee after the approved period of absence.
ISOs granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of employment
within or among the Company and Related Corporations, so long as the optionee
continues to be an employee of the Company or any Related Corporation. Nothing
in the Plan shall be deemed to give any grantee of any Stock Right the right to
be retained in employment or other service by the Company or any Related
Corporation for any period of time.

         10. DEATH; DISABILITY.

                  A. DEATH. If an ISO optionee ceases to be employed by the
         Company and all Related Corporations by reason of his or her death, any
         ISO owned by such optionee may be exercised, to the extent otherwise
         exercisable on the date of death, by the estate, personal
         representative or beneficiary who has acquired the ISO by will or by
         the laws of descent and distribution, until the earlier of (i) the
         specified expiration date of the ISO or (ii) 180 days from the date of
         the optionee's death.

                  B. DISABILITY. If an ISO optionee ceases to be employed by the
         Company and all Related Corporations by reason of his or her
         disability, such optionee shall have the right to exercise any ISO held
         by him or her on the date of termination of employment, for the number
         of shares for which he or she could have exercised it on that date,
         until the earlier of (i) the specified expiration date of the ISO or
         (ii) 180 days from the date of the termination of the optionee's
         employment. For the purposes of the Plan, the term "disability" shall
         mean "permanent and total disability" as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of
         the Code or any successor statute.

         11. ASSIGNABILITY. No Stock Right shall be assignable or transferable
by the grantee except by will, by the laws of descent and distribution or, in
the case of Non-Qualified Options only, pursuant to a valid domestic relations
order. Except as set forth in the previous sentence, during the lifetime of a
grantee each Stock Right shall be exercisable only by such grantee.

         12. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS. Options shall be evidenced by
instruments (which need not be identical) in such forms as the Committee may
from time to time approve. Such instruments shall conform to the terms and
conditions set forth in paragraphs 6 through 11 hereof and may contain such
other provisions as the Committee deems advisable which are not



<PAGE>   7
                                      -7-


inconsistent with the Plan, including restrictions applicable to shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options. The Committee may specify that
any Non-Qualified Option shall be subject to the restrictions set forth herein
with respect to ISOs, or to such other termination and cancellation provisions
as the Committee may determine. The Committee may from time to time confer
authority and responsibility on one or more of its own members and/or one or
more officers of the Company to execute and deliver such instruments. The proper
officers of the Company are authorized and directed to take any and all action
necessary or advisable from time to time to carry out the terms of such
instruments.

         13. ADJUSTMENTS. Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, an
optionee's rights with respect to Options granted to such optionee hereunder
shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided, unless otherwise specifically
provided in the written agreement between the optionee and the Company relating
to such Option:

                  A. STOCK DIVIDENDS AND STOCK SPLITS. If the shares of Common
         Stock shall be subdivided or combined subsequent to the amendment and
         restatement of this Plan into a greater or smaller number of shares or
         if the Company shall issue any shares of Common Stock as a stock
         dividend on its outstanding Common Stock, the number of shares of
         Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise of Options shall be
         appropriately increased or decreased proportionately, and appropriate
         adjustments shall be made in the purchase price per share to reflect
         such subdivision, combination or stock dividend.

                  B. CONSOLIDATIONS OR MERGERS. If the Company is to be
         consolidated with or acquired by another entity in a merger, sale of
         all or substantially all of the Company's assets or otherwise (an
         "Acquisition"), the Committee or the board of directors of any entity
         assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder (the "Successor
         Board"), shall, as to outstanding Options, either (i) make appropriate
         provision for the continuation of such Options by substituting on an
         equitable basis for the shares then subject to such Options either (a)
         the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of
         Common Stock in connection with the Acquisition, (b) shares of stock of
         the surviving corporation or (c) such other securities as the Successor
         Board deems appropriate, the fair market value of which shall not
         materially exceed the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock
         subject to such Options immediately preceding the Acquisition; or (ii)
         upon written notice to the optionees, provide that all Options must be
         exercised, to the extent then exercisable, within a specified number of
         days of the date of such notice, at the end of which period the Options
         shall terminate; or (iii) terminate all Options in exchange for a cash
         payment equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares
         subject to such Options (to the extent then exercisable) over the
         exercise price thereof.

                  C. RECAPITALIZATION OR REORGANIZATION. In the event of a
         recapitalization or reorganization of the Company (other than a
         transaction described in subparagraph B above) pursuant to which
         securities of the Company or of another corporation are issued with
         respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock, an optionee upon
         exercising an Option shall be entitled to receive for the purchase
         price paid upon such exercise the



<PAGE>   8
                                      -8-


         securities he or she would have received if he or she had exercised
         such Option prior to such recapitalization or reorganization.

                  D. MODIFICATION OF ISOs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
         adjustments made pursuant to subparagraphs A, B or C with respect to
         ISOs shall be made only after the Committee, after consulting with
         counsel for the Company, determines whether such adjustments would
         constitute a "modification" of such ISOs (as that term is defined in
         Section 424 of the Code) or would cause any adverse tax consequences
         for the holders of such ISOs. If the Committee determines that such
         adjustments made with respect to ISOs would constitute a modification
         of such ISOs or would cause adverse tax consequences to the holders, it
         may refrain from making such adjustments.

                  E. DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION. In the event of the proposed
         dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each Option will terminate
         immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action or at
         such other time and subject to such other conditions as shall be
         determined by the Committee.

                  F. ISSUANCES OF SECURITIES. Except as expressly provided
         herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or
         securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect,
         and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the
         number or price of shares subject to Options. No adjustments shall be
         made for dividends paid in cash or in property other than securities of
         the Company.

                  G. FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares shall be issued
         under the Plan and the optionee shall receive from the Company cash in
         lieu of such fractional shares.

                  H. ADJUSTMENTS. Upon the happening of any of the events
         described in subparagraphs A, B or C above, the class and aggregate
         number of shares set forth in paragraph 4 hereof that are subject to
         Stock Rights which previously have been or subsequently may be granted
         under the Plan shall also be appropriately adjusted to reflect the
         events described in such subparagraphs. The Committee or the Successor
         Board shall determine the specific adjustments to be made under this
         paragraph 13 and, subject to paragraph 2, its determination shall be
         conclusive.

         14. MEANS OF EXERCISING OPTIONS. An Option (or any part or installment
thereof) shall be exercised by giving written notice to the Company at its
principal office address, or to such transfer agent as the Company shall
designate. Such notice shall identify the Option being exercised and specify the
number of shares as to which such Option is being exercised, accompanied by full
payment of the purchase price therefor either (a) in United States dollars in
cash or by check, (b) at the discretion of the Committee, through delivery of
shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal as of the date of the
exercise to the cash exercise price of the Option, (c) at the discretion of the
Committee, by delivery of the grantee's personal recourse note bearing interest
payable not less than annually at no less than 100% of the lowest applicable
Federal rate, as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code, (d) at the discretion
of the Committee and consistent with applicable law, through the delivery of an
assignment to the Company of a



<PAGE>   9
                                      -9-


sufficient amount of the proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock acquired
upon exercise of the Option and an authorization to the broker or selling agent
to pay that amount to the Company, which sale shall be at the participant's
direction at the time of exercise, or (e) at the discretion of the Committee, by
any combination of (a), (b), (c) and (d) above. If the Committee exercises its
discretion to permit payment of the exercise price of an ISO by means of the
methods set forth in clauses (b), (c), (d) or (e) of the preceding sentence,
such discretion shall be exercised in writing at the time of the grant of the
ISO in question. The holder of an Option shall not have the rights of a
shareholder with respect to the shares covered by such Option until the date of
issuance of a stock certificate to such holder for such shares. Except as
expressly provided above in paragraph 13 with respect to changes in
capitalization and stock dividends, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or
similar rights for which the record date is before the date such stock
certificate is issued.

         15. TERM AND AMENDMENT OF PLAN. This Plan was adopted by the Board on
September 28, 1995, subject, with respect to the validation of ISOs granted
under the Plan, to approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company at
the next Meeting of Stockholders or, in lieu thereof, by written consent. If the
approval of stockholders is not obtained prior to September 28, 1996, any grants
of ISOs under the Plan made prior to that date will be rescinded. The Plan shall
expire at the end of the day on September 27, 2005 (except as to Options
outstanding on that date). Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 above,
Options may be granted under the Plan prior to the date of stockholder approval
of the Plan. The Board may terminate or amend the Plan in any respect at any
time, except that, without the approval of the stockholders obtained within 12
months before or after the Board adopts a resolution authorizing any of the
following actions: (a) the total number of shares that may be issued under the
Plan may not be increased (except by adjustment pursuant to paragraph 13); (b)
the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan may not be materially
increased; (c) the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan
may not be materially modified; (d) the provisions of paragraph 3 regarding
eligibility for grants of ISOs may not be modified; (e) the provisions of
paragraph 6(B) regarding the exercise price at which shares may be offered
pursuant to ISOs may not be modified (except by adjustment pursuant to paragraph
13); (f) the expiration date of the Plan may not be extended; (g) the Board may
not take any action which would cause the Plan to fail to comply with Rule
16b-3, and (h) the provisions of paragraph 6(F) regarding the prohibition on
repricing and regrant of Options may not be modified. Except as otherwise
provided in this paragraph 15, in no event may action of the Board or
stockholders alter or impair the rights of a grantee, without such grantee's
consent, under any Option previously granted to such grantee.

         16. CONVERSION OF ISOs INTO NON-QUALIFIED OPTIONS. The Committee, at
the written request or with the written consent of any optionee, may in its
discretion take such actions as may be necessary to convert such optionee's ISOs
(or any installments or portions of installments thereof) that have not been
exercised on the date of conversion into Non-Qualified Options at any time prior
to the expiration of such ISOs, regardless of whether the optionee is an
employee of the Company or a Related Corporation at the time of such conversion.
Such actions may include, but shall not be limited to, extending the exercise
period or reducing the exercise price of the appropriate installments of such
ISOs. At the time of such conversion, the



<PAGE>   10
                                      -10-


Committee (with the consent of the optionee) may impose such conditions on the
exercise of the resulting Non-Qualified Options as the Committee in its
discretion may determine, provided that such conditions shall not be
inconsistent with this Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any
optionee the right to have such optionee's ISOs converted into Non-Qualified
Options, and no such conversion shall occur until and unless the Committee takes
appropriate action.

         17. APPLICATION OF FUNDS. The proceeds received by the Company from the
sale of shares pursuant to Options granted and Purchases authorized under the
Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.

         18. NOTICE TO COMPANY OF DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION. By accepting an ISO
granted under the Plan, each optionee agrees to notify the Company in writing
immediately after such optionee makes a Disqualifying Disposition (as described
in Sections 421, 422 and 424 of the Code and regulations thereunder) of any
stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of ISOs granted under the Plan. A
Disqualifying Disposition is generally any disposition occurring on or before
the later of (a) the date two years following the date the ISO was granted or
(b) the date one year following the date the ISO was exercised.

         19. WITHHOLDING OF ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES. Upon the exercise of a
Non-Qualified Option, the grant of an Award, the making of a Purchase of Common
Stock for less than its fair market value, the making of a Disqualifying
Disposition (as defined in paragraph 18), the vesting or transfer of restricted
stock or securities acquired on the exercise of an Option hereunder, or the
making of a distribution or other payment with respect to such stock or
securities, the Company may withhold taxes in respect of amounts that constitute
compensation includable in gross income. The Committee in its discretion may
condition (i) the exercise of an Option, (ii) the grant of an Award, (iii) the
making of a Purchase of Common Stock for less than its fair market value, or
(iv) the vesting or transferability of restricted stock or securities acquired
by exercising an Option, on the grantee's making satisfactory arrangement for
such withholding. Such arrangement may include payment by the grantee in cash or
by check of the amount of the withholding taxes or, at the discretion of the
Committee, by the grantee's delivery of previously held shares of Common Stock
or the withholding from the shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon
exercise of a Option shares having an aggregate fair market value equal to the
amount of such withholding taxes.

         20. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. The Company's obligation to sell and
deliver shares of the Common Stock under this Plan is subject to the approval of
any governmental authority required in connection with the authorization,
issuance or sale of such shares.

         Government regulations may impose reporting or other obligations on the
Company with respect to the Plan. For example, the Company may be required to
send tax information statements to employees and former employees that exercise
ISOs under the Plan, and the Company may be required to file tax information
returns reporting the income received by grantees of Options in connection with
the Plan.



<PAGE>   11
                                      -11-


         21. GOVERNING LAW. The validity and construction of the Plan and the
instruments evidencing Options shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware, or the laws of any jurisdiction in which the Company or its successors
in interest may be organized.

                              CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
            2000 DIRECTOR AND OFFICER STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN

1.       PURPOSE AND ELIGIBILITY

         The purpose of this 2000 Director and Officer Stock Option and
Incentive Plan (the "PLAN") of Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "COMPANY") is to
provide stock options and other equity interests in the Company (each an
"AWARD") to officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all of
whom are eligible to receive Awards under the Plan. Any person to whom an Award
has been granted under the Plan is called a "PARTICIPANT". Additional
definitions are contained in Section 8.

2.       ADMINISTRATION

         a. ADMINISTRATION BY BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The Plan will be administered
by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "BOARD"). The Board, in its sole
discretion, shall have the authority to grant and amend Awards, to adopt, amend
and repeal rules relating to the Plan and to interpret and correct the
provisions of the Plan and any Award. All decisions by the Board shall be final
and binding on all interested persons. Neither the Company nor any member of the
Board shall be liable for any action or determination relating to the Plan.

         b. APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEES. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Board may delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to one or
more committees or subcommittees of the Board (a "COMMITTEE"). All references in
the Plan to the "BOARD" shall mean such Committee or the Board.

         c. DELEGATION TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, the Board may delegate to one or more executive officers of the
Company the power to grant Awards and exercise such other powers under the Plan
as the Board may determine, PROVIDED THAT the Board shall fix the maximum number
of Awards to be granted and the maximum number of shares issuable to any one
Participant pursuant to Awards granted by such executive officers.

3.       STOCK AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS

         a. NUMBER OF SHARES. Subject to adjustment under Section 3(c), the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock of the Company (the "COMMON STOCK")
that may be issued pursuant to the Plan is 4,000,000 shares plus, effective as
of January 1, 2001 and each year thereafter, a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to one-half of one percent (.5%) of the total number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on December 31 of the
preceding year. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph 3(a),
no more than an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options (as hereinafter defined)
granted under the Plan (including



<PAGE>   2

shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under
the Plan that are the subject of disqualifying dispositions within the meaning
of Sections 421, 422 and 424 of the Code and the regulations thereunder). If any
Award expires, or is terminated, surrendered or forfeited, in whole or in part,
the unissued Common Stock covered by such Award shall again be available for the
grant of Awards (other than ISOs) under the Plan. If shares of Common Stock
issued pursuant to the Plan are repurchased by, or are surrendered or forfeited
to, the Company at no more than cost, such shares of Common Stock shall again be
available for the grant of Awards under the Plan. Shares issued under the Plan
may consist in whole or in part of authorized but unissued shares or treasury
shares.

         b. PER-PARTICIPANT LIMIT. Subject to adjustment under Section 3(c), no
Participant may be granted Awards during any one fiscal year to purchase more
than 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock.

         c. ADJUSTMENT TO COMMON STOCK. In the event of any stock split, stock
dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, liquidation, spin-off, split-up,
or other similar change in capitalization or event, (i) the number and class of
securities available for Awards under the Plan and the per-Participant share
limit, (ii) the number and class of securities, vesting schedule and exercise
price per share subject to each outstanding Option, (iii) the repurchase price
per security subject to repurchase, and (iv) the terms of each other outstanding
stock-based Award shall be adjusted by the Company (or substituted Awards may be
made) to the extent the Board shall determine, in good faith, that such an
adjustment (or substitution) is appropriate.

4.       STOCK OPTIONS

         a. GENERAL. The Board may grant options to purchase Common Stock (each,
an "OPTION") and determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by
each Option, the exercise price of each Option and the conditions and
limitations applicable to the exercise of each Option and the Common Stock
issued upon the exercise of each Option, including vesting provisions,
repurchase provisions and restrictions relating to applicable federal or state
securities laws, as it considers advisable.

         b. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. An Option that the Board intends to be an
"incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Code (an "INCENTIVE
STOCK OPTION") shall be granted only to employees of the Company and shall be
subject to and shall be construed consistently with the requirements of Section
422 of the Code. The Board and the Company shall have no liability if an Option
or any part thereof that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option does not
qualify as such. An Option or any part thereof that does not qualify as an
Incentive Stock Option is referred to herein as a "NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTION.

         c. EXERCISE PRICE. The exercise price per share specified in the
applicable option agreement relating to each Option granted shall not be less
than the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of such grant,
PROVIDED HOWEVER, that if a Non-Qualified Option is expressly granted in lieu of
a reasonable amount of salary or cash bonus, the exercise price per




                                      -2-
<PAGE>   3

share specified in the applicable option agreement may be equal to or greater
than 85% of the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of such
grant.

         d. DURATION OF OPTIONS. Each Option shall be exercisable at such times
and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may specify in the
applicable option agreement.

         e. EXERCISE OF OPTION. Options may be exercised only by delivery to the
Company of a written notice of exercise signed by the proper person together
with payment in full as specified in Section 4(f) for the number of shares for
which the Option is exercised.

         f. PAYMENT UPON EXERCISE. Common Stock purchased upon the exercise of
an Option shall be paid for by one or any combination of the following forms of
payment:

                  (i)  by check payable to the order of the Company;

                  (ii) except as otherwise explicitly provided in the applicable
option agreement, and only if the Common Stock is then publicly traded, delivery
of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a creditworthy broker to
deliver promptly to the Company sufficient funds to pay the exercise price, or
delivery by the Participant to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and
unconditional instructions to a creditworthy broker to deliver promptly to the
Company cash or a check sufficient to pay the exercise price; or

                  (iii) to the extent explicitly provided in the applicable
option agreement, by (x) delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the
Participant valued at fair market value (as determined by the Board or as
determined pursuant to the applicable option agreement), (y) delivery of a
promissory note of the Participant to the Company (and delivery to the Company
by the Participant of a check in an amount equal to the par value of the shares
purchased), or (z) payment of such other lawful consideration as the Board may
determine.

         g. PROHIBITION ON REPRICING AND REGRANTS. No Option shall be repriced,
or terminated and subsequently regranted, at a lower purchase price per share
than the original grant, without the prior affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares of stock of the Company present at a stockholders' meeting in person or
by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

5.       RESTRICTED STOCK

         a. GRANTS. The Board may grant Awards entitling recipients to acquire
shares of Common Stock, subject to (i) delivery to the Company by the
Participant of a check in an amount at least equal to the par value of the
shares purchased, and (ii) the right of the Company to repurchase all or part of
such shares at their issue price or other stated or formula price from the
Participant in the event that conditions specified by the Board in the
applicable Award are not satisfied prior to the end of the applicable
restriction period or periods established by the Board for such Award (each, a
"RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD").




                                      -3-
<PAGE>   4

         b. TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The Board shall determine the terms and
conditions of any such Restricted Stock Award, except that all Restricted Stock
Awards shall be subject to a vesting schedule of a minimum of three years,
PROVIDED HOWEVER, that a Restricted Stock Award subject to a performance based
vesting schedule may be subject to a vesting schedule of a minimum of one year.
Any stock certificates issued in respect of a Restricted Stock Award shall be
registered in the name of the Participant and, unless otherwise determined by
the Board, deposited by the Participant, together with a stock power endorsed in
blank, with the Company (or its designee). After the expiration of the
applicable restriction periods, the Company (or such designee) shall deliver the
certificates no longer subject to such restrictions to the Participant or, if
the Participant has died, to the beneficiary designated by a Participant, in a
manner determined by the Board, to receive amounts due or exercise rights of the
Participant in the event of the Participant's death (the "DESIGNATED
BENEFICIARY"). In the absence of an effective designation by a Participant,
Designated Beneficiary shall mean the Participant's estate.

6.       OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS

         The Board shall have the right to grant other Awards based upon the
Common Stock having such terms and conditions as the Board may determine,
including, without limitation, the grant of shares based upon certain
conditions, the grant of securities convertible into Common Stock and the grant
of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or stock units, except that
all other Awards shall be subject to a vesting schedule of a minimum of three
years, PROVIDED HOWEVER, that other Awards subject to a performance based
vesting schedule may be subject to a vesting schedule of a minimum of one year.

7.       GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS

         a. TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS. Except as the Board may otherwise
determine or provide in an Award, Awards shall not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the person to whom they are
granted, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws
of descent and distribution, and, during the life of the Participant, shall be
exercisable only by the Participant. References to a Participant, to the extent
relevant in the context, shall include references to authorized transferees.

         b. DOCUMENTATION. Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by a
written instrument in such form as the Board shall determine or as executed by
an officer of the Company pursuant to authority delegated by the Board. Each
Award may contain terms and conditions in addition to those set forth in the
Plan PROVIDED THAT such terms and conditions do not contravene the provisions of
the Plan.

         c. BOARD DISCRETION. The terms of each type of Award need not be
identical, and the Board need not treat Participants uniformly.

         d. TERMINATION OF STATUS. The Board shall determine the effect on an
Award of the disability, death, retirement, authorized leave of absence or other
change in the employment or other status of a Participant and the extent to
which, and the period during which, the Participant,




                                      -4-
<PAGE>   5

or the Participant's legal representative, conservator, guardian or Designated
Beneficiary, may exercise rights under the Award.

         e. WITHHOLDING. Each Participant shall pay to the Company, or make
provisions satisfactory to the Company for payment of, any taxes required by law
to be withheld in connection with Awards to such Participant no later than the
date of the event creating the tax liability. The Board may allow Participants
to satisfy such tax obligations in whole or in part by transferring shares of
Common Stock, including shares retained from the Award creating the tax
obligation, valued at their fair market value (as determined by the Board or as
determined pursuant to the applicable option agreement). The Company may, to the
extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any
kind otherwise due to a Participant.

         f. AMENDMENT OF AWARDS. The Board may amend, modify or terminate any
outstanding Award including, but not limited to, substituting therefor another
Award of the same or a different type, changing the date of exercise or
realization, and converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonstatutory Stock
Option, PROVIDED THAT the Participant's consent to such action shall be required
unless the Board determines that the action, taking into account any related
action, would not materially and adversely affect the Participant.

         g. CONDITIONS ON DELIVERY OF STOCK. The Company will not be obligated
to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan or to remove
restrictions from shares previously delivered under the Plan until (i) all
conditions of the Award have been met or removed to the satisfaction of the
Company, (ii) in the opinion of the Company's counsel, all other legal matters
in connection with the issuance and delivery of such shares have been satisfied,
including any applicable securities laws and any applicable stock exchange or
stock market rules and regulations, and (iii) the Participant has executed and
delivered to the Company such representations or agreements as the Company may
consider appropriate to satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws, rules
or regulations.

         h. ACCELERATION. The Board may at any time provide that any Options
shall become immediately exercisable in full or in part, that any Restricted
Stock Awards shall be free of some or all restrictions, or that any other
stock-based Awards may become exercisable in full or in part or free of some or
all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise realizable in full or in part, as
the case may be, despite the fact that the foregoing actions may (i) cause the
application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code if a change in control of the
Company occurs, or (ii) disqualify all or part of the Option as an Incentive
Stock Option.

8.       MISCELLANEOUS

<PAGE>   6

Options, the term "COMPANY" shall include any other business venture in which

of employment has been extended by the Company.

         b. NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER STATUS. No person shall have any
claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be

time to dismiss or otherwise terminate its relationship with a Participant free
from any liability or claim under the Plan.

         c. NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. Subject to the provisions of the
applicable Award, no Participant or Designated Beneficiary shall have any rights
as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock to be distributed
with respect to an Award until becoming the record holder thereof.

         d. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN. The Plan shall become effective on
the date on which it is adopted by the Board. No Awards shall be granted under
the Plan after the completion of ten years from the date on which the Plan was
adopted by the Board, but Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date.

         e. AMENDMENT OF PLAN. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the
Plan or any portion thereof at any time, except that, without the approval of
the stockholders obtained within 12 months before or after the Board adopts a
resolution authorizing any of the following actions: (a) the total number of
shares that may be issued under the Plan may not be increased (except by
adjustment pursuant to Section 3(c)); (b) the benefits accruing to participants

which shares may be offered pursuant to ISOs may not be modified (except by

Plan to fail to comply with Rule 16b-3 and (h) the provisions of Section 4(g)
regarding the prohibition on repricing and regrant of Options may not be
modified. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8(e), in no event may
action of the Board or stockholders alter or impair the rights of a grantee,
without such grantee's consent, under any Option previously granted to such
grantee.
