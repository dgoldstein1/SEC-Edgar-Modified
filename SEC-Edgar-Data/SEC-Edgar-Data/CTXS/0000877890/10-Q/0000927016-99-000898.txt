             Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                                  (Unaudited)
                                March 31, 1998
                                        

   1.  Basis of Presentation

   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
   been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
   interim financial information and with Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
   Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
   required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
   statements.  All adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are
   considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for
   the periods shown are of a normal recurring nature and have been reflected in
   the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  The results of
   operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of  the
   results expected for the full fiscal year or for any future period.   The
   information included in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial
   statements should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and
   Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the
   consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the
   Citrix Systems, Inc. (the Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
   year ended December 31, 1997.

   2.  Restatement of Financial Statements

   In a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
   ("AICPA"), the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") expressed its views
   on the recording of in-process research and development ("IPR&D").  As a
   result, the Company has re-evaluated the amount of purchased IPR&D recorded
   in connection with its acquisition of Insignia Solutions, plc. ("Insignia")
   and its licensing of technology from EPiCON, Inc. ("EPiCON") based on its
   understanding and interpretation of the aforementioned letter. The re-
   evaluations resulted in a decrease in the amount of purchase price that was
   allocated to IPR&D and an increase in the amount allocated to purchased
   technology and goodwill. Specifically, the Company reduced the amount of
   previously reported write-offs for purchased IPR&D to $5.3 million and
   increased amortization of intangible assets to $0.8 million and increased
   intangible assets, net to $19.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 1998.

   The effects of the adjustments on the Company's previously reported
   consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 1998 is as
   follows:

   3.  Use of Estimates

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
   accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
   that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial
   statements and accompanying notes.  While the Company believes that such
   estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with the condensed
   consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole,
   the actual amount of such estimates, when known, will vary from these
   estimates.

   4.  Revenue Recognition

   In October 1997, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, "Software
   Revenue Recognition," which the Company has adopted for transactions entered
   during the year beginning January 1, 1998.  SOP 97-2 provides guidance for
   recognizing revenue on software transactions and supersedes SOP 91-1,
   "Software Revenue Recognition."  In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-4,
   "Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
   Recognition."  SOP 98-4 defers, for one year, the application of certain
   passages in SOP 97-2 which limit what is considered vendor-specific objective
   evidence necessary to recognize revenue for software licenses in multiple-
   element arrangements when undelivered elements exist.  Additional guidance is
   expected to be provided prior to adoption of the deferred provision of SOP
   97-2.  The Company will determine the impact, if any, the additional guidance
   will have on current revenue recognition practices when issued.  Adoption of
   the remaining provisions of SOP 97-2 did not have a material impact on
   revenue recognition during the first quarter of 1998.

   5.  Acquisition

   On February 5, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain in-
   process software technologies and assets of Insignia Solutions, plc for
   approximately $17.5 million.  A portion of the purchase price was allocated
   to in-process research and development which had not reached technological
   feasibility and had no alternative future use.  The allocation resulted in a
   pre-tax charge of approximately $2.7 million to the Company's operations in
   the first quarter of 1998, after giving effect to the re-revaluation
   described in Note 2 above.

   6.  Licensed Technology

   In January 1998, the Company licensed certain in-process software technology
   from EPiCON, Inc. for approximately $8.0 million.  A portion of the licensing
   fee was allocated to in-process research and development which had no
   alternative future use.  The allocation resulted in a pre-tax charge of
   approximately $2.6 million to the Company's operations in the first quarter
   of 1998, after giving effect to the re-revaluation described in Note 2 above.

   7.  Earnings per Share

   In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128,
   "Earnings Per Share."  Statement 128 replaced the calculation of primary and
   fully diluted earnings per share.  Unlike primary earnings per share, basic
   earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and
   convertible securities.  Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
   previously reported fully diluted earnings per share.  All earnings per share
   amounts for all periods have been presented, and where appropriate, restated
   to conform to the Statement 128 requirements.  All common share and per share
   data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock
   split in the form of a stock dividend paid on February 20, 1998, which stock
   dividend was paid to stockholders of record as of February 12, 1998.

   The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings
   per share:

   8.  Reclassifications

       Certain reclassifications have been made for consistent presentation.

   9.  Legal Matters

   The Company received a letter dated February 25, 1998 from a third party
   alleging that certain technology incorporated in the Company's WinFrame
   product line may infringe a patent held by the third party, and requesting
   that the Company contact the third party to discuss a licensing arrangement
   for such  patent.  The Company believes that its existing products do not
   infringe the patent held by the third party.  There can be no assurance that
   the Company would prevail in the defense of an infringement claim, if made,
   or that the Company could obtain a license to the patent on a reasonable
   basis, if at all.  Any patent dispute or litigation, or any royalty-bearing
   license, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
   financial condition or results of operations.

   10.  Subsequent Events

   On April 17, 1998, the Company entered into an amendment to its May 1997
   agreement with Microsoft Corporation.  Under the terms of the amendment,
   assuming certain milestones are reached by Citrix with respect to Microsoft's
   release to manufacturing of the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition(TM)
   product, Citrix's right to receive royalties on future sales of the NT
   Terminal Server Edition product releases 4.0 and 5.0 under the 1997 agreement
   would be amended to require payment of the full amount in quarterly payments.
   Further, among other matters, Microsoft would commit to 

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
   make commercially reasonable efforts to include NT Terminal Server
   functionality in its base Windows NT Server product. In the event that the
   milestones were not achieved, the existing royalties in the 1997 agreement of
   up to $100.0 million on sales of Windows NT Terminal Server Edition product
   would continue to apply.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

  The Company develops, markets, sells and supports innovative client and
server-based computing software that enables effective and efficient deployment
of enterprise applications that is designed for Microsoft Windows operating
systems. The Company was incorporated in April 1989, and shipped its initial
products in 1991.

  From its introduction in the second quarter of 1993 through the second quarter
of 1995, the Company's WinView product represented the largest source of the
Company's revenues.  The Company began shipping its current principal product
WinFrame in final form in the third quarter of 1995 and since then it has been
the largest source of the Company's revenue.

   On May 9, 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") entered
into a License, Development and Marketing Agreement, as amended (the
"Development Agreement"), which provides for the licensing to Microsoft of
certain of the Company's multi-user software enhancements to Microsoft's Windows
NT Server and for the cooperation between the parties for the development of
future multi-user versions of Microsoft Windows NT Server, called Windows NT
Server Terminal Server Edition (formerly referred to as "Hydrix").  The
Development Agreement also provides for each party to develop its own
enhancements or "plug-ins" to the jointly developed products which may provide
access to the Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition base platform from a
wide variety of computing devices, such as a Company developed plug-in that
implements the Independent Computer Architecture (ICA(R)) protocol on the new
platform, which provides Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition with
capabilities similar to those currently offered in the WinFrame product line.
Pursuant to the terms of the Development Agreement, in May 1997, the Company
received an aggregate of $75 million as a non-refundable royalty payment and for
engineering and support services to be rendered by the Company.  Under the terms
of the Development Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive payments of an
additional $100 million based on Microsoft's release and shipment of Windows NT
Server Terminal Server Edition.  In addition, Microsoft and the Company have
agreed to engage in certain joint marketing efforts to promote use of Windows NT
Server-based multi-user software and the Company's ICA protocol.  Additionally,
until at least November 1999, Microsoft has agreed to endorse only the Company's
ICA protocol as the preferred way to provide multi-user Windows access for
devices other than Windows client devices.  Further, subject to the terms of the
Development Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to license versions of its
WinFrame technology based on Windows NT v.3.51 until at least September 30,
2001.

  As a result of the Development Agreement, the Company will continue to support
the Microsoft Windows NT platform but will no longer incorporate Windows NT
source code directly into the Company's future offerings.  However,   future
WinFrame products based upon the Windows NT v.3.51 kernel may continue to be
offered under the terms of the Development Agreement until at least September
30, 2001.  In June 1997, the Company announced the development of MetaFrame(TM)
(formerly code-named "pICAsso"), a product which, when combined with the
Microsoft multi-user version of Windows NT technology, will provide capabilities
similar to those currently offered in the WinFrame product line.  The Company
plans to continue developing enhancements to its MetaFrame product and expects
that this product, existing and future enhanced WinFrame products and the
royalties derived under the terms of the Development Agreement will constitute a
majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future.

  Product revenues are recognized upon shipment only if no significant Company
obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed
probable.  The initial fee of $75 million relating to the Development Agreement
is being recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is five years.
In the case of non-cancelable product licensing arrangements under which certain
OEMs have software reproduction rights, initial recognition of revenue also
requires delivery and customer acceptance of the product master or first copy.
Subsequent recognition of revenues is based upon reported royalties from the
OEMs as well as estimates of royalties due through the Company's reporting date.
Product returns and sales allowances, including stock rotations, are estimated
and provided for at the time of sale. Non-recurring engineering fees are
recognized ratably as the work is performed.  Revenues from training and
consulting are recognized when the services are performed.  Service revenues
from customer maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates
are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically twelve
months.  Service revenues, which are immaterial when compared to net revenues,
are included in net revenues on the face of the income statement.

  The Company has recently acquired or licensed technology that is related to
its strategic objectives.  On February 5, 1998, the Company completed its
acquisition of certain of the assets, technology and operations of Insignia
Solutions, plc for approximately $17.5 million.  In January 1998, the Company
licensed certain technology from EPiCON, Inc., for approximately $8.0 million.
These transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
with the purchase price being principally allocated to purchased technologies
and intangible assets.

  These acquisitions and licensing arrangement were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations".  The Company allocated
the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values using valuation methods believed to be
appropriate at the time.  The acquired intangible assets included in-process
technology projects, among other assets, which were related to research and
development that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there
was no alternative future use.  As a result of the SEC's letter to the AICPA
dated September 9, 1998 regarding its views on write-offs of purchased in-
process research and development ("IPR&D"), the Company revised its calculations
of the value of the acquired in-process technology based on adjusted after-tax
cash flows and reduced the amount of the write-offs for purchased IPR&D related
to the Insignia acquisition and the EPiCON licensing agreement to $2.7 million
and $2.6 million, respectively.  These reductions have been reallocated to other
intangible assets.  After giving effect to the re-evaluation, the Company
recorded amortization of intangible assets of $0.8 million and IPR&D of $5.3
million for the three months ended March 31, 1998 in accordance with applicable
accounting pronouncements.

  The discussion below relating to the individual financial statement captions,
the Company's overall financial performance, operations and financial position
should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in
"Overview" and "Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results" which, it is
anticipated, will impact the Company's future performance and financial
position.

  Net Revenues.  Net revenues were approximately $49.3 million and $21.5 million
for the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, representing
an increase of 129.1%.  The increases in net revenues in the first quarter of
1998 compared to the first quarter of 1997 were primarily attributable to an
increase in volume of shipments of the Company's WinFrame products and, to a
lesser extent, the initial recognition of revenue on the Development Agreement
with Microsoft, as well as increased volume in licensing of OEM products.

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
  WinFrame, OEM and Development Agreement revenues approximated 71.4 %, 16.0 %
and 7.6 % of revenues, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 1998
and 66.7%, 27.7% and 0.0% of revenues, respectively, in the three months ended
March 31, 1997.  Both the Company's WinFrame and OEM revenues represent product
license fees based upon the Company's multi-user NT-based technology.

  International.  International revenues (sales outside of the United States)
accounted for approximately 27.6% and 15.2% of net revenues for the three months
ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

  Cost of Goods Sold.  Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost of
royalties, product media and duplication, manuals,  packaging materials and
shipping expense.  Cost of OEM revenues included in cost of goods sold primarily
consists of cost of royalties, except where the OEM elects to purchase shrink
wrapped products in which case such costs are as described in the previous
sentence. All development costs incurred in connection with the Development
Agreement are expensed as incurred as a separate component of cost of goods
sold.  Costs associated with non-recurring engineering fees are included in
research and development expenses and are not separately identifiable.  All
development costs included in the research and development of software products
and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred.
Consequently, there is no amortization of capitalized research and development
costs included in cost of goods sold.

  Gross Margin.  Gross margin increased from 89.8% in the first quarter of 1997
to 90.2% in the first quarter of 1998. The increase in gross margin was
primarily attributable to changes in product mix, representing changes in the
mix of OEM revenues versus product sold to distributors and resellers, and
different products within the WinFrame product line.

  Research and Development Expenses.  Research and development expenses
consisted primarily of personnel-related costs.  The increase in research and
development expenses resulted primarily from additional staffing, associated
salaries and related expenses required to expand and enhance the Company's
product lines.  These increases were partially offset by the allocation of
certain research and development expenses to cost of goods sold for the portion
of these expenses associated with the Development Agreement revenues.

  Sales, Marketing and Support Expenses.  The increase in sales, marketing and
support expenses resulted primarily from increases in promotional activities,
such as advertising literature production and distribution and trade shows as
well as distributor programs.  Sales, marketing and support staff and associated
salaries, commissions and related expenses also increased, resulting from
efforts to expand the Company's product distribution.

  General and Administrative Expenses.  The increase in general and
administrative expenses is primarily due to increased expenses associated with
additional staff, associated salaries and related expenses necessary to support
overall increases in the scope of the Company's operations, as well as an
increase in the provision for doubtful accounts resulting from the higher credit
risk associated with an increased level of accounts receivable attributable to
the period's increase in sales.

   Amortization of Intangible Assets. The increase in amortization of goodwill
and identifiable intangible assets in the three months ended March 31, 1998 as
compared to the prior period is due to the Insignia acquisition and EPiCON
licensing arrangement.  As of March 31, 1998, after giving effect to the re-
evaluation discussed in "--Overview" and in Note 2 to the Notes to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements ("Note 2"), the Company had other net
intangible assets of $19.9 million, associated with the DataPac Australasia Pty
Limited, an October 2, 1997 acquisition, and Insignia acquisitions and the
EPiCON licensing arrangement, remaining to be amortized over four years
following each of the transactions.  See "--In-Process Research and Development
Expenses."

   In-Process Research and Development Expenses. During 1998, the Company
completed the acquisition and licensing of certain in-process software
technologies in which it allocated a portion of the purchase price to IPR&D.
The Company allocated $2.7 million for IPR&D related to the Insignia acquisition
and $2.6 million for IPR&D related to the licensing agreement with EPiCON, after
giving effect to the re-evaluation as further discussed in "--Overview" and in
Note 2.

   Since the respective dates of acquisition and licensing, the Company has used
the acquired in-process technology to develop new product offerings, which have
or will become part of the Company's suite of products when completed.
Functionality included in products using the acquired in-process technology have
been introduced at various times following the respective transaction dates of
the acquired assets and licensing, and the Company currently expects to complete
the 

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
development of the remaining projects at various dates between 1999 and 2000.
Upon completion, the Company offers the related products to its customers.

   The nature of the efforts required to develop and integrate acquired in-
process technology into commercially viable products or features and
functionalities within the Citrix suite of existing products principally relate
to the completion of all planning, designing and testing activities that are
necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design
requirements, including functions, features and technical performance
requirements. The Company currently expects that products utilizing the acquired
in-process technology will be successfully developed, but there can be no
assurance that commercial viability of any of these products will be achieved.
Furthermore, future developments in the software industry, particularly the thin
client-server environment, changes in technology, changes in other products and
offerings or other developments may cause the Company to alter or abandon
product plans.

   The fair value of the in-process technology in each acquisition was based on
analyses of the markets, projected cash flows and risks associated with
achieving such projected cash flows.  In developing these cash flow projections,
revenues were estimated based on relevant factors, including aggregate revenue
growth rates for the business as a whole, individual service offering revenues,
characteristics of the potential market for the service offerings and the
anticipated life of the underlying technology. Operating expenses and resulting
profit margins were estimated based on the characteristics and cash flow
generating potential of the acquired in-process research and development, and
included assumptions that certain expenses would decline over time as operating
efficiencies were obtained.  The Company assumed material net cash inflows would
commence in 1999 for the Insignia acquisition and EPiCON licensing agreement.
Appropriate adjustments were made to operating income to derive net cash flow,
and the estimated net cash flows of the in-process technologies in each
acquisition were then discounted to present value using rates of return that the
Company believes reflect the specific risk/return characteristics of these
research and development projects. The selection of discount rates for
application in each acquisition were based on the consideration of: (i) the
weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which measures a company's cost of
debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of
equity in its target capital structure; (ii) the corresponding weighted average
return on assets ("WARA") which measures the after-tax return required on the
assets employed in the business weighted by each asset group's percentage of the
total asset portfolio; and (iii) venture capital required rates of return which
typically relate to equity financing for relatively high-risk  business
projects.  The risk adjusted discount rates were 35% and 40% for the EPiCON
licensing agreement and Insignia acquisition, respectively.

   Failure to complete the development of these projects in their entirety, or
in a timely manner, could have a material, adverse impact on the Company's
operating results, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance
can be given that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired
in-process research and development will not deviate from the projections used
to value such technology in connection with each of the respective acquisitions.
Ongoing operations and financial results for acquired assets and licensed
technology, and the Company as a whole, are subject to a variety of factors
which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such transaction, and
the estimates discussed below should not be considered the Company's current
projections for operating results for the acquired assets or licensed technology
or the Company as a whole.

   Revenues attributable to the acquired in-process technology associated with
these acquisitions were assumed to increase depending on the product between the
first one to two years of two to six year projection periods at annual rates
ranging from 20% to 264% before decreasing over the remaining years at rates
ranging from 7% to 68% as other products are released in the marketplace.
Projected annual revenue attributable to the products ranged from approximately
$0.6 million to $4.4 million over the term of the projections. These projections
were based on aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole,
individual product revenues, giving consideration to transaction volumes and
prices, anticipated growth rates for the server-based computing market,
anticipated product development and product introduction cycles, and the
estimated life of the underlying technology. Projected revenues from the in-
process research and development were assumed to peak during periods between

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
1999 and 2000, depending on the product, and decline from 2000 to 2004 as other
new products are expected to enter the market.

   Gross profit was assumed to increase in the first one to two years of the
projection period, depending on the product, at annual rates ranging from 20% to
267%, decreasing over the remaining years at rates ranging from 7% to 68%
annually, resulting in annual gross profits ranging from approximately $0.6
million to $4.3 million. The gross profit projections assumed a growth rate
approximately the same as the revenue growth rate.

   Operating profit was assumed to increase depending on the product, in the
first one to two years of the projection period at annual rates ranging between
19% and 255%, and decrease over the remaining years at rates between 8% and 75%
annually, resulting in annual operating profits of approximately $0.4 million to
$3.1 million. Operating profit projections assumed a growth rate approximately
the same as the revenue growth rate.

   The Company used discount rates ranging from 35% to 40% for valuing the in-
process research and development acquired in these transactions, which the
Company believes reflected the risk associated with the completion of the
individual research and development projects acquired and the estimated future
economic benefits to be generated subsequent to the projects' completion.

   A description of the in-process research and development and the estimates
made by the Company for EPiCON and Insignia, are summarized below.  All of the
acquired projects are targeted for the server-based computing market.  After the
acquisition or license of each technology, the Company has continued the
development of these in-process projects.

EPiCON

   The in-process research and development acquired in the license of EPiCON
technology consisted of one significant research and development project,
Application Installation Services. This project enables an application to be
installed once on a server and then replicated to all other servers in a server
farm configuration, and is targeted for the server-based computing market. At
the date of licensing, EPiCON was shipping its Windows NT 3.51 version of its
ALTiS application deployment product and was testing its Windows NT 4.0 version.
Neither the Windows NT 3.51 version nor the Windows NT 4.0 version of the ALTiS
product was operating in a Citrix MetaFrame or WinFrame environment at the date
of licensing. After licensing the EPiCON technology, the Company continued the
development of this in-process project, which the Company estimated was less
than 60% complete at the date of licensing. The aggregate value assigned to the
in-process research and development was $2.6 million, after giving effect to the
re-evaluation described in "--Overview" and in Note 2. At the time of the
valuation, the expected cost to complete the project was approximately $300,000.
As of March 31, 1998, approximately $12,000 had been incurred since the date of
licensing. The Company estimates that approximately $1.1 million will be
required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is
expected to be completed during the first half of 1999. The remaining efforts to
complete the project relate primarily to utilizing the technology in a multi-
user environment. The research and development risks associated with this
project primarily reside with the migration of the Application Installation
Services technology to the Company's MetaFrame and WinFrame platforms, which are
based on server-based computing technology.

Insignia

   The in-process research and development acquired in the Insignia acquisition
consisted primarily of one significant research and development project, Keoke,
a video display protocol designed to add performance and bandwidth management
enhancements to ICA in WinFrame and MetaFrame software.  The Company estimated
this project was less than 40% complete at the date of acquisition. The
aggregate value assigned to in-process research and development was $2.7
million, after giving effect to the re-evaluation described in "--Overview" and
in Note 2.  At the date of the valuation, the expected cost to complete 

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
the Keoke and other projects related to the acquisition was approximately $1.9
million. As of March 31, 1998, approximately $310,000 had been incurred since
the date of acquisition. The Company estimates that approximately $1.0 million
will be required to complete the remaining research and development and it is
expected to be completed by the end of 1999. The remaining efforts to complete
the project are primarily the utilization of performance enhancements and
algorithmic methodologies of the Keoke protocol to create similar improvements
in the Company's Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol. The research
and development risks associated with this project primarily relate to the
integration of key performance features of Keoke into the Company's ICA
protocol.

   There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional charges
in subsequent periods to reflect costs associated with these transactions or
that the Company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further
develop these technologies.

   Interest Income, Net.  The increase in interest income, net, in the three
months ended March 31, 1998 was primarily due to interest income earned on
additional cash generated from the receipt of an initial license fee under the
terms of the Development Agreement.

  Income Taxes.  The Company's effective tax rate amounted to 36% for the three
months ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  During the three months ended March 31, 1998, the Company generated positive
operating cash flows of approximately $14.5 million which is net of cash used to
purchase and license in-process research and development of $5.3 million. These
amounts were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during the
period.  During the same period, the Company also recognized tax benefits from
the exercise of non-statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of
incentive stock options of approximately $4.1 million.  The Company purchased
and sold short-term investments for approximately $33.4 million and $19.8
million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 1998.
Additionally, the Company expended approximately $4.2 million in the same period
for the purchase of leasehold improvements and equipment.  These capital
expenditures were primarily associated with the Company's relocation and
expansion in its new facilities.

  Positive operating cash flows in the three months ended March 31, 1997, were
primarily due to increased profitability during that period.
 
  As of March 31, 1998, the Company had approximately $119.0 million in cash and
cash equivalents, $102.8 million in short-term investments and $221.3 million of
working capital.  The Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments are invested in investment grade, interest bearing securities to
minimize interest rate risk and allow for flexibility in the event of immediate
cash needs. At March 31, 1998, the Company had approximately $20.7 million in
accounts receivable, net of allowances, and $65.6 million of deferred revenues,
of which the Company anticipates $19.0 million will be earned over the next
twelve months.

  On February 5, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain in-
process software technologies and assets of Insignia Solutions, plc for
approximately $17.5 million in cash.  Additionally, on January 8, 1998, the
Company licensed certain in-process software technology from EPiCON, Inc. for
approximately $8.0 million in cash, payable over a two-year period.

  The Company believes existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditures
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

  The Company paid cash amounting to approximately $3,000 in lieu of fractional
shares in connection with its three-for-two stock split effected February 20,
1998.  The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Common
Stock in the foreseeable future.

Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results

  The Company does not provide financial performance forecasts.  The Company's
operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the
future vary significantly depending on a number of factors.  Except for the
historical 

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
information contained herein, the matters contained in this report include
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The following
factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented
elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have
a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, results of operations and
financial condition.

  Reliance Upon Strategic Relationship with Microsoft.  Microsoft is the leading
provider of desktop operating systems.  The Company is dependent upon the
license of certain key technology from Microsoft, including certain source and
object code licenses, technical support and other materials.  The Company is
also dependent on its strategic alliance agreement with Microsoft which provides
for cooperation in the development of technologies for advanced operating
systems, and the promotion of advanced Windows application program interfaces.
On May 9, 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into a License, Development
and Marketing Agreement, as amended (the "Development Agreement"), which
provides for the licensing to Microsoft of certain of the Company's multi-user
software enhancements to Microsoft's Windows NT Server and for the cooperation
between the parties for the development of certain future multi-user versions of
Microsoft Windows NT Server, known as the Windows NT Server Terminal Server
Edition.  The Development Agreement also provides for each party to develop its
own enhancements or "plug-ins" to the jointly developed products which may
provide access to the Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition platform from a
wide variety of computing devices, such as a Company-developed plug-in that
implements the Independent Computing Architecture (ICA(R)) protocol on the new
platform, MetaFrame.  Pursuant to the terms of the Development Agreement, the
Company received an aggregate of $75 million as a non-refundable royalty payment
and for engineering and support services to be rendered by the Company.  Under
the terms of the Development Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive
payments of an additional $100 million based on Microsoft's release of Windows
NT Server Terminal Server Edition.  In addition, Microsoft and the Company have
agreed to engage in certain joint marketing efforts to promote use of Windows NT
Server-based multi-user software and the Company's ICA protocol.  Additionally,
until at least November 1999, Microsoft has agreed to endorse only the Company's
ICA protocol as the preferred way to provide multi-user Windows access for
devices other than Windows client devices.  Further, subject to the terms of the
Development Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to license versions of its
WinFrame technology based on Windows NT v.3.51 until at least September 30,
2001.

  The Company's relationship with Microsoft is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties.  First, the Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition based
platforms will allow Microsoft to create plug-in products that will be
competitive with at least some of the Company's current WinFrame products and,
may in the future compete with the Company's Windows NT Server  Terminal Server
Edition plug-in product offerings.  Second, as stated above, Microsoft has
agreed to endorse only the Company's ICA protocol as the preferred method to
provide multi-user Windows access for devices other than Windows clients until
at least November 1999.  Subsequent to November 1999, it is possible that
Microsoft will market or endorse other methods to provide non-Windows client
devices multi-user Windows access.  Third, the Company's ability to successfully
commercialize its future MetaFrame product will be dependent on Microsoft's
ability to market and sell its Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition
products.  Finally, there may be delays in the release and shipment of Windows
NT Server Terminal Server Edition.  Microsoft's distributors and resellers are
not within the control of the Company and, to the Company's knowledge, are not
obligated to purchase products from Microsoft.  Additionally, the Company may
hire additional development, marketing and support staff to the extent they are
needed in order to fulfill the Company's responsibilities under the terms of the
Development Agreement.  Further, if Microsoft (1) develops competitive plug-in
products, (2) endorses in the future other methods to provide non-Windows client
devices multi-user Windows access, (3) is unable to successfully market and sell
the Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition products, or (4) encounters delays
in the release and shipment of Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition, the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

  Dependence Upon Broad-Based Acceptance of ICA Protocol.  The Company believes
that its success in the markets in which it competes will depend upon its
ability to cause broad-based acceptance of its ICA protocol as an emerging
standard for supporting distributed Windows applications, thereby creating
demand for its server products.

  Dependence Upon Strategic Relationships.  In addition to its relationship with
Microsoft, the Company has relationships with NCD, Tektronix, Wyse and others.
The Company is dependent on its strategic partners to successfully incorporate
the Company's technology into their products and to successfully market and sell
such products.

  Competition.  The markets in which the Company competes are intensely
competitive.  Most of the competitors and potential competitors, including
Microsoft, have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing
and other resources than the Company.   Additionally, the announcement of the
release, and the actual release of products competitive to 

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
the Company's existing and future product lines, such as Microsoft's Windows NT
Server Terminal Server Edition and related plug-ins, could cause existing and
potential customers of the Company to postpone or cancel plans to license
certain of the Company's existing and future product offerings, which would
adversely impact its net revenues, operating results and financial condition.
Further, the Company's ability to market ICA, MetaFrame and other future product
offerings will be dependent on Microsoft's licensing and pricing scheme to allow
client devices implementing ICA, MetaFrame or any such future product offerings
to attach to the Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition.

  Dependence on Proprietary Technology.  The Company relies primarily on a
combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary
rights.  Despite the Company's precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized
third parties to copy certain portions of the Company's products or to obtain
and use information regarded as proprietary.  Additionally, the laws of some
foreign countries do not protect the Company's intellectual property to the same
extent as do the laws of the United States and Canada.  There can be no
assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the
Company in the future or that any such assertion will not result in costly
litigation or require the Company to obtain a license to intellectual property
rights of such third parties.  In addition, there can be no assurance that such
licenses will be available on reasonable terms or at all, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and
financial condition.

  Product Concentration.  The Company anticipates that one of its product
technologies and future derivative products and product lines based upon this
technology, if any, will constitute a majority of its revenues for the
foreseeable future.  The Company's ability to generate revenue from its
MetaFrame product will be highly dependent on market acceptance of Windows NT
Server Terminal Server Edition products, with which its product is intended to
be combined to provide capabilities similar to those currently offered in the
WinFrame technology line.  The Company may experience declines in demand for
products based on WinFrame technology, whether as a result of new competitive
product releases, price competition, lack of success of its strategic partners,
technological change or other factors.  In addition, the introduction of
products based upon the MetaFrame technology may be competitive with its
WinFrame technology line and may delay or replace orders of either technology.

  Management of Growth and Anticipated Operating Expenses.  The Company has
recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations, the number of
its employees, and the geographic area of its operations.  In addition, the
Company has completed certain international acquisitions since October 1997, and
assimilating the operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed
and may continue to place a significant strain on the Company's managerial,
operational and financial resources.  To manage its growth effectively, the
Company will be required to continue to implement and improve additional
management and financial systems and controls, and to expand, train and manage
its employee base.  Although the Company believes that it has made adequate
allowances for the costs and risks associated with these expansions, there can
be no assurance that the Company's systems, procedures or controls will be
adequate to support the Company's current or future operations or that Company
management will be able to effectively manage this expansion and still achieve
the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market window for the
Company's products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner.  The
Company's future operating results will also depend on its ability to manage its
expanding product line, expand its sales and marketing organizations, and expand
its support organization commensurate with the increasing base of its installed
products.  If the Company is unable to manage growth effectively or unable to
achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market window for the
Company's products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

  Additionally, the Company expects that its requirements for office facilities
and equipment will grow as staffing requirements dictate.  The Company plans to
increase its professional staff during 1998 as sales, marketing and support and
product development efforts as well as associated administrative systems are
implemented to support planned growth.  As a result of this planned growth in
staff, the Company believes that additional facilities will be required during
1998. Although the Company believes that the cost of expanding in such
additional facilities will not significantly impact its financial position or
results of operations, the Company anticipates that operating expenses will
increase during 1998 as a result of its planned growth in staff and that such
increase may reduce its income from operations and cash flows from operating
activities in 1998.

  Information System Conversion.  The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
all utilize separate applications to process their accounting transactions.  As
a result, the Company and its subsidiaries are currently in the process of
converting a significant part of its business operations to a single accounting
application purchased from a third-party vendor.  Although the Company believes
it has addressed all the significant issues related to this conversion, there
can be no assurance that 

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
unanticipated software and hardware problems will not arise, which may result in
delays in customer billings and vendor payments, as well as extended accounts
receivable payment cycles.

  Dependence on Key Personnel.  The Company's success will depend, in large
part, upon the services of a number of key employees.  The effective management
of the Company's anticipated growth will depend, in large part, upon the
Company's ability to retain its highly skilled technical, managerial and
marketing personnel as well as its ability to attract and maintain replacements
for and additions to such personnel in the future.

  New Products and Technological Change.  The markets for the Company's products
are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving
industry standards, changes in end-user requirements and frequent new product
introductions and enhancements, including enhancements to certain key technology
licensed from Microsoft.  The Company believes it will incur additional costs
and royalties associated with the development, licensing, or acquisition of new
technologies or enhancements to existing products which will increase the
Company's cost of goods sold and operating expenses.  To the extent that such
transactions have not yet occurred, the Company cannot currently quantify such
increase.  The Company may use a substantial portion of its cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments to fund these additional costs, in which
case, the Company's interest income will decrease if not offset by cash flows
from future operations.  Additionally, the Company and others may announce new
products, new MetaFrame capabilities or technologies that could replace or
shorten the life cycle of the Company's existing product offerings.  These
market characteristics will require the Company to continuously enhance its
current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with
technological developments and respond to evolving end-user requirements.  The
Company may hire additional development staff to the extent they are needed in
order to fulfill the Company's responsibilities under the terms of the
Development Agreement.  To the extent the Company is unable to add additional
staff and resources in its development efforts, future enhancement and
additional features to its existing or future products may be delayed, which may
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations
and financial condition.

  Year 2000 Compliance.   Until recently, many computer programs were written
using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year in the
twentieth century.  Such software may recognize a date using "00" as the year
1900 rather than the year 2000. Utilizing both internal and external resources,
the Company is in the process of defining, assessing and converting, or
replacing, various programs, hardware and instrumentation systems to make them
Year 2000 compatible.  The Company's Year 2000 project is comprised of two
components -- business applications and equipment.  The business applications
component consists of the Company's business computer systems, as well as the
computer systems of third-party suppliers or customers whose Year 2000 problems
could potentially impact the Company.  Equipment exposures consist of personal
computers, system servers, telephone equipment and elevators whose Year 2000
problems could also impact the Company.  The cost of the Year 2000 initiatives
is not expected to be material to the Company's results of operations or
financial position.

  The Company's main product, WinFrame, is an authorized extension to Microsoft
Windows NT v.3.51 server.  While the Company believes both Windows NT v.3.51
server and WinFrame/Enterprise (versions 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7) are currently capable
of storing four-digit year data, allowing applications to differentiate between
dates from the 1900s and the year 2000 and beyond, potential incompatibility
with two-digit application programs may limit the Company's sales of product in
those situations.  While the Company believes that its WinFrame/Enterprise
(versions 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7) are capable of storing four-digit year data, it is
typically the application's function to collect and properly store date data.
There can be no assurance that the Company's products will not be integrated by
the Company or its customers with, or otherwise interact with non-compliant
software or other products which may expose the Company to claims from its
customers or other third parties.  The foregoing could result in the loss of or
delay in market acceptance of the Company's products and services, increased
service costs to the Company or payment by the Company of compensatory or other
damages.  Although most Windows applications do store four-digit year dates
today, it is possible that some applications are now or have historically only
collected two-digit year data, WinFrame cannot create four-digit year data for
applications which have collected only two digits in year fields.  Further,
there can be no assurance that the Company's software products that are designed
to be Year 2000 compliant contain all necessary technology to make them Year
2000 compliant.  Many companies are expending significant resources to correct
or patch their current software systems for Year 2000 compliance.  These
expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products
such as those offered by the Company, thus potentially resulting in stalled
market sales within the industry.  The foregoing could result in a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial
condition.

  Potential for Undetected Errors.  Despite significant testing by the Company
and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products
until after commencement of commercial shipments.  Additionally, third party
products, upon which the Company's products are dependent, may contain defects
which could reduce the performance of the Company's products or render them
useless.

  Reliance Upon Indirect Distribution Channels and Major Distributors.  The
Company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the
marketing and distribution of its products.  The Company's distributors and
resellers are not within the control of the Company, are not obligated to
purchase products from the Company, and may also represent other lines of
products.

  Need to Expand Channels of Distribution.  The Company intends to leverage its
relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to
encourage these parties to recommend or distribute the Company's products.  In
addition, an integral part of the Company's strategy is to expand its direct
sales force and add third-party distributors both domestically and
internationally.  The Company is currently investing, and intends to continue to
invest, significant resources to develop these channels, which could adversely
affect the Company's operating margins and related cash flows from operating
activities.

  Revenue Recognition Process.    The Company continually re-evaluates its
programs, including specific license terms and conditions, to market its various
current and future products and services.  The Company may implement new
programs which may include, among other things, specified and unspecified
enhancements to its current and future product lines.  Revenues associated with
such enhancements may be recognized after the initial shipment or licensing of
the software product or may be recognized over the product's life cycle.  The
timing of the implementation of such programs, the timing of the release of such
enhancements as well as factors such as determining vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value of each element offered separately and whether upgrades
and enhancements are defined as upgrade rights pursuant to Statement of Position
(SOP) 97-2 will impact the timing of the Company's recognition of revenues and
related expenses associated with its products, related enhancements and
services.  Because of the uncertainties related to the  outcome of the re-
evaluation of its programs, the determination of vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value and whether upgrades and enhancements will be defined as
upgrade rights pursuant to SOP 97-2, and its impact on revenue recognition, the
Company cannot currently quantify the impact of  such re-evaluation on its
business, results of operations and financial condition.

  Product Returns and Price Reductions.  The Company provides most of its
distributors with product return rights for stock balancing or limited product
evaluation.  The Company also provides most of its distributors with price
protection rights.  The Company has established reserves for each of these
circumstances where appropriate, based on historical trends and evaluation of
current circumstances.  Although the Company believes that it has adequate
reserves to cover product returns, there can be no assurance that the Company
will not experience significant returns in the future or that such reserves will
be adequate.

  International Operations. The Company's continued growth and profitability
will require expansion of its international operations.  To successfully expand
international sales, the Company will need to establish additional foreign
operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international
resellers.  Such international operations are subject to certain risks, such as
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, dependence on
independent relicensors, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements, variability of
foreign economic and political conditions and changing restrictions imposed by
regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by United States
export laws, costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign
countries, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax
consequences, including restrictions on repatriation of earnings and the burdens
of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

  Fluctuations in Economic and Market Conditions.  The demand for the Company's
products depends in part upon the general demand for computer hardware and
software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending
levels and general economic conditions.

  Growth Rate.  The Company's revenue growth rate in the current year may not
approach the levels attained in 1997 and 1996, which were high, due primarily to
the increased market acceptance of WinFrame during that period.  However, to the
extent the Company's revenue growth continues, the Company believes that its
cost of goods sold and certain operating expenses will also increase.  Due to
the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses, together with the
possibility of slower revenue growth, the Company's income from operations and
cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease in the current
year.

  Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results.  The Company's quarterly
operating results have in the past varied and may in the future vary
significantly depending on factors such as the success of the Company's WinFrame
or future MetaFrame products, the size, timing and recognition of revenue from
significant orders, increased competition, the proportion of revenues derived
from distributors, OEMs and other channels, changes in the Company's pricing
policies or those of its competitors, the financial stability of major
customers, new product introductions or enhancements by competitors and
partners, delays in the introduction of products or product enhancements by the
Company or by competitors and partners, customer order deferrals in anticipation
of upgrades and new products, market acceptance of new products, the timing and
nature of sales and marketing expenses (such as trade shows and other
promotions), other changes in operating expenses, personnel changes (including
the addition of personnel), foreign currency exchange rates and general economic
conditions.  The Company operates with little order backlog because its software
products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received.  In addition,
like many systems level software companies, the Company has often recognized a
substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of a quarter with these
revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of the quarter.  As a
result, the product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on
orders booked and shipped in that quarter, and revenues for any future quarter
are not predictable with any degree of certainty.  Any significant deferral of
purchases of the Company's products could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition in any
particular quarter, and to the extent significant sales occur earlier than
expected, operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected.
Royalty and license revenues are impacted by fluctuations in OEM licensing
activity and certain end user licensing and deployment activity from quarter to
quarter because initial license fees generally are recognized upon customer
acceptance and continuing royalty and subsequent ongoing license revenues are
recognized when the amount of such licensing activity can be reasonably
determined.  The Company's expense levels are based, in part, on its
expectations as to future orders and sales, and the Company may be unable to
adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any sales shortfall.  If
sales are below expectations, operating results are likely to be adversely
affected.  Net income may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in sales
because a significant portion of the Company's expenses do not vary with
revenues.  The Company may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in
response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities.  In particular,
if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other
competitive factors require the Company to invest significantly greater
resources in research and development efforts, the Company's operating margins
in the future may be adversely affected.  Finally, any delay in the release and
shipment of Windows NT Server Terminal Server Edition or MetaFrame could
adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial
condition.

  Uncertainty as to IPR&D Valuation.  With respect to the statements made
regarding the adjustment of amounts previously charged to in-process research
and development, the amount and rate of amortization of such amounts included in
this report are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including,
without limitation, the effects of any changes in accounting standards or
guidance adopted by the SEC or the accounting profession.   In the event of any
changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the SEC, such changes may
materially affect future results of operations through increased amortization
expense.

  Because of these factors, the Company believes that period-to-period
comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.  Due to all of
the foregoing factors, it is likely that in some future quarter the Company's
operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors.  In such event, the price of the Company's Common Stock would likely
be materially adversely affected.
