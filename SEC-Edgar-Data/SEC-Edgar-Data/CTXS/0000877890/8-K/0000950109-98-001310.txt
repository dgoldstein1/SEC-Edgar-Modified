     Acquisition of Assets
     ---------------------

     On February 5, 1998, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") and its wholly-
     owned subsidiary Citrix Systems UK Limited ("Citrix UK"), completed its
     acquisition of certain software technologies and assets of Insignia
     Solutions, plc ("Insignia"), including Macintosh and UNIX ICA(R)-based
     clients, X.11 driver technology, Keoke technology, and all modifications
     and technology enhancements to WinFrame(R) thin-client/server software
     marketed under Insignia's NTRIGUE brand name, and agreed to employ certain
     members of Insignia's development team, who have joined the Company at its
     new research and development center in High Wycombe, England.

     The aggregate purchase price for the transaction was approximately U.S.
     $17.5 million and the acquisition will be accounted for by the Company
     as a purchase. A substantial portion of the purchase price is expected to
     be allocated by the Company to purchased in-process research and
     development for which the Company expects to incur a one-time charge to its
     operations, amounting to approximately U.S. $16 million, in the quarter
     ending March 31, 1998.

     Forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K report are made pursuant to the
     safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
     1934. Investors are cautioned that statements in this report which are not
     strictly historical statements, including, without limitation, statements
     regarding current or future financial performance, management's plans and
     objectives for future operations, product plans and performance,
     management's assessment of market factors, as well as statements regarding
     the strategy and plans of the Company and its strategic partners,
     constitute forward-looking statements which involve risks and
     uncertainties, including, without limitation, the successful and timely
     development, integration and introduction of the former Insignia technology
     into the Company's existing or future products, market acceptance of the
     Company's new or enhanced products; and the impact of competitive products
     and pricing, in addition to risks associated with the Company's reliance
     upon its strategic relationships with Microsoft and other strategic
     partners, dependence upon broad-based acceptance of the Company's ICA
     protocol, management of growth, the possibility of undetected software
     errors, and dependence on proprietary technology.

     Stock Split
     -----------

     The Registrant effected a three-for-two stock split in the form of a one-
     for-two stock dividend on February 20, 1998, which stock split was paid in
     the form of a dividend to stockholders of record of the Registrant as of
     February 12, 1998.

Citrix Purchases Additional Technologies

New Technologies to Enhance Citrix Thin-Client/Server Products and Advance
Strategy for Enterprise Application Deployment

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- January 12, 1998 --

Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS) today announced it has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire certain software technologies and assets of Insignia
Solutions (Nasdaq:INSGY), including Macintosh and UNIX ICA(R)-based clients,
X.11 driver technology, Keoke technology, and all modifications and technology
enhancements to WinFrame(R) thin-client/server software marketed under
Insignia's NTRIGUE brand name, as well as transfer engineering resources
necessary for ongoing product development. The transaction, which is subject to
customary closing conditions, is expected to close later this month.

Today's announcement advances Citrix's strategy for delivering universal access
to Windows-based applications-- regardless of client hardware, operating
platform or network connection. The acquisition of Insignia's technologies will
provide a basis for further expanding Citrix's own ICA-based client offerings to
include additional, non-Intel device platforms such as Macintosh computers and
UNIX workstations.

"The technologies we will be purchasing will provide a basis for enhancing the
capabilities of our thin-client/server software products, making it easier for
customers to extend the reach of Windows-based applications to any type of
client device," said Roger W. Roberts, President and CEO of Citrix. "This is an
important milestone for our cross-platform client strategy, and it further
strengthens our ability to enhance key thin-client/server technologies, such as
our ICA protocol."

The aggregate purchase price is approximately U.S. $17.5 million and the
acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. A substantial portion of the
purchase price is expected to be allocated to purchased in-process research and
development for which the company expects to incur a one-time charge to its
operations, amounting to approximately U.S. $16 million, in the quarter ending
March 31, 1998.

Pricing, packaging and availability of new products and enhancements based upon
former Insignia technologies will be announced at a later date. Approximately
one-half of the Insignia development team will join Citrix at the company's new
research and development center in High Wycombe, England. Citrix intends to
provide Insignia NTRIGUE customers a migration path to its current WinFrame
software as well as its thin-client/server software for the Windows NT Server
4.0 environment, currently code-named "pICAsso."
