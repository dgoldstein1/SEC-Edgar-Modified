Item 2.  Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
         -------------------------------------

         On June 30, 1998, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") completed its
         acquisition of all of the outstanding securities of APM Ltd. ("APM"), a
         company organized under the laws of England. APM, based in Cambridge,
         England, is engaged in consulting and development of application
         deployment, management and security products for Java. The Company
         intends to integrate the businesses of APM with the Company's existing
         operations.

         The transaction was valued at approximately US $41 million. The Company
         paid cash of approximately US $39 million and assumed net liabilities
         and transaction costs of approximately US $2 million. A substantial
         portion of the purchase price was allocated by the Company to in-
         process research and development for which the Company incurred a one-
         time charge to its operations, amounting to approximately US $34
         million, in the quarter ended June 30, 1998. The source of the funds
         used in this acquisition was the Company's working capital, and this
         acquisition was accounted for by the Company as a purchase. The
         purchase price and terms for the transaction were determined in arms-
         length negotiations.

         Forward-looking statements in this report are made pursuant to the safe
         harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
         1934. Investors are cautioned that statements in this press report
         which are not strictly historical statements, including, without
         limitation, statements regarding current or future financial
         performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations,
         product plans and performance, management's assessment of market
         factors, as well as statements regarding the strategy and plans of the
         Company and its strategic partners, constitute forward-looking
         statements which involve risks and uncertainties, including, without
         limitation, the successful and timely integration of APM into the
         Company and the Company's existing or future products, market
         acceptance of the Company's new or enhanced products, and the impact of
         competitive products and pricing, in addition to risks associated with
         the Company's reliance upon its strategic relationships with Microsoft
         and other strategic partners, dependence upon broad-based acceptance of
         the Company's ICA protocol, management of growth, the possibility of
         undetected software errors, and dependence on proprietary technology.
         For a more detailed description of the risk factors associated with the
         Company, please refer to the Company's 1997 Form 10-K and its Form 10-Q
         for the quarter ended March 31, 1998 filed with the Securities and

          capable of causing confusion.

4.3  Each of the Executive Directors hereby agrees that he will at the request
     and cost of Citrix enter into a direct agreement or undertaking with any
     Associate of Citrix whereby he will accept restrictions and provisions
     corresponding to the restrictions and provisions above (or such of them as
     may be appropriate in the circumstances) in relation to such activities and
     such areas and/or such periods not greater than those set out above as any
     such Associate of Citrix may require for the protection of its legitimate
     interests.

4.4  Each of the Executive Directors hereby acknowledges and agrees that:

     (a)  each of the covenants contained in sub-clauses 4.2(a), 4.2(b), 4.2(c),
          4.2(d), 4.2(e), 4.2(f) and 4.3 constitute an entirely separate and
          independent restriction on him; and

     (b)  the duration extent and application of each of the restrictions are no
          greater than as necessary for the protection of the interests of APM.

4.5  Whilst the restrictions in sub-clauses 4.2 and 4.3 are considered by the
     Parties to be reasonable in all the circumstances as at the date of this
     Agreement it is acknowledged that restrictions of such a nature may be
     invalid because of changing circumstances or other unforeseen reasons and
     accordingly it is hereby agreed and declared that if any one or more of
     those restrictions is judged to be void as going beyond what is reasonable
     in all the circumstances for the protection of the interests of APM but
     would be valid if part of the wording of the restriction was deleted or its
     duration was reduced or the range of activities covered by it was reduced
     in scope then each restriction(s) shall apply with such modification(s) as
     may be necessary to make it valid and effective and any such modification
     shall not thereby affect the validity of any other restriction contained in
     this clause.

4.6  Each of the Executive Directors further undertakes with Citrix and agrees
     that:

     (a)  he will observe any substitute restrictions (in place of these set out
          in sub-clauses 4.2 and 4.3 as Citrix may from time to time specify in
          writing which are 
<PAGE>
 
          in all respects less restrictive in extent than those specified in 
          sub-clauses 4.2 and 4.3;

     (b)  if any breach or violation of any of the terms of sub-clauses 2 and 3
          occurs damages alone cannot compensate for such breach of violation
          and that injunctive relief is reasonable and essential to safeguard
          the interests of APM and that an injunction in addition to any other
          remedy may accordingly be obtained by APM.  No waiver of any such
          breach or violation shall be implied from the forbearance or failure
          by APM to take action in respect of such breach or violation;

     (c)  any covenant or undertaking given by him under this clause 4 to Citrix
          is given to Citrix in its capacity as trustee for APM, any parent or
          other holding company of APM and any Associate of APM which has a
          legitimate interest to protect.

4.7  None of the Executive Directors shall be treated as committing a breach or
     violation of the provisions of this clause at any time after Closing Date
     while he is acting  solely in his capacity as a director or employee of any
     of the APM Companies in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

4.8  Each of Herbert and Phoenix hereby respectively agree until the 18 month
     anniversary of the Closing Date not to transferencumber or dispose
     (collectively, "TRANSFER") 55.5 per cent. of the Initial Consideration (as
     defined in the Offer Document) he receives from the Offers (with respect to
     each, his Restricted Consideration) except that he may Transfer 28 per
     cent. of his Restricted Consideration on or after the 12 month anniversary
     of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Herbert and Phoenix
     each may transfer all or any of his Restricted Consideration (a) by way of
     gift to any member of his respective family or to any trust for the benefit
     of any such family member, provided that any such transferee shall agree in
     writing with Citrix, as a condition precedent to such transfer, to be bound
     by all of the provisions of this clause 4.8 to the same extent as if such
     transferee were Herbert or Phoenix, as the case may be, or (b) by will or
     otherwise following his death in which event such transferee shall not be
     bound by the provisions of this clause 4.8.  Herbert and Phoenix each
     hereby acknowledges that he shall not be entitled to Transfer any of his
     Retained Consideration (as defined in the Offer Document) until such
     consideration has been released to him in accordance with the provisions of
     Appendix II of the Offer Document but on such release such Retained
     Consideration shall not be subject to any restrictions on Transfer.  These
     restrictions shall cease to apply to Herbert or Phoenix if his employment
     by Citrix Group or any of the APM Companies is terminated by reason of
     redundancy following a decision by Citrix to withdraw from the Java
     deployment market.  The Restricted Consideration shall be invested by each
     of Herbert and Phoenix within such reasonably prudent investment parameters
     as shall be mutually agreed upon by Citrix and each of Herbert and Phoenix
     prior to closing. Until the release of all of the Restricted Consideration
     Herbert and Phoenix shall provide Citrix with quarterly reports of how the
     Restricted Consideration has been invested.

To the APM shareholders, APM loan stock holders and holders of options under the
APM Share Option Scheme



Dear Sir or Madam

RECOMMENDED OFFERS FOR APM

I am pleased to be able to advise you that Citrix and APM announced on 12 June
1998 that agreement has been reached on the terms of recommended offers to be
made by Citrix for APM.  Full details of the Offers are set out in this
document.  I am now writing to explain the background to the Offers and the
reasons for the recommendation of your Board, as advised by Broadview, that you
accept the Offers.

AGREEMENT AND UNDERTAKING

Your Board, on 8 June 1998, entered into an Agreement and Undertaking with
Citrix, whereby Citrix has agreed to make the Offers, subject to receiving
Irrevocable Undertakings to accept the Offers, when made, from the holders of
more than 50 per cent. of the issued APM shares. Such Irrevocable Undertakings
have been received.

DETAILS OF THE OFFERS

The Offers, the terms of which are set out in Part III of this document, are
being made on the following basis:-

                                      -6-

<TABLE>
<S>                                                          <C> 
For each APM ordinary share                                  US$2.2902 in cash
For each APM restricted share                                US$2.2902 in cash
For each APM deferred ordinary share                         US$2.2902 in cash
For each (Pounds)1 of APM loan stock                         US$3.5234 in cash
For each (Pounds)1 of accrued interest on
the APM loan stock                                           US$3.5234 in cash
For each APM warrant                                         US$1.2237 in cash
For each APM share option                                    US$2.2738 in cash
</TABLE>


In addition, Citrix has agreed to assume certain fees and expenses of the
transaction up to US$1.4 million. The Offers value APM at US$38.6 million. Ten
per cent. of the Consideration is to be retained for one year to satisfy any
claims made by Citrix under its indemnity, details of which can be found in
Appendix II of this document.

BACKGROUND TO THE OFFERS

In October 1997 Citrix approached APM to discuss the possibility of a business
relationship between the parties. The parties had various discussions about
licensing and distribution. In March 1998, it became apparent to the boards of
Citrix and APM that a combination of the two companies would enable them to
serve customers in the market better. The subsequent discussions between the
boards of Citrix and APM have culminated in these recommended Offers.

Citrix is a leader in system software for thin-client/server computing and the
boards of Citrix and APM believe that the businesses of Citrix and APM have a
strategic and complementary fit, which will allow the enlarged group access to
new product markets.  The acquisition of APM is intended to provide Citrix with
key technologies and products which will enable customers to obtain a broader
array of application server technologies.

TIMETABLE

The expected timetable for the Offers is as follows:


3:00 pm on 29 June 1998       Date for return of Form(s) of Acceptance.

30 June 1998                  Closing Date
 
7 July 1998                   Latest date for wiring of Initial Consideration


PROCEDURE FOR ACCEPTANCE

Your attention is drawn to the section headed "Procedure for Acceptance of the
Offers" on pages 21 and 22 of this document and the enclosed Form(s) of
Acceptance which set out the procedures for acceptance of the Offers.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
In order to accept the Offers, you should complete and return the appropriate
Form(s) of Acceptance, together with the relevant documents of title, in
accordance with the instructions printed on it/them, so as to be received as
soon as possible, but in any event no later than 3:00 pm on 29 June 1998.

COMPULSORY ACQUISITION

The Articles of Association of APM contain provisions which enable the holder or
holders of over 50 per cent. of the APM shares to require all APM shareholders
to accept a cash offer which is recommended by the Board of APM and endorsed in
writing by an appropriate institution.  Immediately following such a request,
recommendation and endorsement, that offer shall be deemed to have been accepted
by all APM shareholders and a director of APM is authorised, by the Articles of
Association of APM, to transfer the APM shares to the offeror.

Those who have given Irrevocable Undertakings to accept the Offers have stated
that if any APM shareholder has not accepted the Offers by 3:00 pm on 29 June
1998 then immediately prior to Closing they will exercise their rights as
described above following which a director of APM will execute Forms of
Acceptance regarding those APM shares in respect of which the Offers have not
been accepted.  Notwithstanding the execution of Forms of Acceptance on behalf
of those APM shareholders who have not accepted the Offers, such  APM
shareholders will not receive their share of the Consideration until their share
certificate(s), loan stock certificate(s), share option certificate(s) and/or
other documents of title have been received in accordance with the procedure set
out under the heading "Procedure for acceptance of the Offers" on pages 21 and
22 of this document.

APM LOAN STOCK

APM loan stock holders should note that this document constitutes formal notice
under condition 2.2.1 of Part One of the First Schedule to the Loan Stock
Instruments that the anticipated Conversion Date (as defined in the Loan Stock
Instruments) is 30 June 1998.  However, an APM loan stock holder, if he wishes
to accept the Offers, need take no steps to convert his APM loan stock or
exercise his APM warrants, but should instead follow the procedure for
acceptance of the Offers.  Any APM loan stock holder who does not wish to accept
the Offers should consider whether he wishes to serve a Conversion Notice (as
defined in the Loan Stock Instruments).

RECOMMENDATION

The Board of APM, which has been so advised by Broadview, considers the terms of
the Offers to be fair and reasonable. In providing advice to the Board,
Broadview has taken account of the commercial assessments of the directors of
APM. Your directors unanimously recommend APM shareholders, APM loan stock
holders and holders of APM share options to accept the Offers. Your directors
have irrevocably undertaken to accept the Offers in respect of their own
personal holdings of APM ordinary shares, APM restricted shares, APM deferred
ordinary shares, APM loan stock and accrued interest, APM warrants and APM share
options representing 24.11 per cent, of APM ordinary shares, 88.53 per cent, of
APM restricted

                                      -8-

shares, 26.50 per cent. of APM deferred ordinary shares, 2.94 per cent. of APM
loan stock, accrued interest and APM warrants and 36.01 per cent. of APM share
options.

Yours faithfully,

S M METCALF

The APM loan stock holders are entitled to convert the whole of their APM loan
stock and accrued interest on their APM loan stock into APM ordinary shares upon
a sale of APM.  In addition, they are entitled to acquire APM warrants which
confer a right to subscribe for APM ordinary shares.  Citrix hereby offers to
acquire, on and subject to the terms and conditions set out in this document and
the Form of Acceptance, all APM loan stock, the right to interest accrued  on
the APM loan stock prior to the Closing Date and all APM warrants that would be
issued upon a conversion of the APM loan stock on the following basis:

     FOR EACH (Pounds)1.00 OF APM LOAN STOCK:                 US$3.5234 IN CASH
 
     FOR EACH (Pounds)1.00 OF ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE APM
     LOAN STOCK:                                              US$3.5234 IN CASH

In accordance with the Loan Stock Instruments, any APM loan stock that is not
sold pursuant to the Offers or converted prior to the Closing will be redeemed
at par, together with accrued interest on such loan stock, immediately following
the Closing Date.

Offers for APM share options

The holders of APM share options are entitled to exercise their vested options
upon a sale of APM.  However, Citrix hereby makes an offer, on and subject to
the terms and conditions set out in this document and the Form of Acceptance, to
pay to the holders of all APM share options, both vested and unvested, the
following amounts, in consideration of the surrender of those APM share options:

     FOR EACH APM SHARE OPTION:                               US$2.2738 IN CASH
     (less the exercise price of (Pounds)0.01 (US$0.0164)
     per APM share option)

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
The attention of holders of APM share options is drawn to the sections headed
"United Kingdom Taxation" and "United States Taxation".  If an Offer for APM
share options is accepted the holder will be subject to an income tax charge on
the sums paid for the surrender of those APM share options.  APM Group will be
responsible for accounting to the Inland Revenue or Internal Revenue Service (as
the case may be) in respect of that income tax charge on behalf of that holder.
Accordingly, Citrix will retain from the amount to be paid for the surrender of
APM share options to a holder of APM share options, an amount to cover such
liability so that APM Group can be placed in funds to meet its obligations.

THE OFFERS WILL NOT BE INCREASED.  ACCEPTANCES OF THE OFFERS SHOULD BE RECEIVED
BY NO LATER THAN 3:00PM ON 29 JUNE 1998.

The Offers value APM at US$38.6 million.  In addition, Citrix has agreed to
assume certain fees and expenses of the transaction up to US$1.4 million.

The APM shares, APM loan stock and APM warrants will be acquired and the APM
share options will be surrendered free of all liens, charges, equities,
encumbrances, rights of pre-emption and any other third party rights of any
nature and together with all rights attaching thereto at the date of the Offers
or thereafter, including the right to all dividends and other distributions
hereafter declared, paid or made.

Each Acceptor will receive cash representing 90 per cent. of the Consideration
("Initial Consideration") to which he is entitled following the Closing Date;
the balance of 10 per cent. of such entitlement to the Consideration ("Retained
Consideration") to which he is entitled will be transferred on his behalf to the
Depositary (under the terms of the Depositary Agreement, the principal terms of
which are set out in Part 1 of Appendix II of this document), for the purposes
described below under the heading "Citrix's right to receive back the Retained
Consideration in certain circumstances".  All interest accruing on the Retained
Consideration will be paid to the Acceptors or Citrix, as the case may be,
whenever an amount of the principal is paid.


CITRIX'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE BACK THE RETAINED CONSIDERATION IN CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES

The right of the Acceptors to receive their proportion of the whole or any part
of the Retained Consideration is subject to the right of Citrix to receive back
that consideration in satisfaction of any valid claim which Citrix may have
under the indemnity to be given by each Acceptor to Citrix in accordance with
the provisions set out in Part 2 of Appendix II of this document.

These indemnity provisions could apply if certain statements relating to the
business and affairs of APM prove not to be true as at 15 June 1998 and/or as at
the Closing Date.  These APM Statements are set out in Part 2 of Appendix III of
this document.

You will note that the APM Statements are expressed to be subject to the APM
Disclosure Memorandum which contains exceptions to and qualifications of the APM
Statements.  Accordingly, Citrix will not be able to make a claim against
Acceptors for indemnification under Part 2 of Appendix II of this document if
the relevant matter was disclosed to Citrix in

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
the APM Disclosure Memorandum or in the documents which are listed in the
schedule to the APM Disclosure Memorandum. The Acceptors' liability is also
limited by Part 5 of Appendix II of this document.

You should also note that the Executive Directors have undertaken in the
Agreement and Undertaking to inform Citrix until the Closing Date of matters
which would have rendered any of the APM Statements which are made as at the
Closing Date untrue in any material respect if known on 15 June 1998.  In
addition, APM will have to deliver a supplement to the APM Disclosure Memorandum
on the Closing Date containing further information, if any, which was not
disclosed in the APM Disclosure Memorandum and which constitutes exceptions to
the APM Statements.  If the Offers are closed Citrix may be entitled to make a
claim under Part 2 of Appendix II of this document if Citrix can prove that a
relevant APM Statement was untrue on 15 June 1998 and/or on the Closing Date or
if the matters disclosed to Citrix on an ongoing basis or as contained in the
supplement to the APM Disclosure Memorandum show that a relevant APM Statement
was untrue on 15 June 1998 and/or on the Closing Date (and in each case the
Citrix or the APM Group thereby suffered loss or damage).

Any Retained Consideration which is not needed to satisfy any claims or pending
claims of Citrix under the indemnity provisions relating to the APM Statements
will be released to Acceptors by the Depositary on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date.  The rules governing the release of the Retained Consideration
under the Depositary Agreement are more fully described in Part 3 of Appendix II
of this document.

Acceptors should note that if Citrix were to make a claim or claims under the
indemnity this could result in the whole or part (depending on the amount of the
claim) of the Retained Consideration being held by the Depositary following the
first anniversary of the Closing Date pending resolution of the claim.

SUCCESSFUL CLAIMS BY CITRIX UNDER THE INDEMNITY COULD RESULT IN ALL OF THE
RETAINED CONSIDERATION BEING RETURNED TO CITRIX BY THE DEPOSITARY AND THEREFORE
NOT BEING DISTRIBUTED TO ACCEPTORS.

To facilitate the handling of the arrangements relating to the Retained
Consideration and any claims in relation to the indemnities, Acceptors, by
executing the Form(s) of Acceptance, thereby agree to appoint Scott Metcalf, the
present chairman of APM, as the Vendors' Representative to act on behalf of the
Acceptors.  The Vendors' Representative is entitled to obtain funding from the
Retained Consideration for (i) reasonable professional fees and expenses and
(ii) certain fees and out of pocket expenses incurred by him.  Accordingly, the
amount of Retained Consideration will be diminished in the event that the
Vendors' Representative requires such funding in order to deal with a claim by
Citrix.  Full details of the operation of the Depositary Agreement, the
functions and powers of the Vendors' Representative and the delivery of the
Retained Consideration are set out in Appendix II of this document.

FINANCIAL DATA ON APM

A summary of selected financial data of APM for the three years ended 31
December 1995, 31 December 1996 and 31 December 1997 is attached to this
DOCUMENT AS AN EXHIBIT  AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR APM DIRECTORS

Citrix has entered into employment contracts with A J Herbert, C J Phoenix and R
J van der Linden, all executive directors of APM, to be effective upon the
Closing Date. Citrix has also entered into a 6 month consulting agreement with S
M Metcalf, an executive director of APM, to be effective one month after the
Closing Date. These employment and consulting agreements provide for the payment
of compensation which is substantially the same as current arrangements. The
Executive Directors have also agreed with Citrix to certain non-competition and
non-solicitation of employees and customers restrictions for a period of two
years after the Closing Date with respect to the business of APM as at the
Closing Date, and for a period of six months after termination of the employment
or consulting arrangements with respect to the business of APM and Citrix as at
the date of termination. In addition, A J Herbert and C J Phoenix have agreed
with Citrix not to transfer encumber or dispose of certain portions of the
Initial Consideration they receive under the Offers for a period of up to 18
months after the Closing Date.

A J Herbert, S M Metcalf, R J van der Linden, J E Goodman and P M L Frew will
resign as directors of APM as of the Closing Date and Citrix will appoint J
Felcyn, Vice President-Finance and Administration, Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer of Citrix, and M Boisseau, Controller of Citrix, to serve as directors
of APM along with C J Phoenix.

REASONS FOR THE OFFERS

Citrix is a leader in system software for thin-client/server computing.  APM has
developed technical expertise in the secure deployment of Java applications.
Citrix is making the Offers to acquire all of the APM shares, APM loan stock and
APM warrants and making a payment for surrender of the APM share options as it
believes that, from the combination of the two companies' people, technology and
products, will emerge a strong, global thin-client server computing group.

Citrix believes that the businesses of Citrix and APM have a strategic and
complementary fit which will allow the enlarged group access to new product
markets.  The acquisition of APM is intended to provide Citrix with key
technologies and products that will enable customers to obtain a broader array
of application server technologies.

AGREEMENT AND UNDERTAKING

On 8 June 1998, the Non-Executive Directors, the Executive Directors and Citrix
entered into the Agreement and Undertaking under the terms of which the Non-
Executive Directors and the Executive Directors have given certain undertakings
to Citrix in respect of the conduct of the business of APM up to the Closing
Date.  It is a condition of the Offers that there is no

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
 
material breach of such undertakings prior to or at the Closing Date. The
Agreement and Undertaking also specifies the parties' obligations upon the
Offers being declared unconditional.

UNITED KINGDOM TAXATION

THE COMMENTS SET OUT BELOW ARE INTENDED AS A GENERAL GUIDE TO THE CAPITAL GAINS
TAX AND, WHERE RELEVANT, INCOME TAX POSITION UNDER CURRENT UNITED KINGDOM LAW
AND INLAND REVENUE PRACTICE OF ACCEPTORS WHO ARE RESIDENT OR ORDINARILY RESIDENT
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WHO, IN THE CASE OF APM SHAREHOLDERS, HOLD THEIR APM
SHARES AS AN INVESTMENT.  THE COMMENTS RELATE ONLY TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE
TAXATION TREATMENT OF THE OFFERS AND EACH ACCEPTOR IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO
CONSULT WITH THEIR INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVISERS WITH A VIEW TO CONFIRMING
THEIR TAX POSITION IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

TAXATION OF CAPITAL GAINS

APM shareholders

Liability to United Kingdom taxation in respect of capital gains on acceptance
of the Offers, if the Offers become wholly unconditional, will depend upon the
individual circumstances of APM shareholders.

APM shareholders will be treated as making a disposal of their shares for the
purposes of United Kingdom taxation of capital gains on accepting the Offers for
the Consideration. Any capital gain accruing on the disposal will be taxed at
the APM shareholder's appropriate marginal rate of tax.

APM loan stock holders

The following comments are made on the assumption that loan stock held by APM
loan stock holders does not, and will not, fall to be treated for the purposes
of United Kingdom taxation as a relevant discounted security which would, or
could, have the effect of requiring a conversion or of the loan stock to be
treated as a disposal on income account and as not within the capital gains tax
regime.

APM loan stock holders who transfer their APM loan stock to Citrix on accepting
the Offers for the Consideration will be treated as making a disposal of the APM
loan stock for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation of capital gains. Any
capital gain accruing on the disposal will be taxed at the APM loan stock
holder's appropriate marginal rate of tax.

APM loan stock holders who elect to convert their loan stock into APM ordinary
shares instead of accepting the Offer should not by reason of that conversion be
treated as having made a disposal of the APM loan stock for the purposes of
United Kingdom taxation of capital gains. However, APM loan stock holders who
convert their loan stock into APM ordinary shares will

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
 
also become entitled to subscribe for additional APM ordinary shares under the
APM warrants and should, therefore, seek independent professional advice as to
the potential United Kingdom capital gains tax consequences of the issue of
these warrants.

APM ordinary shares acquired following conversion of the loan stock, or acquired
following subscription for APM ordinary shares under the APM warrants, and which
are then transferred to Citrix for the Consideration will be treated as the
subject of a disposal for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation of capital
gains on the same basis and principles as set out above for existing APM
shareholders.

An APM loan stock holder who neither accepts the Offers nor converts his loan
stock whose loan stock is redeemed by APM at par, together with payment of
accrued interest, will be treated as having made a disposal of the loan stock on
its redemption for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation of capital gains but
no capital gain should accrue.

INCOME TAX

APM loan stock holders

Interest which has accrued in respect of the APM loan stock and which has not
been paid since the date of its issue will be treated as received for income tax
or corporation tax purposes by each APM loan stock holder on or before the
conversion, transfer or redemption of the relevant loan stock.

APM Share Option Scheme

Holders of APM share options will be liable to an income tax charge, under
Schedule E, in respect of the Consideration received or receivable for the
surrender of their options. It is expected that any income tax charge arising in
respect of the surrender of the options will be required to be accounted for to
the Inland Revenue by APM under PAYE on behalf of the option holder following
the end of the income tax month in which the release or surrender of the share
option occurs.

Although the position is not entirely clear from doubt, it is not expected that
the surrender by a holder of APM share options would give rise to a liability to
the Class I National Insurance Contribution.

RETAINED CONSIDERATION

Acceptors are likely to be treated as in receipt of taxable income in respect of
interest arising as a result of the placing on deposit of the Retained
Consideration.  Acceptors should seek independent professional advice as to when
such interest will be treated as received for United Kingdom income tax or
corporation tax purposes and any United Kingdom withholding tax implications on
the payment of such interest.

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
 
STAMP DUTY AND STAMP DUTY RESERVE TAX ("SDRT")

No stamp duty or SDRT should be payable by Acceptors as a result of accepting
the Offers.


US TAXATION

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS APPLICABLE TO UNITED
STATES PERSONS

The following is a general discussion of the principal United States federal
income tax considerations that may be applicable to (i) APM shareholders who are
"United States Persons" (each such APM shareholder, a "US shareholder") who
surrender their APM shares for Consideration pursuant to the Offers, (ii) APM
loan stock holders who are "United States Persons" who surrender their APM loan
stock for Consideration pursuant to the Offers (each such holder a "US APM loan
stock holder"), and (iii) holders of APM share options granted under the APM
Share Option Scheme who are "United States Persons" and who surrender their APM
share options for Consideration pursuant to the Offers (each such holder, a "US
option holder"), (US shareholders, US APM loan stock holders and US option
holders, collectively, "US holders".)  For purposes of this discussion, the term
"United States Person" has the meaning set forth in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
includes (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a partnership or
corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, (iii) any
estate (other than a foreign estate within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(31) of
the Code) or (iv) any trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to
exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and (B) one or
more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust.

This discussion does not address United States federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to certain APM shareholders, APM loan stock holders or
holders of APM share options in light of their particular circumstances (for
example, individuals who receive their APM shares in connection with the
performance of services, foreign corporations, individuals who are not citizens
or residents of the United States for federal income tax purposes, US holders
who are dealers in securities, US holders who do not use the cash receipts and
disbursements method of accounting or US holders who do not hold their APM
shares as capital assets).  This discussion also assumes that APM is not, and
has never been, (i) a "passive foreign investment company" within the meaning of
Section 1297 of the Code, (ii) a "foreign personal holding company" within the
meaning of Section 553 of the Code, or (iii) a "controlled foreign corporation"
within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code.  Although it has also been
assumed that APM is not and has not ever been a "collapsible corporation", the
matter is uncertain.  If, in fact, APM is or has ever been a "collapsible
corporation", then the US federal income tax consequences to US holders may be
different than as described in this discussion and income that would have been
capital gain may, in fact, be ordinary income.  In addition, the following
discussion assumes that APM is and has always been properly classified for
United States federal income tax purposes as an association taxable as a
corporation rather than a partnership, that the APM shares represent equity
rather than debt for United States federal income tax purposes, that the APM
loan stock represents debt rather than equity for United States federal income
tax purposes, that the US APM loan stock holders acquired their

                                      -17-
<PAGE>
 
APM loan stock from APM at original issue and that no declaration of accrued and
unpaid dividends on the APM shares has been made.
 
The discussion, insofar as it relates to US option holders, assumes that all of
such holders received their options in connection with the performance of
services for APM and that such services were performed in the United States.
The discussion does not address the foreign earned income provisions of Section
911 of the Code, the foreign tax credit provisions of Subpart A of Part III of
Subchapter N of the Code, or any provisions of the Convention between the
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double
Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income
and Capital Gains.

The discussion addresses only the principal United States federal income tax
consequences that may be applicable to (i) US shareholders of the surrender of
APM shares for Consideration, (ii) US APM loan stock holders of the surrender of
APM loan stock for Consideration, and (iii) US option holders of the surrender
of APM share options for Consideration, and does not address any tax
consequences of other transactions or events (whether or not any such
transactions or events are undertaken in connection with such exchange),
including but not limited to the tax treatment of indemnification payments,
whether pursuant to the Depositary Agreement or otherwise, that may occur in
connection with the Offers. Further, no non-US, state or local tax
considerations are addressed herein.

The discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, regulations, rulings
and judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change.  No
ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") has been
requested or will be sought, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will
take the same view of the tax consequences described below.

THE FOLLOWING IS A GENERAL SUMMARY ONLY AND DOES NOT ADDRESS EVERY SITUATION
APPLICABLE TO EACH PARTICULAR US HOLDER.  US HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR
OWN TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE TRANSACTIONS
DESCRIBED IN THE OFFERS, INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE, LOCAL AND
NON-US TAX LAWS AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUCH TAX LAWS.

The surrender of APM shares, APM loan stock and APM share options for
Consideration pursuant to the Offers will not constitute a reorganisation within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.  Instead, the surrender of APM
shares, APM loan stock and APM share options for Consideration is intended to be
a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes.

US shareholders

Upon the surrender of APM shares for Consideration pursuant to the Offers each
US shareholder will recognise capital gain or loss equal to the difference
between (i) the Consideration received pursuant to the Offers and (ii) such US
shareholder's tax basis in the APM shares surrendered; and depending on the
holding period of the APM shares surrendered by such US shareholders, any
capital gain recognised on such surrender may be taxable at

                                      -18-
<PAGE>
 
preferential tax rates. US Shareholders are advised to consult their tax
advisers as to the application of such rates.

US APM loan stock holders

Assuming that the APM loan stock constitutes debt rather than equity for US
federal income tax purposes and that the US APM loan stock holders acquired
their APM loan stock from APM at original issue, the following tax consequences
should generally result upon the surrender of APM loan stock for Consideration
pursuant to the Offers:
 
     (a)  each APM loan stock holder will recognise ordinary income equal to the
          amount of interest which is accrued on the APM loan stock as of the
          date of the exchange; and

     (b)  each APM loan stock holder will recognise short-term capital gain or
          loss equal to the difference between (i) the Consideration received
          and (ii) such APM loan stock holder's tax basis in his, her or its APM
          loan stock surrendered plus the amount of interest income recognised
          by such holder upon surrender of the APM loan stock.

Although Citrix believes that the APM loan stock is more likely to constitute
debt rather than equity for US federal income tax purposes, if the APM loan
stock were to constitute equity the tax consequences to US APM loan stock
holders upon the surrender of APM loan stock for Consideration pursuant to the
Offers would be different and could be more favourable

If either (i) a US APM loan stock holder elects to convert such holder's loan
stock into APM ordinary shares or (ii) a US APM loan stock holder's loan stock
is redeemed by APM, then the US federal income tax consequences to such holder
upon such conversion or redemption (as the case may be) may be different than as
described above.

US option holders

Upon the receipt of Consideration by a US option holder upon the surrender of
such holder's APM share options pursuant to the Offers, a US option holder will
recognise ordinary income in the nature of compensation equal to the amount of
Consideration received.  Such ordinary income will be subject to United States
withholding taxes.

In general, any gain or loss recognised by a US holder upon the conversion of
Pounds Sterling into United States dollars will be ordinary income or loss.

THE RETAINED CONSIDERATION

With regard to the Retained Consideration, it is not clear whether US
shareholders, US APM loan stock holders and US option holders will be treated as
having received the Retained Consideration on the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Offers or upon actual distribution of the Retained
Consideration to such holders.  If the Retained Consideration is treated as
having been received by such holders on the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Offers, the entire amount of gain or ordinary income
realised by such holder may be

                                      -19-
<PAGE>
 
included as gross income for the taxable year of such transactions. In the event
that such holder loses his, her or its right to receive part or all of the
Retained Consideration pursuant to the Offers and the Depositary Agreement, such
holder may be entitled to a loss (which in general should have the same
character as the gain, loss or ordinary income recognised on the transactions
set forth in the Offers), in the taxable year in which it is determined that
such holder is not entitled to receive such Retained Consideration.
Alternatively, in the case of a US shareholder or a US APM loan stock holder,
such holder may be entitled to report gain attributable to the Retained
Consideration on the instalment method, unless such holder elects out of such
treatment. Under the instalment method, a US shareholder or US APM loan stock
holder may be treated as having received the Retained Consideration when such
amount is released from the Depositary. Any gain will be recognised in the year
(or years) during which the Retained Consideration is released from the
Depositary. If and when all or a portion of the Retained Consideration is
released from the Depositary, it will be released together with the actual net
interest, if any, earned thereon by the Depositary. A US holder will recognise
ordinary interest income at the time of such release equal to the amount of such
interest received. Citrix expects that the interest actually earned by the
Depositary on the Retained Consideration will be sufficient to avoid imputation
of interest under the instalment sale rules.

BACKUP WITHHOLDING

Payments made to a US shareholder or a US APM loan stock holder (other than
payments which represent accrued interest) pursuant to the surrender of APM
shares for Consideration may be subject to United States "backup withholding"
tax of 31 per cent. unless such US shareholder or US APM loan stock holder
complies with certain identification requirements. Any withheld amounts
generally should be allowed as a credit against such holder's United States
federal income tax liability if a timely federal income tax return is filed. To
avoid backup withholding, each such holder must complete a Form W-9. On that
form, such holder must provide his, her or its correct taxpayer identification
number and certify under penalties of perjury that such number is correct and
that such holder is not subject to backup withholding.


CONDITIONS OF THE OFFERS

The Offers are subject to a number of conditions imposed by Citrix and these are
set out in full in Appendix I of this document.  These conditions must be
fulfilled or waived by Citrix before the Acceptors will be entitled to receive
any Consideration.  UNLESS AGREED OTHERWISE BY CITRIX THE FINAL DATE FOR
SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF THESE CONDITIONS IS THE CLOSING DATE.

The principal conditions of the Offers are as follows:-

 .    None of the relevant APM Statements being untrue at the Closing Date such

     Executive Directors of any of their obligations under the Agreement and

               cease to be capable of further acceptance and Citrix and APM

               made, or should be made, shall not invalidate the Offer in any
               way.

               the person or agent whose name and address is set out in the
               relevant place on the Form of Acceptance or, if none is set out,

          (j)  All powers of attorney and authorities in the terms conferred by,
               or referred to in, this Appendix or in the Irrevocable

               performance of the obligations of the APM shareholder concerned
               under the Offer and are irrevocable.

               certificate(s), loan stock certificate(s), share option
               certificate(s) and/or other document(s) of title will be given.

               to refer to the expiry of the Offer as so extended.

PART 3 - FORM OF ACCEPTANCE

Each Acceptor irrevocably undertakes, represents, warrants and agrees to and
with Citrix (so as to bind him, his personal representatives, heirs, successors
and assignees) to the effect that:

                                  APPENDIX II

                            RETAINED CONSIDERATION

SUMMARY

The following statements summarise the operation of the arrangements for the
Retained Consideration. The detailed terms governing the operation of these
arrangements and the rights of Citrix to be indemnified out of the Retained
Consideration are detailed in Parts 2, 3 and 4 of this Appendix II and in the
Depositary Agreement:

1.   On the Closing Date, 10 per cent. of the Consideration to which Acceptors
     would otherwise be entitled will be placed in the custody of the
     Depositary, as an independent party. The terms under which the Depositary
     will act in such capacity are set out in a Depositary Agreement. The
     principal provisions of the Depositary Agreement are set out in Part I of
     this Appendix II.

2.   The Retained Consideration is to be held by the Depositary to provide a
     pool of money against which Citrix can seek indemnification for the
     purposes set out in paragraph 3 below.

3.   To the extent that Citrix has evidence (or considers that it has evidence)
     that a relevant APM Statement is untrue on 15 June 1998 and/or as at the
     Closing Date (as the case may be) and that any such Statement has not been
     disclosed against in the APM Disclosure Memorandum, it will be entitled to
     make a claim for the return to it of up to the total amount of the Retained
     Consideration on the terms of the indemnity arrangements set out in Part 2
     of this Appendix II.

4.   Citrix is entitled to seek indemnification for all damages, loss, liability
     and expenses which it incurs or suffers arising out of any such APM
     Statement being untrue provided and to the extent that the amount of such
     damages, loss, liability and expenses in the aggregate exceeds US$500,000.
     Full details of these indemnification provisions are set out in Part 2 of
     this Appendix II. The provisions relating to how claims must be made are
     set out in the provisions of Part 3 of this Appendix II. The maximum
     liability of Acceptors under these provisions will not exceed the total
     amount of the Retained Consideration plus any interest that has accrued
     thereon, retained in accordance with Part 1 of this Appendix II.

5.   The administration of claims will be dealt with by the Vendors'
     Representative. The terms under which the Vendors' Representative will act
     are set out in Part 4 of this Appendix II.

6.   No claim for indemnification may be brought by Citrix in relation to the
     APM Statements after the first anniversary of the Closing Date and
     Acceptors will receive, following such date, such amount of the Retained
     Consideration to which they are entitled as are not necessary to meet such
     indemnification claims or such pending indemnification claims.

PART 1 - RETAINED CONSIDERATION AND APPOINTMENT OF DEPOSITARY

The following is a summary of the terms of the Depositary Agreement:

1.   Within 7 days of the Closing Date, Citrix will wire to the Depositary the
     amount of the Retained Consideration which will be, in aggregate, 10 per
     cent. of the Consideration. The Retained Consideration will be held in a
     US$ denominated account in the joint names of the Depositary who will hold
     such Retained Consideration for the benefit of Acceptors on the terms of
     the Depositary Agreement.

2.   The Depositary has agreed to act on the basis that Citrix shall be
     responsible for the Depositary's professional fees and reasonable out-of-
     pocket expenses.

3.   If any amount of the Retained Consideration is paid to Citrix it shall be
     paid, together with an appropriate proportion of the interest accrued
     thereon to the date of such payment. If any amount of the Retained
     Consideration is paid to the Acceptors it shall be paid, together with an
     appropriate proportion of the interest accrued thereon to the date of such
     payment. The Retained Consideration shall be invested by the Depositary in
     accordance with agreed instructions given to it, from time to time, by
     Citrix and the Vendors' Representative.

PART 2 - CITRIX'S RIGHTS OF INDEMNIFICATION

Subject to the provisions of Part 5 of this Appendix, each Acceptor agrees to
indemnify Citrix against, and agrees to hold it harmless from, any and all
damage, loss, liability and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
legal fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding)
("Statement Related Loss") incurred or suffered by Citrix or the APM Group
arising out of any of the APM Statements being untrue (determined after taking
into account exceptions in the APM Disclosure Memorandum) on 15 June 1998 and/or
as at the Closing Date (as the case may be), provided that:

1.   such Acceptor shall only be liable under this Part 2 of this Appendix II to
     the extent that the aggregate amount of Statement Related Loss with respect
     to all matters referred to in this Part 2 of this Appendix (determined
     without regard to any qualification relating to materiality or Material
     Adverse Effect (as defined in Part 1 of Appendix III) contained in any of
     the APM Statements (other than claims arising from paragraph 24 of Part 2
     of Appendix III) giving rise to the claim for indemnity hereunder) exceeds
     US$500,000 and then only in respect of such excess;

2.   each such Acceptor shall only be so liable in respect of any claim or
     claims arising from paragraph 24 of Part 2 of Appendix III to the extent
     that the aggregate amount of Statement Related Loss relating thereto
     exceeds US$400,000 and then only in respect of such excess;

3.   no liability shall arise under this Part 2 of this Appendix II in respect
     of any individual claim which does not exceed US$5,000;

                                      -32-
<PAGE>
 
4.   such Acceptor shall be liable only to the extent of his Pro Rata Share (as
     defined below) of such Statement Related Loss; and

5.   such Acceptor's maximum liability under this Part 2 of this Appendix II
     shall not exceed the amount of Retained Consideration plus interest which
     has accrued thereon held by the Depositary on behalf of such Acceptor.

"PRO RATA SHARE" means in respect of an Acceptor, a fraction, the numerator of
which is the total amount of Retained Consideration held by the Depositary in
respect of such Acceptor pursuant to the Offers at the time the claim is made by
Citrix and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Retained
Consideration held by the Depositary in respect of all Acceptors pursuant to the
Offers after all of the Consideration (including the Retained Consideration) has
been paid.

PART 3 - HOW CLAIMS ARE MADE BY CITRIX

The Depositary Agreement contains the following provisions for dealing with
claims for indemnification which Citrix may make pursuant to the terms of Part 2
of this Appendix II. It should be noted that the following provisions in this
Part 3 are only a summary of the terms of the Depositary Agreement and, to the
extent that a conflict arises, the Depositary Agreement will prevail:

1.   SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS

     If Citrix has a claim pursuant to Part 2 of this Appendix II for which it
     seeks indemnification, Citrix will deliver a written notice thereof to (i)
     the Depositary and (ii) the Vendors' Representative. Such notice will
     include a description of the facts upon which such claim is based (so far
     as then known to Citrix) and the amount of such claim with respect thereto
     (the "Notice of Claim"). No Notice of Claim requesting satisfaction of
     Statement Related Loss may be submitted if any of the provisos listed in
     Part 2 of this Appendix II applies to exclude the liability of the
     Acceptors. If Citrix has not received a written notice of objection
     ("Notice of Objection") to the Notice of Claim from the Vendors'
     Representative within 20 business days of receipt of the same, Citrix may
     deliver a notice to the Depositary instructing the Depositary to transfer
     to Citrix the amount of Retained Consideration equal to the amount of the
     Statement Related Loss described in the relevant Notice of Claim. No Notice
     of Claim may be served by Citrix in respect of Statement Related Loss after
     the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

2.   DISPUTED CLAIMS

     If a timely Notice of Objection in respect of Statement Related Loss is
     submitted by Citrix and Citrix and the Vendors' Representative are unable
     to settle the claim within 20 business days of the date of the Notice of
     Objection, in whole or in part, then Citrix may raise proceedings in the
     High Court of Justice in England which shall have non-exclusive
     jurisdiction in respect of any such claim. If such proceedings are not
     commenced within 16 months of the Closing Date, such claim will lapse.

                                      -33-
<PAGE>
 
3.   SATISFACTION OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS

     Citrix's rights to indemnification are to be satisfied by the transfer to
     it of an amount of Retained Consideration equal to the relevant Statement
     Related Loss.

4.   PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES OF THE VENDORS' REPRESENTATIVE

     The Vendors' Representative shall be entitled to require the Depositary to
     make a payment to him from the Retained Consideration to fund professional
     fees and expenses (including any fees arising as a result of the indemnity
     referred to in paragraph 3 of Part 5 of this Appendix II) and the Vendors'
     Representative of (pound)500 for each day (reduced pro rata for part days)
     spent on dealing with any claims submitted by Citrix, together with out-of-
     pocket expenses incurred or to be incurred by the Vendors' Representative
     in connection with the operation of this Appendix II and the Depositary
     Agreement.

5.   RELEASE OF RETAINED CONSIDERATION

     Acceptors will receive, following the first anniversary of the Closing
     Date, such amount of Retained Consideration and interest to which they are
     entitled as are not necessary to meet indemnification claims or pending
     indemnification claims in respect of Statement Related Loss.

PART 4 - VENDORS' REPRESENTATIVE

1.   Such of the APM shareholders (hereinafter together the "Majority APM
     shareholders" or individually a "Majority APM shareholder") as hold a
     majority of the APM shares on the Closing Date shall be entitled, from time
     to time, to appoint such person as they shall in their sole discretion
     decide (and to remove such person) as the Vendors' Representative, for the
     purposes set out in this Part 4 of this Appendix II, by notice in writing
     to Citrix signed by or on behalf of the Majority APM shareholders.

2.   Each Acceptor Irrevocably Agrees:

          (a)  that he grants the Vendors' Representative full power and
               authority on behalf of such Acceptor to (i) dispute or refrain
               from disputing any claim made by Citrix in respect of the
               Retained Consideration under the indemnity provisions set out in
               Part 2 of this Appendix II and the Depositary Agreement; (ii)
               remedy or seek to remedy the circumstances giving rise to any
               Statement Related Loss; (iii) negotiate and compromise any such
               claim; (iv) engage lawyers, attorneys, accountants, other
               professional advisers and agents; (v) execute any settlement
               agreement, release or other document with respect to such claim;
               and (vi) to perform all other duties and obligations and to
               exercise all rights with respect to any of the foregoing as are
               set out in the Depositary Agreement;

                                      -34-
<PAGE>
 
          (b)  that he grants the Vendors' Representative full power and
               authority on behalf of such Acceptor to give such instructions
               and to take such action or refrain from taking such action as the
               Vendors' Representative deems, in his sole discretion, necessary
               or appropriate to carry out the provisions of, and to consummate,
               the transactions contemplated by this Part 4 of this Appendix II;

          (c)  Citrix shall be entitled to rely on any and all action taken by
               the Vendors' Representative evidenced by a document appearing to
               be signed by the Vendors' Representative without any liability
               to, or obligation to inquire of, any Acceptors;

          (d)  a notice, validly delivered to the Vendors' Representative, of
               the intimation of a claim in respect of Citrix's rights to be
               indemnified under Part 2 of this Appendix II, shall be sufficient
               notice and Citrix shall not be required to give notice of such
               claim to such Acceptor;

          (e)  the authority of the Vendors' Representative hereunder shall be
               effective until the date upon which no Retained Consideration is
               held by the Depositary;

          (f)  the Vendors' Representative shall be entitled to communicate the
               receipt by him of any claim from Citrix under Part 3 of this
               Appendix II to Acceptors by placing an advertisement to this
               effect in one national daily newspaper in the United Kingdom; and

          (g)  in carrying out his functions hereunder, the Vendors'
               Representative shall be entitled to exercise his discretion and
               shall not be obliged to consult with such Acceptor provided that
               if the Vendors' Representative elects to consult with such
               Acceptor such consultation shall not in any way affect the right
               of the Vendors' Representative to exercise his discretion as
               aforesaid and the acts of the Vendors' Representative shall in
               all circumstances bind such Acceptor.

3.   Any claim, action, suit or other proceeding, to enforce any right, benefit
     or remedy granted to Citrix under Part 2 of this Appendix II may be
     asserted, brought, prosecuted, or maintained by Citrix against the
     Acceptors by service of process on the Vendors' Representative and without
     the necessity of serving process on, or otherwise joining or naming, any
     other party as a defendant in such claim, action, suit or other proceeding.
     With respect to any matter contemplated by the appointment of the Vendors'
     Representative, the Acceptors shall be bound by any determination in favour
     of or against the Vendors' Representative or the terms of any settlement or
     release to which the Vendors' Representative shall become a party.

4.   The Vendors' Representative shall not be liable to any Acceptor with
     respect to any act or omission taken or omitted to be taken by the Vendors'
     Representative pursuant to this Part 4 of this Appendix II, except to the
     extent that the relevant loss results from such Vendors' Representative's
     gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

indemnification rights of Citrix set out in Part 2 of this Appendix II shall be
limited in each of the following respects:

1.   Citrix shall have no rights under Part 2 of this Appendix II:

          (a)  to the extent of any Statement Related Loss in respect of which
               Citrix and/or APM is entitled to make a claim under any policy of
               insurance;

          (b)  to the extent that such liability would not have arisen but for
               an act or omission before Closing Date by Citrix or by APM in
               accordance with Citrix's directions;

          (c)  to the extent that such liability would not have arisen but for a
               voluntary act or failure to act, omission or transaction on the
               part of Citrix and/or any APM Group company after the Closing
               Date, otherwise than in the ordinary course of business of APM
               Group;

          (d)  in respect of any state of affairs which has arisen after 15 June
               1998 and shall have rendered any APM Statement untrue as at the

               writing to the bringing about of such state of affairs pursuant
               to clause 3 of the Agreement and Undertaking;

          (e)  to the extent that such liability would not have arisen but for
               any alteration or enactment made after the Closing Date of any

                                      -61-
<PAGE>
 
               Signing Date neither APM nor, to the knowledge of the Executive
               Directors, any other party thereto is in default in any material
               respect under the terms of any agreement, contract, lease,
               arrangement or commitment.

     18.3      Full disclosure is made in the APM Disclosure Memorandum of any
               negotiations or offers or the like at the Signing Date which are
               capable or likely to result in APM entering into any agreement or
               arrangement of a kind described in paragraph 18.1.

     18.4      APM has not assigned or sublet any of its rights under and at the
               Signing Date is not in default under agreement or arrangement of
               a kind described in paragraph 18.1 to which it is a party and
               there are no circumstances at the Signing Date likely to give
               rise to any such default, and no other party thereto is in
               default of any such agreement or arrangement and there are no
               circumstances expected to give rise to any such default.

     18.5      No agreement or transaction to which APM is a party is invalid or
               ultra vires and at the Signing Date there are no grounds for
               rescission, breach, avoidance or repudiation of any agreement or
               other transaction to which APM is a party.

     18.6      No party with whom APM has entered into any agreement or
               arrangement is at the Signing Date in default thereunder, being a
               default which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
               financial or trading position or prospects of APM; and, so far as
               the Executive Directors are aware there are no circumstances
               which are likely to give rise to any default.

                    expected by the Executive Directors to do so;

               (b)  no director, consultant or employee will leave the

               nature of any such disclosure) and no such disclosure will be
               authorised by APM prior to Closing.

               which it is or is alleged to be a party, and no circumstances

               process, notice or communication.

     21.8      There have not been and are not at the Signing Date pending, or

            the Signing Date and so far as the Executive Directors are aware
            there are no claims or actions (whether criminal or civil) pending
            or threatened or anticipated by or against APM or any of its
            directors, employees or consultants in relation to APM or its

     22.2   So far as the Executive Directors are aware, there are no

            involving APM.

23.  INSURANCE

     23.1   APM and its assets are insured against such risks and in such sums

            renewal date for each of such insurances is a date at least 30 days
            after the date of Closing. All such insurances are currently in full
            force and effect, and nothing has been done or omitted to be done
            which could make any policy of insurance void or voidable, or which
            is likely to result in an increase in premium; and none of such
            insurances is subject to any special or unusual terms or
            restrictions or to the payment of any premium in excess of the
            normal rate for companies similar to APM.

     23.2   No claim is outstanding at the Signing Date or at the Signing Date
            is likely to be made under any of such insurances and no
            circumstances exist which are likely to give rise to any such claim.

     23.3   So far as the Executive Directors are aware, there are no claims
            which are likely to be brought against APM by an employee, a workman
            or any other third party, in respect of any accident or injury
            occurring before Closing, which are not fully covered by insurance.

            relation to the Properties or otherwise, and there are no
            circumstances existing which may lead to any such action, claim,
            investigation, proceeding, suit or prosecution.

            the Properties or any other property at any time owned or occupied
            by APM which would give rise to any liability to make good, repair,
            reinstate or clean up.

                  retirement or in anticipation of retirement on or after
                  retirement in connection with past service, or to be given on
                  or in anticipation of or in connection with any change in the
                  nature of the service of the person in question) for any

                  or employee of APM or for any dependants of any such person;

            written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written)
            by APM relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
            under such 401(k) Plan that would increase materially the expense of
            maintaining such 401(k) Plan above the level of the expense incurred
            in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended prior to the date
            hereof.

1.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

     As to: (i) warranties 1.1 to 1.6 inclusive in so far as they relate to
     APM's Product IPRs; and (ii) warranties 1.11 and 1.12; except as
     directly disclosed:

     1.1   All of APM's IPRs are:

           (a)    directly or indirectly identified or referred to in the APM

           (b)    (only in relation to (i) patent rights and applications
                  therefor and (ii) defects, in such of APM's IPRs as are
                  licensed to it, arising out of defects in the relevant
                  licensor's title and ability to grant licenses, so far as the
                  Executive Directors are aware) valid and subsisting; and

           (c)    (only in relation to (i) patent rights and applications
                  therefor and (ii) defects, in such of APM's IPRs as are
                  licensed to it, arising out of defects in the relevant
                  licensor's title and ability to grant licenses, so far as the
                  Executive Directors are aware) there is no impediment or
                  restriction on their use by APM in the Business (both as
                  currently conducted and including any planned, anticipated, or
                  reasonably foreseeable extension or change to that business).

     1.2   APM's IPRs are:

           (a)    so far as the Executive Directors are aware, not subject to
                  any charges, mortgages, liens or encumbrances; and

           (b)    not subject to any licences or other agreements other than the
                  Customer Contracts and (in relation only to such of APM's IPRs
                  as are licensed to it) the Third Party Agreements;

           affecting the same or restricting their use by APM in any way.

     1.3   Save for the Customer Contracts, there are no agreements, consents,
           permissions, undertakings or understandings which license the use of

           dealings which have been entered into or purportedly entered into by
           or on behalf of any other person.

                                      -70-
<PAGE>
 
     1.4   There are no circumstances which could entitle a third party:

           (a)    to a licence, permission, consent or assignment of or in
                  respect of any of APM's IPRs; or

           (b)    to call for or exercise any right to use or work under any of
                  APM's IPRs;

                  save as may be provided for by the Customer Contracts.

     1.5   APM's IPRs and the Third Party Agreements will not be adversely
           affected by the acquisition contemplated by this document.

     1.6   Save for the Customer Contracts, neither APM nor any of the directors
           or employees of APM has entered, become a party to or become bound by
           any agreement for the sharing, exchanging, passing on or otherwise of
           APM's IPRs of any description to any other person, firm or
           corporation neither are there any such agreements which were entered
           into in relation to the Software.

     1.7   There have not been any actions, claims, counterclaims, applications
           or allegations impugning the validity or enforceability of any of
           APM's IPRs (only in relation to Third Party Software, so far as the
           Executive Directors are aware) or (for such as APM claims to own)
           APM's ownership thereof and (only in relation to patent rights and
           applications therefor and to Third Party Software, so far as the
           Executive Directors are aware) there are no facts, matters or
           circumstances which could give rise to any such action, claim,
           counterclaim, application or allegation. The use and exercise of
           APM's IPRs (only in relation to patent rights and applications
           therefor and to Third Party Software, so far as the Executive
           Directors are aware) does not constitute and has never constituted an
           infringement of any intellectual property or other rights owned by
           any third party.

     1.8   There have not been any actions, claims or allegations against any
           third party alleging infringement of any of APM's IPRs and (only in
           relation to patent rights and applications therefor, so far as the
           Executive Directors are aware) there are not and there have not been
           any facts matters or circumstances which could give or which might
           give or have given rise to any such action, claim or allegation.

     1.9
           (a)    Insofar as Know-how owned or used by APM and/or APM's
                  Confidential Information or any part thereof has been
                  disclosed it has been disclosed only under the terms of
                  confidentiality agreements which are intended to protect (and
                  purport to have the effect of

                                      -71-
<PAGE>
 
                  protecting) the confidentiality of that Know-how and/or APM's
                  Confidential Information and maintain APM's rights therein.

           (b)    Subject to sub paragraph (a) above, all Know-how owned or used
                  by APM and APM's Confidential Information has been maintained
                  as confidential and, so far as the Executive Directors are
                  aware, no recipient of APM's Confidential Information has made
                  any unauthorised disclosure or any commercial use of that
                  information.

           (c)    None of the Non-Disclosure Agreements contains any grant of
                  rights to use or exploit any of the Software in any way.

     1.10  There are no Intellectual Property Rights (a) which were once owned
           or licensed to APM, and (b) which are no longer so owned or licensed
           due to the neglect, wilful act or default of APM, and (c) which if
           still so owned and licensed would be (i) within the definition of
           APM's Product IPRs and (ii) of substantial benefit to APM in the
           conduct or expansion of the Business.

     1.11  Excepting such of APM's IPRs as are identified in item 1.11 of Part B
           of the APM Disclosure Memorandum as licensed to it (or, in relation
           only to APM's non-Product IPRs, as are generally or impliedly
           identified by the Research Contracts or the Consultancy Contracts as
           licensed to it or jointly owned by it), all of APM's IPRs are:

           (a)    legally and beneficially owned by APM;

           (b)    all exclusively owned by APM and no third party has any
                  ownership rights in them; and

           (c)    not subject to any claims from employees or others.

     1.12  None of APM's IPRs which are licensed to it are exclusively licensed
           to it.

     1.13  Insofar as any of APM's IPRs are the subject of registrations or
           applications identified in Part B of the APM Disclosure Memorandum:

           (a)    all relevant registrations and applications therefor are in
                  the name of APM or (for such of APM's IPRs as APM does not
                  own) its licensor;

           (b)    all application and renewal fees have been paid; and

           (c)    so far as the Executive Directors are aware, all material
                  information (whether or not originally in written form)
                  relating to all such applications and registrations has been
                  disclosed in parts (I) and (II)

                                      -72-
<PAGE>
 
                  of Section 7 of Part B of the Schedule to the APM Disclosure
                  Memorandum.

     1.14  APM does not require or make use of any Intellectual Property Rights
           (other than APM's IPRs) in carrying on the Business. APM has not done
           or omitted to do any act which has resulted or which may result in
           any breach or infringement of any third party's Intellectual Property
           Rights.

     1.15  All agreements and licenses (and all provisions thereof) for the use
           by APM of Intellectual Property rights not owned by APM are valid and
           subsisting, are described in the APM Disclosure Memorandum and APM is
           not in breach of any of the provisions hereof and no disputes have
           arisen or are reasonably foreseeable with respect to them.

     1.16  There are no consents or agreements which are or may become
           reasonably necessary in order (i) for APM to create and develop the
           Software to the specifications and with the functionality which APM
           is currently representing as reasonably achievable or (ii) for users
           of the Software to fully benefit from those specifications and fully
           exploit that functionality, other than consents or agreements which
           either (A) are already obtained and assured for the relevant future
           or (B) are made generally available and can be readily acquired on
           usual commercial terms for a cost which has no material effect on APM
           or on the commercial value of the Software to APM.

     1.17  In particular but without limiting the preceding paragraph, there are
           no Intellectual Property Rights or licences under them which are or
           may become reasonably necessary in order (i) for APM to create and
           develop the Software to the specifications and with the functionality
           which APM is currently representing as reasonably achievable or (ii)
           for users of the Software to fully benefit from those specifications
           and fully exploit that functionality, other than Intellectual
           Property Rights or licences under them which either (A) are already
           obtained and assured for the relevant future or (B) are made
           generally available and can be readily acquired on usual commercial
           terms for a cost which has no material effect on APM or on the
           commercial value of the Software to APM.

     1.18  Notwithstanding any disclosure, APM has never, pursuant to any
           Research Contract or Consultancy Contract, licensed or otherwise
           supplied to any other party to any of those contracts (its
           "Licensee") Intellectual Property Rights licensed or supplied to APM
           by a third party (whether or not a party to any of those contracts)
           (its "Licensor"), in any way that might give rise to any liability in
           APM in relation to infringement of third party rights by its Licensee
           resulting from Licensee's use or exploitation of Intellectual
           Property Rights belonging to or represented as belonging to the
           Licensor (other than liability fully covered by a right of APM to
           claim compensation from its Licensor).

2.   THE SOFTWARE

     Except as directly disclosed:

     2.1   APM exclusively owns all Intellectual Property Rights in the Software
           and Supporting Materials subject only to such end-user non exclusive
           object code licences within any Customer Contract. The Software is
           all the software ever developed or acquired by APM for commercial
           exploitation (other than pursuant to any of the Research Contracts).
           The Software and the Supporting Material were specified, designed,
           written and produced entirely and solely by persons who were at all
           material times either:

           (a)    employees of APM and who produced the Software and the
                  Supporting Material as part of their duties of employment, or

           (b)    third parties (or employees of them) who produced the Software
                  and the Supporting Materials pursuant to written contracts
                  under which, notwithstanding any disclosure, all ownership and
                  possession of, and Intellectual Property Rights in, the
                  resulting Software and Supporting Materials have passed into
                  the sole ownership of APM. Except as directly disclosed, so
                  far as the Executive Directors are aware no such person (or
                  any employee of such person) has ever indicated any intent to
                  claim or interest in claiming any Intellectual Property Rights
                  in the Software.

           The persons concerned are listed in the Software Statement. No other
           persons were or have been involved in the specification, design,
           writing or production of the Software or the Supporting Material.
           None of the Software is computer-generated within the meaning of the
           Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 (as amended). All employees of
           APM who did work for APM in relation to the Software but have since
           ceased to be employees of APM parted from APM on good terms and so
           far as the Executive Directors are aware no such person has ever
           indicated any intent to claim or interest in claiming any
           Intellectual Property Rights in the Software.

     2.2   No person other than APM and the current and duly authorised
           employees has the Source Code or the Supporting Material in its
           possession or is entitled to possess or use the Source Code or the
           Supporting Material in any way (including pursuant to a source code
           escrow agreement). There are no escrow agreements in force under
           which any third party might contingently become entitled to such use
           or possession, nor is any person entitled to require such an escrow
           agreement to be entered into by APM. APM has in its possession a
           complete and functional copy of the Source Code and has verified it
           to be complete and functional within the last 7 days.

     2.3   The Software:

                                      -74-
<PAGE>
 
           (a)    when used with such Third Party Software as is embedded in it
                  or supplied with it:

                  (i)   conforms in all material respects with the User Manuals
                        and all other written statements as to its features and
                        capabilities; and

                  (ii)  does not contain any defect which has a materially
                        adverse effect on its use or operation (save that it is
                        not warranted as being bug free or error free); and

           (b)    so far as the Executive Directors are aware, no Software is
                  not Millenium Compliant

           save to the extent that the recorded errors are disclosed in print-
           outs from the Radar Bugs Data Base included in Section 8 of Part B of
           the Schedule to the APM Disclosure Memorandum.

     2.4   The supply and licensing of the Software does not involve or result
           in the infringement of any third party's Intellectual Property Rights
           and does not require the permission or consent of any third party.
           Except as directly disclosed, no Third Party Software is embedded in
           any Software or otherwise included in any Product.

3.   PRODUCTS, CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

     3.1   All Third Party Software is clearly identified as such in the APM
           Disclosure Memorandum. (In relation to such Third Party Software as
           is embedded in any of the Software or otherwise included in any
           Product, notwithstanding any disclosure) APM is fully and properly
           licensed to use or otherwise deal with all Third Party Software in
           the manner in which it has been used or dealt with by APM up to and
           including the Closing Date. Where APM has licensed or sub-licensed
           the Third Party Software or any part of it to a Customer (whether in
           association with the Software or otherwise) it has been and remains
           duly authorised and licensed to do so. Save for the parties to the
           Customer Contracts, there are no other parties to whom the Software
           has been licensed or supplied or who are otherwise entitled to
           possess, use or otherwise deal with any Products or to whom APM is
           liable to perform any maintenance or other services or provide any
           goods in relation to or connection with Products or their use.

     3.2   So far as the Executive Directors are aware, there has been no breach
           of any of the Customer Contracts nor any instance of any Customer
           using, authorising or purporting to authorise the use of the Products
           in a manner which is inconsistent with the relevant Customer
           Contracts or not authorised by APM.

                                      -75-
<PAGE>
 
     3.3   APM had at the time it did so, full authority to enter into each of
           the Customer Contracts. The Customer Contracts are valid and
           subsisting and no disputes or potential disputes have arisen or been
           notified to APM or are reasonably foreseeable with respect thereto.

     3.4   APM is not in material breach or default in relation to any of the
           Customer Contracts and no claims or allegations have been made by any
           person to the effect that APM is in breach of any of the Customer
           Contracts and there are no facts, matters or circumstances nor has
           APM done or omitted to do any act which could amount to or result in
           any such breach or give rise to any such claim or allegation.

     3.5   So far as the Executive Directors are aware, no person other than APM
           is in breach or default in relation to any of the Customer Contracts
           and no claims or allegations have been made by any person to the
           effect that any such person is in breach of any of the Customer
           Contracts and there are no facts, matters or circumstances nor has
           any such person done or omitted to do any act which could amount to
           or result in any such breach or give rise to any such claim or
           allegation.

     3.6   So far as the Executive Directors are aware, there are no grounds for
           rescission, breach, avoidance or repudiation of any of the Customer
           Contracts or of any other agreement (in whole or in part) or other
           transaction relating to the Business to which APM is a party.

     3.7   There are no agreements or understandings (written or oral) whereby
           any of the Customer Contracts or any other such agreement, instrument
           or arrangement may be terminated or rescinded by any party other than
           APM or the Customers or whereby the terms may be worsened as against
           APM or whereby APM's IPRs or their ownership or exercise may be
           prejudiced as a result of anything done or omitted or permitted to be
           done by APM.

     3.8   APM has obtained and maintained in force all registrations under the
           Data Protection Act 1984 or any other similar legislation or
           regulations within the European Union which are necessary in order
           for APM (or any officer or employee of APM, as appropriate) to
           conduct its business in the ordinary and usual course in a lawful and
           appropriate manner.

     3.9   Except for the claims particulars of which have been disclosed in the
           APM Disclosure Memorandum, APM has not received any claims alleging
           that the Products are defective or that they have caused or
           contributed to damage or personal injury, and except as aforesaid, no
           dispute exists between APM and any customer or client of it, nor are
           there any circumstances which may give rise to any such dispute.

                                      -76-
<PAGE>
 
     3.10  APM has not received any notice or other intimation that any of the
           Products infringe any United Kingdom or European Community
           regulations relating to safety and manufacture or that any of the
           Products sold outside the United Kingdom infringe any regulations in
           the country of sale relating to the manufacture of products of their
           kind.

     3.11  APM's advertising for the Products makes no claims for the
           performance and quality of the Products which are inaccurate; APM has
           received no complaints from any regulatory body, customer or other
           person that such advertising is misleading or deceptive or likely to
           cause confusion; and neither the sale nor the manner or terms of sale
           of the Products contravene or have contravened the Trade Descriptions
           Act 1968, the Consumer Protection Act 1961 or the Unfair Contract
