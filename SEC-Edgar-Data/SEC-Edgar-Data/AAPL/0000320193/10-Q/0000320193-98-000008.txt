        Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation  
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim periods are not 
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These 
financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
for the fiscal year ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report 
on Forms 10-K and 10-K/A for the year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 
Form 10-K").

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128
("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share." In accordance with SFAS 128, primary 
earnings per share has been replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully 
diluted earnings per share has been replaced with diluted earnings per share 
which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and 
convertible securities. Prior periods presented have been presented to conform 
to SFAS 128; however, as the Company had a net loss in those periods, basic 
and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary loss per share 
previously reported.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method. For fiscal years 1997, 1996, 1995, 
1994, and 1993, basic earnings (loss) per share was $(8.29), $(6.59), $3.50, 
$2.63, and $0.74, respectively. For those same fiscal years, there were no 
material differences between amounts previously reported as fully diluted 
earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share calculated in 
accordance with SFAS 128.

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated 
notes (the "Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately
22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common shares 
represented by these Notes upon conversion were included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 26, 1998, as the 
effect of using the if-converted method was dilutive for that period. The 
common shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation 
of diluted earnings per share for other periods presented because the effect 
of using the if-converted method for those periods would be anti-dilutive. For 
additional disclosures regarding the outstanding preferred stock, employee 
stock options and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

Note 3 - Restructuring Activities
In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a 
restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring profitability to the 
Company's operations. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased 
demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic 
direction. These actions resulted in a net charge of $179 million after 
subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996. During 1997, the 
Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to 
meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 
million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those 
actions, including approximately $8 million of costs related to the 
termination of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The combined 
restructuring actions consist of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time 
employees, approximately 3,400 of whom have been terminated from the second 
quarter of 1996 through June 26, 1998, excluding employees who were hired by 
SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center 
facility, respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a 
result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing 
various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and 
technologies that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The 
restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $236 
million and noncash asset write-downs of $83 million from the second quarter of 
1996 through June 26, 1998. The Company has periodically made adjustments to 
the categories and timing of expected restructure spending based on revised 
estimates. The Company expects that the remaining $77 million accrued balance 
as of June 26, 1998 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $35 
million over the next three months and $25 million thereafter. The remaining 
contemplated restructuring actions related to the plan will be initiated 
before the end of fiscal 1998 and completed before the end of calendar year 
1998. Remaining restructuring actions are expected to be financed through 
current working capital.

Note 4 - Stock Option Exchange
In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's key 
employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option exchange 
program which allowed employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of 
their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of greater 
than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise price of 
$13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on December 19, 
1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in December 1997.  A 
total of 4.4 million options with a weighted-average exercise price of $20.01 
per share were exchanged for new options as a result of this program.

Note 5 - Equity Investment Gains
As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of ARM 
Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved 
in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The 
Company accounts for this investment using the equity method. On April 17, 
1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London 
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its 
shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 
million which was recognized as other income. Foreign taxes recognized on this 
gain were approximately $7 million. 

At the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common 
stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method 
requires that the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the 
investor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity 
resulting from the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment 


                                       9
<PAGE>
reflecting its share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity 
resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the 
Company also recognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of 
approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in 
the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As 
of June 26, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM was 
approximately $21 million. The fair value of this investment at that date 
based on listed market values was approximately $219 million. The Company is 
subject to a "lock-up" agreement under which it is restricted from selling any 
of its ARM shares before October 16, 1998. The Company will continue to 
account for its investment in ARM using the equity method.

Note 6 - Technology Acquisition
In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under 
development.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of 
purchased in-process research and development which was charged to operations 
upon acquisition.

Note 7 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" which 
establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of software 
revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the Company to modify 
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not 
expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated results of operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities" which establishes accounting and reporting 
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires 
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in 
the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair 
value.  The Statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years 
beginning after June 15, 1999.  Earlier application of the Statement is 
permitted. The Company is still in the process of assessing the impact that the 
Statement will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 8 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the 
Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings 
and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing 
petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax 
adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of 
issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in 
dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations.

Certain amounts in the 1997 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

Net Sales

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates, 
discounts and price protection. Net sales for the third quarter and first nine 
months of 1998 were $1.402 billion and $4.385 billion, respectively, decreases 
of 19% and 20%, respectively, over the corresponding periods in 1997. The 
decline in net sales is attributable to several factors. The Company has 
experienced a $355 million decrease in net sales of peripheral products between 
the first nine months of 1998 and the same period in 1997 primarily due to the 
discontinuance by the Company of certain imaging and display products. Net 
sales in Asia were adversely affected primarily by the region's current 
economic problems, declining 37% or $476 million during the first nine months 
of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997. The average revenue per Macintosh 
system, a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total 
Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 7% and 6%, respectively, between the third 
quarter and first nine months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods in 
1997, reflecting the effect of aggressive pricing of the Company's Power 
Macintosh G3 systems introduced in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the 
decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral products, and 
the overall industry trend towards lower-priced products. Lastly, overall 
CPU units sales for the comparable nine month periods decreased approximately 
14% from 1997.

Net sales were unchanged in the third quarter of 1998 compared with the second 
quarter of 1998. A slight sequential decrease in unit sales from 650 thousand 
in the second quarter of 1998 to 644 thousand in the third quarter was offset 
by an increase in the average revenue per Macintosh system of 2%. The slight 
overall decline in unit sales is primarily attributable to the lack of 
available consumer oriented products and production capacity constraints 
related to the introduction of new PowerBook G3 systems at the end of the third 
quarter of 1998. The overall product mix continued to shift towards products 
incorporating the Power Macintosh G3 microprocessor. Sales of G3 powered 
Macintosh systems accounted for approximately 84% of Macintosh systems 
shipped during the third quarter of 1998 as compared to 51% of Macintosh 
systems shipped during the prior quarter. Net sales of imaging and display 
products decreased by $25 million to $127 million in the third quarter of 1998 
compared with the prior quarter reflecting the continuing phase-out of most 
imaging and display products.

International sales for the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 1998 
represented 43% and 47%, respectively, of consolidated net sales in each of the 
periods versus 53% for the same periods in 1997. International net sales fell 
35% in the third quarter of 1998 compared with the same period of 1997, 
primarily due to decreased revenue in the European and Japanese markets as a 
result of significant decreases in Macintosh unit sales and the average revenue 
per Macintosh system, partially offset by increases in the average revenue per 
peripheral unit. Overall sales in the European and Japanese markets were 
negatively affected during the current quarter by the lack of available 
consumer oriented products. Sales in Asia were also negatively affected by the 
region's continuing economic problems. Domestic net sales increased slightly 
in the third quarter of 1998 over the comparable period of 1997 due to 

                                       14
<PAGE>

increases in unit sales of Macintosh systems, partially offset by decreases in 
the average revenue per Macintosh system and in peripheral unit sales.

The Company anticipates modest sequential quarterly revenue growth for the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, and year-over-year quarterly revenue growth is 
not expected before the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The foregoing statements 
are forward looking. The Company's actual results could differ because of 
several factors, including those set forth below in the subsection entitled 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition".

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales during the third quarter and 
the first nine months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, 
and increased from the second quarter of 1998 to the third quarter of 1998 
from 25% to 26% of sales. These increases were primarily a result of a shift in 
revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh G3 systems 
and newer PowerBook G3 systems, the unusually low volume of lower margin 
consumer products shipped during the third quarter of 1998, and the continuing 
benefits derived from new distribution channel policies and improved inventory 
management.  

As consumer products become a larger share of the Company's net sales over 
upcoming quarters, management anticipates that gross margins will trend 
down gradually. The foregoing statement is forward looking. The Company's 
actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set 
forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection entitled 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition".

There can be no assurance that anticipated consolidated gross margin levels 
will be achieved or that current margins on existing individual products will 
be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products 
will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, 
including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased 
competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential changes to the 
Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with 
lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these 
downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing 
actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by 
the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty 
costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's 
operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be 
significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 


                                       15
<PAGE>

1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, and remained relatively 
flat in amount and as a percentage of net sales during the third quarter of 
1998 compared with the second quarter of 1998. These reductions on a year-
over-year basis are due to various restructuring actions which resulted in 
reductions in headcount and cancellation of certain research and development 
projects. 

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and during the third 
quarter of 1998 compared to the second quarter of 1998. These decreases are 
due to various restructuring actions which resulted in reductions in 
headcount, the closing of facilities, the write-down of assets, and changes to 
distribution channel policies.

Special Charges

In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under 
development.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of 
purchased in-process research and development which was charged to operations 
upon acquisition.

During the first nine months of 1997, the Company recognized a $375 million 
charge for purchased in-process research and development in connection with the 
acquisition of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT") and a $155 million charge for 
restructuring costs. For further information regarding the Company's 
restructuring actions, see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the Company's 
debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for using the equity 
method, certain foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous 
income and expense items. 

As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of ARM 
Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved 
in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The 
Company accounts for this investment using the equity method. On April 17, 
1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London 
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% 
of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of 
approximately $24 million which was recognized as other income. Foreign taxes 
recognized on this gain were approximately $7 million. The Company also 
recognized other income of approximately $16 million to reflect the increase 
in its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the net book value of ARM 
following its initial public offering.
                                       16

Provision for Income Taxes

As of June 26, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $658 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of June 26, 1998, a valuation allowance of $173 million was recorded against 
the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be 
realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset representing 
tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to 
generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management 
believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, including 
income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, 
will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their expiration 
in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, there can be no 
assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of future U.S. taxable 
income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered 
realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future 
taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially adversely 
affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company will continue 
to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by 
assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Company's 
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 1998 was only 5.6% due 
primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation 
allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes 
were provided.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 
increased to $1,993 million as of June 26, 1998, from $1,459 million as of 
September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of 
June 26, 1998 and September 26, 1997 include $58 million and $165 million, 
respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily 
associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the 1996 
sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. On 
April 24, 1998, SCI notified the Company that certain performance measures 
defined within the letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company. As a 
result, effective as of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount 
pledged as collateral by the Company to support the letter of credit was 
reduced by $100 million to $50 million. Should the Company fail to meet those 
performance measures in the future, it is possible that some or all of the 
letter of credit and supporting collateral would have to be reestablished.

Cash generated by operations during the first nine months of 1998 totaled $452 
million. Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of positive 
earnings and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially 
offset by decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

                                       17
<PAGE>

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $29 
million in the first nine months of 1998, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing equipment and tooling. The Company expects that the level of 
capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 1998 will be consistent with 
those experienced through the first three quarters of 1998.

The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the 
next twelve months. Expected cash requirements over the next twelve months 
include an estimated $60 million to effect actions under the restructuring 
plan, most of which will be effected during 1998. No assurance can be given 
that any additional required financing could be obtained should the 
restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or be 
unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, 
results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected. 

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. As of March 27, 1998, the Company's senior and 
subordinated long-term debt ratings were B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard 
and Poor's Rating Agency, and B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services. In June 1998, Moody's upgraded the Company's senior debt to B2 from 
B3 and subordinated debt to Caa1 from Caa2 citing strengthened debtholder 
protection measurements as the major reason for the upgrade.  At the same time, 
both Moody's and Standard and Poor's revised their outlooks on the Company to 
"positive" due to the Company's improved profitability and financial 
flexibility. Despite these recent upgrades, the Company's non-investment grade 
debt ratings will maintain pressure on the Company's cost of funds in future 
periods and may require the Company to pledge additional collateral or agree to 
more stringent debt covenants.

Year 2000 Compliance

Many currently installed computer systems, software products and other 
equipment utilizing microprocessors are coded to accept only two digit entries 
in the date code field. These date code fields will need to accept four digit 
entries to distinguish twenty-first century dates from twentieth century 
dates.  This is commonly referred to as the "Year 2000 issue". 

The Company is aware of the Year 2000 issue and has commenced a program to 
identify, remediate, test and develop contingency plans for, the Year 2000 
issue (the "Y2K Program"), to be substantially completed by the fall of 1999. 
The Company has established  a Year 2000 Project Management Office which is 
responsible for managing the Y2K Program as it relates to  (1) the software and 
systems used in the Company's internal business; (2)  the Company's software 
and hardware products delivered to customers; and (3) third party vendors, 
manufacturers and suppliers.  The Company currently does not anticipate that 



                                       18
<PAGE>


the cost of the Y2K Program will be material to its financial condition or 
results of operations. Nevertheless, satisfactorily addressing the Year 2000 
issue is dependent on many factors, some of which are not completely within the 
Company's control.  Should the Company's internal systems,  its software and/or 
hardware products to be delivered to customers  or the internal systems of one 
or more significant vendors, manufacturers or suppliers fail to achieve Year 
2000 compliance, the Company's business and its results of operations could be 
adversely affected.

The foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's actual results 
could differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the 
subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition".

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number 
of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In addition 
to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are many 
factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which may 
cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The Company's 
future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the 
Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued competitive 
pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; risks 
associated with international operations, including economic and labor 
conditions,  the continuing economic problems being experienced in Asia, 
political instability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; increasing 
dependence on third-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced 
functions such as logistics; the availability of key components on terms 
acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of certain components 
essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from 
sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by 
and obtained from IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products in 
certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely 
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate the technologies of NeXT, which was acquired in 1997; 
the Company's ability to successfully implement its strategic direction and 
restructuring actions, including reducing its expenditures; the Company's 
ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; the effects of significant 
adverse publicity; the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications; the effect of year 2000 compliance issues; the Company's ability 
to successfully replace its existing transaction systems in the U.S.; and the 
impact on the Company's sales, market share and gross margins as a result of 
the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program.   

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" 
in the Company's 1997 Form 10-K.

        Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation  
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim periods are not 
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These 
financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
for the fiscal year ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report 
on Forms 10-K and 10-K/A for the year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 
Form 10-K").

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128
("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share." In accordance with SFAS 128, primary 
earnings per share has been replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully 
diluted earnings per share has been replaced with diluted earnings per share 
which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and 
convertible securities. Prior periods presented have been presented to conform 
to SFAS 128; however, as the Company had a net loss in those periods, basic 
and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary loss per share 
previously reported.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method. For fiscal years 1997, 1996, 1995, 
1994, and 1993, basic earnings (loss) per share was $(8.29), $(6.59), $3.50, 
$2.63, and $0.74, respectively. For those same fiscal years, there were no 
material differences between amounts previously reported as fully diluted 
earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share calculated in 
accordance with SFAS 128.

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated 
notes (the "Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately
22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common shares 
represented by these Notes upon conversion were included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 26, 1998, as the 
effect of using the if-converted method was dilutive for that period. The 
common shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation 
of diluted earnings per share for other periods presented because the effect 
of using the if-converted method for those periods would be anti-dilutive. For 
additional disclosures regarding the outstanding preferred stock, employee 
stock options and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

Note 3 - Restructuring Activities
In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a 
restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring profitability to the 
Company's operations. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased 
demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic 
direction. These actions resulted in a net charge of $179 million after 
subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996. During 1997, the 
Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to 
meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 
million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those 
actions, including approximately $8 million of costs related to the 
termination of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The combined 
restructuring actions consist of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time 
employees, approximately 3,400 of whom have been terminated from the second 
quarter of 1996 through June 26, 1998, excluding employees who were hired by 
SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center 
facility, respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a 
result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing 
various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and 
technologies that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The 
restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $236 
million and noncash asset write-downs of $83 million from the second quarter of 
1996 through June 26, 1998. The Company has periodically made adjustments to 
the categories and timing of expected restructure spending based on revised 
estimates. The Company expects that the remaining $77 million accrued balance 
as of June 26, 1998 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $35 
million over the next three months and $25 million thereafter. The remaining 
contemplated restructuring actions related to the plan will be initiated 
before the end of fiscal 1998 and completed before the end of calendar year 
1998. Remaining restructuring actions are expected to be financed through 
current working capital.

Note 4 - Stock Option Exchange
In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's key 
employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option exchange 
program which allowed employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of 
their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of greater 
than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise price of 
$13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on December 19, 
1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in December 1997.  A 
total of 4.4 million options with a weighted-average exercise price of $20.01 
per share were exchanged for new options as a result of this program.

Note 5 - Equity Investment Gains
As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of ARM 
Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved 
in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The 
Company accounts for this investment using the equity method. On April 17, 
1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London 
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its 
shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 
million which was recognized as other income. Foreign taxes recognized on this 
gain were approximately $7 million. 

At the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common 
stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method 
requires that the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the 
investor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity 
resulting from the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment 


                                       9
<PAGE>
reflecting its share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity 
resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the 
Company also recognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of 
approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in 
the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As 
of June 26, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM was 
approximately $21 million. The fair value of this investment at that date 
based on listed market values was approximately $219 million. The Company is 
subject to a "lock-up" agreement under which it is restricted from selling any 
of its ARM shares before October 16, 1998. The Company will continue to 
account for its investment in ARM using the equity method.

Note 6 - Technology Acquisition
In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under 
development.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of 
purchased in-process research and development which was charged to operations 
upon acquisition.

Note 7 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" which 
establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of software 
revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the Company to modify 
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not 
expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated results of operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities" which establishes accounting and reporting 
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires 
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in 
the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair 
value.  The Statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years 
beginning after June 15, 1999.  Earlier application of the Statement is 
permitted. The Company is still in the process of assessing the impact that the 
Statement will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 8 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the 
Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings 
and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing 
petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax 
adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of 
issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in 
dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations.

Net Sales

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates, 
discounts and price protection. Net sales for the third quarter and first nine 
months of 1998 were $1.402 billion and $4.385 billion, respectively, decreases 
of 19% and 20%, respectively, over the corresponding periods in 1997. The 
decline in net sales is attributable to several factors. The Company has 
experienced a $355 million decrease in net sales of peripheral products between 
the first nine months of 1998 and the same period in 1997 primarily due to the 
discontinuance by the Company of certain imaging and display products. Net 
sales in Asia were adversely affected primarily by the region's current 
economic problems, declining 37% or $476 million during the first nine months 
of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997. The average revenue per Macintosh 
system, a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total 
Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 7% and 6%, respectively, between the third 
quarter and first nine months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods in 
1997, reflecting the effect of aggressive pricing of the Company's Power 
Macintosh G3 systems introduced in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the 
decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral products, and 
the overall industry trend towards lower-priced products. Lastly, overall 
CPU units sales for the comparable nine month periods decreased approximately 
14% from 1997.

Net sales were unchanged in the third quarter of 1998 compared with the second 
quarter of 1998. A slight sequential decrease in unit sales from 650 thousand 
in the second quarter of 1998 to 644 thousand in the third quarter was offset 
by an increase in the average revenue per Macintosh system of 2%. The slight 
overall decline in unit sales is primarily attributable to the lack of 
available consumer oriented products and production capacity constraints 
related to the introduction of new PowerBook G3 systems at the end of the third 
quarter of 1998. The overall product mix continued to shift towards products 
incorporating the Power Macintosh G3 microprocessor. Sales of G3 powered 
Macintosh systems accounted for approximately 84% of Macintosh systems 
shipped during the third quarter of 1998 as compared to 51% of Macintosh 
systems shipped during the prior quarter. Net sales of imaging and display 
products decreased by $25 million to $127 million in the third quarter of 1998 
compared with the prior quarter reflecting the continuing phase-out of most 
imaging and display products.

International sales for the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 1998 
represented 43% and 47%, respectively, of consolidated net sales in each of the 
periods versus 53% for the same periods in 1997. International net sales fell 
35% in the third quarter of 1998 compared with the same period of 1997, 
primarily due to decreased revenue in the European and Japanese markets as a 
result of significant decreases in Macintosh unit sales and the average revenue 
per Macintosh system, partially offset by increases in the average revenue per 
peripheral unit. Overall sales in the European and Japanese markets were 
negatively affected during the current quarter by the lack of available 
consumer oriented products. Sales in Asia were also negatively affected by the 
region's continuing economic problems. Domestic net sales increased slightly 
in the third quarter of 1998 over the comparable period of 1997 due to 

                                       14
<PAGE>

increases in unit sales of Macintosh systems, partially offset by decreases in 
the average revenue per Macintosh system and in peripheral unit sales.

The Company anticipates modest sequential quarterly revenue growth for the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, and year-over-year quarterly revenue growth is 
not expected before the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The foregoing statements 
are forward looking. The Company's actual results could differ because of 
several factors, including those set forth below in the subsection entitled 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition".

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales during the third quarter and 
the first nine months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, 
and increased from the second quarter of 1998 to the third quarter of 1998 
from 25% to 26% of sales. These increases were primarily a result of a shift in 
revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh G3 systems 
and newer PowerBook G3 systems, the unusually low volume of lower margin 
consumer products shipped during the third quarter of 1998, and the continuing 
benefits derived from new distribution channel policies and improved inventory 
management.  

As consumer products become a larger share of the Company's net sales over 
upcoming quarters, management anticipates that gross margins will trend 
down gradually. The foregoing statement is forward looking. The Company's 
actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set 
forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection entitled 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition".

There can be no assurance that anticipated consolidated gross margin levels 
will be achieved or that current margins on existing individual products will 
be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products 
will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, 
including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased 
competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential changes to the 
Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with 
lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these 
downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing 
actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by 
the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty 
costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's 
operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be 
significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 


                                       15
<PAGE>

1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, and remained relatively 
flat in amount and as a percentage of net sales during the third quarter of 
1998 compared with the second quarter of 1998. These reductions on a year-
over-year basis are due to various restructuring actions which resulted in 
reductions in headcount and cancellation of certain research and development 
projects. 

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and during the third 
quarter of 1998 compared to the second quarter of 1998. These decreases are 
due to various restructuring actions which resulted in reductions in 
headcount, the closing of facilities, the write-down of assets, and changes to 
distribution channel policies.

Special Charges

In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under 
development.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of 
purchased in-process research and development which was charged to operations 
upon acquisition.

During the first nine months of 1997, the Company recognized a $375 million 
charge for purchased in-process research and development in connection with the 
acquisition of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT") and a $155 million charge for 
restructuring costs. For further information regarding the Company's 
restructuring actions, see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the Company's 
debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for using the equity 
method, certain foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous 
income and expense items. 

As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of ARM 
Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved 
in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The 
Company accounts for this investment using the equity method. On April 17, 
1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London 
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% 
of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of 
approximately $24 million which was recognized as other income. Foreign taxes 
recognized on this gain were approximately $7 million. The Company also 
recognized other income of approximately $16 million to reflect the increase 
in its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the net book value of ARM 
following its initial public offering.
                                       16

Provision for Income Taxes

As of June 26, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $658 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of June 26, 1998, a valuation allowance of $173 million was recorded against 
the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be 
realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset representing 
tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to 
generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management 
believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, including 
income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, 
will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their expiration 
in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, there can be no 
assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of future U.S. taxable 
income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered 
realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future 
taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially adversely 
affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company will continue 
to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by 
assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Company's 
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 1998 was only 5.6% due 
primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation 
allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes 
were provided.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 
increased to $1,993 million as of June 26, 1998, from $1,459 million as of 
September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of 
June 26, 1998 and September 26, 1997 include $58 million and $165 million, 
respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily 
associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the 1996 
sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. On 
April 24, 1998, SCI notified the Company that certain performance measures 
defined within the letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company. As a 
result, effective as of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount 
pledged as collateral by the Company to support the letter of credit was 
reduced by $100 million to $50 million. Should the Company fail to meet those 
performance measures in the future, it is possible that some or all of the 
letter of credit and supporting collateral would have to be reestablished.

Cash generated by operations during the first nine months of 1998 totaled $452 
million. Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of positive 
earnings and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially 
offset by decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

                                       17
<PAGE>

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $29 
million in the first nine months of 1998, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing equipment and tooling. The Company expects that the level of 
capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 1998 will be consistent with 
those experienced through the first three quarters of 1998.

The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the 
next twelve months. Expected cash requirements over the next twelve months 
include an estimated $60 million to effect actions under the restructuring 
plan, most of which will be effected during 1998. No assurance can be given 
that any additional required financing could be obtained should the 
restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or be 
unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, 
results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected. 

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. As of March 27, 1998, the Company's senior and 
subordinated long-term debt ratings were B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard 
and Poor's Rating Agency, and B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services. In June 1998, Moody's upgraded the Company's senior debt to B2 from 
B3 and subordinated debt to Caa1 from Caa2 citing strengthened debtholder 
protection measurements as the major reason for the upgrade.  At the same time, 
both Moody's and Standard and Poor's revised their outlooks on the Company to 
"positive" due to the Company's improved profitability and financial 
flexibility. Despite these recent upgrades, the Company's non-investment grade 
debt ratings will maintain pressure on the Company's cost of funds in future 
periods and may require the Company to pledge additional collateral or agree to 
more stringent debt covenants.

Year 2000 Compliance

Many currently installed computer systems, software products and other 
equipment utilizing microprocessors are coded to accept only two digit entries 
in the date code field. These date code fields will need to accept four digit 
entries to distinguish twenty-first century dates from twentieth century 
dates.  This is commonly referred to as the "Year 2000 issue". 

The Company is aware of the Year 2000 issue and has commenced a program to 
identify, remediate, test and develop contingency plans for, the Year 2000 
issue (the "Y2K Program"), to be substantially completed by the fall of 1999. 
The Company has established  a Year 2000 Project Management Office which is 
responsible for managing the Y2K Program as it relates to  (1) the software and 
systems used in the Company's internal business; (2)  the Company's software 
and hardware products delivered to customers; and (3) third party vendors, 
manufacturers and suppliers.  The Company currently does not anticipate that 



                                       18
<PAGE>


the cost of the Y2K Program will be material to its financial condition or 
results of operations. Nevertheless, satisfactorily addressing the Year 2000 
issue is dependent on many factors, some of which are not completely within the 
Company's control.  Should the Company's internal systems,  its software and/or 
hardware products to be delivered to customers  or the internal systems of one 
or more significant vendors, manufacturers or suppliers fail to achieve Year 
2000 compliance, the Company's business and its results of operations could be 
adversely affected.

The foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's actual results 
could differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the 
subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition".

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number 
of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In addition 
to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are many 
factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which may 
cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The Company's 
future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the 
Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued competitive 
pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; risks 
associated with international operations, including economic and labor 
conditions,  the continuing economic problems being experienced in Asia, 
political instability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; increasing 
dependence on third-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced 
functions such as logistics; the availability of key components on terms 
acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of certain components 
essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from 
sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by 
and obtained from IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products in 
certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely 
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate the technologies of NeXT, which was acquired in 1997; 
the Company's ability to successfully implement its strategic direction and 
restructuring actions, including reducing its expenditures; the Company's 
ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; the effects of significant 
adverse publicity; the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications; the effect of year 2000 compliance issues; the Company's ability 
to successfully replace its existing transaction systems in the U.S.; and the 
impact on the Company's sales, market share and gross margins as a result of 
the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program.   

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" 
in the Company's 1997 Form 10-K.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, 
the Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal 
proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its 
financial condition or results of operations.

Item 5. Other Information

The Company anticipates holding its annual meeting of shareholders on March 24, 
1999.  Shareholders who intend to present proposals at the next annual meeting 
of shareholders must send such proposals to the Company for receipt no later 
than October 14, 1998 in order for such proposals to be considered for 
inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to such meeting.

        Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation  
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim periods are not 
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These 
financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
for the fiscal year ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report 
on Forms 10-K and 10-K/A for the year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 
Form 10-K").

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128
("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share." In accordance with SFAS 128, primary 
earnings per share has been replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully 
diluted earnings per share has been replaced with diluted earnings per share 
which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and 
convertible securities. Prior periods presented have been presented to conform 
to SFAS 128; however, as the Company had a net loss in those periods, basic 
and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary loss per share 
previously reported.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method. For fiscal years 1997, 1996, 1995, 
1994, and 1993, basic earnings (loss) per share was $(8.29), $(6.59), $3.50, 
$2.63, and $0.74, respectively. For those same fiscal years, there were no 
material differences between amounts previously reported as fully diluted 
earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share calculated in 
accordance with SFAS 128.

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated 
notes (the "Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately
22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common shares 
represented by these Notes upon conversion were included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 26, 1998, as the 
effect of using the if-converted method was dilutive for that period. The 
common shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation 
of diluted earnings per share for other periods presented because the effect 
of using the if-converted method for those periods would be anti-dilutive. For 
additional disclosures regarding the outstanding preferred stock, employee 
stock options and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

Note 3 - Restructuring Activities
In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a 
restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring profitability to the 
Company's operations. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased 
demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic 
direction. These actions resulted in a net charge of $179 million after 
subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996. During 1997, the 
Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to 
meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 
million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those 
actions, including approximately $8 million of costs related to the 
termination of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The combined 
restructuring actions consist of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time 
employees, approximately 3,400 of whom have been terminated from the second 
quarter of 1996 through June 26, 1998, excluding employees who were hired by 
SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center 
facility, respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a 
result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing 
various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and 
technologies that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The 
restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $236 
million and noncash asset write-downs of $83 million from the second quarter of 
1996 through June 26, 1998. The Company has periodically made adjustments to 
the categories and timing of expected restructure spending based on revised 
estimates. The Company expects that the remaining $77 million accrued balance 
as of June 26, 1998 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $35 
million over the next three months and $25 million thereafter. The remaining 
contemplated restructuring actions related to the plan will be initiated 
before the end of fiscal 1998 and completed before the end of calendar year 
1998. Remaining restructuring actions are expected to be financed through 
current working capital.

Note 4 - Stock Option Exchange
In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's key 
employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option exchange 
program which allowed employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of 
their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of greater 
than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise price of 
$13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on December 19, 
1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in December 1997.  A 
total of 4.4 million options with a weighted-average exercise price of $20.01 
per share were exchanged for new options as a result of this program.

Note 5 - Equity Investment Gains
As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of ARM 
Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved 
in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The 
Company accounts for this investment using the equity method. On April 17, 
1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London 
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its 
shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 
million which was recognized as other income. Foreign taxes recognized on this 
gain were approximately $7 million. 

At the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common 
stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method 
requires that the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the 
investor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity 
resulting from the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment 


                                       9
<PAGE>
reflecting its share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity 
resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the 
Company also recognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of 
approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in 
the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As 
of June 26, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM was 
approximately $21 million. The fair value of this investment at that date 
based on listed market values was approximately $219 million. The Company is 
subject to a "lock-up" agreement under which it is restricted from selling any 
of its ARM shares before October 16, 1998. The Company will continue to 
account for its investment in ARM using the equity method.

Note 6 - Technology Acquisition
In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under 
development.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of 
purchased in-process research and development which was charged to operations 
upon acquisition.

Note 7 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" which 
establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of software 
revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the Company to modify 
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not 
expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated results of operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities" which establishes accounting and reporting 
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires 
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in 
the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair 
value.  The Statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years 
beginning after June 15, 1999.  Earlier application of the Statement is 
permitted. The Company is still in the process of assessing the impact that the 
Statement will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 8 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the 
Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings 
and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing 
petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax 
adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of 
issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in 
dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations.

Net Sales

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates, 
discounts and price protection. Net sales for the third quarter and first nine 
months of 1998 were $1.402 billion and $4.385 billion, respectively, decreases 
of 19% and 20%, respectively, over the corresponding periods in 1997. The 
decline in net sales is attributable to several factors. The Company has 
experienced a $355 million decrease in net sales of peripheral products between 
the first nine months of 1998 and the same period in 1997 primarily due to the 
discontinuance by the Company of certain imaging and display products. Net 
sales in Asia were adversely affected primarily by the region's current 
economic problems, declining 37% or $476 million during the first nine months 
of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997. The average revenue per Macintosh 
system, a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total 
Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 7% and 6%, respectively, between the third 
quarter and first nine months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods in 
1997, reflecting the effect of aggressive pricing of the Company's Power 
Macintosh G3 systems introduced in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the 
decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral products, and 
the overall industry trend towards lower-priced products. Lastly, overall 
CPU units sales for the comparable nine month periods decreased approximately 
14% from 1997.

Net sales were unchanged in the third quarter of 1998 compared with the second 
quarter of 1998. A slight sequential decrease in unit sales from 650 thousand 
in the second quarter of 1998 to 644 thousand in the third quarter was offset 
by an increase in the average revenue per Macintosh system of 2%. The slight 
overall decline in unit sales is primarily attributable to the lack of 
available consumer oriented products and production capacity constraints 
related to the introduction of new PowerBook G3 systems at the end of the third 
quarter of 1998. The overall product mix continued to shift towards products 
incorporating the Power Macintosh G3 microprocessor. Sales of G3 powered 
Macintosh systems accounted for approximately 84% of Macintosh systems 
shipped during the third quarter of 1998 as compared to 51% of Macintosh 
systems shipped during the prior quarter. Net sales of imaging and display 
products decreased by $25 million to $127 million in the third quarter of 1998 
compared with the prior quarter reflecting the continuing phase-out of most 
imaging and display products.

International sales for the three and nine month periods ended June 26, 1998 
represented 43% and 47%, respectively, of consolidated net sales in each of the 
periods versus 53% for the same periods in 1997. International net sales fell 
35% in the third quarter of 1998 compared with the same period of 1997, 
primarily due to decreased revenue in the European and Japanese markets as a 
result of significant decreases in Macintosh unit sales and the average revenue 
per Macintosh system, partially offset by increases in the average revenue per 
peripheral unit. Overall sales in the European and Japanese markets were 
negatively affected during the current quarter by the lack of available 
consumer oriented products. Sales in Asia were also negatively affected by the 
region's continuing economic problems. Domestic net sales increased slightly 
in the third quarter of 1998 over the comparable period of 1997 due to 

                                       14
<PAGE>

increases in unit sales of Macintosh systems, partially offset by decreases in 
the average revenue per Macintosh system and in peripheral unit sales.

The Company anticipates modest sequential quarterly revenue growth for the 
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, and year-over-year quarterly revenue growth is 
not expected before the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The foregoing statements 
are forward looking. The Company's actual results could differ because of 
several factors, including those set forth below in the subsection entitled 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition".

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales during the third quarter and 
the first nine months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, 
and increased from the second quarter of 1998 to the third quarter of 1998 
from 25% to 26% of sales. These increases were primarily a result of a shift in 
revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh G3 systems 
and newer PowerBook G3 systems, the unusually low volume of lower margin 
consumer products shipped during the third quarter of 1998, and the continuing 
benefits derived from new distribution channel policies and improved inventory 
management.  

As consumer products become a larger share of the Company's net sales over 
upcoming quarters, management anticipates that gross margins will trend 
down gradually. The foregoing statement is forward looking. The Company's 
actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set 
forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection entitled 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition".

There can be no assurance that anticipated consolidated gross margin levels 
will be achieved or that current margins on existing individual products will 
be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products 
will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, 
including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased 
competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential changes to the 
Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with 
lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these 
downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing 
actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by 
the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty 
costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's 
operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be 
significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 


                                       15
<PAGE>

1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, and remained relatively 
flat in amount and as a percentage of net sales during the third quarter of 
1998 compared with the second quarter of 1998. These reductions on a year-
over-year basis are due to various restructuring actions which resulted in 
reductions in headcount and cancellation of certain research and development 
projects. 

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the third quarter and the first nine months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and during the third 
quarter of 1998 compared to the second quarter of 1998. These decreases are 
due to various restructuring actions which resulted in reductions in 
headcount, the closing of facilities, the write-down of assets, and changes to 
distribution channel policies.

Special Charges

In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under 
development.  The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of 
purchased in-process research and development which was charged to operations 
upon acquisition.

During the first nine months of 1997, the Company recognized a $375 million 
charge for purchased in-process research and development in connection with the 
acquisition of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT") and a $155 million charge for 
restructuring costs. For further information regarding the Company's 
restructuring actions, see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the Company's 
debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for using the equity 
method, certain foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous 
income and expense items. 

As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of ARM 
Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved 
in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The 
Company accounts for this investment using the equity method. On April 17, 
1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London 
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% 
of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of 
approximately $24 million which was recognized as other income. Foreign taxes 
recognized on this gain were approximately $7 million. The Company also 
recognized other income of approximately $16 million to reflect the increase 
in its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the net book value of ARM 
following its initial public offering.
                                       16

Provision for Income Taxes

As of June 26, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $658 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of June 26, 1998, a valuation allowance of $173 million was recorded against 
the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be 
realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset representing 
tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to 
generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management 
believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, including 
income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, 
will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their expiration 
in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, there can be no 
assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of future U.S. taxable 
income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered 
realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future 
taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially adversely 
affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company will continue 
to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by 
assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Company's 
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 1998 was only 5.6% due 
primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation 
allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes 
were provided.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 
increased to $1,993 million as of June 26, 1998, from $1,459 million as of 
September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of 
June 26, 1998 and September 26, 1997 include $58 million and $165 million, 
respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily 
associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the 1996 
sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. On 
April 24, 1998, SCI notified the Company that certain performance measures 
defined within the letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company. As a 
result, effective as of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount 
pledged as collateral by the Company to support the letter of credit was 
reduced by $100 million to $50 million. Should the Company fail to meet those 
performance measures in the future, it is possible that some or all of the 
letter of credit and supporting collateral would have to be reestablished.

Cash generated by operations during the first nine months of 1998 totaled $452 
million. Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of positive 
earnings and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially 
offset by decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

                                       17
<PAGE>

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $29 
million in the first nine months of 1998, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing equipment and tooling. The Company expects that the level of 
capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 1998 will be consistent with 
those experienced through the first three quarters of 1998.

The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the 
next twelve months. Expected cash requirements over the next twelve months 
include an estimated $60 million to effect actions under the restructuring 
plan, most of which will be effected during 1998. No assurance can be given 
that any additional required financing could be obtained should the 
restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or be 
unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, 
results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected. 

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. As of March 27, 1998, the Company's senior and 
subordinated long-term debt ratings were B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard 
and Poor's Rating Agency, and B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services. In June 1998, Moody's upgraded the Company's senior debt to B2 from 
B3 and subordinated debt to Caa1 from Caa2 citing strengthened debtholder 
protection measurements as the major reason for the upgrade.  At the same time, 
both Moody's and Standard and Poor's revised their outlooks on the Company to 
"positive" due to the Company's improved profitability and financial 
flexibility. Despite these recent upgrades, the Company's non-investment grade 
debt ratings will maintain pressure on the Company's cost of funds in future 
periods and may require the Company to pledge additional collateral or agree to 
more stringent debt covenants.

Year 2000 Compliance

Many currently installed computer systems, software products and other 
equipment utilizing microprocessors are coded to accept only two digit entries 
in the date code field. These date code fields will need to accept four digit 
entries to distinguish twenty-first century dates from twentieth century 
dates.  This is commonly referred to as the "Year 2000 issue". 

The Company is aware of the Year 2000 issue and has commenced a program to 
identify, remediate, test and develop contingency plans for, the Year 2000 
issue (the "Y2K Program"), to be substantially completed by the fall of 1999. 
The Company has established  a Year 2000 Project Management Office which is 
responsible for managing the Y2K Program as it relates to  (1) the software and 
systems used in the Company's internal business; (2)  the Company's software 
and hardware products delivered to customers; and (3) third party vendors, 
manufacturers and suppliers.  The Company currently does not anticipate that 



                                       18
<PAGE>


the cost of the Y2K Program will be material to its financial condition or 
results of operations. Nevertheless, satisfactorily addressing the Year 2000 
issue is dependent on many factors, some of which are not completely within the 
Company's control.  Should the Company's internal systems,  its software and/or 
hardware products to be delivered to customers  or the internal systems of one 
or more significant vendors, manufacturers or suppliers fail to achieve Year 
2000 compliance, the Company's business and its results of operations could be 
adversely affected.

The foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's actual results 
could differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the 
subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition".

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number 
of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In addition 
to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are many 
factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which may 
cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The Company's 
future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the 
Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued competitive 
pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; risks 
associated with international operations, including economic and labor 
conditions,  the continuing economic problems being experienced in Asia, 
political instability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; increasing 
dependence on third-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced 
functions such as logistics; the availability of key components on terms 
acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of certain components 
essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from 
sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by 
and obtained from IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products in 
certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely 
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate the technologies of NeXT, which was acquired in 1997; 
the Company's ability to successfully implement its strategic direction and 
restructuring actions, including reducing its expenditures; the Company's 
ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; the effects of significant 
adverse publicity; the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications; the effect of year 2000 compliance issues; the Company's ability 
to successfully replace its existing transaction systems in the U.S.; and the 
impact on the Company's sales, market share and gross margins as a result of 
the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program.   

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" 
in the Company's 1997 Form 10-K.
