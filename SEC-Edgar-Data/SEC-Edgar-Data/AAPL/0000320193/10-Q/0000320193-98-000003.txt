       Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
                             (Unaudited)

1. Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These financial 
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year 
ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 Form 10-K").

2. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
128 ("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share". In accordance with SFAS 128, 
primary earnings per share have been replaced with basic earnings per share, 
and fully diluted earnings per share have been replaced with diluted earnings 
per share which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding 
options and convertible securities. Prior periods have been presented to 
conform to SFAS 128, however, as the Company had a net loss in the prior 
period, basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary 
loss per share previously presented.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is
 reflected using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the 
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except net 
income (loss) and per share amounts):

For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 
of 1998, the Company assumed that all employees exchanged their existing 
options (See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) for 
new options with an exercise price of $13.6875 effective December 15, 1998. 
Therefore, all options outstanding as of December 26, 1997, were included in 
the computation of diluted earnings per share as they were all considered to 
have exercise prices less than $18.05, the average market price of common 
shares during the first quarter of 1998.  However, the effect on dilutive 
earnings per share of approximately 8.5 million of the outstanding options was 
weighted to reflect that they were only considered outstanding and dilutive 
options from December 19, 1997, the date of the Company's option exchange 
offer to its employees, through the end of the quarter. The Company has 
outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the 
"Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately 22.6 
million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common 
shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share because the effect of using the if-converted method 
would be anti-dilutive. For additional disclosures regarding the outstanding 
preferred stock, employee stock options and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

3.  In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations. The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for the Company's products and the 
Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a 
net charge of $179 million after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 1996. During 1997, the Company announced and began to 
implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives 
of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 million charge during 1997 for 
the estimated incremental costs of those actions, including approximately $8 
million of costs related to the termination of the Company's former Chief 
Executive Officer. The combined restructuring actions consist of terminating 
approximately 3,600 full-time employees, approximately 3,000 of whom have 
been terminated from the second quarter of 1996 through December 26, 1997, 
excluding employees who were hired by SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI 
Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's Fountain, Colorado 
manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center facility, 
respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of 
those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing 
various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and 
technologies that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The 
restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $195 
million and noncash asset write-downs of $57 million from the second quarter 
of 1996 through December 26, 1997. During the third quarter of 1997 
and the first quarter of 1998, the Company made adjustments to the categories 
and timing of expected restructure spending based on revised estimates. The 
Company expects that the remaining $144 million accrued balance as of 
December 26, 1997 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $102 
million over the next twelve months and $10 million thereafter. The 
Company expects that most of the contemplated restructuring actions related to 
the plan will be completed during fiscal 1998 and will be financed through 
current working capital and, if necessary, continued short-term borrowings.

4.	In August 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets of 
Power Computing Corporation ("PCC"), a company which Apple had licensed 
to distribute the Mac OS operating system. In addition to the acquisition of 
certain assets such as PCC's customer database and the license to 
distribute the Mac OS, the Company has the right to retain certain key 
employees of PCC. The agreement with PCC also includes a release of claims 
between the parties.

	On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of 
certain assets of PCC. The total purchase price was approximately $115 
million, which included 4,159,000 shares of the Company's common stock 
valued at $80 million, the forgiveness of approximately $28 million of 
receivables due from PCC, assumption by the Company of certain 
customer support liabilities of PCC, and closing and related costs. The 
difference between the total purchase price and the $75 million expensed as 
"Termination of License Agreement" in the fourth quarter of 1997 will be 
capitalized in the second quarter of 1998 and then amortized over a period of 
three years.

5.	In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's 
key employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option 
exchange program which permits employees to exchange all (but not less than 
all) of their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of 
greater than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise 
price of $13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on 
December 19, 1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in 
December 1997.

6.	In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue 
Recognition." SOP 97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all 
aspects of software revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered 
into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the 
Company to modify certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The 
Company does not expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact 
on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

7.	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies 
by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in 
dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income 
tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial 
number of issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still 
remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes 
that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from 
tax examinations.

incorporated by reference.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking 
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results 
may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking 
statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not 
limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May 
Affect Operating Results and Financial Condition" below. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this 
Form 10-Q. All information is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. 

Overview

During the first quarter of 1998 the Company experienced significant 
improvement in its financial performance, reporting its first operating profit 
since the fourth quarter of 1996 and earning higher gross margins than in both 
the previous quarter and the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses 
were substantially lower than in the previous quarter and the same 
quarter from the prior year, reflecting reductions in all functional areas of 
the Company as a result of continued restructuring actions. However, both net 
sales and unit sales of Macintosh computer systems fell slightly from the 
previous quarter and fell substantially from the same quarter in the prior 
year. The second quarter has historically been the weakest for the Company.  
Therefore, sequential revenue growth is not expected until at least the third 
quarter, while year-over-year revenue growth is not expected until at least 
the fourth quarter. The Company believes that gross margin levels on its 
current products are sustainable for several quarters and that operating 
expenses will continue to trend downward through the third quarter.  The 
foregoing statements are forward looking.  The Company's actual results could 
differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the following 
paragraph, and those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May 
Affect Operating Results and Financial Condition" below.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent 
upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued 
competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by 
the Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the
Company; the availability of key components on terms acceptable to the 
Company; the Company's ability to supply products in certain categories; the 
Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or other faults;
the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of 
technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely 
delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and to make timely 
delivery of a new and substantially backward-compatible operating system; the 
Company's ability to successfully integrate the technologies, processes and 
employees of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT") ,which was acquired by the Company 
in 1997, with those at Apple; the Company's ability to successfully implement 
its strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees, 
including a new Chief Executive Officer; the effects of significant adverse 
publicity; the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications; and the impact on the Company's sales, market share and gross 
margins as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program.

Net Sales

Q1 98 Compared with Q1 97

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates and 
discounts. Net sales decreased 26% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the same quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral 
unit sales decreased 31% and 49%, respectively, in the first quarter of 
1998, compared with the same period of 1997. The effect on net sales of this 
decline in computer and peripheral unit sales in the first quarter of 1998 was 
partially offset by the successful introduction of the Company's Power 
Macintosh G3 systems in November 1997, which accounted for approximately 
21% of the 635,000 systems shipped during the first quarter of 1998. The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased 6% in the first quarter 
of 1998, compared with the same period of 1997, as a result of a shift in mix 
from the Company's "Value" (entry level Power Macintosh) products to its 
"Flagship" line of high-performance Power Macintosh computers and due to 
increases in the average aggregate revenue across all product lines. In 
general, the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit and per 
peripheral unit is expected to remain under significant downward pressure due 
to a variety of factors, including industry wide pricing pressures, increased 
competition, and the need to stimulate demand for the Company's products. 

International net sales represented 50% of total net sales in the first quarter
 of 1998 compared with 56% of total net sales in the same period of 1997. 
International net sales declined 34% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the same period of 1997. Net sales decreased significantly in the European and 
Japanese markets during the first quarter of 1998 compared with the same 
period of 1997 as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit 
sales. Further discussion relating to factors contributing to the decline in
net sales in the Japanese market may be found in this Part I, Item 2 of Form 
10-Q

                                  10
<PAGE>


under the subheading "Global Market Risks" included under the heading 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which 
information is hereby incorporated by reference. 

Domestic net sales declined 16% in the first quarter of 1998 over the 
comparable period of 1997, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products, partially offset by increases in the average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit. 

During the first quarter of 1998 compared with the comparable period of 1997, 
the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer 
markets decreased to 2.6% from 4.3%, and to 3.3% from 5.2%, respectively, 
based upon current market information provided by industry sources. 

The Company believes that quarterly net sales will be below the level of the 
prior year's comparable periods through at least the third fiscal quarter of
1998, if not longer. 

Q1 98 Compared with Q4 97

Net sales decreased 2% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth 
quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 4% in the first 
quarter of 1998 compared with the prior quarter. The effect on net sales of 
this decline in unit sales was partially offset by the successful introduction 
of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems in November 1997, which accounted 
for approximately 21% of the 635,000 systems shipped during the first quarter 
of 1998. In addition, net sales were positively impacted as the Company began 
marketing many of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the 
Company's on-line store, which opened in November 1997. The Company 
generated $15 million in revenue from its on-line store during the first 
quarter of 1998. Unit sales of peripheral products decreased 15% in the first 
quarter of 1998 compared with the prior quarter. The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh computer unit increased 5% as a result of a shift in mix 
from the Company's "Value" products to its "Flagship" line of high-
performance Power Macintosh computers and due to increases in the average 
aggregate revenue across most other product lines.

International net sales represented 50% of total net sales in the first 
quarter of 1998, compared with 42% in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
International net sales increased 16% in the first quarter of 1998 compared 
with the fourth quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of increases in 
Macintosh and peripheral unit net sales in Europe and increases in net sales 
of Macintosh units in Japan.

Domestic net sales decreased 16% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the prior quarter due to decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, 
slightly offset by increases in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh 
and peripheral unit. 

During the first quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth quarter of 1997, the 
Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer 
markets decreased to 2.6% from 3.3%, and to 3.3% from 4.6%, respectively, 
based upon current market information provided by industry sources. 

Backlog

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any 
particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business 
prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or 
immediately following introduction of new products because of overordering 
by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and 
customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, 
as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not 
be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any 
particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information 
regarding the Company's backlog may be found in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 
10-Q under the subheading "Product Introductions and Transitions" included

Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales and its 
cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of 
components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor costs. The type and cost of 
components included in particular configurations of the Company's products 
(such as memory and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to 
market products in configurations competitive with other manufacturers. 
Competition in the personal computer industry is intense and, in the short 
term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often 
necessary in order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by 
actions undertaken by the Company in response to industry wide competitive 
pressures. 

Gross margin increased from 18.6% to 22.4% of sales during the first quarter 
of 1998 compared to the same period of 1997, and increased from 19.8% to 
22.4% of sales compared to the fourth quarter of 1997. This was primarily as a 
result of a shift in revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin 
"Flagship" line of high-performance Power Macintosh computers, including 
Power Macintosh G3 systems, with relatively stable margins quarter-to-quarter 
on the Company's "Value" product line.

The gross margin levels in the first quarter of 1998 compared to the fourth 
quarter of 1997 were not significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange 
rates. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes 
in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations 
can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates. 

While the Company believes the overall gross margin levels achieved in the 
first quarter of 1998 are sustainable for several quarters, there can be no 
assurance that such margins will be maintained. In general, gross margins will 
remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, 
including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased 
competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential changes to the 
Company's product mix. In response to these downward pressures, the 
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its 
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to 
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate 
demand for certain of its products.

research and development related projects. 

The Company believes that continued and focused investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the 
marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new 
and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business 
strategy. The Company anticipates that research and development expenditures 
in the second quarter of 1998 will be comparable to those in the first quarter.

The Company anticipates that selling, general and administrative expenditures 
will decline further during the second quarter of 1998 as compared to the first

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the 
Company's debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for 
using the equity method, foreign exchange gains and losses not allowed 
to be recognized as revenue or cost of sales, and other 
miscellaneous income and expense items. Over the last two 
years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. The Company's cost of funds may 
increase in future periods as a result of the downgrading in the 
second quarter of 1997 of its senior and subordinated long-term 
debt to B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services, and the downgrading in October 1997 of its senior 
and subordinated long-term debt to B- and CCC, respectively, 
by Standard and Poor's Rating Agency. 

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes

As of December 26, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets 
arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and 
tax credits of $696 million before being offset against certain 
deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's 
balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable 
based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of December 26, 1997, a valuation allowance of $211 
million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the 
benefits of tax losses which may not be realized. Realization 
of approximately $85 million of the asset representing tax loss 
and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability 
to generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable 
income. Management believes that it is more likely than not 
that forecasted U.S. income, including income that may be 
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be 
sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their 
expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will 
meet its expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the 
amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be 
reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future taxable 
U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. 
The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the 
deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and 
amount of the valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

Restructuring of Operations

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain 
restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, 
improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustainable 
profitability. During 1997, the Company announced and began 
to implement supplemental restructuring actions, including 
significant headcount reductions, to meet the foregoing 
objectives. There are several risks inherent in the Company's 
efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These include the 
risk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures 
quickly enough to restore sustainable profitability and the risk 
that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability 
to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry. 

Implementation of this restructuring involves several risks, 
including the risk that by simplifying and modifying its product 
line the Company will increase its dependence on fewer 
products, potentially reduce overall sales, and increase its 
reliance on unproven products and technology. Another risk of 
the restructuring is that by increasing the proportion of the 
Company's products to be manufactured under outsourcing 
arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality or 
quantity of the products manufactured and distributed, or lose 
the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules 
in order to respond to changing market conditions. As part of 
its restructuring, the Company announced and opened its on-
line store in November 1997, which makes available most of 
its products to end-users in the U.S. There can be no assurance 
the on-line store will result in greater sales. The Company also 
began manufacturing products on a build-to-order basis in 
November 1997. There can be no assurance this manufacturing 
process will result in decreased costs or increased gross margins. 
The Company is also reducing the number of wholesale and 
retail channel partners, particularly in the Americas, which 
places a greater volume of sales through fewer partners. There 
can be no assurance that this will not adversely impact the 
Company. In addition, the actions taken in connection with the 
restructuring could adversely affect employee morale, thereby 
damaging the Company's ability to retain and motivate 
employees. Also, because the Company contemplates relying 
to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements 
with third parties, the Company will have less direct control 
over certain of its research and development efforts, and its 
ability to create innovative new products may be reduced. In 
addition, there can be no assurance that the technologies 
acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key 
NeXT employees and processes will be retained and successfully 
integrated with those at Apple. Also, the restructuring includes 
the winding down of the Company's Mac OS licensing 
program. There can be no assurance that the winding down of 
this program will result in greater sales, market share, and 
increased gross margins to the Company. In addition, there can 
be no assurance that this action will not result in the 
availability of fewer application software titles for the Mac OS, 
which may result in a decrease to the Company's sales, market 
share and gross margins. Finally, even if the restructuring is 
successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will 
effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the 
Company. Although the Company believes that the actions it 
is taking in connection with the restructuring, including its 
acquisition of NeXT and the winding down of its Mac OS 
licensing program, should help restore marketplace confidence 
in the Company, there can be no assurance that such actions 
will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing 
its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring 
sustainable profitability. The Company's future consolidated 
operating results and financial condition could be adversely 
affected should it encounter difficulty in effectively managing 
the restructuring and new cost structure. 

Additional information relating to the restructuring of 
operations may be found in Part I of this Form 10-Q in Note 3 
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Unaudited), which information is hereby incorporated by 
reference. 

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer 
industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand 
patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must 
continuously introduce new products and technologies and 
enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. 
Recent introductions include certain PowerBook and Power 
Macintosh products, including the Power Macintosh G3 
computers in November 1997, and the introduction of Mac OS 
8 in July 1997. The success of new product introductions is 
dependent on a number of 

                                  14
<PAGE>


factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to 
manage the risks associated with product transitions, the 
availability of application software for new products, the 
effective management of inventory levels in line with 
anticipated product demand, the availability of products in 
appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk 
that new products may have quality or other defects in the early 
stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot 
determine the effect that new products will have on its sales or 
results of operations. In addition, although the number of new 
product introductions may decrease as a result of the Company's 
restructuring actions, the risks and uncertainties associated with 
new product introductions may increase as the Company 
refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments and to 
the extent new product introductions are in markets that are new 
to the Company. 

The rate of product shipments immediately following 
introduction of a new product is not necessarily an indication of 
the future rate of shipments for that product, which depends on 
many factors, some of which are not under the control of the 
Company. These factors may include initial large purchases by 
a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase 
new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users 
("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand 
by users who anticipated new technology and, as a result, 
deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by dealers 
who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. 
These factors may be offset by others, such as the deferral of 
purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as 
"proven" and for which commonly used software products are 
available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once they 
believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously 
in backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to 
the aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident 
with introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and 
customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of the new 
products. The Company has in the past experienced difficulty in 
anticipating demand for new products, resulting in product 
shortages which have adversely affected the Company's 
operating results. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is 
further complicated by the availability of different product 
configurations, which may include various types of built-in 
peripherals and software. Configurations may also require 
certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, 
as a result, demand in different geographic areas may be a 
function of the availability of third-party software in those 
localized versions. For example, the availability of European-
language versions of software products manufactured by U.S. 
producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions by a 
quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the 
Company's new products outside the U.S., even though 
localized versions of the Company's products may be available. 

The increasing integration of new or enhanced functions and 
complexity of operations of the Company's products also 
increase the risk that latent defects or other faults could be 
discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products 
have been produced or shipped. If such defects were significant, 
the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs 
under product warranties. 

The Company has announced plans for two operating systems. 
The Company plans to continue to introduce major upgrades to 
the current Mac OS and later introduce a new operating system 
(code named "Rhapsody") which is expected to offer advanced 
functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. 
However, the NeXT software technologies that the Company 
plans to use in the development of Rhapsody were not 
originally designed to be compatible with the Mac OS. As a 
result, there can be no assurance that the development of 
Rhapsody can be completed at reasonable cost or at all. In 
addition, Rhapsody may not be fully backward-compatible with 
all existing applications, which could result in a loss of 
existing customers. Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody 
or the planned enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain 
developer support and market acceptance. Inability to 
successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially 
backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to 
the current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market 
acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse 
impact on the Company's consolidated operating results and 
financial condition. 

                                  15

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure 
on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short 
product life cycles, continual improvement in product 
price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of 
consumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's 
consolidated results of operations and financial condition have 
been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by 
industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on 
gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid 
technological advances in software functionality and hardware 
performance and features based on existing or emerging industry 
standards. Many of the Company's competitors have greater 
financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological 
resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed 
customer bases than those of the Company. 

The Company's future consolidated operating results and 
financial condition may be affected by overall demand for 
personal computers and general customer preferences for one 
platform over another or one set of product features over 
another. 

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that 
uses the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in 
the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of 
computers that run the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 
NT operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac 
OS, with its perceived advantages over Windows, and the 
general reluctance of the Macintosh installed base to incur the 
costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind 
sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the past 
several years. Recent innovations in the Windows platform, 
including those included in Windows 95 and Windows NT, or 
those expected to be included in a new version of Windows to 
be introduced in 1998, have added features to the Windows 
platform that make the differences between the Mac OS and 
Microsoft's Windows operating systems less significant. The 
Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to 
respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its 
personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in 
the Windows platform. The Company's future consolidated 
operating results and financial condition will be substantially 
dependent on its ability to maintain continuing improvements 
to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived 
functional advantages over competing platforms. 

The Company had previously entered into agreements to license 
its Mac OS to other personal computer vendors (the "Clone 
Vendors") as part of an effort to increase the installed base for 
the Macintosh platform. The Company recently determined that 
the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors 
under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and 
costs of the licensing program. As a result, the Company 
agreed to acquire certain assets, including the license to 
distribute the Mac OS, of PCC, a Clone Vendor, and has no 
plans to renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements. 
Although the Company believes that this winding down of its 
licensing program will help reduce the adverse impact of the 
licensing program on the Company's sales, market share and 
gross margins, there can be no assurance that this will occur. In 
addition, there can be no assurance that this winding down of 
the licensing program will not result in the availability of fewer 
application software titles for the Mac OS, which may result in 
a decrease to the Company's sales, market share and gross 
margins. 

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from 
Windows and other platforms, the Company had previously 
devoted substantial resources toward developing personal 
computer products capable of running application software 
designed for the Windows operating systems. These products 
include an add-on card containing a Pentium or 586-class 
microprocessor that enables users to run applications 
concurrently that require the Mac OS, Windows 3.1 or 
Windows 95 operating systems. The Company plans to 
transition the cross-platform business to third-parties during 
1998. There can be no assurance that this transition will be 
successful. 

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation 
and Motorola, Inc. had agreed upon and announced the 
availability of specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-
based hardware platform (the "Platform"). These specifications 
defined a "unified" personal computer architecture that would 
have given the Clone Vendors broad access to the Power 
Macintosh platform and would have utilized standard industry 
components. The Company had intended to license the Mac OS 
to manufacturers of the Platform. However, the Company has 
decided it will no longer support the Platform based upon its 
decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing program, and 
because of 

                                  16
<PAGE>


little industry support for the Platform. The decision not to 
further develop this Platform may affect the Company's ability 
to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform. 

Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or 
announced their intention to target certain of the Company's 
key market segments, including education and publishing. 
Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, 
manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company. 

In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into 
patent cross licensing and technology agreements. Under these 
agreements, the companies provided patent cross licenses to 
each other. In addition, for a period of five years from August 
1997, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft 
Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS, and the 
Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac 
OS system software releases and make that product the default 
Internet browser for such releases. In addition, Microsoft 
purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series 'A' non-voting 
convertible preferred stock for $150 million. While the 
Company believes that its relationship with Microsoft will be 
beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the 
installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for 
a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which 
the Company competes with Microsoft, including the Windows 
platform. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an 
adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's 
relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance that 
the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will 
not be offset by the disadvantages. 

Support from Third-Party Software Developers

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal 
computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often 
based on the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications. The Company believes that the availability of 
third-party application software for the Company's hardware 
products depends in part on third-party developers' perception 
and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, 
and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus 
software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based 
on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and 
its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be 
generated, and the costs of developing such software products. 
To the extent the Company's recent financial losses and 
declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the 
Company's decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing 
program, have caused software developers to question the 
Company's prospects in the personal computer market, 
developers could be less inclined to develop new application 
software or upgrade existing software for the Company's 
products and more inclined to devote their resources to 
developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows 
market. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce a 
new operating system (code named "Rhapsody") could cause 
software developers to stop developing software for the current 
Mac OS. In addition, there can be no assurance that software 
developers will decide to develop software for the new operating 
system on a timely basis or at all. 

Microsoft is an important developer of application software for 
the Company's products. Although the Company has entered 
into a relationship with Microsoft, which includes Microsoft's 
agreement to develop and ship future versions of its Microsoft 
Office and Internet Explorer products and certain other Microsoft 
tools for the Mac OS, such relationship is for a limited term 
and does not cover many areas in which the Company competes 
with Microsoft. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing 
application software for the Mac OS not covered by the 
relationship or upon expiration of the relationship may be 
influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the 
vendor of the Windows operating system. 

Global Market Risks

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's 
consolidated operations and financial results could be 
significantly affected by risks associated with international 
activities, including economic and labor conditions, political 
instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign 
subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus 
the local currency in which the products are sold. 

Countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have 
recently experienced weaknesses in their currency, banking and 
equity markets. These weaknesses could adversely affect 
consumer demand for the Company's products, 


                                  17
<PAGE>


the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency 
denominated sales, the availability and supply of product 
components to the Company, and ultimately the Company's 
consolidated results of operations. 

When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the 
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. 
When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-
U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. 
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the 
U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar 
strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net receiver of 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from 
a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar 
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in 
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales 
and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in 
the interest rates of many of the world's leading industrialized 
countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most 
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest 
rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the 
interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign 
currency hedges. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. 
interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap, 
collar, and floor transactions. 

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's 
foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to 
monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, 
the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward 
and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor 
positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with 
its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related 
exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an 
economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of 
the Company's risk management activities, there can be no 
assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more 
than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from 
unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest 
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition 
of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for 
any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and 
losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, 
therefore, may adversely affect the Company's consolidated 
operating results and financial position. The Company does not 
engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition may increase the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of 
the hedging transactions into which the Company's 
counterparties are willing to enter.

The Company makes a provision for inventories of products 
that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated 
demand, accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for 
inventories that have been canceled, and accrues for the 
estimated costs to correct any product quality problems. 
Although the Company believes its inventory and related 
provisions are adequate given the rapid and unpredictable pace of 
product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can 
be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory 
and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may 
again have, a material effect on the Company's consolidated 
financial position and results of operations. 

The Company must order components for its products and build 
inventory well in advance of product shipments. Because the 
Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology 
and price changes, there is a risk that the Company will forecast 
incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of 
particular products. The Company's consolidated operating 
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in 
the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's 
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term 
shifts in customer demand patterns. 

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole 
or in part by third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design 
specifications of the Company or otherwise. As part of its 
restructuring actions, the Company sold its Fountain, 
Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI and entered into a 
related manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI; sold its 
Singapore printed circuit board manufacturing assets to NatSteel 
Electronics Pte., Ltd., which is 

                                  18
<PAGE>


expected to supply main logic boards to the Company under a 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement; entered into an 
agreement with Ryder Integrated Logistics, Inc. to outsource the 
Company's domestic operations transportation and logistics 
management; and has entered into other similar agreements to 
outsource the Company's European operations transportation 
and logistics management. As a result of the foregoing actions, 
the proportion of the Company's products produced and 
distributed under outsourcing arrangements will continue to 
increase. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed 
cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the 
Company has over production and distribution. It is uncertain 
what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or 
quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the 
Company to respond to changing market conditions. 
Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its 
inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the 
Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the 
arrangement. Moreover, although arrangements with such 
manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense 
reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially 
responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. 
Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty 
liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any 
unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether 
pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or 
otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future 
consolidated operating results and financial condition. 

Although certain components essential to the Company's 
business are generally available from multiple sources, other 
key components (including microprocessors and application 
specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by 
the Company from single sources. If the supply of a key 
single-sourced component were to be delayed or curtailed, the 
Company's business and financial performance could be 
adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain 
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and 
obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The 
Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the 
personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs 
presents the most significant potential for constraining the 
Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced 
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for 
production and thus have limited availability. The Company 
and other producers in the personal computer industry also 
compete for other semiconductor products with other industries 
that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to 
either increased consumer demand or increased use of 
semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and 
automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some 
components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry (including certain microprocessors and 
ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be 
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the 
production of common components instead of components 
customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product 
supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could 
decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the 
Company's consolidated operating results and financial 
condition. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive 
products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and 
Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC 
microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to 
supply to the Company in adequate numbers microprocessors 
that produce superior price/performance results compared with 
those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel 
Corporation, and other developers and producers of the 
microprocessors used by most personal computers using the 
Windows operating systems. The desire of IBM and Motorola 
to continue producing these microprocessors may be influenced 
by Microsoft's decision not to adapt its Windows NT operating 
system software to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. IBM 
produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as 
well as workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, 
and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating 
system to the Company's Mac OS. Accordingly, IBM's interest 
in supplying the Company with microprocessors for the 
Company's products may be influenced by IBM's perception of 
its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers 
and as a competing operating system vendor. In addition, 
Motorola has recently announced its intention to stop producing 
Macintosh clones. As a result, Motorola may be less inclined 
to continue to produce PowerPC microprocessors. 

The Company's current financial condition and uncertainties 
related to recent events could affect the terms on which 
suppliers are willing to supply the Company with their 
products. There can be no assurance that the Company's current 
suppliers will continue to supply the Company on terms 
acceptable to the Company or that the Company will be able to 
obtain comparable products from alternate sources on such 
terms. The Company's future consolidated operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company 
is unable to continue to obtain key components on terms 
substantially similar to those currently available to the 
Company. 

                                  19

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and 
distribution of the Company's products. Currently, the 
Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, 
mass merchants, and cataloguers (collectively referred to as 
"resellers") and direct to higher education institutions. In 
addition, in November 1997 the Company began selling many 
of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the 
Company's on-line store. Many of the Company's significant 
resellers operate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers 
also distribute products from competing manufacturers. The 
Company's business and financial results could be adversely 
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened or 
if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not to 
continue to distribute the Company's products. 

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may 
continue to cause resellers to reduce their ordering and 
marketing of the Company's products. In addition, the 
Company has in the past and may in the future experience 
delays in ordering by resellers in light of uncertain demand for 
the Company's products. Under the Company's arrangements 
with its resellers, resellers have the option to reduce or 
eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances 
without financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to 
return products to the Company without penalty within certain 
limits, beyond which they may be assessed fees. The Company 
has recently revised its channel program, including decreasing 
the number of resellers and reducing returns, price protection 
and certain rebate programs, in an effort to reduce channel 
inventory, increase inventory turns, increase product support 
within the channel and improve gross margins. In addition, in 
November 1997 the Company opened its on-line store in the 
U.S. which makes many of the Company's products available 
directly to the end-user. Although the Company believes the 
foregoing changes will improve its consolidated operating 
results and financial condition, there can be no assurance that 
this will occur. 

Change in Senior Management

On July 9, 1997, the Company announced that Dr. Gilbert F. 
Amelio had resigned his positions as Chairman of the Board and 
Chief Executive Officer and that the Company was initiating a 
search for a new Chief Executive Officer. While the Company 
intends to name a new Chief Executive Officer as soon as 
practicable, there can be no assurance that the change in senior 
management and related uncertainties will not adversely affect 
the Company's consolidated operating results and financial 
condition during the period until a new Chief Executive Officer 
is hired and afterward. In addition, certain members of the 
Company's senior management have been with the Company 
for less than twelve months. There can be no assurance that 
new members of the management team can be successfully 
assimilated, that the Company will be able to satisfactorily 
allocate responsibilities or that such new members of its 
management will succeed in their roles in a timely and efficient 
manner. The Company's failure to recruit, retain and assimilate 
new executives, or the failure of any such executive to perform 
effectively, or the loss of any such executive, could have a 
material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 

Changes to Board of Directors

The Company announced on August 6, 1997 significant 
changes to its Board of Directors, replacing all but two former 
directors. The continuing directors are Gareth C.C. Chang, 
Corporate Senior Vice President, Marketing, Hughes 
Electronics and President, Hughes International, and Edgar S. 
Woolard, Jr., retired Chairman of E.I. DuPont de Nemours & 
Company. The new directors are William V. Campbell, 
President and CEO of Intuit Corp.; Lawrence J. Ellison, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oracle Corp.; Steven 
P. Jobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pixar 
Animation Studios; and Jerome B. York, Vice Chairman of 
Tracinda Corporation and former Chief Financial Officer of IBM 
and Chrysler Corporation. 

Dependence on Key Employees

During the past several years, the Company has experienced 
significant voluntary employee turnover as a result of 
employees' concerns over the Company's prospects, as well as 
the abundance of career opportunities available elsewhere. The 
Company is dependent on its key employees in order to achieve 
its business plan. There can be no assurance the Company will 
be able to attract, motivate and retain key employees. Failure to 
do so may have a significant effect on the Company's 
consolidated operating results and financial condition. 
                                  20
<PAGE>


Other Factors

The Company is in the process of identifying operating and 
application software challenges related to the year 2000. While 
the Company expects to resolve year 2000 compliance issues 
substantially through normal replacement and upgrades of 
software, there can be no assurance that there will not be 
interruption of operations or other limitations of system 
functionality or that the Company will not incur substantial 
costs to avoid such limitations. Any failure to effectively 
monitor, implement or improve the Company's operational, 
financial, management and technical support systems could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and 
consolidated results of operations. 

The majority of the Company's research and development 
activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business 
operations, including certain major vendors, are located near 
major seismic faults. The Company's consolidated operating 
results and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected in the event of a major earthquake. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and 
countries may subject the Company to environmental and other 
regulations which include, in some instances, the requirement 
that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return 
to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave 
responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling 
with the Company. It is unclear what effect such regulations 
will have on the Company's future consolidated operating 
results and financial condition. 

The Company recently decided to replace its existing transaction 
systems in the U.S. (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated 
system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational 
efficiency. Substantially all of the transaction systems in the 
European operations were replaced with the same integrated 
system in 1997. The Company's future consolidated operating 
results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the 
Company is unable to implement and effectively manage the 
transition to this new integrated system. 

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors 
affecting the Company's consolidated operating results and 
financial condition, past financial performance should not be 
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or 
trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's 
participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in 
significant volatility of the Company's common stock price. 

                                      21

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's consolidated financial position with respect to 
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 
$1,627 million as of December 26, 1997, from $1,459 million 
as of September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash 
equivalent balances as of December 26, 1997 and September 26, 
1997 include $164 million and $165 million, respectively, 
pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily 
associated with the Company's purchase commitments under 
the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash generated by operations during the first quarter of 1998 
totaled $143 million. Cash generated by operations was 
primarily the result of positive earnings and decreases in 
accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by  
decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment 
totaled $7 million in the first quarter of 1998, and consisted 
primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and 
equipment. The Company expects that the level of capital 
expenditures in the second quarter of 1998 will increase slightly 
as compared to the first quarter.

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been 
downgraded to non-investment grade. In October 1997, the 
Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt were 
downgraded to B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency. The Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt ratings by Moody's Investor Services remain 
unchanged from the second quarter of 1997, when they were 
downgraded to B3 and Caa2, respectively. Both Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency and Moody's Investor Services have the 
Company on negative outlook. These actions may increase the 
Company's cost of funds in future periods. In addition, the 
Company may be required to pledge additional collateral with 
respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to 
agree to more stringent covenants than in the past. 

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash 
equivalents and short-term investments, and continued short-
term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash 
requirements over the next twelve months. Expected cash 
requirements over the next twelve months include an estimated 
$102 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, 
most of which will be effected during fiscal 1998. No assurance 
can be given that any additional required financing could be 
obtained should the restructuring plan take longer to implement 
than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable 
to obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, and 
financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal 
income tax deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and 
the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. The 
Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions 
with the U.S. Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed 
income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. 
Although a substantial number of the issues for these years 
have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are 
being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp et al.
In January 1996, a purported shareholder class action styled 
Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp et. al was 
filed in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County 
naming the Company and its then directors as defendants. The 
complaint sought injunctive relief and damages and alleged that 
acts of mismanagement resulted in a depressed price for the 
Company. In February 1996, the complaint was amended to add 
a former director as a defendant and to add purported class and 
derivative claims based on theories such as breach of fiduciary 
duty, misrepresentation, and insider trading. In July 1996, the 
Court sustained defendants' demurrer and dismissed the amended 
complaint on a variety of grounds and granted plaintiffs leave to 
amend the complaint. In October 1996, the plaintiffs filed a 
second amended complaint naming the Company's then 
directors and certain former directors as defendants and again 
alleging purported class and derivative claims, seeking 
injunctive relief and damages (compensatory and punitive) based 
on theories such as breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation, 
and insider trading. In July 1997, the Court granted in part and 
denied in part the Company's motion to strike most of the 
substantive allegations of the second amended complaint. The 
Court sustained the demurrer to plaintiffs' class claims but 
overruled the demurrer to the shareholder derivative claims. In 
September 1997, the Company brought a motion to reconsider 
portions of the court order. The Third Amended Complaint 
was filed in October 1997, and eliminated the class action 
claims and restated claims against certain directors and former 
directors. In November 1997, the Company's Board of Directors 
appointed a special investigation committee and engaged 
independent counsel to assist in the investigation of the claims 
made in the Third Amended Complaint. Also in November 
1997, the Company filed a demurrer to the Third Amended 
Complaint. A hearing is set for February 1998.

LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et al.
In May 1996, an action was filed in the California Superior 
Court for Alameda County naming as defendants the Company 
and certain of its current and former officers and directors. The 
complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and 
generally alleges that the defendants misrepresented or omitted 
material facts about the Company's operations and financial 
results, which plaintiff contends artificially inflated the price of 
the Company's stock. The case was transferred to the California 
Superior Court for Santa Clara County. In July 1997, the 
Court sustained the Company's demurrer dismissing the 
amended complaint with leave to amend, after which plaintiff 
served a second amended complaint. In September 1997, the 
Company and the two remaining individual defendants (former 
directors Markkula and Spindler) brought a motion to dismiss 
the second amended complaint. In October 1997, the Court 
granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety with leave to 
amend as to certain defendants and claims. In November 1997, 
the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, adding a former 
director as a defendant and alleging further misrepresentations by 
the defendants about the Company's operations and financial 
results. In January 1998, the Company and the three individual 
defendants brought a motion to dismiss the third amended 
complaint, which is set for hearing in February 1998.

"Repetitive Stress Injury" Litigation
The Company is named in approximately 60 lawsuits, alleging 
that plaintiffs incurred so-called "repetitive stress" injuries to 
their upper extremities as a result of using keyboards and/or 
mouse input devices sold by the Company. These actions are 
similar to those filed against other major suppliers of personal 
computers. In October 1996, the Company prevailed in the first 
full trial to go to verdict against the Company. Since then, 
approximately ten lawsuits have been dismissed with prejudice 
by the plaintiffs, and two others have been dismissed by court 
order. The remaining actions are in various stages of pretrial 
activity. Ultimate resolution of these cases may depend on 
industry-wide progress in resolving similar litigation, as well as 
on the impact of the recent decision handed down by the New 
York Court of Appeals in the case of Blanco v. American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co. (a majority of the cases naming 
the Company as a defendant were filed in New York, and are 
subject to the decision). In that decision, the court announced a 
new standard for determining when the statute of limitations 
period begins to accrue in so-

                                  23
<PAGE>


called "repetitive stress" injury cases. While the decision could 
result in the revival of some cases which were previously 
dismissed, the decision will not cause the Company to alter its 
strategy in these cases.

Monitor-Size Litigation
In August 1995, the Company was named, along with 41 other 
entities, including computer manufacturers and computer 
monitor vendors, in a putative nationwide class action filed in 
the California Superior Court for Orange County, styled Keith 
Long et al. v. AAmazing Technologies Corp. et al. The 
complaint alleges that each of the defendants engaged in false or 
misleading advertising with respect to the size of computer 
monitor screens. Also in August 1995, the Company was 
named as the sole defendant in a purported class action alleging 
similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for 
Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. Apple Computer, 
Inc. Subsequently, in November 1995, the Company, along 
with 26 other entities, was named in a purported class action 
alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court 
for Essex County, entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple 
Computer, Inc. et al. Similar putative class actions have been 
filed in other California counties in which the Company was 
not named as a defendant. The complaints in all of these cases 
seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, 
damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. In December 
1995, the California Judicial Council ordered all of the 
California actions, including Long, coordinated for purposes of 
pretrial proceedings and trial before a single judge, the 
Honorable William Cahill, sitting in the County of San 
Francisco. All of the California actions were subsequently 
coordinated under the name In re Computer Monitor Litigation, 
and a master consolidated complaint was filed superseding all of 
the individual complaints in those actions. In July 1996, Judge 
Cahill ordered all of the California cases dismissed without 
leave to amend as to plaintiffs residing in California on the 
ground that a stipulated judgment entered in September 1995 in 
a prior action brought by the California Attorney General 
alleging the same cause of action was res judicata as to the 
plaintiffs in the consolidated California class action suits. This 
order may be subject to appellate review at a later stage of the 
proceedings. Both the New Jersey cases and the consolidated 
California cases are at a preliminary stage, with no discovery 
having taken place. In March 1997, the Court in the case styled 
In re Computer Monitor Litigation  preliminarily approved a 
proposed settlement to which the Company and all but three of 
the other defendants in the action would be parties and 
provisionally certified a nationwide settlement class with 
respect thereto. A hearing regarding final approval of the 
proposed settlement was held on June 30, 1997 and the Court's 
decision is pending. If approved, the Company does not 
anticipate its obligations pursuant to the proposed settlement 
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of 
operations or financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements. 

Exponential Technology v. Apple
Plaintiff alleges in a lawsuit styled Exponential Technology, 
Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc. that the Company, which was an 
investor in Exponential, breached its fiduciary duty to 
Exponential by misusing confidential information about its 
financial situation to cause Exponential to fail, and that the 
Company fraudulently misrepresented the facts about allowing 
Exponential to sell its processors to the Company Mac OS 
licensees. The lawsuit is filed in California State Court in 
Santa Clara County. In November 1997, the Company filed a 
demurrer to portions of the complaint, which the court granted 
in part. In January 1998, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint.

Other
On August 21, 1997, the Federal Trade Commission issued its 
consent decree against the Company, regarding the Company's 
past processor upgrade practices, specifically certain 
advertisements which the Commission deemed to have 
misrepresented the Company's marketing of certain 
microprocessor upgrade products. Pursuant to the order, the 
Company is ordered to cease and desist from any such allegedly 
misleading advertising, to give notice to consumers, and to 
implement certain programs enabling consumers who are 
within the order's scope to obtain upgrade kits or rebates, in 
connection with any purchases within the scope of the order. 
The Company has complied with all provisions of the order 
currently effective, and has filed its 60-day compliance with the 
Commission on October 17, 1997.

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with 
third parties, investigations and pending actions involving 
allegations of false or misleading advertising, product defects, 
discrimination, infringement of intellectual property rights, and 
breach of contract and other matters against the Company and 
its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its business. The 
liability, if any, associated with these matters is not 
determinable. 

                                  24

The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
as reported in the accompanying financial statements. However, 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable 
resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's 
future consolidated results of operations or cash flows could be 
materially affected in a particular period.

                            1990 STOCK OPTION PLAN
                         (as amended through 11/5/97)

	1.	Purposes of the Plan.  The purposes of this 1990 Stock 
Option Plan are to attract and retain high quality personnel for 
positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional 
incentive to Employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its 
Affiliated Companies and to promote the success of the Company's 
business.  This Plan succeeds to and replaces the Company's 1981 
Stock Option Plan.  Options granted under the Plan may be incentive 
stock options (as defined under Section 422 of the Code) or non-
statutory stock options, as determined by the Administrator at the 
time of grant of an option and subject to the applicable provisions of 
Section 422 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated 
thereunder.  Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may be granted 
under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of 
Options.

	2.	Definitions.  As used herein, the following definitions 
shall apply:

	(a)	"Administrator" means the Board or any of its 
Committees, as shall be administering the Plan from time to time 
pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan.

	(b)	"Affiliated Company" means a corporation which is not a

Administrator, provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in 
termination of the employment relationship with the Company or any

greatest volume of trading in the Common Stock) for the date of determination 
or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, the immediately 
preceding trading day, as reported in The Wall Street Journal or such other 
source as the Administrator deems reliable.

	(ii)	If the Common Stock is regularly quoted on the NASDAQ System (but not 
on the National Market System) or quoted by a recognized securities dealer but 
selling prices are not reported, its Fair Market Value shall be the mean 
between the high and low asked prices for the Common Stock on the date of

of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be optioned and
sold under the Plan or for which SARs may be granted and exercised is 
52,200,000 Shares (including Shares issued under the 1981 Stock Option Plan,

                                      30
<PAGE>

	If an Option or SAR issued under this Plan or under the Company's 1981 Stock 
Option Plan should expire or become unexercisable for any reason without 
having been exercised in full, the unpurchased Shares which were subject 
thereto shall, unless this Plan shall have been terminated, become available
 for other Options or SARs under this Plan.  However, should the Company 
reacquire Shares which were issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or 
SAR, such Shares shall not become available for future grant under the Plan.

	Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Employee may be
granted Options and SARs covering in the aggregate more than 1.5 million 
shares of Common Stock (the "Limit") in a fiscal year beginning on or after 
September 30, 1995.  Each share underlying a SAR not granted in tandem with
an Option shall be applied against the Limit, regardless of the number of 
shares deliverable or delivered upon exercise of the SAR; provided, however, 
that shares of Common Stock underlying a tandem grant of Options and SARs 
shall be counted only once in calculating the Limit.  The Limit shall not 
apply to grants of Options and SARs made prior to September 30, 1995."

	4.	Administration of the Plan.

		(a)	Composition of Administrator.

			(1)	Multiple Administrative Bodies.  If 
permitted by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act or 
any successor rule thereto, as in effect at the time that discretion is 
being exercised with respect to the Plan ("Rule 16b-3"), and by the 
legal requirements relating to the administration of stock plans such 
as the Plan, if any, of applicable securities laws, California corporate 
law and the Code (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), the Plan may 
(but need not) be administered by different administrative bodies 
with respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors 
who are Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) 
Employees who are neither Directors nor Officers.

				(2)	Administration with respect to 
Directors and Officers.  With respect to grants and awards to 
Employees who are also Officers or Directors of the Company, the 
Plan may be administered by (A) the Board, if the Board may 
administer the Plan in compliance with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to 
grants to Officers and Directors, or (B) a Committee designated by 
the Board to administer the Plan, which Committee shall be 
constituted (I) in such a manner as to permit the Plan and grants and 
awards thereunder to comply with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to grants 
to Officers and Directors and (II) in such a manner as to satisfy the 
Applicable Laws.

				(3)	Administration with respect to Other 
Persons.  With respect to grants and awards to Employees who are 
neither Directors nor Officers of the Company, the Plan may be 
administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee designated by the 
Board, which Committee shall be constituted in such a manner as to 
satisfy the Applicable Laws.

				(4)	General.  Once a Committee has 
been appointed pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this Section 4(a), 
such Committee shall continue to serve in its designated capacity 
until otherwise directed by the Board.  From time to time the Board 
may increase the size of any Committee and appoint additional 
members thereof, remove members (with or without cause) and 
appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill vacancies 
(however caused) and remove all members of a Committee and 
thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by 
the Applicable Laws and, in the case of a Committee appointed 
under subsection (2) to the extent permitted by Rule 16b-3 as it 
applies to grants to Officers and Directors.

		(b)	Powers of the Administrator.  Subject to the 
provisions of the Plan and, in the case of a Committee, subject to the 
specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the 
Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to 
determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in accordance 
with Section 2(l) of the Plan; (ii) to determine, in accordance with 
Section 8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per Share of Options and 
SARs to be granted; (iii) to determine the Employees to whom, and 
the time or times at which, Options and SARs shall be granted and 
the number of Shares to be represented by each Option or SAR 
(including without limitation whether or not a corporation shall be 
excluded from the definition of Affiliated Company under Section 
2(b)); (iv) to interpret the Plan; (v) to determine the terms and 
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Option 
or SAR granted hereunder (including, but not limited to, any 
restriction or limitation, or any vesting acceleration or waiver of 
forfeiture restrictions regarding any Option or SAR and/or the 
Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the 
Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion); (vi) to approve 
forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vii) to prescribe, amend 
and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (viii) to 
modify or amend each Option or SAR (with the consent of the 
Optionee) or accelerate the exercise date of any Option or SAR; (ix) 
to reduce the exercise price of any Option or SAR to the then current 
Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by such Option or SAR shall have declined since the date the 
Option or SAR was granted; (x) to authorize any person to execute 
on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effectuate the 
grant of an Option or SAR previously granted by the Administrator; 
and (xi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or 
advisable for the administration of the Plan.

                                      31
<PAGE>
		(c)	Effect of Decisions by the Administrator.  All 
decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Administrator 
shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of 
any Options.

		(d)	Anything in the Plan to the contrary 
notwithstanding, on and after September 30, 1995, grants of Options 
and SARs under the Plan to Officers shall be made only by a 
Committee consisting of at least two directors of the Company who 
qualify as "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) 
of the Code, and such Committee shall exercise all of the authority 
delegated under the Plan to the Administrator with respect to grants 
to Officers made on and after that date.

	5.	Eligibility.  Options and SARs may be granted only to 
Employees. An Employee who has been granted an Option or SAR 
may, if he or she is otherwise eligible, be granted an additional 
Option or Options, SAR or SARs. Each Option shall be evidenced by 
a written Option agreement, which shall expressly identify the 
Options as Incentive Stock Options or as Nonstatutory Stock 
Options, and which shall be in such form and contain such 
provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem 
appropriate.  However, notwithstanding such designation, to the 
extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with 
respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options and 
options granted under other plans of the Company or any Parent or 
Subsidiary that are designated as incentive stock options are 
exercisable for the first time by an Optionee during any calendar 
year exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as 
Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, (i) Options shall be taken into account in the order in which 
they were granted, and (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall 
be determined as of the time the Option or other incentive stock 
option with respect to such Shares is granted.  Without limiting the 
foregoing, the Administrator may, at any time, or from time to time, 
authorize the Company, with the consent of the respective recipients, 
to issue new Options or Options in exchange for the surrender and 
cancellation of any or all outstanding Options, other options, SARs 
or other stock appreciation rights.

	Neither the Plan nor any Option or SAR agreement shall 
confer upon any Optionee any right with respect to continuation of 
employment by the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or 
Affiliated Company), nor shall it interfere in any way with the 
Optionee's right or the right of the Company (or any Parent, 
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company) to terminate the Optionee's 
employment at any time or for any reason.

	6.	Term of Plan.  The Plan shall become effective upon its 
adoption by the Board or its approval by vote of the holders of a 
majority of the outstanding Shares of the Company entitled to vote 
on the adoption of the Plan, whichever is earlier.  It shall continue in 
effect for a term of ten (10) years unless sooner terminated under 
Section 14 of the Plan.

	7.	Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be ten 
(10) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may 
be provided in the Option agreement.  However, in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the 
Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more 
than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of 
the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option 
shall be five (5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter 
time as may be provided in the Option agreement.
                                      32
<PAGE>
	8.	Exercise Price and Consideration.

		(a)	Exercise Price.  The per Share exercise price for 
the Shares issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is 
determined by the Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 
100% of the Fair Market Value of Common Stock, determined as of 
the date of grant of the Option.  In the event that the Administrator 
shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise price shall be no less than 
100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of that reduction.  In no 
event shall the per Share exercise price be less than 110% of the Fair 
Market Value per Share as of the date of grant in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, immediately 
before the grant of such Option, owns Shares representing more than 
10% of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the 
Company or any Parent or Subsidiary.
		(b)	Method of Payment.  The consideration to be paid 
for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the 
method of payment, shall be determined by the Administrator (and, 
in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the 
time of grant) and may consist of (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) promissory 
note, (iv) other Shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of 
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to 
which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery of a properly 
executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a 
broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or 
loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (vi) any 
combination of the foregoing methods of payment and/or any other 
consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted under 
applicable corporate law.

	9.	Stock Appreciation Rights.

		(a)	Granted in Connection with Options.  At the sole 
discretion of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection 
with all or any part of an Option, either concurrently with the grant 
of the Option or at any time thereafter during the term of the Option.  
The following provisions apply to SARs that are granted in 
connection with Options:

			(i)	The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to 
exercise the SAR by surrendering to the Company unexercised a 
portion of the related Option.  The Optionee shall receive in 
exchange from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the 
Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR of the Common 
Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related Option over 
(y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the 
surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that 
may be paid upon exercise of an SAR; provided, however, that such 
limit shall not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.

		(ii)	When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to 
the extent surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.

		(iii)	An SAR shall be exercisable only when and to 
the extent that the related Option is exercisable and shall 
expire no later than the date on which the related Option 
expires.

			(iv)	An SAR may only be exercised at a time 
when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by the 
related Option exceeds the exercise price of the Common Stock 
covered by the related Option.
 
 		(b)	Independent SARs.  At the sole discretion of the 
Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options.  The 
following provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in 
connection with Options:

		(i)	The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising 
the SAR, to receive from the Company an amount equal to the 
excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date of such 
exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date on 
which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the 
Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be 
paid upon exercise of an SAR.
                                      33
<PAGE>
		(ii)	SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at 
such times as the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's 
SAR agreement. 

		(c)	Form of Payment.  The Company's obligation 
arising upon the exercise of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock 
or in cash, or in any combination of Common Stock and cash, as the 
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine.  Shares issued 
upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their Fair Market 
Value as of the date of exercise.

		(d)	Rule 16b-3.  SARs granted to persons who are 
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Insiders") shall contain 
such additional restrictions as may be required to be contained in the 
plan or SAR agreement in order for the SAR to qualify for the 
maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.

	10.	Method of Exercise.

		(a)	Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder.  Any 
Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times 
and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and 
as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.

		An Option or SAR shall be deemed to be exercised 
when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company 
in accordance with the terms of the Option or SAR by the person 
entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and full payment for the 
Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been 
received by the Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the 
Administrator (and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, 
determined at the time of grant) and permitted by the Option 
agreement, consist of any consideration and method of payment 
allowable under Section 8(b) of the Plan.  Until the issuance (as 
evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or 
of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock 
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive 
dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with 
respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the 
Option.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right 
for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is 
issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option or 
SAR may not be exercised with respect to a fraction of a Share.

		Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a 
decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be available, 
both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the 
number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  Exercise of an 
SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised, result in 
a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be 
available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be 
exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.

		(b)	Rule 16b-3.  Options and SARs granted to 
Insiders must comply with Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such 
additional conditions or restrictions as may be required thereunder 
to be contained in the Plan or the agreement to qualify for the 
maximum exemption from Section 16 of the Exchange Act with 
respect to Plan transactions.

		(c)	Termination of Continuous Employment.  Upon 
termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other 
than termination by reason of the Optionee's death), the Optionee 
may, but only within ninety (90) days after the date of such 
termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that it 
was exercisable at the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the 
date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

		(d)	Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an 
Optionee:

		(1)	Who is at the time of death an Employee and who shall have been in 
Continuous Status as an Employee since the date of grant of the Option, the 
Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months (or such 
other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the
Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or by a 
person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or 
inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have 
                                      34
<PAGE>
accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated his or her employment 
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months 
as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death; or

		(2)	Within ninety (90) days after the termination of 
Continuous Status as an Employee, the Option or SAR may be 
exercised, at any time within six (6) months (or such other 
period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as 
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death 
by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right 
to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to 
the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date 
of termination.

		Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or 
SAR may not be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would 
otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time from the 
date of grant.

		(e)	Stock Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax 
Obligations.  When an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with 
the exercise of an Option or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax 
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is 
obligated to pay the Company an amount required to be withheld 
under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may satisfy the withholding 
tax obligation (including, at the election of the Optionee, any 
additional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in 
order to satisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax 
in connection with the exercise) by electing to have the Company 
withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, 
or the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR, if any, that 
number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount 
required to be withheld (and any additional amount desired to be 
withheld, as aforesaid).  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be 
withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be 
withheld is to be determined (the "Tax Date").

		All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld 
for this purpose shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the 
Administrator and shall be subject to the following restrictions:

			(i)	the election must be made on or prior to 
the applicable Tax Date; and
			(ii)	all elections shall be subject to the consent 
or disapproval of the Administrator.

		In the event the election to have Shares withheld is 
made by an Optionee and the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 
of the Code because no election is filed under Section 83(b) of the 
Code, the Optionee shall receive the full number of Shares with 
respect to which the Option or SAR is exercised but such Optionee 
shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back to the Company the 
proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.

	11.	Non-Transferability of Options.  Options and SARs may 
not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or 
disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of 
descent or distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations 
order as defined by the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder, provided, however, 
that the Administrator may grant non-qualified stock options that 
are freely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an 
Optionee or holder of an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An 
Option or an SAR may be exercised, during the lifetime of the 
Optionee or SAR holder, only by the Optionee or SAR holder or by a 
transferee permitted by this Section 11.

	12.	Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.

		(a)	Changes in Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by 
the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each 
outstanding Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been 
authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have 
yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or 
expiration of an Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each 
such outstanding Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any 
increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock 
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of 
the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number 
of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; 
provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the 
Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of 
consideration."  Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose 
                                      35
<PAGE>
determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.  
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of 
shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of 
stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof 
shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject 
to an Option or SAR.

		(b)	Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the 
proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding 
Options and SARs will terminate immediately prior to the 
consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided 
by the Administrator.  The Administrator may, in the exercise of its 
sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or SAR 
shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator and give each 
Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or 
any part of the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares as to which 
the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.

		(c)	Sale of Assets or Merger. Subject to the provisions 
of paragraph (d) hereof, in the event of a proposed sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the 
Company with or into another corporation, each outstanding Option 
and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or stock 
appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor corporation 
or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the 
Administrator determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in 
lieu of such assumption or substitution, that the Optionee shall have 
the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR would not 
otherwise be exercisable.  If the Administrator makes an Option or 
SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the 
event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall notify the 
Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a 
period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the 
Option or SAR will terminate upon the expiration of such period.  
For purposes of this paragraph, an Option granted under the Plan 
shall be deemed to be assumed if, following the sale of assets or 
merger, the Option confers the right to purchase, for each Share of 
Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to the sale of 
assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other 
securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by 
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of 
the transaction (and if such holders were offered a choice of 
consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a 
majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such 
consideration received in the sale of assets or merger was not solely 
Common Stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the 
Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation 
and the participant, provide for the per share consideration to be 
received upon exercise of the Option to be solely Common Stock of 
the successor corporation or its parent equal in Fair Market Value to 
the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in 
the sale of assets or merger.

		(d)	Change in Control.  In the event of a "Change in 
Control" of the Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless 
otherwise determined by the Administrator prior to the occurrence 
of such Change in Control, the following acceleration and valuation 
provisions shall apply:

		(1)	Any Options and SARs outstanding as of the 
date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred 
that are not yet exercisable and vested on such date shall 
become fully exercisable and vested; and

		(2)	The value of all outstanding Options and SARs 
shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or 
after grant, be cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options 
and SARs shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of (x) 
the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option or 
SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, 
in the event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the 
estate of the Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to 
exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance.

		(e)	Definition of "Change in Control".  For purposes of 
this Section 12, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of 
the following:

		( i )	When any "person", as such term is used in 
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the 
Company, a Subsidiary or a Company employee benefit plan, 
including any trustee of such plan acting as trustee) is or 
becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 
                                     36
<PAGE>
under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of 
the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
securities; or

		(ii)	The occurrence of a transaction requiring 
shareholder approval, and involving the sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of 
the Company with or into another corporation.

		(f)	Change in Control Price.  For purposes of this 
Section 12, "Change in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the 
Administrator, (i) the highest Fair Market Value at any time within 
the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of determination 
of the Change in Control Price by the Administrator (the "60-Day 
Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered, as determined by 
the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer 
related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time within 
the 60-Day Period.

	13.	Time of Granting Options and SARs.  The date of grant of 
an Option or SAR shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the 
Administrator makes the determination granting such Option or 
SAR.  Notice of the determination shall be given to each Employee to 
whom an Option or SAR is so granted within a reasonable time after 
the date of such grant.

	14.	Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

		(a)	Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at 
any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as it may 
deem advisable; provided that, to the extent necessary and desirable 
to comply with Applicable Laws, regulations or rules, including 
Section 422 of the Code, or, for periods on and after September 30, 
1995, with Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company shall obtain 
shareholder approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and 
to such a degree as is required.

		(b)	Effect of Amendment or Termination.  Any such 
amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall 
not impair the rights of any Optionee or SAR holder under any grant 
theretofore made without his or her consent.  Such Options and 
SARs shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been 
amended or terminated.

	15.	Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.  Shares shall not be 
issued with respect to an Option or SAR unless the exercise of such 
Option or SAR and the issuance and delivery of such Shares 
pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, 
including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 
the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation 
system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and 
shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company 
with respect to such compliance.

		As a condition to the exercise of an Option or SAR or 
the issuance of Shares upon exercise of an Option or SAR, the 
Company may require the person exercising such Option or SAR to 
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the 
Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any 
present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of 
counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of 
the aforementioned relevant provisions of law.

		Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any 
regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by 
the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and 
sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any 
liability in respect of the non-issuance or sale of such Shares as to 
which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

	16.	Reservation of Shares.  The Company, during the term of 
this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of 
Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

       Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
                             (Unaudited)

1. Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These financial 
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year 
ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 Form 10-K").

2. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
128 ("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share". In accordance with SFAS 128, 
primary earnings per share have been replaced with basic earnings per share, 
and fully diluted earnings per share have been replaced with diluted earnings 
per share which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding 
options and convertible securities. Prior periods have been presented to 
conform to SFAS 128, however, as the Company had a net loss in the prior 
period, basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary 
loss per share previously presented.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is
 reflected using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the 
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except net 
income (loss) and per share amounts):

For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 
of 1998, the Company assumed that all employees exchanged their existing 
options (See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) for 
new options with an exercise price of $13.6875 effective December 15, 1998. 
Therefore, all options outstanding as of December 26, 1997, were included in 
the computation of diluted earnings per share as they were all considered to 
have exercise prices less than $18.05, the average market price of common 
shares during the first quarter of 1998.  However, the effect on dilutive 
earnings per share of approximately 8.5 million of the outstanding options was 
weighted to reflect that they were only considered outstanding and dilutive 
options from December 19, 1997, the date of the Company's option exchange 
offer to its employees, through the end of the quarter. The Company has 
outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the 
"Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately 22.6 
million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common 
shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share because the effect of using the if-converted method 
would be anti-dilutive. For additional disclosures regarding the outstanding 
preferred stock, employee stock options and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

3.  In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations. The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for the Company's products and the 
Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a 
net charge of $179 million after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 1996. During 1997, the Company announced and began to 
implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives 
of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 million charge during 1997 for 
the estimated incremental costs of those actions, including approximately $8 
million of costs related to the termination of the Company's former Chief 
Executive Officer. The combined restructuring actions consist of terminating 
approximately 3,600 full-time employees, approximately 3,000 of whom have 
been terminated from the second quarter of 1996 through December 26, 1997, 
excluding employees who were hired by SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI 
Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's Fountain, Colorado 
manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center facility, 
respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of 
those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing 
various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and 
technologies that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The 
restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $195 
million and noncash asset write-downs of $57 million from the second quarter 
of 1996 through December 26, 1997. During the third quarter of 1997 
and the first quarter of 1998, the Company made adjustments to the categories 
and timing of expected restructure spending based on revised estimates. The 
Company expects that the remaining $144 million accrued balance as of 
December 26, 1997 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $102 
million over the next twelve months and $10 million thereafter. The 
Company expects that most of the contemplated restructuring actions related to 
the plan will be completed during fiscal 1998 and will be financed through 
current working capital and, if necessary, continued short-term borrowings.

4.	In August 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets of 
Power Computing Corporation ("PCC"), a company which Apple had licensed 
to distribute the Mac OS operating system. In addition to the acquisition of 
certain assets such as PCC's customer database and the license to 
distribute the Mac OS, the Company has the right to retain certain key 
employees of PCC. The agreement with PCC also includes a release of claims 
between the parties.

	On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of 
certain assets of PCC. The total purchase price was approximately $115 
million, which included 4,159,000 shares of the Company's common stock 
valued at $80 million, the forgiveness of approximately $28 million of 
receivables due from PCC, assumption by the Company of certain 
customer support liabilities of PCC, and closing and related costs. The 
difference between the total purchase price and the $75 million expensed as 
"Termination of License Agreement" in the fourth quarter of 1997 will be 
capitalized in the second quarter of 1998 and then amortized over a period of 
three years.

5.	In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's 
key employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option 
exchange program which permits employees to exchange all (but not less than 
all) of their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of 
greater than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise 
price of $13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on 
December 19, 1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in 
December 1997.

6.	In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue 
Recognition." SOP 97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all 
aspects of software revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered 
into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the 
Company to modify certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The 
Company does not expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact 
on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

7.	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies 
by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in 
dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income 
tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial 
number of issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still 
remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes 
that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from 
tax examinations.

8.	The information set forth in Item 1 of Part II hereof is hereby 
incorporated by reference.

During the first quarter of 1998 the Company experienced significant 
improvement in its financial performance, reporting its first operating profit 
since the fourth quarter of 1996 and earning higher gross margins than in both 
the previous quarter and the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses 
were substantially lower than in the previous quarter and the same 
quarter from the prior year, reflecting reductions in all functional areas of 
the Company as a result of continued restructuring actions. However, both net 
sales and unit sales of Macintosh computer systems fell slightly from the 
previous quarter and fell substantially from the same quarter in the prior 
year. The second quarter has historically been the weakest for the Company.  
Therefore, sequential revenue growth is not expected until at least the third 
quarter, while year-over-year revenue growth is not expected until at least 
the fourth quarter. The Company believes that gross margin levels on its 
current products are sustainable for several quarters and that operating 
expenses will continue to trend downward through the third quarter.  The 
foregoing statements are forward looking.  The Company's actual results could 
differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the following 
paragraph, and those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May 
Affect Operating Results and Financial Condition" below.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent 
upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued 
competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by 
the Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the
Company; the availability of key components on terms acceptable to the 
Company; the Company's ability to supply products in certain categories; the 
Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or other faults;
the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of 
technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely 
delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and to make timely 
delivery of a new and substantially backward-compatible operating system; the 
Company's ability to successfully integrate the technologies, processes and 
employees of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT") ,which was acquired by the Company 
in 1997, with those at Apple; the Company's ability to successfully implement 
its strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees, 
including a new Chief Executive Officer; the effects of significant adverse 
publicity; the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications; and the impact on the Company's sales, market share and gross 
margins as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program.

Net Sales

Q1 98 Compared with Q1 97

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates and 
discounts. Net sales decreased 26% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the same quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral 
unit sales decreased 31% and 49%, respectively, in the first quarter of 
1998, compared with the same period of 1997. The effect on net sales of this 
decline in computer and peripheral unit sales in the first quarter of 1998 was 
partially offset by the successful introduction of the Company's Power 
Macintosh G3 systems in November 1997, which accounted for approximately 
21% of the 635,000 systems shipped during the first quarter of 1998. The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased 6% in the first quarter 
of 1998, compared with the same period of 1997, as a result of a shift in mix 
from the Company's "Value" (entry level Power Macintosh) products to its 
"Flagship" line of high-performance Power Macintosh computers and due to 
increases in the average aggregate revenue across all product lines. In 
general, the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit and per 
peripheral unit is expected to remain under significant downward pressure due 
to a variety of factors, including industry wide pricing pressures, increased 
competition, and the need to stimulate demand for the Company's products. 

International net sales represented 50% of total net sales in the first quarter
 of 1998 compared with 56% of total net sales in the same period of 1997. 
International net sales declined 34% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the same period of 1997. Net sales decreased significantly in the European and 
Japanese markets during the first quarter of 1998 compared with the same 
period of 1997 as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit 
sales. Further discussion relating to factors contributing to the decline in
net sales in the Japanese market may be found in this Part I, Item 2 of Form 
10-Q

under the subheading "Global Market Risks" included under the heading 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which 
information is hereby incorporated by reference. 

Domestic net sales declined 16% in the first quarter of 1998 over the 
comparable period of 1997, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products, partially offset by increases in the average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit. 

During the first quarter of 1998 compared with the comparable period of 1997, 
the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer 
markets decreased to 2.6% from 4.3%, and to 3.3% from 5.2%, respectively, 
based upon current market information provided by industry sources. 

The Company believes that quarterly net sales will be below the level of the 
prior year's comparable periods through at least the third fiscal quarter of
1998, if not longer. 

Q1 98 Compared with Q4 97

Net sales decreased 2% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth 
quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 4% in the first 
quarter of 1998 compared with the prior quarter. The effect on net sales of 
this decline in unit sales was partially offset by the successful introduction 
of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems in November 1997, which accounted 
for approximately 21% of the 635,000 systems shipped during the first quarter 
of 1998. In addition, net sales were positively impacted as the Company began 
marketing many of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the 
Company's on-line store, which opened in November 1997. The Company 
generated $15 million in revenue from its on-line store during the first 
quarter of 1998. Unit sales of peripheral products decreased 15% in the first 
quarter of 1998 compared with the prior quarter. The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh computer unit increased 5% as a result of a shift in mix 
from the Company's "Value" products to its "Flagship" line of high-
performance Power Macintosh computers and due to increases in the average 
aggregate revenue across most other product lines.

International net sales represented 50% of total net sales in the first 
quarter of 1998, compared with 42% in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
International net sales increased 16% in the first quarter of 1998 compared 
with the fourth quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of increases in 
Macintosh and peripheral unit net sales in Europe and increases in net sales 
of Macintosh units in Japan.

Domestic net sales decreased 16% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the prior quarter due to decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, 
slightly offset by increases in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh 
and peripheral unit. 

During the first quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth quarter of 1997, the 
Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer 
markets decreased to 2.6% from 3.3%, and to 3.3% from 4.6%, respectively, 
based upon current market information provided by industry sources. 

Backlog

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any 
particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business 
prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or 
immediately following introduction of new products because of overordering 
by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and 
customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, 
as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not 
be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any 
particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information 
regarding the Company's backlog may be found in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 
10-Q under the subheading "Product Introductions and Transitions" included 
under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales and its 
cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of 
components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor costs. The type and cost of 
components included in particular configurations of the Company's products 
(such as memory and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to 
market products in configurations competitive with other manufacturers. 
Competition in the personal computer industry is intense and, in the short 
term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often 
necessary in order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by 
actions undertaken by the Company in response to industry wide competitive 
pressures. 

Gross margin increased from 18.6% to 22.4% of sales during the first quarter 
of 1998 compared to the same period of 1997, and increased from 19.8% to 
22.4% of sales compared to the fourth quarter of 1997. This was primarily as a 
result of a shift in revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin 
"Flagship" line of high-performance Power Macintosh computers, including 
Power Macintosh G3 systems, with relatively stable margins quarter-to-quarter 
on the Company's "Value" product line.

The gross margin levels in the first quarter of 1998 compared to the fourth 
quarter of 1997 were not significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange 
rates. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes 
in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations 
can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates. 

While the Company believes the overall gross margin levels achieved in the 
first quarter of 1998 are sustainable for several quarters, there can be no 
assurance that such margins will be maintained. In general, gross margins will 
remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, 
including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased 
competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential changes to the 
Company's product mix. In response to these downward pressures, the 
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its 
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to 
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate 
demand for certain of its products.

research and development related projects. 

The Company believes that continued and focused investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the 
marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new 
and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business 
strategy. The Company anticipates that research and development expenditures 
in the second quarter of 1998 will be comparable to those in the first quarter.

The Company anticipates that selling, general and administrative expenditures 
will decline further during the second quarter of 1998 as compared to the first 
quarter of 1998 as the Company completes and more fully realizes the cost 
reduction benefits of its restructuring plan and lower ongoing variable selling

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the 
Company's debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for 
using the equity method, foreign exchange gains and losses not allowed 
to be recognized as revenue or cost of sales, and other 
miscellaneous income and expense items. Over the last two 
years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. The Company's cost of funds may 
increase in future periods as a result of the downgrading in the 
second quarter of 1997 of its senior and subordinated long-term 
debt to B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services, and the downgrading in October 1997 of its senior 
and subordinated long-term debt to B- and CCC, respectively, 
by Standard and Poor's Rating Agency. 

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes

As of December 26, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets 
arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and 
tax credits of $696 million before being offset against certain 
deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's 
balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable 
based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of December 26, 1997, a valuation allowance of $211 
million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the 
benefits of tax losses which may not be realized. Realization 
of approximately $85 million of the asset representing tax loss 
and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability 
to generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable 
income. Management believes that it is more likely than not 
that forecasted U.S. income, including income that may be 
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be 
sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their 
expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will 
meet its expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the 
amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be 
reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future taxable 
U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. 
The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the 
deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and 
amount of the valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

Restructuring of Operations

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain 
restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, 
improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustainable 
profitability. During 1997, the Company announced and began 
to implement supplemental restructuring actions, including 
significant headcount reductions, to meet the foregoing 
objectives. There are several risks inherent in the Company's 
efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These include the 
risk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures 
quickly enough to restore sustainable profitability and the risk 
that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability 
to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry. 

Implementation of this restructuring involves several risks, 
including the risk that by simplifying and modifying its product 
line the Company will increase its dependence on fewer 
products, potentially reduce overall sales, and increase its 
reliance on unproven products and technology. Another risk of 
the restructuring is that by increasing the proportion of the 
Company's products to be manufactured under outsourcing 
arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality or 
quantity of the products manufactured and distributed, or lose 
the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules 
in order to respond to changing market conditions. As part of 
its restructuring, the Company announced and opened its on-
line store in November 1997, which makes available most of 
its products to end-users in the U.S. There can be no assurance 
the on-line store will result in greater sales. The Company also 
began manufacturing products on a build-to-order basis in 
November 1997. There can be no assurance this manufacturing 
process will result in decreased costs or increased gross margins. 
The Company is also reducing the number of wholesale and 
retail channel partners, particularly in the Americas, which 
places a greater volume of sales through fewer partners. There 
can be no assurance that this will not adversely impact the 
Company. In addition, the actions taken in connection with the 
restructuring could adversely affect employee morale, thereby 
damaging the Company's ability to retain and motivate 
employees. Also, because the Company contemplates relying 
to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements 
with third parties, the Company will have less direct control 
over certain of its research and development efforts, and its 
ability to create innovative new products may be reduced. In 
addition, there can be no assurance that the technologies 
acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key 
NeXT employees and processes will be retained and successfully 
integrated with those at Apple. Also, the restructuring includes 
the winding down of the Company's Mac OS licensing 
program. There can be no assurance that the winding down of 
this program will result in greater sales, market share, and 
increased gross margins to the Company. In addition, there can 
be no assurance that this action will not result in the 
availability of fewer application software titles for the Mac OS, 
which may result in a decrease to the Company's sales, market 
share and gross margins. Finally, even if the restructuring is 
successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will 
effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the 
Company. Although the Company believes that the actions it 
is taking in connection with the restructuring, including its 
acquisition of NeXT and the winding down of its Mac OS 
licensing program, should help restore marketplace confidence 
in the Company, there can be no assurance that such actions 
will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing 
its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring 
sustainable profitability. The Company's future consolidated 
operating results and financial condition could be adversely 
affected should it encounter difficulty in effectively managing 
the restructuring and new cost structure. 

Additional information relating to the restructuring of 
operations may be found in Part I of this Form 10-Q in Note 3 
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Unaudited), which information is hereby incorporated by 
reference. 

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer 
industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand 
patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must 
continuously introduce new products and technologies and 
enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. 
Recent introductions include certain PowerBook and Power 
Macintosh products, including the Power Macintosh G3 
computers in November 1997, and the introduction of Mac OS 
8 in July 1997. The success of new product introductions is 
dependent on a number of 

                                  14
<PAGE>


factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to 
manage the risks associated with product transitions, the 
availability of application software for new products, the 
effective management of inventory levels in line with 
anticipated product demand, the availability of products in 
appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk 
that new products may have quality or other defects in the early 
stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot 
determine the effect that new products will have on its sales or 
results of operations. In addition, although the number of new 
product introductions may decrease as a result of the Company's 
restructuring actions, the risks and uncertainties associated with 
new product introductions may increase as the Company 
refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments and to 
the extent new product introductions are in markets that are new 
to the Company. 

The rate of product shipments immediately following 
introduction of a new product is not necessarily an indication of 
the future rate of shipments for that product, which depends on 
many factors, some of which are not under the control of the 
Company. These factors may include initial large purchases by 
a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase 
new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users 
("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand 
by users who anticipated new technology and, as a result, 
deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by dealers 
who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. 
These factors may be offset by others, such as the deferral of 
purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as 
"proven" and for which commonly used software products are 
available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once they 
believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously 
in backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to 
the aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident 
with introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and 
customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of the new 
products. The Company has in the past experienced difficulty in 
anticipating demand for new products, resulting in product 
shortages which have adversely affected the Company's 
operating results. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is 
further complicated by the availability of different product 
configurations, which may include various types of built-in 
peripherals and software. Configurations may also require 
certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, 
as a result, demand in different geographic areas may be a 
function of the availability of third-party software in those 
localized versions. For example, the availability of European-
language versions of software products manufactured by U.S. 
producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions by a 
quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the 
Company's new products outside the U.S., even though 
localized versions of the Company's products may be available. 

The increasing integration of new or enhanced functions and 
complexity of operations of the Company's products also 
increase the risk that latent defects or other faults could be 
discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products 
have been produced or shipped. If such defects were significant, 
the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs 
under product warranties. 

The Company has announced plans for two operating systems. 
The Company plans to continue to introduce major upgrades to 
the current Mac OS and later introduce a new operating system 
(code named "Rhapsody") which is expected to offer advanced 
functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. 
However, the NeXT software technologies that the Company 
plans to use in the development of Rhapsody were not 
originally designed to be compatible with the Mac OS. As a 
result, there can be no assurance that the development of 
Rhapsody can be completed at reasonable cost or at all. In 
addition, Rhapsody may not be fully backward-compatible with 
all existing applications, which could result in a loss of 
existing customers. Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody 
or the planned enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain 
developer support and market acceptance. Inability to 
successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially 
backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to 
the current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market 
acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse 
impact on the Company's consolidated operating results and 
financial condition.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure 
on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short 
product life cycles, continual improvement in product 
price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of 
consumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's 
consolidated results of operations and financial condition have 
been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by 
industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on 
gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid 
technological advances in software functionality and hardware 
performance and features based on existing or emerging industry 
standards. Many of the Company's competitors have greater 
financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological 
resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed 
customer bases than those of the Company. 

The Company's future consolidated operating results and 
financial condition may be affected by overall demand for 
personal computers and general customer preferences for one 
platform over another or one set of product features over 
another. 

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that 
uses the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in 
the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of 
computers that run the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 
NT operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac 
OS, with its perceived advantages over Windows, and the 
general reluctance of the Macintosh installed base to incur the 
costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind 
sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the past 
several years. Recent innovations in the Windows platform, 
including those included in Windows 95 and Windows NT, or 
those expected to be included in a new version of Windows to 
be introduced in 1998, have added features to the Windows 
platform that make the differences between the Mac OS and 
Microsoft's Windows operating systems less significant. The 
Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to 
respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its 
personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in 
the Windows platform. The Company's future consolidated 
operating results and financial condition will be substantially 
dependent on its ability to maintain continuing improvements 
to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived 
functional advantages over competing platforms. 

The Company had previously entered into agreements to license 
its Mac OS to other personal computer vendors (the "Clone 
Vendors") as part of an effort to increase the installed base for 
the Macintosh platform. The Company recently determined that 
the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors 
under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and 
costs of the licensing program. As a result, the Company 
agreed to acquire certain assets, including the license to 
distribute the Mac OS, of PCC, a Clone Vendor, and has no 
plans to renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements. 
Although the Company believes that this winding down of its 
licensing program will help reduce the adverse impact of the 
licensing program on the Company's sales, market share and 
gross margins, there can be no assurance that this will occur. In 
addition, there can be no assurance that this winding down of 
the licensing program will not result in the availability of fewer 
application software titles for the Mac OS, which may result in 
a decrease to the Company's sales, market share and gross 
margins. 

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from 
Windows and other platforms, the Company had previously 
devoted substantial resources toward developing personal 
computer products capable of running application software 
designed for the Windows operating systems. These products 
include an add-on card containing a Pentium or 586-class 
microprocessor that enables users to run applications 
concurrently that require the Mac OS, Windows 3.1 or 
Windows 95 operating systems. The Company plans to 
transition the cross-platform business to third-parties during 
1998. There can be no assurance that this transition will be 
successful. 

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation 
and Motorola, Inc. had agreed upon and announced the 
availability of specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-
based hardware platform (the "Platform"). These specifications 
defined a "unified" personal computer architecture that would 
have given the Clone Vendors broad access to the Power 
Macintosh platform and would have utilized standard industry 
components. The Company had intended to license the Mac OS 
to manufacturers of the Platform. However, the Company has 
decided it will no longer support the Platform based upon its 
decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing program, and 
because of 

                                  16
<PAGE>


little industry support for the Platform. The decision not to 
further develop this Platform may affect the Company's ability 
to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform. 

Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or 
announced their intention to target certain of the Company's 
key market segments, including education and publishing. 
Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, 
manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company. 

In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into 
patent cross licensing and technology agreements. Under these 
agreements, the companies provided patent cross licenses to 
each other. In addition, for a period of five years from August 
1997, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft 
Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS, and the 
Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac 
OS system software releases and make that product the default 
Internet browser for such releases. In addition, Microsoft 
purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series 'A' non-voting 
convertible preferred stock for $150 million. While the 
Company believes that its relationship with Microsoft will be 
beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the 
installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for 
a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which 
the Company competes with Microsoft, including the Windows 
platform. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an 
adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's 
relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance that 
the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will 
not be offset by the disadvantages. 

Support from Third-Party Software Developers

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal 
computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often 
based on the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications. The Company believes that the availability of 
third-party application software for the Company's hardware 
products depends in part on third-party developers' perception 
and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, 
and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus 
software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based 
on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and 
its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be 
generated, and the costs of developing such software products. 
To the extent the Company's recent financial losses and 
declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the 
Company's decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing 
program, have caused software developers to question the 
Company's prospects in the personal computer market, 
developers could be less inclined to develop new application 
software or upgrade existing software for the Company's 
products and more inclined to devote their resources to 
developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows 
market. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce a 
new operating system (code named "Rhapsody") could cause 
software developers to stop developing software for the current 
Mac OS. In addition, there can be no assurance that software 
developers will decide to develop software for the new operating 
system on a timely basis or at all. 

Microsoft is an important developer of application software for 
the Company's products. Although the Company has entered 
into a relationship with Microsoft, which includes Microsoft's 
agreement to develop and ship future versions of its Microsoft 
Office and Internet Explorer products and certain other Microsoft 
tools for the Mac OS, such relationship is for a limited term 
and does not cover many areas in which the Company competes 
with Microsoft. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing 
application software for the Mac OS not covered by the 
relationship or upon expiration of the relationship may be 
influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the 
vendor of the Windows operating system. 

Global Market Risks

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's 
consolidated operations and financial results could be 
significantly affected by risks associated with international 
activities, including economic and labor conditions, political 
instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign 
subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus 
the local currency in which the products are sold. 

Countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have 
recently experienced weaknesses in their currency, banking and 
equity markets. These weaknesses could adversely affect 
consumer demand for the Company's products, 


                                  17
<PAGE>


the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency 
denominated sales, the availability and supply of product 
components to the Company, and ultimately the Company's 
consolidated results of operations. 

When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the 
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. 
When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-
U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. 
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the 
U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar 
strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net receiver of 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from 
a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar 
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in 
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales 
and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in 
the interest rates of many of the world's leading industrialized 
countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most 
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest 
rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the 
interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign 
currency hedges. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. 
interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap, 
collar, and floor transactions. 

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's 
foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to 
monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, 
the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward 
and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor 
positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with 
its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related 
exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an 
economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of 
the Company's risk management activities, there can be no 
assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more 
than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from 
unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest 
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition 
of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for 
any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and 
losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, 
therefore, may adversely affect the Company's consolidated 
operating results and financial position. The Company does not 
engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition may increase the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of 
the hedging transactions into which the Company's 
counterparties are willing to enter. 

Inventory and Supply

The Company makes a provision for inventories of products 
that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated 
demand, accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for 
inventories that have been canceled, and accrues for the 
estimated costs to correct any product quality problems. 
Although the Company believes its inventory and related 
provisions are adequate given the rapid and unpredictable pace of 
product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can 
be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory 
and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may 
again have, a material effect on the Company's consolidated 
financial position and results of operations. 

The Company must order components for its products and build 
inventory well in advance of product shipments. Because the 
Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology 
and price changes, there is a risk that the Company will forecast 
incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of 
particular products. The Company's consolidated operating 
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in 
the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's 
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term 
shifts in customer demand patterns. 

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole 
or in part by third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design 
specifications of the Company or otherwise. As part of its 
restructuring actions, the Company sold its Fountain, 
Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI and entered into a 
related manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI; sold its 
Singapore printed circuit board manufacturing assets to NatSteel 
Electronics Pte., Ltd., which is 

                                  18
<PAGE>


expected to supply main logic boards to the Company under a 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement; entered into an 
agreement with Ryder Integrated Logistics, Inc. to outsource the 
Company's domestic operations transportation and logistics 
management; and has entered into other similar agreements to 
outsource the Company's European operations transportation 
and logistics management. As a result of the foregoing actions, 
the proportion of the Company's products produced and 
distributed under outsourcing arrangements will continue to 
increase. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed 
cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the 
Company has over production and distribution. It is uncertain 
what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or 
quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the 
Company to respond to changing market conditions. 
Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its 
inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the 
Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the 
arrangement. Moreover, although arrangements with such 
manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense 
reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially 
responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. 
Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty 
liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any 
unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether 
pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or 
otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future 
consolidated operating results and financial condition. 

Although certain components essential to the Company's 
business are generally available from multiple sources, other 
key components (including microprocessors and application 
specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by 
the Company from single sources. If the supply of a key 
single-sourced component were to be delayed or curtailed, the 
Company's business and financial performance could be 
adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain 
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and 
obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The 
Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the 
personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs 
presents the most significant potential for constraining the 
Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced 
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for 
production and thus have limited availability. The Company 
and other producers in the personal computer industry also 
compete for other semiconductor products with other industries 
that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to 
either increased consumer demand or increased use of 
semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and 
automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some 
components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry (including certain microprocessors and 
ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be 
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the 
production of common components instead of components 
customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product 
supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could 
decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the 
Company's consolidated operating results and financial 
condition. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive 
products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and 
Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC 
microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to 
supply to the Company in adequate numbers microprocessors 
that produce superior price/performance results compared with 
those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel 
Corporation, and other developers and producers of the 
microprocessors used by most personal computers using the 
Windows operating systems. The desire of IBM and Motorola 
to continue producing these microprocessors may be influenced 
by Microsoft's decision not to adapt its Windows NT operating 
system software to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. IBM 
produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as 
well as workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, 
and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating 
system to the Company's Mac OS. Accordingly, IBM's interest 
in supplying the Company with microprocessors for the 
Company's products may be influenced by IBM's perception of 
its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers 
and as a competing operating system vendor. In addition, 
Motorola has recently announced its intention to stop producing 
Macintosh clones. As a result, Motorola may be less inclined 
to continue to produce PowerPC microprocessors. 

The Company's current financial condition and uncertainties 
related to recent events could affect the terms on which 
suppliers are willing to supply the Company with their 
products. There can be no assurance that the Company's current 
suppliers will continue to supply the Company on terms 
acceptable to the Company or that the Company will be able to 
obtain comparable products from alternate sources on such 
terms. The Company's future consolidated operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company 
is unable to continue to obtain key components on terms 
substantially similar to those currently available to the 
Company. 

                                  19
<PAGE>


Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and 
distribution of the Company's products. Currently, the 
Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, 
mass merchants, and cataloguers (collectively referred to as 
"resellers") and direct to higher education institutions. In 
addition, in November 1997 the Company began selling many 
of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the 
Company's on-line store. Many of the Company's significant 
resellers operate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers 
also distribute products from competing manufacturers. The 
Company's business and financial results could be adversely 
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened or 
if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not to 
continue to distribute the Company's products. 

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may 
continue to cause resellers to reduce their ordering and 
marketing of the Company's products. In addition, the 
Company has in the past and may in the future experience 
delays in ordering by resellers in light of uncertain demand for 
the Company's products. Under the Company's arrangements 
with its resellers, resellers have the option to reduce or 
eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances 
without financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to 
return products to the Company without penalty within certain 
limits, beyond which they may be assessed fees. The Company 
has recently revised its channel program, including decreasing 
the number of resellers and reducing returns, price protection 
and certain rebate programs, in an effort to reduce channel 
inventory, increase inventory turns, increase product support 
within the channel and improve gross margins. In addition, in 
November 1997 the Company opened its on-line store in the 
U.S. which makes many of the Company's products available 
directly to the end-user. Although the Company believes the 
foregoing changes will improve its consolidated operating 
results and financial condition, there can be no assurance that 
this will occur. 

Change in Senior Management

On July 9, 1997, the Company announced that Dr. Gilbert F. 
Amelio had resigned his positions as Chairman of the Board and 
Chief Executive Officer and that the Company was initiating a 
search for a new Chief Executive Officer. While the Company 
intends to name a new Chief Executive Officer as soon as 
practicable, there can be no assurance that the change in senior 
management and related uncertainties will not adversely affect 
the Company's consolidated operating results and financial 
condition during the period until a new Chief Executive Officer 
is hired and afterward. In addition, certain members of the 
Company's senior management have been with the Company 
for less than twelve months. There can be no assurance that 
new members of the management team can be successfully 
assimilated, that the Company will be able to satisfactorily 
allocate responsibilities or that such new members of its 
management will succeed in their roles in a timely and efficient 
manner. The Company's failure to recruit, retain and assimilate 
new executives, or the failure of any such executive to perform 
effectively, or the loss of any such executive, could have a 
material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 

Changes to Board of Directors

The Company announced on August 6, 1997 significant 
changes to its Board of Directors, replacing all but two former 
directors. The continuing directors are Gareth C.C. Chang, 
Corporate Senior Vice President, Marketing, Hughes 
Electronics and President, Hughes International, and Edgar S. 
Woolard, Jr., retired Chairman of E.I. DuPont de Nemours & 
Company. The new directors are William V. Campbell, 
President and CEO of Intuit Corp.; Lawrence J. Ellison, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oracle Corp.; Steven 
P. Jobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pixar 
Animation Studios; and Jerome B. York, Vice Chairman of 
Tracinda Corporation and former Chief Financial Officer of IBM 
and Chrysler Corporation. 

Dependence on Key Employees

During the past several years, the Company has experienced 
significant voluntary employee turnover as a result of 
employees' concerns over the Company's prospects, as well as 
the abundance of career opportunities available elsewhere. The 
Company is dependent on its key employees in order to achieve 
its business plan. There can be no assurance the Company will 
be able to attract, motivate and retain key employees. Failure to 
do so may have a significant effect on the Company's 
consolidated operating results and financial condition. 
                                  20
<PAGE>


Other Factors

The Company is in the process of identifying operating and 
application software challenges related to the year 2000. While 
the Company expects to resolve year 2000 compliance issues 
substantially through normal replacement and upgrades of 
software, there can be no assurance that there will not be 
interruption of operations or other limitations of system 
functionality or that the Company will not incur substantial 
costs to avoid such limitations. Any failure to effectively 
monitor, implement or improve the Company's operational, 
financial, management and technical support systems could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and 
consolidated results of operations. 

The majority of the Company's research and development 
activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business 
operations, including certain major vendors, are located near 
major seismic faults. The Company's consolidated operating 
results and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected in the event of a major earthquake. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and 
countries may subject the Company to environmental and other 
regulations which include, in some instances, the requirement 
that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return 
to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave 
responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling 
with the Company. It is unclear what effect such regulations 
will have on the Company's future consolidated operating 
results and financial condition. 

The Company recently decided to replace its existing transaction 
systems in the U.S. (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated 
system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational 
efficiency. Substantially all of the transaction systems in the 
European operations were replaced with the same integrated 
system in 1997. The Company's future consolidated operating 
results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the 
Company is unable to implement and effectively manage the 
transition to this new integrated system. 

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors 
affecting the Company's consolidated operating results and 
financial condition, past financial performance should not be 
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or 
trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's 
participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in 
significant volatility of the Company's common stock price. 

                                      21

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's consolidated financial position with respect to 
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 
$1,627 million as of December 26, 1997, from $1,459 million 
as of September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash 
equivalent balances as of December 26, 1997 and September 26, 
1997 include $164 million and $165 million, respectively, 
pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily 
associated with the Company's purchase commitments under 
the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash generated by operations during the first quarter of 1998 
totaled $143 million. Cash generated by operations was 
primarily the result of positive earnings and decreases in 
accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by  
decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment 
totaled $7 million in the first quarter of 1998, and consisted 
primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and 
equipment. The Company expects that the level of capital 
expenditures in the second quarter of 1998 will increase slightly 
as compared to the first quarter.

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been 
downgraded to non-investment grade. In October 1997, the 
Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt were 
downgraded to B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency. The Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt ratings by Moody's Investor Services remain 
unchanged from the second quarter of 1997, when they were 
downgraded to B3 and Caa2, respectively. Both Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency and Moody's Investor Services have the 
Company on negative outlook. These actions may increase the 
Company's cost of funds in future periods. In addition, the 
Company may be required to pledge additional collateral with 
respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to 
agree to more stringent covenants than in the past. 

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash 
equivalents and short-term investments, and continued short-
term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash 
requirements over the next twelve months. Expected cash 
requirements over the next twelve months include an estimated 
$102 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, 
most of which will be effected during fiscal 1998. No assurance 
can be given that any additional required financing could be 
obtained should the restructuring plan take longer to implement 
than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable 
to obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, and 
financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal 
income tax deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and 
the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. The 
Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions 
with the U.S. Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed 
income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. 
Although a substantial number of the issues for these years 
have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are 
being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp et al.
In January 1996, a purported shareholder class action styled 
Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp et. al was 
filed in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County 
naming the Company and its then directors as defendants. The 
complaint sought injunctive relief and damages and alleged that 
acts of mismanagement resulted in a depressed price for the 
Company. In February 1996, the complaint was amended to add 
a former director as a defendant and to add purported class and 
derivative claims based on theories such as breach of fiduciary 
duty, misrepresentation, and insider trading. In July 1996, the 
Court sustained defendants' demurrer and dismissed the amended 
complaint on a variety of grounds and granted plaintiffs leave to 
amend the complaint. In October 1996, the plaintiffs filed a 
second amended complaint naming the Company's then 
directors and certain former directors as defendants and again 
alleging purported class and derivative claims, seeking 
injunctive relief and damages (compensatory and punitive) based 
on theories such as breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation, 
and insider trading. In July 1997, the Court granted in part and 
denied in part the Company's motion to strike most of the 
substantive allegations of the second amended complaint. The 
Court sustained the demurrer to plaintiffs' class claims but 
overruled the demurrer to the shareholder derivative claims. In 
September 1997, the Company brought a motion to reconsider 
portions of the court order. The Third Amended Complaint 
was filed in October 1997, and eliminated the class action 
claims and restated claims against certain directors and former 
directors. In November 1997, the Company's Board of Directors 
appointed a special investigation committee and engaged 
independent counsel to assist in the investigation of the claims 
made in the Third Amended Complaint. Also in November 
1997, the Company filed a demurrer to the Third Amended 
Complaint. A hearing is set for February 1998.

LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et al.
In May 1996, an action was filed in the California Superior 
Court for Alameda County naming as defendants the Company 
and certain of its current and former officers and directors. The 
complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and 
generally alleges that the defendants misrepresented or omitted 
material facts about the Company's operations and financial 
results, which plaintiff contends artificially inflated the price of 
the Company's stock. The case was transferred to the California 
Superior Court for Santa Clara County. In July 1997, the 
Court sustained the Company's demurrer dismissing the 
amended complaint with leave to amend, after which plaintiff 
served a second amended complaint. In September 1997, the 
Company and the two remaining individual defendants (former 
directors Markkula and Spindler) brought a motion to dismiss 
the second amended complaint. In October 1997, the Court 
granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety with leave to 
amend as to certain defendants and claims. In November 1997, 
the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, adding a former 
director as a defendant and alleging further misrepresentations by 
the defendants about the Company's operations and financial 
results. In January 1998, the Company and the three individual 
defendants brought a motion to dismiss the third amended 
complaint, which is set for hearing in February 1998.

"Repetitive Stress Injury" Litigation
The Company is named in approximately 60 lawsuits, alleging 
that plaintiffs incurred so-called "repetitive stress" injuries to 
their upper extremities as a result of using keyboards and/or 
mouse input devices sold by the Company. These actions are 
similar to those filed against other major suppliers of personal 
computers. In October 1996, the Company prevailed in the first 
full trial to go to verdict against the Company. Since then, 
approximately ten lawsuits have been dismissed with prejudice 
by the plaintiffs, and two others have been dismissed by court 
order. The remaining actions are in various stages of pretrial 
activity. Ultimate resolution of these cases may depend on 
industry-wide progress in resolving similar litigation, as well as 
on the impact of the recent decision handed down by the New 
York Court of Appeals in the case of Blanco v. American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co. (a majority of the cases naming 
the Company as a defendant were filed in New York, and are 
subject to the decision). In that decision, the court announced a 
new standard for determining when the statute of limitations 
period begins to accrue in so-

                                  23
<PAGE>


called "repetitive stress" injury cases. While the decision could 
result in the revival of some cases which were previously 
dismissed, the decision will not cause the Company to alter its 
strategy in these cases.

Monitor-Size Litigation
In August 1995, the Company was named, along with 41 other 
entities, including computer manufacturers and computer 
monitor vendors, in a putative nationwide class action filed in 
the California Superior Court for Orange County, styled Keith 
Long et al. v. AAmazing Technologies Corp. et al. The 
complaint alleges that each of the defendants engaged in false or 
misleading advertising with respect to the size of computer 
monitor screens. Also in August 1995, the Company was 
named as the sole defendant in a purported class action alleging 
similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for 
Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. Apple Computer, 
Inc. Subsequently, in November 1995, the Company, along 
with 26 other entities, was named in a purported class action 
alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court 
for Essex County, entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple 
Computer, Inc. et al. Similar putative class actions have been 
filed in other California counties in which the Company was 
not named as a defendant. The complaints in all of these cases 
seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, 
damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. In December 
1995, the California Judicial Council ordered all of the 
California actions, including Long, coordinated for purposes of 
pretrial proceedings and trial before a single judge, the 
Honorable William Cahill, sitting in the County of San 
Francisco. All of the California actions were subsequently 
coordinated under the name In re Computer Monitor Litigation, 
and a master consolidated complaint was filed superseding all of 
the individual complaints in those actions. In July 1996, Judge 
Cahill ordered all of the California cases dismissed without 
leave to amend as to plaintiffs residing in California on the 
ground that a stipulated judgment entered in September 1995 in 
a prior action brought by the California Attorney General 
alleging the same cause of action was res judicata as to the 
plaintiffs in the consolidated California class action suits. This 
order may be subject to appellate review at a later stage of the 
proceedings. Both the New Jersey cases and the consolidated 
California cases are at a preliminary stage, with no discovery 
having taken place. In March 1997, the Court in the case styled 
In re Computer Monitor Litigation  preliminarily approved a 
proposed settlement to which the Company and all but three of 
the other defendants in the action would be parties and 
provisionally certified a nationwide settlement class with 
respect thereto. A hearing regarding final approval of the 
proposed settlement was held on June 30, 1997 and the Court's 
decision is pending. If approved, the Company does not 
anticipate its obligations pursuant to the proposed settlement 
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of 
operations or financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements. 

Exponential Technology v. Apple
Plaintiff alleges in a lawsuit styled Exponential Technology, 
Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc. that the Company, which was an 
investor in Exponential, breached its fiduciary duty to 
Exponential by misusing confidential information about its 
financial situation to cause Exponential to fail, and that the 
Company fraudulently misrepresented the facts about allowing 
Exponential to sell its processors to the Company Mac OS 
licensees. The lawsuit is filed in California State Court in 
Santa Clara County. In November 1997, the Company filed a 
demurrer to portions of the complaint, which the court granted 
in part. In January 1998, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint.

Other
On August 21, 1997, the Federal Trade Commission issued its 
consent decree against the Company, regarding the Company's 
past processor upgrade practices, specifically certain 
advertisements which the Commission deemed to have 
misrepresented the Company's marketing of certain 
microprocessor upgrade products. Pursuant to the order, the 
Company is ordered to cease and desist from any such allegedly 
misleading advertising, to give notice to consumers, and to 
implement certain programs enabling consumers who are 
within the order's scope to obtain upgrade kits or rebates, in 
connection with any purchases within the scope of the order. 
The Company has complied with all provisions of the order 
currently effective, and has filed its 60-day compliance with the 
Commission on October 17, 1997.

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with 
third parties, investigations and pending actions involving 
allegations of false or misleading advertising, product defects, 
discrimination, infringement of intellectual property rights, and 
breach of contract and other matters against the Company and 
its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its business. The 
liability, if any, associated with these matters is not 
determinable. 

                                  24
<PAGE>


The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
as reported in the accompanying financial statements. However, 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable 
resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's 
future consolidated results of operations or cash flows could be 
materially affected in a particular period.

EXHIBIT 10.A.5			

                          APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
                            1990 STOCK OPTION PLAN
                         (as amended through 11/5/97)

	1.	Purposes of the Plan.  The purposes of this 1990 Stock 
Option Plan are to attract and retain high quality personnel for 
positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional 
incentive to Employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its 
Affiliated Companies and to promote the success of the Company's 
business.  This Plan succeeds to and replaces the Company's 1981 
Stock Option Plan.  Options granted under the Plan may be incentive 
stock options (as defined under Section 422 of the Code) or non-
statutory stock options, as determined by the Administrator at the 
time of grant of an option and subject to the applicable provisions of 
Section 422 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated 
thereunder.  Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may be granted 
under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of 
Options.

	2.	Definitions.  As used herein, the following definitions 
shall apply:

	(a)	"Administrator" means the Board or any of its 
Committees, as shall be administering the Plan from time to time 
pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan.

	(b)	"Affiliated Company" means a corporation which is not a 
Subsidiary but with respect to which the Company owns, directly or 
indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, at least 20% of the total 
voting power, unless the Administrator determines in its discretion 
that such corporation is not an Affiliated Company.

	(c)	"Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

	(d)	"Common Stock" means the Common Stock, no par 
value, of the Company.

	(e)	"Company" means Apple Computer, Inc., a California 
corporation, or its successor.

	(f)	"Committee" means a Committee, if any, appointed by 
the Board in accordance with paragraph (a) of Section 4 of the Plan.

	(h)	"Continuous Status as an Employee" means the absence of 
any interruption or termination of the employment relationship with the Company
 or any Subsidiary or Affiliated Company.  Continuous Status as an Employee 
shall not be considered interrupted in the case of (i) medical leave, military 
leave, family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the 
Administrator, provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in 
termination of the employment relationship with the Company or any 
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company, as the case may be, under the terms of the 
respective Company policy for such leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers 
between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Subsidiaries, 
its successor or its Affiliated Companies.

	(i)	"Director" means a member of the Board.

	(j)	"Employee" means any person, including Officers and 
Directors, employed by and on the payroll of the Company, any Subsidiary or 
any Affiliated Company.  The payment of Directors' fees by the Company shall 
not be sufficient to constitute "employment" by the Company.

	(k)	"Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended.
                                       29
<PAGE>
	(l)	"Fair Market Value" means the value of Common Stock 
determined as follows:

	(i)	If the Common Stock is listed on any established stock 
exchange or a national market system (including without limitation the 
National Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers, 
Inc. Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ") System), its Fair Market Value shall be the 
closing sales price for such stock or the closing bid if no sales were 
reported, as quoted on such system or exchange (or the exchange with the 
greatest volume of trading in the Common Stock) for the date of determination 
or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, the immediately 
preceding trading day, as reported in The Wall Street Journal or such other 
source as the Administrator deems reliable.

	(ii)	If the Common Stock is regularly quoted on the NASDAQ System (but not 
on the National Market System) or quoted by a recognized securities dealer but 
selling prices are not reported, its Fair Market Value shall be the mean 
between the high and low asked prices for the Common Stock on the date of 
determination or, if there are no quoted prices on the date of determination, 
on the last day on which there are quoted prices prior to the date of 
determination.

(iii)   	In the absence of an established market for the Common Stock, the Fair 
Market Value thereof shall be determined in good faith by the Administrator.

	(m)	"Officer" means an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section

of Section 422 of the Code and is expressly designated by the Administrator 
at the time of grant as an incentive stock option.

	(p)	"Option" means an Option granted pursuant to the Plan.

	(q)	"Optioned Stock" means the Common Stock subject to an 
Option or SAR.

	(r)	"Optionee" means an Employee who receives an Option 
or SAR.

	(s)	"Parent" corporation shall have the meaning defined in 
Section 424(e) of the Code.

	(t)	"Plan" means this 1990 Stock Option Plan.

	(u)	"SAR" means a stock appreciation right granted 
pursuant to Section 9 below.

	(v)	"Share" means a share of the Common Stock, as 
adjusted in accordance with Section 12 of the Plan.

	(w)	"Subsidiary" corporation has the meaning defined in 
Section 424(f) of the Code.

	In addition, the terms "Rule 16b-3" and "Applicable Laws", the term 
"Insiders", the term "Tax Date" and the terms "Change in Control" and "Change 
in Control Price", shall have the meanings set forth, respectively, in 
Sections 4, 9, 10 and 12 below.

	3.	Stock Subject to the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of  Section 12 
of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be optioned and
sold under the Plan or for which SARs may be granted and exercised is 
52,200,000 Shares (including Shares issued under the 1981 Stock Option Plan, 
to which this Plan is a successor).  The Shares may be authorized but unissued 
or reacquired Common Stock.

	In the discretion of the Administrator, any or all of the Shares authorized 
under the Plan may be subject to SARs issued pursuant to the Plan.

                                      30
<PAGE>

	If an Option or SAR issued under this Plan or under the Company's 1981 Stock 
Option Plan should expire or become unexercisable for any reason without 
having been exercised in full, the unpurchased Shares which were subject 
thereto shall, unless this Plan shall have been terminated, become available
 for other Options or SARs under this Plan.  However, should the Company 
reacquire Shares which were issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or 
SAR, such Shares shall not become available for future grant under the Plan.

	Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Employee may be
granted Options and SARs covering in the aggregate more than 1.5 million 
shares of Common Stock (the "Limit") in a fiscal year beginning on or after 
September 30, 1995.  Each share underlying a SAR not granted in tandem with
an Option shall be applied against the Limit, regardless of the number of 
shares deliverable or delivered upon exercise of the SAR; provided, however, 
that shares of Common Stock underlying a tandem grant of Options and SARs 
shall be counted only once in calculating the Limit.  The Limit shall not 
apply to grants of Options and SARs made prior to September 30, 1995."

	4.	Administration of the Plan.

		(a)	Composition of Administrator.

			(1)	Multiple Administrative Bodies.  If 
permitted by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act or 
any successor rule thereto, as in effect at the time that discretion is 
being exercised with respect to the Plan ("Rule 16b-3"), and by the 
legal requirements relating to the administration of stock plans such 
as the Plan, if any, of applicable securities laws, California corporate 
law and the Code (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), the Plan may 
(but need not) be administered by different administrative bodies 
with respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors 
who are Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) 
Employees who are neither Directors nor Officers.

				(2)	Administration with respect to 
Directors and Officers.  With respect to grants and awards to 
Employees who are also Officers or Directors of the Company, the 
Plan may be administered by (A) the Board, if the Board may 
administer the Plan in compliance with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to 
grants to Officers and Directors, or (B) a Committee designated by 
the Board to administer the Plan, which Committee shall be 
constituted (I) in such a manner as to permit the Plan and grants and 
awards thereunder to comply with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to grants 
to Officers and Directors and (II) in such a manner as to satisfy the 
Applicable Laws.

				(3)	Administration with respect to Other 
Persons.  With respect to grants and awards to Employees who are 
neither Directors nor Officers of the Company, the Plan may be 
administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee designated by the 
Board, which Committee shall be constituted in such a manner as to 
satisfy the Applicable Laws.

				(4)	General.  Once a Committee has 
been appointed pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this Section 4(a), 
such Committee shall continue to serve in its designated capacity 
until otherwise directed by the Board.  From time to time the Board 
may increase the size of any Committee and appoint additional 
members thereof, remove members (with or without cause) and 
appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill vacancies 
(however caused) and remove all members of a Committee and 
thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by 
the Applicable Laws and, in the case of a Committee appointed 
under subsection (2) to the extent permitted by Rule 16b-3 as it 
applies to grants to Officers and Directors.

		(b)	Powers of the Administrator.  Subject to the 
provisions of the Plan and, in the case of a Committee, subject to the 
specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the 
Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to 
determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in accordance 
with Section 2(l) of the Plan; (ii) to determine, in accordance with 
Section 8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per Share of Options and 
SARs to be granted; (iii) to determine the Employees to whom, and 
the time or times at which, Options and SARs shall be granted and 
the number of Shares to be represented by each Option or SAR 
(including without limitation whether or not a corporation shall be 
excluded from the definition of Affiliated Company under Section 
2(b)); (iv) to interpret the Plan; (v) to determine the terms and 
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Option 
or SAR granted hereunder (including, but not limited to, any 
restriction or limitation, or any vesting acceleration or waiver of 
forfeiture restrictions regarding any Option or SAR and/or the 
Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the 
Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion); (vi) to approve 
forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vii) to prescribe, amend 
and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (viii) to 
modify or amend each Option or SAR (with the consent of the 
Optionee) or accelerate the exercise date of any Option or SAR; (ix) 
to reduce the exercise price of any Option or SAR to the then current 
Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by such Option or SAR shall have declined since the date the 
Option or SAR was granted; (x) to authorize any person to execute 
on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effectuate the 
grant of an Option or SAR previously granted by the Administrator; 
and (xi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or 
advisable for the administration of the Plan.

                                      31
<PAGE>
		(c)	Effect of Decisions by the Administrator.  All 
decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Administrator 
shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of 
any Options.

		(d)	Anything in the Plan to the contrary 
notwithstanding, on and after September 30, 1995, grants of Options 
and SARs under the Plan to Officers shall be made only by a 
Committee consisting of at least two directors of the Company who 
qualify as "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) 
of the Code, and such Committee shall exercise all of the authority 
delegated under the Plan to the Administrator with respect to grants 
to Officers made on and after that date.

	5.	Eligibility.  Options and SARs may be granted only to 
Employees. An Employee who has been granted an Option or SAR 
may, if he or she is otherwise eligible, be granted an additional 
Option or Options, SAR or SARs. Each Option shall be evidenced by 
a written Option agreement, which shall expressly identify the 
Options as Incentive Stock Options or as Nonstatutory Stock 
Options, and which shall be in such form and contain such 
provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem 
appropriate.  However, notwithstanding such designation, to the 
extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with 
respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options and 
options granted under other plans of the Company or any Parent or 
Subsidiary that are designated as incentive stock options are 
exercisable for the first time by an Optionee during any calendar 
year exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as 
Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, (i) Options shall be taken into account in the order in which 
they were granted, and (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall 
be determined as of the time the Option or other incentive stock 
option with respect to such Shares is granted.  Without limiting the 
foregoing, the Administrator may, at any time, or from time to time, 
authorize the Company, with the consent of the respective recipients, 
to issue new Options or Options in exchange for the surrender and 
cancellation of any or all outstanding Options, other options, SARs 
or other stock appreciation rights.

	Neither the Plan nor any Option or SAR agreement shall 
confer upon any Optionee any right with respect to continuation of 
employment by the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or 
Affiliated Company), nor shall it interfere in any way with the 
Optionee's right or the right of the Company (or any Parent, 
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company) to terminate the Optionee's 
employment at any time or for any reason.

	6.	Term of Plan.  The Plan shall become effective upon its 
adoption by the Board or its approval by vote of the holders of a 
majority of the outstanding Shares of the Company entitled to vote 
on the adoption of the Plan, whichever is earlier.  It shall continue in 
effect for a term of ten (10) years unless sooner terminated under 
Section 14 of the Plan.

	7.	Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be ten 
(10) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may 
be provided in the Option agreement.  However, in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the 
Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more 
than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of 
the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option 
shall be five (5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter 
time as may be provided in the Option agreement.
                                      32
<PAGE>
	8.	Exercise Price and Consideration.

		(a)	Exercise Price.  The per Share exercise price for 
the Shares issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is 
determined by the Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 
100% of the Fair Market Value of Common Stock, determined as of 
the date of grant of the Option.  In the event that the Administrator 
shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise price shall be no less than 
100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of that reduction.  In no 
event shall the per Share exercise price be less than 110% of the Fair 
Market Value per Share as of the date of grant in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, immediately 
before the grant of such Option, owns Shares representing more than 
10% of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the 
Company or any Parent or Subsidiary.
		(b)	Method of Payment.  The consideration to be paid 
for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the 
method of payment, shall be determined by the Administrator (and, 
in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the 
time of grant) and may consist of (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) promissory 
note, (iv) other Shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of 
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to 
which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery of a properly 
executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a 
broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or 
loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (vi) any 
combination of the foregoing methods of payment and/or any other 
consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted under 
applicable corporate law.

	9.	Stock Appreciation Rights.

		(a)	Granted in Connection with Options.  At the sole 
discretion of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection 
with all or any part of an Option, either concurrently with the grant 
of the Option or at any time thereafter during the term of the Option.  
The following provisions apply to SARs that are granted in 
connection with Options:

			(i)	The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to 
exercise the SAR by surrendering to the Company unexercised a 
portion of the related Option.  The Optionee shall receive in 
exchange from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the 
Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR of the Common 
Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related Option over 
(y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the 
surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that 
may be paid upon exercise of an SAR; provided, however, that such 
limit shall not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.

		(ii)	When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to 
the extent surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.

		(iii)	An SAR shall be exercisable only when and to 
the extent that the related Option is exercisable and shall 
expire no later than the date on which the related Option 
expires.

			(iv)	An SAR may only be exercised at a time 
when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by the 
related Option exceeds the exercise price of the Common Stock 
covered by the related Option.
 
 		(b)	Independent SARs.  At the sole discretion of the 
Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options.  The 
following provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in 
connection with Options:

		(i)	The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising 
the SAR, to receive from the Company an amount equal to the 
excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date of such 
exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date on 
which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the 
Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be 
paid upon exercise of an SAR.
                                      33
<PAGE>
		(ii)	SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at 
such times as the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's 
SAR agreement. 

		(c)	Form of Payment.  The Company's obligation 
arising upon the exercise of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock 
or in cash, or in any combination of Common Stock and cash, as the 
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine.  Shares issued 
upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their Fair Market 
Value as of the date of exercise.

		(d)	Rule 16b-3.  SARs granted to persons who are 
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Insiders") shall contain 
such additional restrictions as may be required to be contained in the 
plan or SAR agreement in order for the SAR to qualify for the 
maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.

	10.	Method of Exercise.

		(a)	Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder.  Any 
Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times 
and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and 
as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.

		An Option or SAR shall be deemed to be exercised 
when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company 
in accordance with the terms of the Option or SAR by the person 
entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and full payment for the 
Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been 
received by the Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the 
Administrator (and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, 
determined at the time of grant) and permitted by the Option 
agreement, consist of any consideration and method of payment 
allowable under Section 8(b) of the Plan.  Until the issuance (as 
evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or 
of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock 
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive 
dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with 
respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the 
Option.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right 
for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is 
issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option or 
SAR may not be exercised with respect to a fraction of a Share.

		Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a 
decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be available, 
both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the 
number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  Exercise of an 
SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised, result in 
a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be 
available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be 
exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.

		(b)	Rule 16b-3.  Options and SARs granted to 
Insiders must comply with Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such 
additional conditions or restrictions as may be required thereunder 
to be contained in the Plan or the agreement to qualify for the 
maximum exemption from Section 16 of the Exchange Act with 
respect to Plan transactions.

		(c)	Termination of Continuous Employment.  Upon 
termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other 
than termination by reason of the Optionee's death), the Optionee 
may, but only within ninety (90) days after the date of such 
termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that it 
was exercisable at the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the 
date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

		(d)	Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an 
Optionee:

		(1)	Who is at the time of death an Employee and who shall have been in 
Continuous Status as an Employee since the date of grant of the Option, the 
Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months (or such 
other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the
Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or by a 
person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or 
inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have 
                                      34
<PAGE>
accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated his or her employment 
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months 
as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death; or

		(2)	Within ninety (90) days after the termination of 
Continuous Status as an Employee, the Option or SAR may be 
exercised, at any time within six (6) months (or such other 
period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as 
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death 
by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right 
to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to 
the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date 
of termination.

		Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or 
SAR may not be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would 
otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time from the 
date of grant.

		(e)	Stock Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax 
Obligations.  When an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with 
the exercise of an Option or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax 
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is 
obligated to pay the Company an amount required to be withheld 
under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may satisfy the withholding 
tax obligation (including, at the election of the Optionee, any 
additional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in 
order to satisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax 
in connection with the exercise) by electing to have the Company 
withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, 
or the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR, if any, that 
number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount 
required to be withheld (and any additional amount desired to be 
withheld, as aforesaid).  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be 
withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be 
withheld is to be determined (the "Tax Date").

		All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld 
for this purpose shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the 
Administrator and shall be subject to the following restrictions:

			(i)	the election must be made on or prior to 
the applicable Tax Date; and
			(ii)	all elections shall be subject to the consent 
or disapproval of the Administrator.

		In the event the election to have Shares withheld is 
made by an Optionee and the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 
of the Code because no election is filed under Section 83(b) of the 
Code, the Optionee shall receive the full number of Shares with 
respect to which the Option or SAR is exercised but such Optionee 
shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back to the Company the 
proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.

	11.	Non-Transferability of Options.  Options and SARs may 
not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or 
disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of 
descent or distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations 
order as defined by the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder, provided, however, 
that the Administrator may grant non-qualified stock options that 
are freely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an 
Optionee or holder of an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An 
Option or an SAR may be exercised, during the lifetime of the 
Optionee or SAR holder, only by the Optionee or SAR holder or by a 
transferee permitted by this Section 11.

	12.	Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.

		(a)	Changes in Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by 
the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each 
outstanding Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been 
authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have 
yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or 
expiration of an Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each 
such outstanding Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any 
increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock 
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of 
the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number 
of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; 
provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the 
Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of 
consideration."  Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose 
                                      35
<PAGE>
determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.  
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of 
shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of 
stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof 
shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject 
to an Option or SAR.

		(b)	Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the 
proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding 
Options and SARs will terminate immediately prior to the 
consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided 
by the Administrator.  The Administrator may, in the exercise of its 
sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or SAR 
shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator and give each 
Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or 
any part of the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares as to which 
the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.

		(c)	Sale of Assets or Merger. Subject to the provisions 
of paragraph (d) hereof, in the event of a proposed sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the 
Company with or into another corporation, each outstanding Option 
and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or stock 
appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor corporation 
or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the 
Administrator determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in 
lieu of such assumption or substitution, that the Optionee shall have 
the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR would not 
otherwise be exercisable.  If the Administrator makes an Option or 
SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the 
event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall notify the 
Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a 
period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the 
Option or SAR will terminate upon the expiration of such period.  
For purposes of this paragraph, an Option granted under the Plan 
shall be deemed to be assumed if, following the sale of assets or 
merger, the Option confers the right to purchase, for each Share of 
Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to the sale of 
assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other 
securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by 
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of 
the transaction (and if such holders were offered a choice of 
consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a 
majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such 
consideration received in the sale of assets or merger was not solely 
Common Stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the 
Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation 
and the participant, provide for the per share consideration to be 
received upon exercise of the Option to be solely Common Stock of 
the successor corporation or its parent equal in Fair Market Value to 
the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in 
the sale of assets or merger.

		(d)	Change in Control.  In the event of a "Change in 
Control" of the Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless 
otherwise determined by the Administrator prior to the occurrence 
of such Change in Control, the following acceleration and valuation 
provisions shall apply:

		(1)	Any Options and SARs outstanding as of the 
date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred 
that are not yet exercisable and vested on such date shall 
become fully exercisable and vested; and

		(2)	The value of all outstanding Options and SARs 
shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or 
after grant, be cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options 
and SARs shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of (x) 
the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option or 
SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, 
in the event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the 
estate of the Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to 
exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance.

		(e)	Definition of "Change in Control".  For purposes of 
this Section 12, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of 
the following:

		( i )	When any "person", as such term is used in 
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the 
Company, a Subsidiary or a Company employee benefit plan, 
including any trustee of such plan acting as trustee) is or 
becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 
                                     36
<PAGE>
under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of 
the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
securities; or

		(ii)	The occurrence of a transaction requiring 
shareholder approval, and involving the sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of 
the Company with or into another corporation.

		(f)	Change in Control Price.  For purposes of this 
Section 12, "Change in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the 
Administrator, (i) the highest Fair Market Value at any time within 
the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of determination 
of the Change in Control Price by the Administrator (the "60-Day 
Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered, as determined by 
the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer 
related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time within 
the 60-Day Period.

	13.	Time of Granting Options and SARs.  The date of grant of 
an Option or SAR shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the 
Administrator makes the determination granting such Option or 
SAR.  Notice of the determination shall be given to each Employee to 
whom an Option or SAR is so granted within a reasonable time after 
the date of such grant.

	14.	Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

		(a)	Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at 
any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as it may 
deem advisable; provided that, to the extent necessary and desirable 
to comply with Applicable Laws, regulations or rules, including 
Section 422 of the Code, or, for periods on and after September 30, 
1995, with Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company shall obtain 
shareholder approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and 
to such a degree as is required.

		(b)	Effect of Amendment or Termination.  Any such 
amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall 
not impair the rights of any Optionee or SAR holder under any grant 
theretofore made without his or her consent.  Such Options and 
SARs shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been 
amended or terminated.

	15.	Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.  Shares shall not be 
issued with respect to an Option or SAR unless the exercise of such 
Option or SAR and the issuance and delivery of such Shares 
pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, 
including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 
the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation 
system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and 
shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company 
with respect to such compliance.

		As a condition to the exercise of an Option or SAR or 
the issuance of Shares upon exercise of an Option or SAR, the 
Company may require the person exercising such Option or SAR to 
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the 
Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any 
present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of 
counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of 
the aforementioned relevant provisions of law.

		Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any 
regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by 
the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and 
sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any 
liability in respect of the non-issuance or sale of such Shares as to 
which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

	16.	Reservation of Shares.  The Company, during the term of 
this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of 
Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

       Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
                             (Unaudited)

1. Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These financial 
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year 
ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 Form 10-K").

2. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
128 ("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share". In accordance with SFAS 128, 
primary earnings per share have been replaced with basic earnings per share, 
and fully diluted earnings per share have been replaced with diluted earnings 
per share which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding 
options and convertible securities. Prior periods have been presented to 
conform to SFAS 128, however, as the Company had a net loss in the prior 
period, basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary 
loss per share previously presented.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the

For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 
of 1998, the Company assumed that all employees exchanged their existing 
options (See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) for 
new options with an exercise price of $13.6875 effective December 15, 1998. 
Therefore, all options outstanding as of December 26, 1997, were included in 
the computation of diluted earnings per share as they were all considered to 
have exercise prices less than $18.05, the average market price of common 
shares during the first quarter of 1998.  However, the effect on dilutive 
earnings per share of approximately 8.5 million of the outstanding options was 
weighted to reflect that they were only considered outstanding and dilutive 
options from December 19, 1997, the date of the Company's option exchange 
offer to its employees, through the end of the quarter. The Company has 
outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the 
"Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately 22.6 
million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common 
shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share because the effect of using the if-converted method 
would be anti-dilutive. For additional disclosures regarding the outstanding 
preferred stock, employee stock options and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

3.  In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations. The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for the Company's products and the 
Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a 
net charge of $179 million after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 1996. During 1997, the Company announced and began to 
implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives 
of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 million charge during 1997 for 
the estimated incremental costs of those actions, including approximately $8 
million of costs related to the termination of the Company's former Chief 
Executive Officer. The combined restructuring actions consist of terminating 
approximately 3,600 full-time employees, approximately 3,000 of whom have 
been terminated from the second quarter of 1996 through December 26, 1997, 
excluding employees who were hired by SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI 
Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's Fountain, Colorado 
manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center facility, 
respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of 
those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing 
various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and 
technologies that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The 
restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $195 
million and noncash asset write-downs of $57 million from the second quarter 
of 1996 through December 26, 1997. During the third quarter of 1997 
and the first quarter of 1998, the Company made adjustments to the categories 
and timing of expected restructure spending based on revised estimates. The 
Company expects that the remaining $144 million accrued balance as of 
December 26, 1997 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $102 
million over the next twelve months and $10 million thereafter. The 
Company expects that most of the contemplated restructuring actions related to 
the plan will be completed during fiscal 1998 and will be financed through 
current working capital and, if necessary, continued short-term borrowings.

4.	In August 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets of 
Power Computing Corporation ("PCC"), a company which Apple had licensed 
to distribute the Mac OS operating system. In addition to the acquisition of 
certain assets such as PCC's customer database and the license to 
distribute the Mac OS, the Company has the right to retain certain key 
employees of PCC. The agreement with PCC also includes a release of claims 
between the parties.

	On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of 
certain assets of PCC. The total purchase price was approximately $115 
million, which included 4,159,000 shares of the Company's common stock 
valued at $80 million, the forgiveness of approximately $28 million of 
receivables due from PCC, assumption by the Company of certain 
customer support liabilities of PCC, and closing and related costs. The 
difference between the total purchase price and the $75 million expensed as 
"Termination of License Agreement" in the fourth quarter of 1997 will be 
capitalized in the second quarter of 1998 and then amortized over a period of 
three years.

5.	In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's 
key employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option 
exchange program which permits employees to exchange all (but not less than 
all) of their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of 
greater than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise 
price of $13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on 
December 19, 1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in 
December 1997.

6.	In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue 
Recognition." SOP 97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all 
aspects of software revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered 
into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the 
Company to modify certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The 
Company does not expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact 
on the Company's consolidated results of operations.

7.	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies 
by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in 
dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income 
tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial 
number of issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still 
remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes 
that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from 
tax examinations.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking 
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results 
may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking 
statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not 
limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May 
Affect Operating Results and Financial Condition" below. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this 
Form 10-Q. All information is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. 

Overview

During the first quarter of 1998 the Company experienced significant 
improvement in its financial performance, reporting its first operating profit 
since the fourth quarter of 1996 and earning higher gross margins than in both 
the previous quarter and the same quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses 
were substantially lower than in the previous quarter and the same 
quarter from the prior year, reflecting reductions in all functional areas of 
the Company as a result of continued restructuring actions. However, both net 
sales and unit sales of Macintosh computer systems fell slightly from the 
previous quarter and fell substantially from the same quarter in the prior 
year. The second quarter has historically been the weakest for the Company.  
Therefore, sequential revenue growth is not expected until at least the third 
quarter, while year-over-year revenue growth is not expected until at least 
the fourth quarter. The Company believes that gross margin levels on its 
current products are sustainable for several quarters and that operating 
expenses will continue to trend downward through the third quarter.  The 
foregoing statements are forward looking.  The Company's actual results could 
differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the following 
paragraph, and those discussed in the subsection entitled "Factors That May 
Affect Operating Results and Financial Condition" below.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent 
upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued 
competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by 
the Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the
Company; the availability of key components on terms acceptable to the 
Company; the Company's ability to supply products in certain categories; the 
Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or other faults;
the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of 
technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely 
delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and to make timely 
delivery of a new and substantially backward-compatible operating system; the 
Company's ability to successfully integrate the technologies, processes and 
employees of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT") ,which was acquired by the Company 
in 1997, with those at Apple; the Company's ability to successfully implement 
its strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees, 
including a new Chief Executive Officer; the effects of significant adverse 
publicity; the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications; and the impact on the Company's sales, market share and gross 
margins as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program.

Net Sales

Q1 98 Compared with Q1 97

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates and 
discounts. Net sales decreased 26% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the same quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral 
unit sales decreased 31% and 49%, respectively, in the first quarter of 
1998, compared with the same period of 1997. The effect on net sales of this 
decline in computer and peripheral unit sales in the first quarter of 1998 was 
partially offset by the successful introduction of the Company's Power 
Macintosh G3 systems in November 1997, which accounted for approximately 
21% of the 635,000 systems shipped during the first quarter of 1998. The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased 6% in the first quarter 
of 1998, compared with the same period of 1997, as a result of a shift in mix 
from the Company's "Value" (entry level Power Macintosh) products to its 
"Flagship" line of high-performance Power Macintosh computers and due to 
increases in the average aggregate revenue across all product lines. In 
general, the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit and per 
peripheral unit is expected to remain under significant downward pressure due 
to a variety of factors, including industry wide pricing pressures, increased 
competition, and the need to stimulate demand for the Company's products. 

International net sales represented 50% of total net sales in the first quarter
 of 1998 compared with 56% of total net sales in the same period of 1997. 
International net sales declined 34% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the same period of 1997. Net sales decreased significantly in the European and 
Japanese markets during the first quarter of 1998 compared with the same 
period of 1997 as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit 
sales. Further discussion relating to factors contributing to the decline in
net sales in the Japanese market may be found in this Part I, Item 2 of Form 
10-Q

                                  10
<PAGE>


under the subheading "Global Market Risks" included under the heading 
"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which 
information is hereby incorporated by reference. 

Domestic net sales declined 16% in the first quarter of 1998 over the 
comparable period of 1997, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products, partially offset by increases in the average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit. 

During the first quarter of 1998 compared with the comparable period of 1997, 
the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer 
markets decreased to 2.6% from 4.3%, and to 3.3% from 5.2%, respectively, 
based upon current market information provided by industry sources. 

The Company believes that quarterly net sales will be below the level of the 
prior year's comparable periods through at least the third fiscal quarter of
1998, if not longer. 

Q1 98 Compared with Q4 97

Net sales decreased 2% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth 
quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 4% in the first 
quarter of 1998 compared with the prior quarter. The effect on net sales of 
this decline in unit sales was partially offset by the successful introduction 
of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems in November 1997, which accounted 
for approximately 21% of the 635,000 systems shipped during the first quarter 
of 1998. In addition, net sales were positively impacted as the Company began 
marketing many of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the 
Company's on-line store, which opened in November 1997. The Company 
generated $15 million in revenue from its on-line store during the first 
quarter of 1998. Unit sales of peripheral products decreased 15% in the first 
quarter of 1998 compared with the prior quarter. The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh computer unit increased 5% as a result of a shift in mix 
from the Company's "Value" products to its "Flagship" line of high-
performance Power Macintosh computers and due to increases in the average 
aggregate revenue across most other product lines.

International net sales represented 50% of total net sales in the first 
quarter of 1998, compared with 42% in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
International net sales increased 16% in the first quarter of 1998 compared 
with the fourth quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of increases in 
Macintosh and peripheral unit net sales in Europe and increases in net sales 
of Macintosh units in Japan.

Domestic net sales decreased 16% in the first quarter of 1998 compared with 
the prior quarter due to decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, 
slightly offset by increases in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh 
and peripheral unit. 

During the first quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth quarter of 1997, the 
Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer 
markets decreased to 2.6% from 3.3%, and to 3.3% from 4.6%, respectively, 
based upon current market information provided by industry sources. 

Backlog

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any 
particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business 
prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or 
immediately following introduction of new products because of overordering 
by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and 
customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, 
as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not 
be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any 
particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information 
regarding the Company's backlog may be found in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 
10-Q under the subheading "Product Introductions and Transitions" included 
under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales and its 
cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of 
components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor costs. The type and cost of 
components included in particular configurations of the Company's products 
(such as memory and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to 
market products in configurations competitive with other manufacturers. 
Competition in the personal computer industry is intense and, in the short 
term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often 
necessary in order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by 
actions undertaken by the Company in response to industry wide competitive 
pressures. 

Gross margin increased from 18.6% to 22.4% of sales during the first quarter 
of 1998 compared to the same period of 1997, and increased from 19.8% to 
22.4% of sales compared to the fourth quarter of 1997. This was primarily as a 
result of a shift in revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin 
"Flagship" line of high-performance Power Macintosh computers, including 
Power Macintosh G3 systems, with relatively stable margins quarter-to-quarter 
on the Company's "Value" product line.

The gross margin levels in the first quarter of 1998 compared to the fourth 
quarter of 1997 were not significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange 
rates. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes 
in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations 
can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates. 

While the Company believes the overall gross margin levels achieved in the 
first quarter of 1998 are sustainable for several quarters, there can be no 
assurance that such margins will be maintained. In general, gross margins will 
remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, 
including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased 
competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential changes to the 
Company's product mix. In response to these downward pressures, the 
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its 
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to 
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate 
demand for certain of its products.

Research and development expenditures decreased in amount and as a

actions which resulted in reductions in headcount and cancellation of certain 
research and development related projects. 

The Company believes that continued and focused investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the 
marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new 
and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business 
strategy. The Company anticipates that research and development expenditures 
in the second quarter of 1998 will be comparable to those in the first quarter.

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the 
Company's debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for 
using the equity method, foreign exchange gains and losses not allowed 
to be recognized as revenue or cost of sales, and other 
miscellaneous income and expense items. Over the last two 
years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. The Company's cost of funds may 
increase in future periods as a result of the downgrading in the 
second quarter of 1997 of its senior and subordinated long-term 
debt to B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services, and the downgrading in October 1997 of its senior 
and subordinated long-term debt to B- and CCC, respectively, 
by Standard and Poor's Rating Agency. 

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes

As of December 26, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets 
arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and 
tax credits of $696 million before being offset against certain 
deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's 
balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable 
based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of December 26, 1997, a valuation allowance of $211 
million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the 
benefits of tax losses which may not be realized. Realization 
of approximately $85 million of the asset representing tax loss 
and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability 
to generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable 
income. Management believes that it is more likely than not 
that forecasted U.S. income, including income that may be 
generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be 
sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their 
expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will 
meet its expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the 
amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be 
reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future taxable 
U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. 
The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the 
deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and 
amount of the valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

Restructuring of Operations

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain 
restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, 
improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustainable 
profitability. During 1997, the Company announced and began 
to implement supplemental restructuring actions, including 
significant headcount reductions, to meet the foregoing 
objectives. There are several risks inherent in the Company's 
efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These include the 
risk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures 
quickly enough to restore sustainable profitability and the risk 
that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability 
to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry. 

Implementation of this restructuring involves several risks, 
including the risk that by simplifying and modifying its product 
line the Company will increase its dependence on fewer 
products, potentially reduce overall sales, and increase its 
reliance on unproven products and technology. Another risk of 
the restructuring is that by increasing the proportion of the 
Company's products to be manufactured under outsourcing 
arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality or 
quantity of the products manufactured and distributed, or lose 
the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules 
in order to respond to changing market conditions. As part of 
its restructuring, the Company announced and opened its on-
line store in November 1997, which makes available most of 
its products to end-users in the U.S. There can be no assurance 
the on-line store will result in greater sales. The Company also 
began manufacturing products on a build-to-order basis in 
November 1997. There can be no assurance this manufacturing 
process will result in decreased costs or increased gross margins. 
The Company is also reducing the number of wholesale and 
retail channel partners, particularly in the Americas, which 
places a greater volume of sales through fewer partners. There 
can be no assurance that this will not adversely impact the 
Company. In addition, the actions taken in connection with the 
restructuring could adversely affect employee morale, thereby 
damaging the Company's ability to retain and motivate 
employees. Also, because the Company contemplates relying 
to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements 
with third parties, the Company will have less direct control 
over certain of its research and development efforts, and its 
ability to create innovative new products may be reduced. In 
addition, there can be no assurance that the technologies 
acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key 
NeXT employees and processes will be retained and successfully 
integrated with those at Apple. Also, the restructuring includes 
the winding down of the Company's Mac OS licensing 
program. There can be no assurance that the winding down of 
this program will result in greater sales, market share, and 
increased gross margins to the Company. In addition, there can 
be no assurance that this action will not result in the 
availability of fewer application software titles for the Mac OS, 
which may result in a decrease to the Company's sales, market 
share and gross margins. Finally, even if the restructuring is 
successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will 
effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the 
Company. Although the Company believes that the actions it 
is taking in connection with the restructuring, including its 
acquisition of NeXT and the winding down of its Mac OS 
licensing program, should help restore marketplace confidence 
in the Company, there can be no assurance that such actions 
will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing 
its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring 
sustainable profitability. The Company's future consolidated 
operating results and financial condition could be adversely 
affected should it encounter difficulty in effectively managing 
the restructuring and new cost structure. 

Additional information relating to the restructuring of 
operations may be found in Part I of this Form 10-Q in Note 3 
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Unaudited), which information is hereby incorporated by 
reference. 

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer 
industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand 
patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must 
continuously introduce new products and technologies and 
enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. 
Recent introductions include certain PowerBook and Power 
Macintosh products, including the Power Macintosh G3 
computers in November 1997, and the introduction of Mac OS 
8 in July 1997. The success of new product introductions is 
dependent on a number of 

                                  14
<PAGE>


factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to 
manage the risks associated with product transitions, the 
availability of application software for new products, the 
effective management of inventory levels in line with 
anticipated product demand, the availability of products in 
appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk 
that new products may have quality or other defects in the early 
stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot 
determine the effect that new products will have on its sales or 
results of operations. In addition, although the number of new 
product introductions may decrease as a result of the Company's 
restructuring actions, the risks and uncertainties associated with 
new product introductions may increase as the Company 
refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments and to 
the extent new product introductions are in markets that are new 
to the Company. 

The rate of product shipments immediately following 
introduction of a new product is not necessarily an indication of 
the future rate of shipments for that product, which depends on 
many factors, some of which are not under the control of the 
Company. These factors may include initial large purchases by 
a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase 
new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users 
("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand 
by users who anticipated new technology and, as a result, 
deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by dealers 
who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. 
These factors may be offset by others, such as the deferral of 
purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as 
"proven" and for which commonly used software products are 
available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once they 
believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously 
in backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to 
the aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident 
with introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and 
customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of the new 
products. The Company has in the past experienced difficulty in 
anticipating demand for new products, resulting in product 
shortages which have adversely affected the Company's 
operating results. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is 
further complicated by the availability of different product 
configurations, which may include various types of built-in 
peripherals and software. Configurations may also require 
certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, 
as a result, demand in different geographic areas may be a 
function of the availability of third-party software in those 
localized versions. For example, the availability of European-
language versions of software products manufactured by U.S. 
producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions by a 
quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the 
Company's new products outside the U.S., even though 
localized versions of the Company's products may be available. 

The increasing integration of new or enhanced functions and 
complexity of operations of the Company's products also 
increase the risk that latent defects or other faults could be 
discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products 
have been produced or shipped. If such defects were significant, 
the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs 
under product warranties. 

The Company has announced plans for two operating systems. 
The Company plans to continue to introduce major upgrades to 
the current Mac OS and later introduce a new operating system 
(code named "Rhapsody") which is expected to offer advanced 
functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. 
However, the NeXT software technologies that the Company 
plans to use in the development of Rhapsody were not 
originally designed to be compatible with the Mac OS. As a 
result, there can be no assurance that the development of 
Rhapsody can be completed at reasonable cost or at all. In 
addition, Rhapsody may not be fully backward-compatible with 
all existing applications, which could result in a loss of 
existing customers. Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody 
or the planned enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain 
developer support and market acceptance. Inability to 
successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially 
backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to 
the current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market 
acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse 
impact on the Company's consolidated operating results and 
financial condition. 

                                  15

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure 
on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short 
product life cycles, continual improvement in product 
price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of 
consumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's 
consolidated results of operations and financial condition have 
been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by 
industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on 
gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid 
technological advances in software functionality and hardware 
performance and features based on existing or emerging industry 
standards. Many of the Company's competitors have greater 
financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological 
resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed 
customer bases than those of the Company. 

The Company's future consolidated operating results and 
financial condition may be affected by overall demand for 
personal computers and general customer preferences for one 
platform over another or one set of product features over 
another. 

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that 
uses the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in 
the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of 
computers that run the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 
NT operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac 
OS, with its perceived advantages over Windows, and the 
general reluctance of the Macintosh installed base to incur the 
costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind 
sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the past 
several years. Recent innovations in the Windows platform, 
including those included in Windows 95 and Windows NT, or 
those expected to be included in a new version of Windows to 
be introduced in 1998, have added features to the Windows 
platform that make the differences between the Mac OS and 
Microsoft's Windows operating systems less significant. The 
Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to 
respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its 
personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in 
the Windows platform. The Company's future consolidated 
operating results and financial condition will be substantially 
dependent on its ability to maintain continuing improvements 
to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived 
functional advantages over competing platforms. 

The Company had previously entered into agreements to license 
its Mac OS to other personal computer vendors (the "Clone 
Vendors") as part of an effort to increase the installed base for 
the Macintosh platform. The Company recently determined that 
the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors 
under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and 
costs of the licensing program. As a result, the Company 
agreed to acquire certain assets, including the license to 
distribute the Mac OS, of PCC, a Clone Vendor, and has no 
plans to renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements. 
Although the Company believes that this winding down of its 
licensing program will help reduce the adverse impact of the 
licensing program on the Company's sales, market share and 
gross margins, there can be no assurance that this will occur. In 
addition, there can be no assurance that this winding down of 
the licensing program will not result in the availability of fewer 
application software titles for the Mac OS, which may result in 
a decrease to the Company's sales, market share and gross 
margins. 

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from 
Windows and other platforms, the Company had previously 
devoted substantial resources toward developing personal 
computer products capable of running application software 
designed for the Windows operating systems. These products 
include an add-on card containing a Pentium or 586-class 
microprocessor that enables users to run applications 
concurrently that require the Mac OS, Windows 3.1 or 
Windows 95 operating systems. The Company plans to 
transition the cross-platform business to third-parties during 
1998. There can be no assurance that this transition will be 
successful. 

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation 
and Motorola, Inc. had agreed upon and announced the 
availability of specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-
based hardware platform (the "Platform"). These specifications 
defined a "unified" personal computer architecture that would 
have given the Clone Vendors broad access to the Power 
Macintosh platform and would have utilized standard industry 
components. The Company had intended to license the Mac OS 
to manufacturers of the Platform. However, the Company has 
decided it will no longer support the Platform based upon its 
decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing program, and 
because of 

                                  16
<PAGE>


little industry support for the Platform. The decision not to 
further develop this Platform may affect the Company's ability 
to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform. 

Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or 
announced their intention to target certain of the Company's 
key market segments, including education and publishing. 
Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, 
manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company. 

In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into 
patent cross licensing and technology agreements. Under these 
agreements, the companies provided patent cross licenses to 
each other. In addition, for a period of five years from August 
1997, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft 
Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS, and the 
Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac 
OS system software releases and make that product the default 
Internet browser for such releases. In addition, Microsoft 
purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series 'A' non-voting 
convertible preferred stock for $150 million. While the 
Company believes that its relationship with Microsoft will be 
beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the 
installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for 
a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which 
the Company competes with Microsoft, including the Windows 
platform. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an 
adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's 
relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance that 
the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will 
not be offset by the disadvantages. 

Support from Third-Party Software Developers

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal 
computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often 
based on the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications. The Company believes that the availability of 
third-party application software for the Company's hardware 
products depends in part on third-party developers' perception 
and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, 
and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus 
software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based 
on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and 
its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be 
generated, and the costs of developing such software products. 
To the extent the Company's recent financial losses and 
declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the 
Company's decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing 
program, have caused software developers to question the 
Company's prospects in the personal computer market, 
developers could be less inclined to develop new application 
software or upgrade existing software for the Company's 
products and more inclined to devote their resources to 
developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows 
market. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce a 
new operating system (code named "Rhapsody") could cause 
software developers to stop developing software for the current 
Mac OS. In addition, there can be no assurance that software 
developers will decide to develop software for the new operating 
system on a timely basis or at all. 

Microsoft is an important developer of application software for 
the Company's products. Although the Company has entered 
into a relationship with Microsoft, which includes Microsoft's 
agreement to develop and ship future versions of its Microsoft 
Office and Internet Explorer products and certain other Microsoft 
tools for the Mac OS, such relationship is for a limited term 
and does not cover many areas in which the Company competes 
with Microsoft. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing 
application software for the Mac OS not covered by the 
relationship or upon expiration of the relationship may be 
influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the 
vendor of the Windows operating system. 

Global Market Risks

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's 
consolidated operations and financial results could be 
significantly affected by risks associated with international 
activities, including economic and labor conditions, political 
instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign 
subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus 
the local currency in which the products are sold. 

Countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have 
recently experienced weaknesses in their currency, banking and 
equity markets. These weaknesses could adversely affect 
consumer demand for the Company's products, 


                                  17
<PAGE>


the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency 
denominated sales, the availability and supply of product 
components to the Company, and ultimately the Company's 
consolidated results of operations. 

When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the 
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. 
When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-
U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. 
dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the 
U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar 
strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net receiver of 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from 
a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar 
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in 
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales 
and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in 
the interest rates of many of the world's leading industrialized 
countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most 
sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest 
rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the 
interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign 
currency hedges. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. 
interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap, 
collar, and floor transactions. 

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's 
foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to 
monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, 
the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward 
and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor 
positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with 
its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related 
exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an 
economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of 
the Company's risk management activities, there can be no 
assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more 
than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from 
unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest 
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition 
of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for 
any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and 
losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, 
therefore, may adversely affect the Company's consolidated 
operating results and financial position. The Company does not 
engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition may increase the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of 
the hedging transactions into which the Company's 
counterparties are willing to enter. 

Inventory and Supply

The Company makes a provision for inventories of products 
that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated 
demand, accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for 
inventories that have been canceled, and accrues for the 
estimated costs to correct any product quality problems. 
Although the Company believes its inventory and related 
provisions are adequate given the rapid and unpredictable pace of 
product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can 
be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory 
and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may 
again have, a material effect on the Company's consolidated 
financial position and results of operations. 

The Company must order components for its products and build 
inventory well in advance of product shipments. Because the 
Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology 
and price changes, there is a risk that the Company will forecast 
incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of 
particular products. The Company's consolidated operating 
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in 
the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's 
ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term 
shifts in customer demand patterns. 

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole 
or in part by third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design 
specifications of the Company or otherwise. As part of its 
restructuring actions, the Company sold its Fountain, 
Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI and entered into a 
related manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI; sold its 
Singapore printed circuit board manufacturing assets to NatSteel 
Electronics Pte., Ltd., which is 

                                  18
<PAGE>


expected to supply main logic boards to the Company under a 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement; entered into an 
agreement with Ryder Integrated Logistics, Inc. to outsource the 
Company's domestic operations transportation and logistics 
management; and has entered into other similar agreements to 
outsource the Company's European operations transportation 
and logistics management. As a result of the foregoing actions, 
the proportion of the Company's products produced and 
distributed under outsourcing arrangements will continue to 
increase. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed 
cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the 
Company has over production and distribution. It is uncertain 
what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or 
quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the 
Company to respond to changing market conditions. 
Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its 
inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the 
Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the 
arrangement. Moreover, although arrangements with such 
manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense 
reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially 
responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. 
Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty 
liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any 
unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether 
pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or 
otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future 
consolidated operating results and financial condition. 

Although certain components essential to the Company's 
business are generally available from multiple sources, other 
key components (including microprocessors and application 
specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by 
the Company from single sources. If the supply of a key 
single-sourced component were to be delayed or curtailed, the 
Company's business and financial performance could be 
adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain 
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and 
obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The 
Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the 
personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs 
presents the most significant potential for constraining the 
Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced 
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for 
production and thus have limited availability. The Company 
and other producers in the personal computer industry also 
compete for other semiconductor products with other industries 
that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to 
either increased consumer demand or increased use of 
semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and 
automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some 
components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry (including certain microprocessors and 
ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be 
affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the 
production of common components instead of components 
customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product 
supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could 
decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the 
Company's consolidated operating results and financial 
condition. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive 
products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and 
Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC 
microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to 
supply to the Company in adequate numbers microprocessors 
that produce superior price/performance results compared with 
those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel 
Corporation, and other developers and producers of the 
microprocessors used by most personal computers using the 
Windows operating systems. The desire of IBM and Motorola 
to continue producing these microprocessors may be influenced 
by Microsoft's decision not to adapt its Windows NT operating 
system software to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. IBM 
produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as 
well as workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, 
and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating 
system to the Company's Mac OS. Accordingly, IBM's interest 
in supplying the Company with microprocessors for the 
Company's products may be influenced by IBM's perception of 
its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers 
and as a competing operating system vendor. In addition, 
Motorola has recently announced its intention to stop producing 
Macintosh clones. As a result, Motorola may be less inclined 
to continue to produce PowerPC microprocessors. 

The Company's current financial condition and uncertainties 
related to recent events could affect the terms on which 
suppliers are willing to supply the Company with their 
products. There can be no assurance that the Company's current 
suppliers will continue to supply the Company on terms 
acceptable to the Company or that the Company will be able to 
obtain comparable products from alternate sources on such 
terms. The Company's future consolidated operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company 
is unable to continue to obtain key components on terms 
substantially similar to those currently available to the 
Company.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and 
distribution of the Company's products. Currently, the 
Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, 
mass merchants, and cataloguers (collectively referred to as 
"resellers") and direct to higher education institutions. In 
addition, in November 1997 the Company began selling many 
of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the 
Company's on-line store. Many of the Company's significant 
resellers operate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers 
also distribute products from competing manufacturers. The 
Company's business and financial results could be adversely 
affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened or 
if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not to 
continue to distribute the Company's products. 

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may 
continue to cause resellers to reduce their ordering and 
marketing of the Company's products. In addition, the 
Company has in the past and may in the future experience 
delays in ordering by resellers in light of uncertain demand for 
the Company's products. Under the Company's arrangements 
with its resellers, resellers have the option to reduce or 
eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances 
without financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to 
return products to the Company without penalty within certain 
limits, beyond which they may be assessed fees. The Company 
has recently revised its channel program, including decreasing 
the number of resellers and reducing returns, price protection 
and certain rebate programs, in an effort to reduce channel 
inventory, increase inventory turns, increase product support 
within the channel and improve gross margins. In addition, in 
November 1997 the Company opened its on-line store in the 
U.S. which makes many of the Company's products available 
directly to the end-user. Although the Company believes the 
foregoing changes will improve its consolidated operating 
results and financial condition, there can be no assurance that 
this will occur. 

Change in Senior Management

On July 9, 1997, the Company announced that Dr. Gilbert F. 
Amelio had resigned his positions as Chairman of the Board and 
Chief Executive Officer and that the Company was initiating a 
search for a new Chief Executive Officer. While the Company 
intends to name a new Chief Executive Officer as soon as 
practicable, there can be no assurance that the change in senior 
management and related uncertainties will not adversely affect 
the Company's consolidated operating results and financial 
condition during the period until a new Chief Executive Officer 
is hired and afterward. In addition, certain members of the 
Company's senior management have been with the Company 
for less than twelve months. There can be no assurance that 
new members of the management team can be successfully 
assimilated, that the Company will be able to satisfactorily 
allocate responsibilities or that such new members of its 
management will succeed in their roles in a timely and efficient 
manner. The Company's failure to recruit, retain and assimilate 
new executives, or the failure of any such executive to perform 
effectively, or the loss of any such executive, could have a 
material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 

Changes to Board of Directors

The Company announced on August 6, 1997 significant 
changes to its Board of Directors, replacing all but two former 
directors. The continuing directors are Gareth C.C. Chang, 
Corporate Senior Vice President, Marketing, Hughes 
Electronics and President, Hughes International, and Edgar S. 
Woolard, Jr., retired Chairman of E.I. DuPont de Nemours & 
Company. The new directors are William V. Campbell, 
President and CEO of Intuit Corp.; Lawrence J. Ellison, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oracle Corp.; Steven 
P. Jobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pixar 
Animation Studios; and Jerome B. York, Vice Chairman of 
Tracinda Corporation and former Chief Financial Officer of IBM 
and Chrysler Corporation. 

Dependence on Key Employees

During the past several years, the Company has experienced 
significant voluntary employee turnover as a result of 
employees' concerns over the Company's prospects, as well as 
the abundance of career opportunities available elsewhere. The 
Company is dependent on its key employees in order to achieve 
its business plan. There can be no assurance the Company will 
be able to attract, motivate and retain key employees. Failure to 
do so may have a significant effect on the Company's 
consolidated operating results and financial condition. 
                                  20
<PAGE>


Other Factors

The Company is in the process of identifying operating and 
application software challenges related to the year 2000. While 
the Company expects to resolve year 2000 compliance issues 
substantially through normal replacement and upgrades of 
software, there can be no assurance that there will not be 
interruption of operations or other limitations of system 
functionality or that the Company will not incur substantial 
costs to avoid such limitations. Any failure to effectively 
monitor, implement or improve the Company's operational, 
financial, management and technical support systems could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and 
consolidated results of operations. 

The majority of the Company's research and development 
activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business 
operations, including certain major vendors, are located near 
major seismic faults. The Company's consolidated operating 
results and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected in the event of a major earthquake. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and 
countries may subject the Company to environmental and other 
regulations which include, in some instances, the requirement 
that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return 
to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave 
responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling 
with the Company. It is unclear what effect such regulations 
will have on the Company's future consolidated operating 
results and financial condition. 

The Company recently decided to replace its existing transaction 
systems in the U.S. (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated 
system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational 
efficiency. Substantially all of the transaction systems in the 
European operations were replaced with the same integrated 
system in 1997. The Company's future consolidated operating 
results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the 
Company is unable to implement and effectively manage the 
transition to this new integrated system. 

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors 
affecting the Company's consolidated operating results and 
financial condition, past financial performance should not be 
considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or 
trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's 
participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in 
significant volatility of the Company's common stock price. 

                                      21

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's consolidated financial position with respect to 
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 
$1,627 million as of December 26, 1997, from $1,459 million 
as of September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash 
equivalent balances as of December 26, 1997 and September 26, 
1997 include $164 million and $165 million, respectively, 
pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily 
associated with the Company's purchase commitments under 
the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash generated by operations during the first quarter of 1998 
totaled $143 million. Cash generated by operations was 
primarily the result of positive earnings and decreases in 
accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by  
decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment 
totaled $7 million in the first quarter of 1998, and consisted 
primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and 
equipment. The Company expects that the level of capital 
expenditures in the second quarter of 1998 will increase slightly 
as compared to the first quarter.

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been 
downgraded to non-investment grade. In October 1997, the 
Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt were 
downgraded to B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency. The Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt ratings by Moody's Investor Services remain 
unchanged from the second quarter of 1997, when they were 
downgraded to B3 and Caa2, respectively. Both Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency and Moody's Investor Services have the 
Company on negative outlook. These actions may increase the 
Company's cost of funds in future periods. In addition, the 
Company may be required to pledge additional collateral with 
respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to 
agree to more stringent covenants than in the past. 

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash 
equivalents and short-term investments, and continued short-
term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash 
requirements over the next twelve months. Expected cash 
requirements over the next twelve months include an estimated 
$102 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, 
most of which will be effected during fiscal 1998. No assurance 
can be given that any additional required financing could be 
obtained should the restructuring plan take longer to implement 
than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable 
to obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, and 
financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal 
income tax deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and 
the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. The 
Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions 
with the U.S. Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed 
income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. 
Although a substantial number of the issues for these years 
have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are 
being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp et al.
In January 1996, a purported shareholder class action styled 
Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp et. al was 
filed in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County 
naming the Company and its then directors as defendants. The 
complaint sought injunctive relief and damages and alleged that 
acts of mismanagement resulted in a depressed price for the 
Company. In February 1996, the complaint was amended to add 
a former director as a defendant and to add purported class and 
derivative claims based on theories such as breach of fiduciary 
duty, misrepresentation, and insider trading. In July 1996, the 
Court sustained defendants' demurrer and dismissed the amended 
complaint on a variety of grounds and granted plaintiffs leave to 
amend the complaint. In October 1996, the plaintiffs filed a 
second amended complaint naming the Company's then 
directors and certain former directors as defendants and again 
alleging purported class and derivative claims, seeking 
injunctive relief and damages (compensatory and punitive) based 
on theories such as breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation, 
and insider trading. In July 1997, the Court granted in part and 
denied in part the Company's motion to strike most of the 
substantive allegations of the second amended complaint. The 
Court sustained the demurrer to plaintiffs' class claims but 
overruled the demurrer to the shareholder derivative claims. In 
September 1997, the Company brought a motion to reconsider 
portions of the court order. The Third Amended Complaint 
was filed in October 1997, and eliminated the class action 
claims and restated claims against certain directors and former 
directors. In November 1997, the Company's Board of Directors 
appointed a special investigation committee and engaged 
independent counsel to assist in the investigation of the claims 
made in the Third Amended Complaint. Also in November 
1997, the Company filed a demurrer to the Third Amended 
Complaint. A hearing is set for February 1998.

LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et al.
In May 1996, an action was filed in the California Superior 
Court for Alameda County naming as defendants the Company 
and certain of its current and former officers and directors. The 
complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and 
generally alleges that the defendants misrepresented or omitted 
material facts about the Company's operations and financial 
results, which plaintiff contends artificially inflated the price of 
the Company's stock. The case was transferred to the California 
Superior Court for Santa Clara County. In July 1997, the 
Court sustained the Company's demurrer dismissing the 
amended complaint with leave to amend, after which plaintiff 
served a second amended complaint. In September 1997, the 
Company and the two remaining individual defendants (former 
directors Markkula and Spindler) brought a motion to dismiss 
the second amended complaint. In October 1997, the Court 
granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety with leave to 
amend as to certain defendants and claims. In November 1997, 
the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, adding a former 
director as a defendant and alleging further misrepresentations by 
the defendants about the Company's operations and financial 
results. In January 1998, the Company and the three individual 
defendants brought a motion to dismiss the third amended 
complaint, which is set for hearing in February 1998.

"Repetitive Stress Injury" Litigation
The Company is named in approximately 60 lawsuits, alleging 
that plaintiffs incurred so-called "repetitive stress" injuries to 
their upper extremities as a result of using keyboards and/or 
mouse input devices sold by the Company. These actions are 
similar to those filed against other major suppliers of personal 
computers. In October 1996, the Company prevailed in the first 
full trial to go to verdict against the Company. Since then, 
approximately ten lawsuits have been dismissed with prejudice 
by the plaintiffs, and two others have been dismissed by court 
order. The remaining actions are in various stages of pretrial 
activity. Ultimate resolution of these cases may depend on 
industry-wide progress in resolving similar litigation, as well as 
on the impact of the recent decision handed down by the New 
York Court of Appeals in the case of Blanco v. American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co. (a majority of the cases naming 
the Company as a defendant were filed in New York, and are 
subject to the decision). In that decision, the court announced a 
new standard for determining when the statute of limitations 
period begins to accrue in so-

                                  23
<PAGE>


called "repetitive stress" injury cases. While the decision could 
result in the revival of some cases which were previously 
dismissed, the decision will not cause the Company to alter its 
strategy in these cases.

Monitor-Size Litigation
In August 1995, the Company was named, along with 41 other 
entities, including computer manufacturers and computer 
monitor vendors, in a putative nationwide class action filed in 
the California Superior Court for Orange County, styled Keith 
Long et al. v. AAmazing Technologies Corp. et al. The 
complaint alleges that each of the defendants engaged in false or 
misleading advertising with respect to the size of computer 
monitor screens. Also in August 1995, the Company was 
named as the sole defendant in a purported class action alleging 
similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for 
Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. Apple Computer, 
Inc. Subsequently, in November 1995, the Company, along 
with 26 other entities, was named in a purported class action 
alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court 
for Essex County, entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple 
Computer, Inc. et al. Similar putative class actions have been 
filed in other California counties in which the Company was 
not named as a defendant. The complaints in all of these cases 
seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, 
damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. In December 
1995, the California Judicial Council ordered all of the 
California actions, including Long, coordinated for purposes of 
pretrial proceedings and trial before a single judge, the 
Honorable William Cahill, sitting in the County of San 
Francisco. All of the California actions were subsequently 
coordinated under the name In re Computer Monitor Litigation, 
and a master consolidated complaint was filed superseding all of 
the individual complaints in those actions. In July 1996, Judge 
Cahill ordered all of the California cases dismissed without 
leave to amend as to plaintiffs residing in California on the 
ground that a stipulated judgment entered in September 1995 in 
a prior action brought by the California Attorney General 
alleging the same cause of action was res judicata as to the 
plaintiffs in the consolidated California class action suits. This 
order may be subject to appellate review at a later stage of the 
proceedings. Both the New Jersey cases and the consolidated 
California cases are at a preliminary stage, with no discovery 
having taken place. In March 1997, the Court in the case styled 
In re Computer Monitor Litigation  preliminarily approved a 
proposed settlement to which the Company and all but three of 
the other defendants in the action would be parties and 
provisionally certified a nationwide settlement class with 
respect thereto. A hearing regarding final approval of the 
proposed settlement was held on June 30, 1997 and the Court's 
decision is pending. If approved, the Company does not 
anticipate its obligations pursuant to the proposed settlement 
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of 
operations or financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements. 

Exponential Technology v. Apple
Plaintiff alleges in a lawsuit styled Exponential Technology, 
Inc. v. Apple Computer, Inc. that the Company, which was an 
investor in Exponential, breached its fiduciary duty to 
Exponential by misusing confidential information about its 
financial situation to cause Exponential to fail, and that the 
Company fraudulently misrepresented the facts about allowing 
Exponential to sell its processors to the Company Mac OS 
licensees. The lawsuit is filed in California State Court in 
Santa Clara County. In November 1997, the Company filed a 
demurrer to portions of the complaint, which the court granted 
in part. In January 1998, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint.

Other
On August 21, 1997, the Federal Trade Commission issued its 
consent decree against the Company, regarding the Company's 
past processor upgrade practices, specifically certain 
advertisements which the Commission deemed to have 
misrepresented the Company's marketing of certain 
microprocessor upgrade products. Pursuant to the order, the 
Company is ordered to cease and desist from any such allegedly 
misleading advertising, to give notice to consumers, and to 
implement certain programs enabling consumers who are 
within the order's scope to obtain upgrade kits or rebates, in 
connection with any purchases within the scope of the order. 
The Company has complied with all provisions of the order 
currently effective, and has filed its 60-day compliance with the 
Commission on October 17, 1997.

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with 
third parties, investigations and pending actions involving 
allegations of false or misleading advertising, product defects, 
discrimination, infringement of intellectual property rights, and 
breach of contract and other matters against the Company and 
its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its business. The 
liability, if any, associated with these matters is not 
determinable. 

                                  24
<PAGE>


The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above 
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
as reported in the accompanying financial statements. However, 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable 
resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's 
future consolidated results of operations or cash flows could be 
materially affected in a particular period.

                          APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
                            1990 STOCK OPTION PLAN
                         (as amended through 11/5/97)

	1.	Purposes of the Plan.  The purposes of this 1990 Stock 
Option Plan are to attract and retain high quality personnel for 
positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional 
incentive to Employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its 
Affiliated Companies and to promote the success of the Company's 
business.  This Plan succeeds to and replaces the Company's 1981 
Stock Option Plan.  Options granted under the Plan may be incentive 
stock options (as defined under Section 422 of the Code) or non-
statutory stock options, as determined by the Administrator at the 
time of grant of an option and subject to the applicable provisions of 
Section 422 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated 
thereunder.  Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may be granted 
under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of 
Options.

	2.	Definitions.  As used herein, the following definitions 
shall apply:

	(a)	"Administrator" means the Board or any of its 
Committees, as shall be administering the Plan from time to time 
pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan.

	(b)	"Affiliated Company" means a corporation which is not a 
Subsidiary but with respect to which the Company owns, directly or 
indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, at least 20% of the total 
voting power, unless the Administrator determines in its discretion 
that such corporation is not an Affiliated Company.

	(c)	"Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

	(d)	"Common Stock" means the Common Stock, no par 
value, of the Company.

	(e)	"Company" means Apple Computer, Inc., a California 
corporation, or its successor.

	(f)	"Committee" means a Committee, if any, appointed by 
the Board in accordance with paragraph (a) of Section 4 of the Plan.

	(g)	"Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended from time to time, and any successor thereto.

	(h)	"Continuous Status as an Employee" means the absence of 
any interruption or termination of the employment relationship with the Company
 or any Subsidiary or Affiliated Company.  Continuous Status as an Employee 
shall not be considered interrupted in the case of (i) medical leave, military 
leave, family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the 
Administrator, provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in 
termination of the employment relationship with the Company or any 
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company, as the case may be, under the terms of the 
respective Company policy for such leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers 
between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Subsidiaries, 
its successor or its Affiliated Companies.

	(i)	"Director" means a member of the Board.

	(j)	"Employee" means any person, including Officers and 
Directors, employed by and on the payroll of the Company, any Subsidiary or 
any Affiliated Company.  The payment of Directors' fees by the Company shall 
not be sufficient to constitute "employment" by the Company.

	(k)	"Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended.
                                       29
<PAGE>
	(l)	"Fair Market Value" means the value of Common Stock 
determined as follows:

	(i)	If the Common Stock is listed on any established stock 
exchange or a national market system (including without limitation the 
National Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers, 
Inc. Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ") System), its Fair Market Value shall be the 
closing sales price for such stock or the closing bid if no sales were 
reported, as quoted on such system or exchange (or the exchange with the 
greatest volume of trading in the Common Stock) for the date of determination 
or, if the date of determination is not a trading day, the immediately 
preceding trading day, as reported in The Wall Street Journal or such other 
source as the Administrator deems reliable.

	(ii)	If the Common Stock is regularly quoted on the NASDAQ System (but not

determination or, if there are no quoted prices on the date of determination, 
on the last day on which there are quoted prices prior to the date of 
determination.

(iii)   	In the absence of an established market for the Common Stock, the Fair 
Market Value thereof shall be determined in good faith by the Administrator.

of the Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be optioned and
sold under the Plan or for which SARs may be granted and exercised is 
52,200,000 Shares (including Shares issued under the 1981 Stock Option Plan, 
to which this Plan is a successor).  The Shares may be authorized but unissued 
or reacquired Common Stock.

	In the discretion of the Administrator, any or all of the Shares authorized 
under the Plan may be subject to SARs issued pursuant to the Plan.

                                      30
<PAGE>

	If an Option or SAR issued under this Plan or under the Company's 1981 Stock 
Option Plan should expire or become unexercisable for any reason without 
having been exercised in full, the unpurchased Shares which were subject 
thereto shall, unless this Plan shall have been terminated, become available
 for other Options or SARs under this Plan.  However, should the Company 
reacquire Shares which were issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or 
SAR, such Shares shall not become available for future grant under the Plan.

	Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Employee may be
granted Options and SARs covering in the aggregate more than 1.5 million 
shares of Common Stock (the "Limit") in a fiscal year beginning on or after 
September 30, 1995.  Each share underlying a SAR not granted in tandem with
an Option shall be applied against the Limit, regardless of the number of 
shares deliverable or delivered upon exercise of the SAR; provided, however, 
that shares of Common Stock underlying a tandem grant of Options and SARs 
shall be counted only once in calculating the Limit.  The Limit shall not 
apply to grants of Options and SARs made prior to September 30, 1995."

	4.	Administration of the Plan.

		(a)	Composition of Administrator.

			(1)	Multiple Administrative Bodies.  If 
permitted by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act or 
any successor rule thereto, as in effect at the time that discretion is 
being exercised with respect to the Plan ("Rule 16b-3"), and by the 
legal requirements relating to the administration of stock plans such 
as the Plan, if any, of applicable securities laws, California corporate 
law and the Code (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), the Plan may 
(but need not) be administered by different administrative bodies 
with respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors 
who are Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) 
Employees who are neither Directors nor Officers.

				(2)	Administration with respect to 
Directors and Officers.  With respect to grants and awards to 
Employees who are also Officers or Directors of the Company, the 
Plan may be administered by (A) the Board, if the Board may 
administer the Plan in compliance with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to 
grants to Officers and Directors, or (B) a Committee designated by 
the Board to administer the Plan, which Committee shall be 
constituted (I) in such a manner as to permit the Plan and grants and 
awards thereunder to comply with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to grants 
to Officers and Directors and (II) in such a manner as to satisfy the 
Applicable Laws.

				(3)	Administration with respect to Other 
Persons.  With respect to grants and awards to Employees who are 
neither Directors nor Officers of the Company, the Plan may be 
administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee designated by the 
Board, which Committee shall be constituted in such a manner as to 
satisfy the Applicable Laws.

				(4)	General.  Once a Committee has 
been appointed pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this Section 4(a), 
such Committee shall continue to serve in its designated capacity 
until otherwise directed by the Board.  From time to time the Board 
may increase the size of any Committee and appoint additional 
members thereof, remove members (with or without cause) and 
appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill vacancies 
(however caused) and remove all members of a Committee and 
thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by 
the Applicable Laws and, in the case of a Committee appointed 
under subsection (2) to the extent permitted by Rule 16b-3 as it 
applies to grants to Officers and Directors.

		(b)	Powers of the Administrator.  Subject to the 
provisions of the Plan and, in the case of a Committee, subject to the 
specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the 
Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to 
determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in accordance 
with Section 2(l) of the Plan; (ii) to determine, in accordance with 
Section 8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per Share of Options and 
SARs to be granted; (iii) to determine the Employees to whom, and 
the time or times at which, Options and SARs shall be granted and 
the number of Shares to be represented by each Option or SAR 
(including without limitation whether or not a corporation shall be 
excluded from the definition of Affiliated Company under Section 
2(b)); (iv) to interpret the Plan; (v) to determine the terms and 
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Option 
or SAR granted hereunder (including, but not limited to, any 
restriction or limitation, or any vesting acceleration or waiver of 
forfeiture restrictions regarding any Option or SAR and/or the 
Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the 
Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion); (vi) to approve 
forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vii) to prescribe, amend 
and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (viii) to 
modify or amend each Option or SAR (with the consent of the 
Optionee) or accelerate the exercise date of any Option or SAR; (ix) 
to reduce the exercise price of any Option or SAR to the then current 
Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by such Option or SAR shall have declined since the date the 
Option or SAR was granted; (x) to authorize any person to execute 
on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effectuate the 
grant of an Option or SAR previously granted by the Administrator; 
and (xi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or 
advisable for the administration of the Plan.

                                      31
<PAGE>
		(c)	Effect of Decisions by the Administrator.  All 
decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Administrator 
shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of 
any Options.

		(d)	Anything in the Plan to the contrary 
notwithstanding, on and after September 30, 1995, grants of Options 
and SARs under the Plan to Officers shall be made only by a 
Committee consisting of at least two directors of the Company who 
qualify as "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) 
of the Code, and such Committee shall exercise all of the authority 
delegated under the Plan to the Administrator with respect to grants 
to Officers made on and after that date.

	5.	Eligibility.  Options and SARs may be granted only to 
Employees. An Employee who has been granted an Option or SAR 
may, if he or she is otherwise eligible, be granted an additional 
Option or Options, SAR or SARs. Each Option shall be evidenced by 
a written Option agreement, which shall expressly identify the 
Options as Incentive Stock Options or as Nonstatutory Stock 
Options, and which shall be in such form and contain such 
provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem 
appropriate.  However, notwithstanding such designation, to the 
extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with 
respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options and 
options granted under other plans of the Company or any Parent or 
Subsidiary that are designated as incentive stock options are 
exercisable for the first time by an Optionee during any calendar 
year exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as 
Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, (i) Options shall be taken into account in the order in which 
they were granted, and (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares shall 
be determined as of the time the Option or other incentive stock 
option with respect to such Shares is granted.  Without limiting the 
foregoing, the Administrator may, at any time, or from time to time, 
authorize the Company, with the consent of the respective recipients, 
to issue new Options or Options in exchange for the surrender and 
cancellation of any or all outstanding Options, other options, SARs 
or other stock appreciation rights.

	Neither the Plan nor any Option or SAR agreement shall 
confer upon any Optionee any right with respect to continuation of 
employment by the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary or 
Affiliated Company), nor shall it interfere in any way with the 
Optionee's right or the right of the Company (or any Parent, 
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company) to terminate the Optionee's 
employment at any time or for any reason.

	6.	Term of Plan.  The Plan shall become effective upon its 
adoption by the Board or its approval by vote of the holders of a 
majority of the outstanding Shares of the Company entitled to vote 
on the adoption of the Plan, whichever is earlier.  It shall continue in 
effect for a term of ten (10) years unless sooner terminated under 
Section 14 of the Plan.

	7.	Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be ten 
(10) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may 
be provided in the Option agreement.  However, in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the 
Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more 
than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of 
the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option 
shall be five (5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter 
time as may be provided in the Option agreement.
                                      32
<PAGE>
	8.	Exercise Price and Consideration.

		(a)	Exercise Price.  The per Share exercise price for 
the Shares issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is 
determined by the Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 
100% of the Fair Market Value of Common Stock, determined as of 
the date of grant of the Option.  In the event that the Administrator 
shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise price shall be no less than 
100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of that reduction.  In no 
event shall the per Share exercise price be less than 110% of the Fair 
Market Value per Share as of the date of grant in the case of an 
Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, immediately 
before the grant of such Option, owns Shares representing more than 
10% of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the 
Company or any Parent or Subsidiary.
		(b)	Method of Payment.  The consideration to be paid 
for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the 
method of payment, shall be determined by the Administrator (and, 
in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the 
time of grant) and may consist of (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) promissory 
note, (iv) other Shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of 
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to 
which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery of a properly 
executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a 
broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale or 
loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (vi) any 
combination of the foregoing methods of payment and/or any other 
consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted under 
applicable corporate law.

	9.	Stock Appreciation Rights.

		(a)	Granted in Connection with Options.  At the sole 
discretion of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection 
with all or any part of an Option, either concurrently with the grant 
of the Option or at any time thereafter during the term of the Option.  
The following provisions apply to SARs that are granted in 
connection with Options:

			(i)	The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to 
exercise the SAR by surrendering to the Company unexercised a 
portion of the related Option.  The Optionee shall receive in 
exchange from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the 
Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR of the Common 
Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related Option over 
(y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the 
surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that 
may be paid upon exercise of an SAR; provided, however, that such 
limit shall not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.

		(ii)	When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to 
the extent surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.

		(iii)	An SAR shall be exercisable only when and to 
the extent that the related Option is exercisable and shall 
expire no later than the date on which the related Option 
expires.

			(iv)	An SAR may only be exercised at a time 
when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by the 
related Option exceeds the exercise price of the Common Stock 
covered by the related Option.
 
 		(b)	Independent SARs.  At the sole discretion of the 
Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options.  The 
following provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in 
connection with Options:

		(i)	The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising 
the SAR, to receive from the Company an amount equal to the 
excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date of such 
exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date on 
which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the 
Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be 
paid upon exercise of an SAR.
                                      33
<PAGE>
		(ii)	SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at 
such times as the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's 
SAR agreement. 

		(c)	Form of Payment.  The Company's obligation 
arising upon the exercise of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock 
or in cash, or in any combination of Common Stock and cash, as the 
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine.  Shares issued 
upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their Fair Market 
Value as of the date of exercise.

		(d)	Rule 16b-3.  SARs granted to persons who are 
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Insiders") shall contain 
such additional restrictions as may be required to be contained in the 
plan or SAR agreement in order for the SAR to qualify for the 
maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.

	10.	Method of Exercise.

		(a)	Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder.  Any 
Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times 
and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and 
as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.

		An Option or SAR shall be deemed to be exercised 
when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company 
in accordance with the terms of the Option or SAR by the person 
entitled to exercise the Option or SAR and full payment for the 
Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been 
received by the Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the 
Administrator (and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, 
determined at the time of grant) and permitted by the Option 
agreement, consist of any consideration and method of payment 
allowable under Section 8(b) of the Plan.  Until the issuance (as 
evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or 
of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock 
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive 
dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with 
respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the 
Option.  No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right 
for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is 
issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option or 
SAR may not be exercised with respect to a fraction of a Share.

		Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a 
decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be available, 
both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the 
number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  Exercise of an 
SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised, result in 
a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be 
available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be 
exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.

		(b)	Rule 16b-3.  Options and SARs granted to 
Insiders must comply with Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such 
additional conditions or restrictions as may be required thereunder 
to be contained in the Plan or the agreement to qualify for the 
maximum exemption from Section 16 of the Exchange Act with 
respect to Plan transactions.

		(c)	Termination of Continuous Employment.  Upon 
termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other 
than termination by reason of the Optionee's death), the Optionee 
may, but only within ninety (90) days after the date of such 
termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that it 
was exercisable at the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the 
date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

		(d)	Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an 
Optionee:

		(1)	Who is at the time of death an Employee and who shall have been in 
Continuous Status as an Employee since the date of grant of the Option, the 
Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months (or such 
other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the
Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or by a 
person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or 
inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have 
                                      34
<PAGE>
accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated his or her employment 
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months 
as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death; or

		(2)	Within ninety (90) days after the termination of 
Continuous Status as an Employee, the Option or SAR may be 
exercised, at any time within six (6) months (or such other 
period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as 
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death 
by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right 
to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to 
the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date 
of termination.

		Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or 
SAR may not be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would 
otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time from the 
date of grant.

		(e)	Stock Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax 
Obligations.  When an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with 
the exercise of an Option or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax 
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is 
obligated to pay the Company an amount required to be withheld 
under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may satisfy the withholding 
tax obligation (including, at the election of the Optionee, any 
additional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in 
order to satisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax 
in connection with the exercise) by electing to have the Company 
withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, 
or the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR, if any, that 
number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount 
required to be withheld (and any additional amount desired to be 
withheld, as aforesaid).  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be 
withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be 
withheld is to be determined (the "Tax Date").

		All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld 
for this purpose shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the 
Administrator and shall be subject to the following restrictions:

			(i)	the election must be made on or prior to 
the applicable Tax Date; and
			(ii)	all elections shall be subject to the consent 
or disapproval of the Administrator.

		In the event the election to have Shares withheld is 
made by an Optionee and the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 
of the Code because no election is filed under Section 83(b) of the 
Code, the Optionee shall receive the full number of Shares with 
respect to which the Option or SAR is exercised but such Optionee 
shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back to the Company the 
proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.

	11.	Non-Transferability of Options.  Options and SARs may 
not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or 
disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of 
descent or distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations 
order as defined by the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder, provided, however, 
that the Administrator may grant non-qualified stock options that 
are freely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an 
Optionee or holder of an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An 
Option or an SAR may be exercised, during the lifetime of the 
Optionee or SAR holder, only by the Optionee or SAR holder or by a 
transferee permitted by this Section 11.

	12.	Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.

		(a)	Changes in Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by 
the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each 
outstanding Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been 
authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have 
yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or 
expiration of an Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each 
such outstanding Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any 
increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock 
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of 
the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number 
of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; 
provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the 
Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of 
consideration."  Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose 
                                      35
<PAGE>
determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.  
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of 
shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of 
stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof 
shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject 
to an Option or SAR.

		(b)	Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the 
proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding 
Options and SARs will terminate immediately prior to the 
consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided 
by the Administrator.  The Administrator may, in the exercise of its 
sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or SAR 
shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator and give each 
Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or 
any part of the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares as to which 
the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.

		(c)	Sale of Assets or Merger. Subject to the provisions 
of paragraph (d) hereof, in the event of a proposed sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the 
Company with or into another corporation, each outstanding Option 
and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or stock 
appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor corporation 
or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the 
Administrator determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in 
lieu of such assumption or substitution, that the Optionee shall have 
the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR would not 
otherwise be exercisable.  If the Administrator makes an Option or 
SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the 
event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall notify the 
Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a 
period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the 
Option or SAR will terminate upon the expiration of such period.  
For purposes of this paragraph, an Option granted under the Plan 
shall be deemed to be assumed if, following the sale of assets or 
merger, the Option confers the right to purchase, for each Share of 
Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to the sale of 
assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other 
securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by 
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of 
the transaction (and if such holders were offered a choice of 
consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a 
majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such 
consideration received in the sale of assets or merger was not solely 
Common Stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the 
Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation 
and the participant, provide for the per share consideration to be 
received upon exercise of the Option to be solely Common Stock of 
the successor corporation or its parent equal in Fair Market Value to 
the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in 
the sale of assets or merger.

		(d)	Change in Control.  In the event of a "Change in 
Control" of the Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless 
otherwise determined by the Administrator prior to the occurrence 
of such Change in Control, the following acceleration and valuation 
provisions shall apply:

		(1)	Any Options and SARs outstanding as of the 
date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred 
that are not yet exercisable and vested on such date shall 
become fully exercisable and vested; and

		(2)	The value of all outstanding Options and SARs 
shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or 
after grant, be cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options 
and SARs shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of (x) 
the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option or 
SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, 
in the event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the 
estate of the Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to 
exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance.

		(e)	Definition of "Change in Control".  For purposes of 
this Section 12, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of 
the following:

		( i )	When any "person", as such term is used in 
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the 
Company, a Subsidiary or a Company employee benefit plan, 
including any trustee of such plan acting as trustee) is or 
becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 
                                     36
<PAGE>
under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of 
the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding 
securities; or

		(ii)	The occurrence of a transaction requiring 
shareholder approval, and involving the sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of 
the Company with or into another corporation.

		(f)	Change in Control Price.  For purposes of this 
Section 12, "Change in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the 
Administrator, (i) the highest Fair Market Value at any time within 
the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of determination 
of the Change in Control Price by the Administrator (the "60-Day 
Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered, as determined by 
the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer 
related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time within 
the 60-Day Period.

	13.	Time of Granting Options and SARs.  The date of grant of 
an Option or SAR shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the 
Administrator makes the determination granting such Option or 
SAR.  Notice of the determination shall be given to each Employee to 
whom an Option or SAR is so granted within a reasonable time after 
the date of such grant.

	14.	Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

		(a)	Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at 
any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as it may 
deem advisable; provided that, to the extent necessary and desirable 
to comply with Applicable Laws, regulations or rules, including 
Section 422 of the Code, or, for periods on and after September 30, 
1995, with Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company shall obtain 
shareholder approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and 
to such a degree as is required.

		(b)	Effect of Amendment or Termination.  Any such 
amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall 
not impair the rights of any Optionee or SAR holder under any grant 
theretofore made without his or her consent.  Such Options and 
SARs shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been 
amended or terminated.

	15.	Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.  Shares shall not be 
issued with respect to an Option or SAR unless the exercise of such 
Option or SAR and the issuance and delivery of such Shares 
pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, 
including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 
the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation 
system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and 
shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company 
with respect to such compliance.

		As a condition to the exercise of an Option or SAR or 
the issuance of Shares upon exercise of an Option or SAR, the 
Company may require the person exercising such Option or SAR to 
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the 
Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any 
present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of 
counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of 
the aforementioned relevant provisions of law.

		Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any 
regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by 
the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and 
sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any 
liability in respect of the non-issuance or sale of such Shares as to 
which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

	16.	Reservation of Shares.  The Company, during the term of 
this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of 
Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
