        Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

     NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's
     management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a
     fair statement of interim periods presented have been included. The results
     for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be
     expected for the entire year. Certain amounts in the Condensed Consolidated
     Balance Sheet as of September 25, 1999, have been reclassified to conform
     to the 2000 presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements
     and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's
     annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year
     ended September 25, 1999, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
     the year ended September 25, 1999 (the 1999 Form 10-K). All information is
     based on the Company's fiscal calendar.

     NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common
     shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
     outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
     dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
     number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
     include the number of additional common shares that would have been
     outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. The
     dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per
     share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of
     convertible securities is reflected using the if-converted method.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
     earnings per share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):

     Options to purchase approximately 1,853,108 and 160,000 shares of common
     stock were outstanding as of July 1, 2000, and June 26, 1999, respectively,
     that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for
     the quarters then ended because the options' exercise price was greater
     than the average market price of the Company's common stock during those
     periods and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.

     During the first two quarters of 1999, the Company had outstanding $661
     million of unsecured convertible subordinated debentures (the Debentures)
     which were convertible by their holders into approximately 45.2 million
     shares of common stock. The weighted-average common shares represented by
     the Debentures upon conversion were included in the computation of diluted
     earnings per share for the three and nine month periods ended June 26,
     1999, using the if-converted method. On April 14, 1999, the Company called
     for redemption the Debentures. As a result, debenture holders converted
     virtually all of the outstanding debentures to 45.2 million shares of the
     Company's common stock during the third quarter of 1999. For additional
     disclosures regarding the Debentures, see the 1999 Form 10-K.

     NOTE 4 - NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

     The Company holds significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM),
     Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai)
     and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These investments are reflected in
     the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments
     and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be
     carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
     reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
     income. The combined fair value of these investments was $1.236 billion and
     $339 million as of July 1, 2000, and September 25, 1999, respectively.
     The combined fair value of these investments has declined to
     approximately $1.062 billion as of July 28, 2000. The Company believes it
     is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair
     value of these investments in the future.

     ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design
     and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology.
     As of September 25, 1999, the Company held approximately 80 million shares
     of ARM stock with a fair value of $226 million. Share data for ARM
     presented in this Form 10-Q has been adjusted to reflect ARM's four-for-one
     stock split in April of 1999 and its five-for-one stock split in April of
     2000. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold approximately 5
     million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $51 million
     and a gain before taxes of $50 million. During the nine months ended July
     1, 2000, the Company has sold approximately 38 million shares of ARM stock
     for net proceeds of approximately $288 million and gains before taxes of
     approximately $284 million. During the third quarter of 1999, the Company
     sold approximately 50 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $105
     million and a gain before taxes of $101 million. During the nine months
     ended June 26, 1999, the Company sold approximately 148 million shares of
     ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $201 million and a gain before
     taxes of approximately $188. The fair value of the Company's investment in
     ARM is approximately $450 million as of July 1, 2000.

     In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an
     Internet service provider (ISP). The investment is in EarthLink's Series C
     Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible by the Company after
     January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common
     stock. Concurrent with this investment, Earthlink and the Company entered
     into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in
     the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will
     profit from each new Mac customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP
     service, and EarthLink will become the default ISP in Apple's Internet
     Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United
     States. The fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink is
     approximately $110 million as of July 1, 2000.

     During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in
     Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel
     display production capacity. The investment, in the form of three year
     unsecured bonds, is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of
     Samsung common stock beginning in July 2000. The bonds carry an annual
     coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at
     their maturity. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung is
     approximately $188 million as of July 1, 2000.

     In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global
     Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of
     convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of
     Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of
     Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. The Company is restricted
     from selling more than 25% of its shares within one year after the date of
     the closing of the public offering of Akamai's stock. Beginning in the
     first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as
     available-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai is
     approximately $488 million as of July 1, 2000.

     NOTE 6 - COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

     Comprehensive income is comprised of two components, net income and other
     comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
     expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting
     principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are
     excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is
     comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
     subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and
     from unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on marketable securities
     categorized as available-for-sale. See Note 4 for additional information

     operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95

                                       9

<PAGE>

     The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on
     net sales and operating income. Operating income for each segment includes
     revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the
     segment. Net sales are based on the location of the customers. Operating
     income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
     expenses that are managed outside the reportable segment. Costs excluded
     from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, income
     taxes, and nonrecurring charges for purchased in-process research and
     development, restructuring, and acquisition related costs. Corporate
     expenses include research and development, manufacturing expenses not
     included in segment cost of sales, corporate marketing expenses, and other
     separately managed general and administrative expenses. The Company does
     not include intercompany transfers between segments for management

     NOTE 9 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1,
     "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
     Internal Use," which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of
     computer software intended for internal use. The adoption of SOP 98-1 in
     fiscal 2000 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
     results of operations or financial position during the quarter and nine
     months ended July 1, 2000.

     In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
     "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued.
     SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 138, establishes accounting and
     reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and
     exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all
     derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
     position and measure those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are
     not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative
     is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value
     will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
     assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in
     other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
     In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
     Hedging Activities- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
     133," was issued. The statement defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133
     until the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Company continues to
     review the effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 133, the Company does
     not currently believe its adoption will have a material impact on its
     financial position or overall trends in results of operations and does not
     believe adoption will result in significant changes to its financial risk
     management practices. However, the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 133 on
     the Company's results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of
     the Company's derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of
     adoption and may result in more pronounced quarterly fluctuations in other
     income and expense.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
     Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
     Statements." The objective of this SAB is to provide further guidance on
     revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature
     addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. The Company is
     required to adopt the guidance in the SAB no later than the fourth quarter
     of its fiscal year 2001. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have
     a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
     operations. The SEC has recently indicated it intends to issue further
     guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by SAB No.
     101. Until such time as this additional guidance is issued, the Company is
     unable to assess the impact, if any, it may have on its financial position
     or results of operations.

     NOTE 10 - CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are
     discussed in detail in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to
     certain other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the
     ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The
     results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however,
     in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential
     liability related to any legal proceedings and claims that would have a
     material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
     operations.

     The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax
     deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made
     certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed
     deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most
     of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS
     proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although
     most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still
     remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management
     believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may
     result from tax examinations.

<PAGE>

Net sales increased $267 million or 17% to $1.825 billion in the third quarter
of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999. On a year-over-year basis,
quarterly net sales increased in all of the Company's geographic operating
segments. The primary source of this growth was an overall 12% increase in
Macintosh unit sales, which reflects strong unit growth in the Americas and
Europe somewhat offset by a decline in unit sales in Japan. Further contributing
to year-over-year quarterly growth in net sales was a 4% increase in the average
revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net sales generated by
hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales.

For the first nine months of 2000, net sales increased $1.315 billion or 27%
over the same period in 1999. A 28% increase in year-to-date Macintosh unit
sales, reflective of strong growth in all of the Company's geographic operating
segments, was the principal cause of the increase in net sales during the first
nine months of 2000.

Net sales declined sequentially during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the
second quarter of 2000 by $120 million or 6%. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales
decreased 3% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the second quarter.
The sequential decline in both net sales and unit sales during the third quarter
was primarily the result of a sequential quarterly decline in iMac unit sales of
6% and a sequential decline in the average revenue per Macintosh system. The
Company believes that iMac unit sales during the third quarter were negatively
impacted by anticipation of product updates expected at the beginning of the
fourth quarter. The average revenue per Macintosh system for the third quarter
of 2000 declined 4% from the second quarter to $1,749. This decline was due to a
shift during the quarter towards lower-priced versions of its consumer products
purchased by the Company's education customers and by price protection
recognized during the third quarter resulting from planned product transitions
in the fourth quarter.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's
reportable geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, and Japan. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar
hardware and software products and similar services. Further information
regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in this Form 10-Q in the
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8, "Segment
Information and Geographic Data," and in the 1999 Form 10-K.

AMERICAS

Net sales in the Americas segment during the third quarter of 2000 increased
$140 million or 16% compared to the same period in 1999. Macintosh quarterly
unit sales in the Americas increased 10% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting
strong growth in unit sales of professional products, particularly PowerBooks,
and the impact on unit sales of iBook which was first shipped at the beginning
of fiscal 2000. These increases in unit sales were partially offset by an 8%
decline in unit sales of iMac ahead of the anticipated product updates at the
beginning of the fourth quarter. During the third quarter of 2000, the Americas
segment represented approximately 56% of the Company's total net sales compared
to 57% during the same quarter in 1999.

For the first nine months of 2000, net sales in the Americas segment increased
$571 million or 22% from the same period in 1999, while Macintosh unit sales
increased 24%. The results experienced by the Americas segment during the first
nine months of 2000 versus the same period in 1999 reflect the Company's overall
results characterized by strong year-to-date growth in sales of iMac and
PowerBook products, sales of iBook which was first shipped at the beginning of
fiscal 2000, and stable unit sales of the Company's Power Macintosh products.


                                       13
<PAGE>



EUROPE

Net sales in the Europe segment increased $56 million or 19% during the third
quarter of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999, while the segment's
Macintosh unit sales increased 33%. Growth in year-over-year unit sales was
experienced in the Europe segment in all four of the Company's principal product
families. Sequentially, net sales in the Europe segment declined $116 million or
25% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the second quarter, while
Macintosh unit sales declined 19%. The sequential decline in the Europe's
segment net sales and unit sales is attributable primarily to two factors.
First, like the Americas segment, Europe's results in the third quarter of 2000
as compared to the second quarter reflect a sequential decline in iMac unit
sales in anticipation of upcoming product updates. Second, the Company has
historically experienced a modest seasonal decline in net sales in Europe during
its third fiscal quarter.

JAPAN

Net sales in Japan rose 13% or $34 million during the third quarter of 2000 as
compared to the same quarter in 1999. However, the segment's quarterly Macintosh
unit sales decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis. The Japan segment's unit
sales during the third quarter of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999
reflect declines in unit sales of the Company's desktop products, particularly
iMac, prior to the anticipated product introductions in the fourth quarter,
partially offset by increases in sales of portable products. This shift in mix
towards higher-priced portable products led to the year-over-year increase in
net sales.

GROSS MARGIN

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2000 was 29.8% compared to 27.4% for the
same quarter in 1999 and 28.2% for the second quarter of 2000. Gross margin
during the third quarter of 2000 was favorably impacted by two principal
factors. First, component costs incurred to manufacture the Company's products
were lower during the third quarter of 2000 compared to both the previous
quarter and to the same quarter in 1999. Second, during the third quarter of
2000 the Company's mix of product sales shifted somewhat away from its consumer
products towards its higher margin professional desktop and portable products.

There can be no assurance targeted gross margin levels will be achieved or
current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general,
gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide
global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles,
potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside
manufacturing services, fluctuations in freight costs incurred to deliver the
Company's products to market, and potential changes to the Company's product
mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling
prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand
for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take
into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time;
however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in
the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding special charges,
increased $35 million or 14% during the third quarter of 2000 as compared to the
same period in 1999 and declined $9 million or 3% from the second quarter of
2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of
2000 increased $123 million or 16% as compared to the same period in 1999.
However, as a result of growing net sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses fell to 14% of net sales during the first nine months of 2000 compared
to 16% during the same period in 1999. The absolute year-over-year increases in
selling, general and administrative expenses for both the third quarter and the
first nine months of 2000 are primarily the result of higher variable selling
and marketing expenses resulting from the year-over-year increase in net sales
and due to higher discretionary spending on marketing and advertising in 2000 as
compared to 1999.

Expenditures for research and development increased 21% between the third
quarter of fiscal 2000 and the same quarter in 1999 and increased 20% during the
first nine months of 2000 compared to the same period in 1999. These increases
resulted primarily from increased spending in 2000 to support product
development activities and increased research and development headcount.

SPECIAL CHARGES

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions
resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was
comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5
million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with
consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing
functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent
by July 1, 2000, and the remainder is expected to be spent over the following
two quarters. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets,
substantially all was utilized by April 1, 2000.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past
services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the company of
approximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible.
Approximately half of the total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The other
half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the purchase.

TOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

Interest and other income and expense (net) increased $28 million or 117% to $52
million during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999
and increased $88 million or 166% for the first nine months of 2000 over the
same period in 1999. These increases are attributable primarily to two factors.
First, interest income increased $18 million or 48% between the third quarter of
2000 and the third quarter of 1999 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investment balances and due to an increase in the overall yield
earned on the Company's investment portfolio resulting from higher market
interest rates and a modest lengthening of the portfolio's average maturity.
Second, as the result of conversion to common stock of the Company's convertible
subordinated debentures during the third quarter of 1999, interest expense
declined $6 million or 55% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the same
quarter in 1999 and decreased $27 million or 64% for the comparable nine month
periods.

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold approximately 5 million
shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $51 million and a gain
before taxes of $50 million. During the nine months ended July 1, 2000, the
Company has sold approximately 38 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds
of approximately $288 million and gains before taxes of approximately $284
million. During the third quarter of 1999, the Company sold approximately 50
million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $105 million and a gain before
taxes of $101 million. During the nine months ended June 26, 1999, the Company
sold approximately 148 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of
approximately $201 million and a gain before taxes of approximately $188.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

As of July 1, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible
temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $535 million before being
offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the
Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based
on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of July 1, 2000,
a valuation allowance of $40 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset
for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance
primarily relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to
tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company will continue to
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the
need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2000 was
approximately 33% and includes the effect of the special executive bonus
accrued during that quarter. The effective tax rate during the first quarter
of 2000 without this charge was approximately 25%. The Company's effective
tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2000, was approximately 26%. The
effective tax rate without the special executive bonus for the nine months
ended July 1, 2000, is also 26%. This effective rate is less than the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to the reversal of a
portion of the previously established valuation allowance for tax loss and
credit carryforwards and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no
U.S. taxes were provided.

As of July 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $3.8 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $600 million over the
same balances at the end of fiscal 1999. For the nine months ended July 1, 2000,
the Company's primary source of cash was $668 million in cash flows from
operating activities. Cash generated by operations was primarily from net income
of $616 million and a combined increase in accounts payable and other current
liabilities of $392 million partially offset by an increase in accounts
receivable of $286 million. In addition to operating cash flow, other
significant cash flow items during the nine months ended July 1, 2000 included
net purchases of short-term investments of $582 million, $232 million utilized
for the purchase of long-term investments, $76 million for the purchase of
property, plant and equipment, and cash proceeds from the sale of ARM stock of
$288 million.

In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company
to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire
shares over any specified period of time. During the third quarter of 2000,
approximately 1 million shares of common stock were repurchased at a cost of
approximately $50 million. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company has repurchased a total of 4.5 million shares of its common stock at a
total cost of $166 million.

On November 18, 1999, the Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit
agreement with Bank of America. Loans under the agreement pay interest at LIBOR
plus 1%, and the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% of the
unused portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this
credit facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the
Company with an additional source of short-term liquidity.

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its cash
requirements over the next twelve months, including any cash that may be
utilized by its stock repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current
non-investment grade debt ratings, if the Company should need to obtain
short-term borrowings, there can no assurance such borrowings could be obtained
at favorable rates. The inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates
could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

The Company holds significant investments in ARM, Samsung, Akamai and EarthLink.
These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as
non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized
gains and

                                       17

<PAGE>

losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The combined fair value of these investments was $1.236
billion and $339 million as of July 1, 2000, and September 25, 1999,
respectively. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be
significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future.
Additional information regarding these investment may be found in this Form 10-Q
in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 4,
"Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments."

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition to
the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are many factors
that will affect the Company's future results and business, which may cause the
actual results to differ from those currently expected. The Company's future
operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the Company's
ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically
innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand patterns. Inherent
in this process are a number of factors that the Company must successfully
manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and a favorable
financial condition.

Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future
operating results and financial condition include, among other things, continued
competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the
Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company;
risks associated with international operations, including economic and labor
conditions, regional economic problems, political instability, tax laws, and
currency fluctuations; increasing dependence on third-parties for manufacturing
and other outsourced functions such as logistics; the availability of key
components on terms acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of
certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently
obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC
microprocessors developed by and obtained from IBM and Motorola and the final
assembly of certain of the Company's products; the Company's ability to supply
products in certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of
latent defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to
the marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue
to make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party
software for particular applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate
and retain key employees; the effect of previously undetected Y2K compliance
issues; managing the continuing impact of the European Union's transition to the
Euro as its common legal currency; continuing fluctuations in the fair value of
the Company's non-current debt and equity investments, and the Company's ability
to retain the operational and cost benefits derived from its recently completed
restructuring programs.

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" in
the Company's 1999 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW REGARDING MARKET RISK CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL
RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN
THIS FORM 10-Q REGARDING MARKET RISK. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1999 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to the Company's investments in debt securities and long-term debt
obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places
its investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is
to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds
by limiting market and credit risk. Excluding those investments classified as
non-current debt and equity investments, all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be
cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and twelve months
are considered to be short-term investments. As of July 1, 2000,
substantially all of the Company's investments in debt securities have
maturities less than 12 months.

During the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative
transactions, including interest rate swaps and floors, with financial
institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest
income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate
interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the
Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The
Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce
the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold
or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk
management.

Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar
and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a
stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may
negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.
dollars.

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with
financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed
transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's
foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its
existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company
may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial
either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related
currency's historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange
forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The
premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in
other current assets and marked to market through earnings.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and
interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities
of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign
exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and
floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its
underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively,
from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the
effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the
anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no
assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign
exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for
recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any
given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the
underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's
operating results and financial position.

For a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign currency
related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's
1999 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the Company's exposure
to interest rate and foreign currency risks since the date of the 1999 Form
10-K.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are
discussed in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other
legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal
proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

                                APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

                             (a California corporation)


                        (as amended through April 20, 2000)


                                     Article I

                                     DIRECTORS

amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this by-law
duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment
reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number less
than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a

her successor shall have been duly elected and  qualified; provided, however,
that the terms of all directors shall expire at  the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000. Commencing at the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, each director shall be elected to
serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in the following fiscal year
or until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

     SECTION 2.6:   VACANCIES.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of Directors
shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any director, or if
the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the shareholders fail, at
any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director is elected, to elect
the full authorized number of directors to be voted for at that meeting.  The
Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a director if he or she is
declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony or if,
within 60 days after notice of his or her election, he or she does not accept
the office.  Any vacancy, except for a vacancy created by removal of a director
as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, may be filled by a


                                      -1-
<PAGE>

person selected by a majority of the remaining directors then in office,
whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of removal of
directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders.  The shareholders
may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the
directors.  Any such election by written consent requires the consent of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling of
any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to
vote for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held
to elect the entire Board of Directors.  The term of office of any director
shall terminate upon such election of a successor.  Any director may resign
effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any,
the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of
Directors of this corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for
the effectiveness of such resignation.  Ifthe resignation is effective at a
future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation
becomes effective.  A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall
not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of
office.

     SECTION 2.7:   REMOVAL. The entire Board of Directors or any individual
director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the
entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the
votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would
be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without regard to
whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same
total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent,
all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number of directors
elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the
number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected.
If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same
meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares
is entitled to elect one or more directors under authority granted by the
Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the provisions of this Section
2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the vote of the
outstanding shares as a whole.

extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of Directors

meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the
business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (ii) in
the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at
the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to present for action by the
shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such
action except that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal
relating to approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of
this corporation, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of
this corporation or winding up of this corporation.  The notice of any meeting
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for election.
Written notice shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder, either (i)
personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, charges
prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's address appearing
on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder to this
corporation for the purpose of notice.  If a shareholder gives no address or no
such address appears on the books of this corporation, notice shall be deemed to
have been given if sent by mail or other means of written communication
addressed to the place where the principal executive office of this corporation
is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the county in which such office is located.  The noice shall be deemed to
have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written communication
and addressed as hereinbefore provided.  An affidavit of delivery or mailing of
any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.4, executed by
the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie
evidence of the giving of the notice.  If any notice addressed to the
shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of the
corporation is returned to this corporation by the United States Postal Service
marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver
the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall be
deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be
available for the shareholder upon written demand of the shareholder at the
principal executive office of this corporation for a period of one year from the
date of the giving of the notice to all other shareholders.

     SECTION 10.5:  CONSENT TO SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS.  The transactions of any
meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as
valid as though had at a


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present
either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting,
each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy,
signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting
or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers, consents or
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting.  Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a
meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of
matters required by law to be included in the notice but not so included, if
such objection is expressly made at the meeting.  Neither the business to be
transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of
shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to
approval of contracts between this corporation and any of its directors,
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this
corporation or winding up the affairs of this corporation.

     SECTION 10.6:  QUORUM.  The presence in person or by proxy of the holders
of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Shares shall not be
counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the
meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the
meeting.  The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a
quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a
quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a
majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

     SECTION 10.7:  ADJOURNED MEETINGS.  Any shareholders' meeting, whether or
not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a
majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or
represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 10.6 hereof, in
the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such meeting.
When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days or if after adjournment a new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at a
meeting.  Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of
the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted
thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is
taken.  At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

     SECTION 10.8:  VOTING RIGHTS.  Only persons in whose names shares entitled
to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close of business
on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be fixed for the
determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section 2.8(k) hereof, then
on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.  In the absence of
any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable
statute relating to the election of directors or to other particular matters,
each such person shall be entitled to one vote for each share.

     In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors may
fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  Any
shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent or request a special meeting of the
shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice to the Secretary,
request the Board of Directors to fix a record date.  The Board of Directors
shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28) days after the date
on which such request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.

     SECTION 10.9:  ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENTS.  Any action which may be taken
at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting
and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than
the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving such written consent or
consents from shareholders of the corporation, the Board of Directors shall
determine whether holders of outstanding shares as of the record date
established pursuant to Section 10.8 having not less than the minimum number of
votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted have properly
consented thereto in writing and notify the requesting party of its finding.
Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in
writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) contracts between this
corporation and any of its directors, (ii) indemnification of any person, (iii)
reorganization of this corporation or (iv) distributions to shareholders upon
winding up of this corporation in certain circumstances without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given at least 10 days before the
consummation of the action authorized by such approval, and prompt notice shall
be given of the taking of any other corporate action approved by shareholders
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent, to those shareholders
entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder
shall conform to the requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.
When written consents are given with


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from the persons
in whose names such shares stand on the books of this corporation at the time
such respective consens are given, or any shareholder's proxy holder, or a
transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder or
their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received
by this corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of
shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the
Secretary of this corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  Such revocation
is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected by
written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to
vote for the election of directors.

     SECTION 10.10: ELECTIONS OF DIRECTORS. In any election of directors, the
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares
entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by
such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with
respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.  Elections
of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a shareholder at
the meeting and before the voting begins.

     SECTION 10.11: PROXIES.  Every person entitled to vote or execute consents
shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents
authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person's duly
authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this corporation.  No proxy
shall be valid (1) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically
made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and applicable
law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof, unless
the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such
proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may be effected by a writing
delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating that the proxy is revoked
or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting
in person by, the person executing the proxy.  A proxy is not revoked by the
death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written
notice of such death or incapacity is received by this corporation.  A proxy
which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified
therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the
following: (1) a pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase
or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of
such person's shares in this corporation to the maker of the proxy, (3) a
creditor or creditors of this corporation or the shareholder who extended or
continued credit to this corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the
proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension
or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the
credit, (4) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of
this corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if
the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of
employment, the name of the employee and the period of employmet contracted for,
(5) a person designated by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or
a voting trust agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is
given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or
equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the
obligation secured by it.  Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability
specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option
or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares
of this corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is
paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a
provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of
the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its
irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares.  Every form
of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity to specify approval
or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate
space marked "abstain", whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain
from voting his or her shares on the proposal.  A proxy marked "abstain" by the
shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for
or against such proposal.  In any election of directors, any form of proxy in
which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which
is marked by a shareholder "withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating
that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not
be voted either for or against the election of a director.

     SECTION 10.12: INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  Before any meeting of shareholders,
the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than nominees for office to
act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no
inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of the meeting may, and on
the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint
inspectors of election at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either
one (1) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request
of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or
their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three
(3) inspectors are to be appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails
to appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairman of the meeting may, and upon
the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person
to fill that vacancy.

     These inspectors shall:

          (a)  Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power
of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and
the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

          (b)  Receive votes, ballots, or consents;


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

          (c)  Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way
arising in connection with the right to vote;

          (d)  Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

          (e)  Determine when the polls shall close;

          (f)  Determine the result; and

          (g)  Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or
vote with fairness to all shareholders.

     SECTION 10.13:  ADVANCE NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR
NOMINATIONS.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought before
a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given timely
notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such
nomination or nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in the event
less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting
is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be
so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure was made.  To be  in proper written form a shareholder's notice to
the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address of the shareholder who
intends to make the nominations or propose the business and, as the case may be,
of the person or persons to be nominated or of the business to be proposed, (ii)
a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the
Corporation that intends to vote such stock at such meeting and, if applicable,
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice, (iii) if applicable, a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee or any
other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the
nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (iv) such other
information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to be proposed by
such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed
pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated,
or intended to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be
proposed, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable,
the consent of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The
chairman of a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the nomination
of any person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the
foregoing procedure.

personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a
person at the home or office of the director who the person giving the notice
has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director.  A notice or

of the minutes of the meeting.

     SECTION 11.8:  ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING.  Any action required or permitted
by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if

Board of Directors.

     SECTION 12.2:  SHARES HELD BY THE CORPORATION.  Shares in other

Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer or the Secretary
or any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and the class or
series of shares owned by the shareholder.  Any or all of the signatures on the
certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar
who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate
shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by this corporation with the same effect
as if such person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of

     SECTION 12.4:  LOST CERTIFICATES.  Where the owner of any certificate for
shares of this corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of the original

by the Board of Directors, the corporation may make loans of money or property
to, or guarantee the obligations of, any officer of the corporation or its
parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the officer is a director, upon the
approval of the Board of Directors alone.  Such approval by the Board of
Directors must be determined by a vote of a majority of the disinterested

more of the outstanding common shares of the corporation be extended a loan
under this provision.

provided, however, that a By-Law or amendment of the Articles of Incorporation
reducing the number or the minimum number of directors to a number less than

Directors to adopt, amend or repeal By-Laws.

either of such events, all certificates of shares of stock subject to such

317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually
and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding (as defined in Section

officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a

<PAGE>

(other than directors and officers) against expenses (as defined in Section
317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding (as
defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by reason of the fact that
such person is or was an agent of the corporation.  For purposes of this
Article XVI, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a
director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or
agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or
agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation
or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

     SECTION 16.3:  PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE.  Expenses incurred in
defending any civil or criminal action or proceeding for which indemnification
is required pursuant to Section 16.1 or for which indemnification is permitted
pursuant to Section 16.2 following authorization thereof by the Board of
Directors, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition
of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in
this Article XVI.

     SECTION 16.4:  INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE.  The indemnification provided by
this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote

official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are
authorized in the Articles of Incorporation.

     SECTION 16.5:  INSURANCE INDEMNIFICATION.  The corporation shall have the
power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was
an Agent of the corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred
by such person in such capacity or arising out of such person's status as such,
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against
such liability under the provisions of this Article XVI.

     SECTION 16.6:  CONFLICTS.  No indemnification or advance shall be made
under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or advance is mandated
by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction,
in any circumstance where it appears:

          (a)  That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles of
Incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an agreement in
effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in
the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid,
which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

          (b)  That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly
imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Shares which may be optioned and sold
under the Plan or for which SARs may be granted and exercised is 21,500,000

In calculating the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, the
following rules shall apply:

              (iv)   Option Stock subject to both an outstanding Option and SAR
       granted in connection with the Option shall be counted only once in
       calculating the Section 3 Limit.

       4.     ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

              (a)    COMPOSITION OF ADMINISTRATOR.  The Plan may be administered
by (i) the Board or (ii) a Committee designated by the Board, which Committee
shall be constituted in such a manner as to satisfy the applicable securities
laws, California corporate law and the Code (collectively, "APPLICABLE LAWS").

                     Once a Committee has been appointed pursuant to this
Section 4(a), such Committee shall continue to serve in its designated capacity
until otherwise directed by the Board.  From time to time the Board may increase
the size of the Committee and appoint additional members thereof, remove members
(with or without cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill
vacancies (however caused) and remove all members of the Committee and
thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by the
Applicable Laws.

              (b)    POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Subject to the provisions of
the Plan and, in the case of the Committee, subject to the specific duties
delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the
authority, in its discretion:  (i) to determine the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock in accordance with the Plan; (ii) to determine, in accordance with
Section 8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per Share of Options and SARs to be
granted; (iii) to determine the Employees to whom, and the time or times at
which, Options and SARs shall be granted and the number of Shares to be
represented by each Option or SAR (including, without limitation, whether or not
a corporation shall be excluded


<PAGE>

from the definition of Affiliated Company); (iv) to construe and interpret
the provisions of the Plan and any agreements or certificates issued under or
in connection with the Plan; (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Option or SAR granted
hereunder (including, but not limited to, any restriction or limitation, or
any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions regarding any
Option or SAR or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such
factors as the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion); (vi)
to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vii) to prescribe,
amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (viii) to
modify or amend each Option or SAR or accelerate the exercise date of any
Option or SAR; (ix) to reduce the exercise price of any Option or SAR to the
then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock
covered by such Option or SAR shall have declined since the date the Option
or SAR was granted; (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the
Company any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Option or SAR
previously granted by the Administrator; and (xi) to make all other
determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the
Plan.

              (c)    EFFECT OF DECISIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATOR.  All decisions,
determinations and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and
binding on all Optionees and any other holders of any Options.

       5.     ELIGIBILITY.  The Administrator may grant Options and SARs only to
individuals who are Employees or who are consultants to the Company, or a
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company.  In no event may an Option or SAR be granted
to any individual who, at the time of grant, is an Officer or Director.  An
Employee who has been granted an Option or SAR may, if he or she is otherwise
eligible, be granted an additional Option or Options, SAR or SARs.  Each Option
shall be evidenced by a written Option agreement, which shall be in such form
and contain such provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem
appropriate.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator may, at any
time, or from time to time, authorize the Company, with the consent of the
respective recipients, to issue new Options or Options in exchange for the
surrender and cancellation of any or all outstanding Options, other options,
SARs or other stock appreciation rights.

       Neither the Plan nor any Option or SAR agreement shall confer upon any
Optionee any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company (or
any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliated Company), nor shall it interfere in any way
with the Optionee's right or the right of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary
or Affiliated Company) to terminate the Optionee's employment at any time or for
any reason.

       If an Option or SAR is granted to an individual who is a consultant to
the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, all references in the Plan to
"Employee" shall be deemed to include the term "consultant" and all references
in the Plan to "employment," "Continuous Status as an Employee" and
"termination of employment" shall be deemed to refer to the individual's
consultancy or status as a consultant.

       6.     TERM OF PLAN.  The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption
by the Board.  It shall continue in effect for a term of ten years unless sooner
terminated under Section 14 of the Plan.

       7.     TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be ten (10) years
from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Option agreement.

       8.     EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

              (a)    EXERCISE PRICE.  The per Share exercise price for the
Shares issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is determined by
the Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 100% of the Fair Market


<PAGE>

Value of Common Stock, determined as of the date of grant of the Option.  In
the event that the Administrator shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise
price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of
that reduction.

              (b)    METHOD OF PAYMENT.  The consideration to be paid for the
Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment,
shall be determined by the Administrator and may consist of (i) cash, (ii)
check, (iii) promissory note, (iv) other Shares which have a Fair Market Value
on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as
to which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery of a properly executed
exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly
deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds required to pay the
exercise price, or (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment
and/or any other consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted under
applicable corporate law.

       9.     STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

              (a)    GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion
of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of
an Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time
thereafter during the term of the Option.  The following provisions apply to
SARs that are granted in connection with Options:

       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by
       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.
       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal
       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the
       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related
       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the
       surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the
       foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be
       paid upon exercise of an SAR; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such limit shall
       not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.

       (ii)   When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent
       surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.

       (iii)  An SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the
       related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on
       which the related Option expires.

       (iv)   An SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value
       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.

              (b)    INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the
Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options.  The following
provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to
       receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair
       Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,
       as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the
       Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date
       on which the SAR was granted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrator
       may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of an SAR.

       (ii)   SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as
       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement.


<PAGE>

              (c)    FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the
exercise of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination
of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
determine.  Shares issued upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their
Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

       10.    METHOD OF EXERCISE.

              (a)    PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any
Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under
such conditions as determined by the Administrator and as shall be permissible
under the terms of the Plan.

              An Option or SAR shall be deemed to be exercised when written
notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the
terms of the Option or SAR by the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR
and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised
has been received by the Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the
Administrator and permitted by the Option agreement, consist of any
consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(b) of the Plan.
Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the
Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock,
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.  No adjustment will be made for a
dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock
certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option
or SAR may not be exercised with respect to a fraction of a Share.

              (b)    TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of
an Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason of
the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety days after the
date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that
it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date the
Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time
from the date of grant.

              (c)    DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  In the event of the death of an
Optionee:

       (i)    Who is at the time of death an Employee and who shall have been in
       Continuous Status as an Employee since the date of grant of the Option,
       the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months (or
       such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined
       by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's
       estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by
       bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise
       that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated
       his or her employment six (6) months (or such other period of time not
       exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator) after
       the date of death; or

       (ii)   Within ninety days after the termination of Continuous Status as
       an Employee, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within six
       (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months
       as determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the
       Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the
       Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to
       exercise that had accrued at the date of termination.

              Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not
be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.


<PAGE>

              (d)    STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX
OBLIGATIONS. When an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the
exercise of an Option or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay
the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the
Optionee may satisfy the withholding tax obligation by electing to have the
Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR, if any, that number of
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be
withheld.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be
determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be
determined (the "TAX DATE").

              All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this
purpose shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and
shall be subject to the following restrictions:

              (i)    the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax
Date; and

              (ii)   all elections shall be subject to the consent or
disapproval of the Administrator.

       11.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS.  Options and SARs may not be sold,
pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other
than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Administrator may grant Nonstatutory Stock Options that are
freely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an Optionee or holder
of an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An Option or an SAR may be exercised,
during the lifetime of the Optionee or SAR holder, only by the Optionee or SAR
holder or by a transferee permitted by this Section 11.

       12.    ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION OR MERGER.

              (a)    CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action
by the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each
outstanding Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been authorized
for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have yet been
granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration
of an Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each such
outstanding Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or
decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common
Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number of issued
Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not
be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."  Such
adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that
respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided
herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or
securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no
adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price
of Shares subject to an Option or SAR.

              (b)    DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options and SARs will
terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless


<PAGE>

otherwise provided by the Administrator.  The Administrator may, in the
exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or
SAR shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator and give each
Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or any part
of the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR
would not otherwise be exercisable.

              (c)    SALE OF ASSETS OR MERGER. Subject to the provisions of
Section 12(d), in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another
corporation, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent
option or stock appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor
corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the
Administrator determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of
such assumption or substitution, that the Optionee shall have the right to
exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as
to which the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.  If the
Administrator makes an Option or SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or
substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall
notify the Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a
period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR
will terminate upon the expiration of such period.  For purposes of this
paragraph, an Option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed if,
following the sale of assets or merger, the Option confers the right to
purchase, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately
prior to the sale of assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or
other securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
transaction (and if such holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the sale of
assets or merger was not solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or its
parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation and
the participant, provide for the per share consideration to be received upon
exercise of te Option to be solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or
its parent equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by
holders of Common Stock in the sale of assets or merger.

              (d)    CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a "Change in Control"
of the Company, as defined in Section 12(e), unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following
acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

       (i)    Any Options and SARs outstanding as of the date such Change in
       Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable and
       vested on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested; and

       (ii)   The value of all outstanding Options and SARs shall, unless
       otherwise determined by the Administrator at or after grant, be
       cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options and SARs shall be cashed
       out shall be equal to the excess of (x) the Change in Control Price (as
       defined below) over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by
       the Option or SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee
       or, in the event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate
       of the Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the
       Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance.

              (e)    "DEFINITION OF "CHANGE IN CONTROL".  For purposes of this
Section 12, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

       ( i )  When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a
       Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting
       as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities
       of the Company representing


<PAGE>

       fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's
       then outstanding securities; or

       (ii)   The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval,
       and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
       Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

              (f)    CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For purposes of this Section 12,
"Change in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the
highest Fair Market Value at any time within the sixty-day period immediately
preceding the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the
Administrator (the "SIXTY-DAY PERIOD"), or (ii) the highest price paid or
offered, as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or
bona fide offer related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time
within the Sixty-Day Period.

       13.    TIME OF GRANTING OPTIONS AND SARS.  The date of grant of an Option
or SAR shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination granting such Option or SAR.  Notice of the determination shall be
given to each Employee to whom an Option or SAR is so granted within a
reasonable time after the date of such grant.

       14.    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

              (a)    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time
amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as it may deem advisable.

              (b)    EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.  Any such amendment,
alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair the rights of
any Optionee or SAR holder under any grant theretofore made without his or her
consent.  Such Options and SARs shall remain in full force and effect as if this
Plan had not been amended or terminated.

       15.    CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.  Shares shall not be issued
with respect to an Option or SAR unless the exercise of such Option or SAR and
the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all
relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon
which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to
the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

              As a condition to the exercise of an Option or SAR or the issuance
of Shares upon exercise of an Option or SAR, the Company may require the person
exercising such Option or SAR to represent and warrant at the time of any such
exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any
present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of
counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the
aforementioned relevant provisions of law.

              Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory
body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to
be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall
relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the non-issuance or sale of
such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

       16.    RESERVATION OF SHARES.  The Company, during the term of this Plan,
will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

       17.    NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to
the contrary, with respect to any employee who is resident outside of the
United States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of
the Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or
to meet the objectives of the Plan. The Committee may, where appropriate,
establish one or more sub-plans for this purpose.

                           (AS AMENDED THROUGH 6/27/00)

    1.  PURPOSES OF THE PLAN.  The purposes of this Stock Plan are:

       to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of
       substantial responsibility;

       to provide additional incentive to the Chairman and/or Executive Officers
       and other key employees; and

       to promote the success of the Company's business.

    Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options (as defined
under Section 422 of the Code) or Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by
the Administrator at the time of grant. Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may
be granted under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of
Options. Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

    2.  DEFINITIONS.  As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

    administration of stock option plans under U.S. state corporate laws, U.S.
    federal and state securities laws, the Code, any stock exchange or quotation
    system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted and the applicable laws

        (j)  "CONTINUOUS STATUS AS CHAIRMAN" unless determined otherwise by the

    not be considered interrupted in the case of medical leave, military leave,
    family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the Administrator,
    provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in termination as
    Chairman with the Company. Neither service as a Director nor payment of a
    director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to constitute status as
    "Chairman" by the Company.

    provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in termination of
    the employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the
    case may be, under the terms of the respective Company policy for such
    leave; however, vesting may be tolled while an employee is on an approved
    leave of absence under the terms of the respective Company policy for such
    leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers between locations of the Company
    or between the Company, its Subsidiaries, or its successor; For purposes
    of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety days, unless

    contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved
    by the Company is not so guaranteed, on the 91st day of such leave any
    Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as
    an Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a
    Nonstatutory Stock Option. Neither service as a Chairman nor as a Director
    nor payment of a director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to
    constitute 'employment' by the Company.

       the closing bid, if no sales were reported) as quoted on such exchange or
       system, on the date of determination or, if the date of determination is
       not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day, as reported in
       THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or such other source as the Administrator deems
       reliable;

           (ii) If the Common Stock is regularly quoted by a recognized
       securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, the Fair Market
       Value of a Share of Common Stock shall be the mean between the high bid
       and low asked prices for the Common Stock on the date of determination
       or, if there are no quoted prices on the date of determination, on the
       last day on which there are quoted prices prior to the date of

reacquired Common Stock.

    In the discretion of the Administrator, any or all of the Shares authorized
under the Plan may be subject to SARs issued pursuant to the Plan.

    If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right issued under the Plan should
expire or become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in
full, the unpurchased Shares which were subject thereto shall become available
for other Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights under this Plan (unless the
Plan has terminated); however, should the Company reacquire Shares which were
issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR, such Shares shall not
become available for future grant under the Plan. If Shares of Restricted Stock
are repurchased by the Company at their original purchase price, such shares
shall become available for future grant under the Plan.

    4.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a)  PROCEDURE.

           (i) MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES. If permitted by Rule 16b-3
       promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto, as in
       effect at the time that discretion is being exercised with respect to the
       Plan, and by the legal requirements of the Applicable Laws relating to

       respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors who are
       Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) Employees who are
       neither Directors nor Officers.

           (ii) SECTION 162(m). To the extent that the Administrator determines
       it to be desirable to qualify Options or SARs granted hereunder as
       "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
       the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more
       "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

<PAGE>
          (iii) RULE 16b-3. To the extent desirable to qualify transactions
       hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated
       hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption
       under Rule 16b-3.

           (iv) OTHER ADMINISTRATION. Other than as provided above, the Plan
       shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which
       committee shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.

        (b)  POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Subject to the provisions of the
    Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties
    delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the
    authority, in its discretion:

           (i) to determine the Fair Market Value;

           (ii) to select the person(s) to whom Options, SARs and Stock Purchase
       Rights may be granted hereunder;

          (iii) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered
       by each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;

           (iv) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

           (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the
       terms of the Plan, of any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted
       hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the
       exercise price, the date of grant, the time or times when Options, SARs
       or Stock Purchase Rights may be exercised (which may be based on
       performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture
       restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR
       or Stock Purchase Right or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto,
       based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole
       discretion, shall determine;

           (vi) to reduce the exercise price of any Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market
       Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
       Right shall have declined since the date the Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right was granted;

          (vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards
       granted pursuant to the Plan;

         (viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating
       to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans
       established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment
       under foreign tax laws;

           (ix) to modify or amend each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
       (subject to Section 17(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary
       authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options
       longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;

           (x) to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by
       electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon
       exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right that number of Shares
       having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.
       The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on
       the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All
       elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall
       be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may
       deem necessary or advisable;

           (xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any
       instrument required to effect the grant of an Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right previously granted by the Administrator; and

<PAGE>
          (xii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable
       for administering the Plan.

        (c)  EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR'S DECISION.  The Administrator's decisions,
    determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all
    Optionees and any other holders of Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights.

    5.  ELIGIBILITY.  Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights
may be granted to the Chairman, Executive Officers and other key employees or to
such other individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has
offered a position of Chairman or Executive Officer. Incentive Stock Options may
be granted only to Executive Officers and other key employees.

    6.  LIMITATIONS.

        (a) Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an
    Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,
    notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair
    Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
    exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year
    (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds
    $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For
    purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into
    account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of
    the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to
    such Shares is granted.

        (b) Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's
    relationship as an Employee with or Chairman of the Company, nor shall they
    interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to
    terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.

        (c) The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options and SARs:

           (i) No participant shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the
       Company, Options or SARs to purchase more than 17,000,000 Shares;

           (ii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in
       connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described
       in Section 15;

          (iii) If an Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the
       Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a
       transaction described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted
       against the limits set forth in subsections (i) above. For this purpose,
       if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction
       will be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a
       new Option or SAR.

    7.  TERM OF PLAN.  Subject to Section 21 of the Plan, the Plan shall become
effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in effect for a term
of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 16 of the Plan.

    8.  TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be stated in the
Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10)
years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an
Optionee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock
representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the
Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such
shorter term as may be provided in the Agreement.

    9.  OPTION EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

        (a)  EXERCISE PRICE.  The per share exercise price for the Shares to be
    issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the
    Administrator, subject to the following:

           (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option;

              (A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock
           Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent
           (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or
           any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no
           less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of
           grant; or

               (B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in
           paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall
           be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date
           of grant;

           (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share
       exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a
       Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as 'performance-based
       compensation' within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per
       Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value
       per Share on the date of grant;

          (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per
       Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share
       on the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a
       merger or other corporate transaction.

        (b)  WAITING PERIOD AND EXERCISE DATES.  At the time an Option is
    granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may
    be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied
    before the Option may be exercised.

        (c)  FORM OF CONSIDERATION.  The Administrator shall determine the
    acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the
    method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the
    Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the
    time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of:

           (i) cash;

           (ii) check;

          (iii) promissory note;

           (iv) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon
       exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six
       months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the
       date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as
       to which said Option shall be exercised;

           (v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise
       program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

           (vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the
       Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's
       participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or
       arrangement;

          (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

         (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance
       of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

<PAGE>
    10.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

        (a)  GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion of the
    Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of an
    Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time
    thereafter during the term of the Option. The following provisions apply to
    SARs that are granted in connection with Options:

           (i) The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by
       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.
       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal
       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the
       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related
       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the
       surrendered portion of the related Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
       the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon
       exercise of a SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict
       the exercisability of the related Option;

           (ii) When a SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent
       surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable;

          (iii) A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the
       related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on
       which the related Option expires; and

           (iv) A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value
       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.

        (b)  INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator,
    SARs may be granted without related Options. The following provisions apply
    to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

           (i) The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to
       receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair
       Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,
       as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the
       Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date
       on which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the Administrator
       may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of a SAR;
       and

           (ii) SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as
       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's Agreement.

        (c)  FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the
    exercise of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any
    combination of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole
    discretion, may determine. Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall be
    valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

        (d)  RULE 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional
    restrictions as may be required to be contained in the Plan or Agreement in
    order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by Rule
    16b-3.

    11.  EXERCISE OF OPTION OR SAR.

        (a)  PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any Option or SAR
    granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan
    and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the
    Administrator and set forth in the Agreement. An Option may not be exercised
    for a fraction of a Share.

<PAGE>
        An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives:
    (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms
    of the Option or SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or
    SAR, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option
    is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of
    payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Agreement and
    the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the
    name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the
    Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by
    the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
    transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any
    other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned
    Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue
    (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised.
    No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the
    record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided
    in Section 15 of the Plan.

        Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares
    thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the
    Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
    Exercise of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised,
    result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be
    available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be
    exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.

        (b)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS STATUS AS CHAIRMAN.  Upon termination of
    an Optionee's Continuous Status as Chairman (other than termination by
    reason of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within
    ninety (90) days after the date of such termination, exercise his or her
    Option or SAR to the extent that it was exercisable at the date of such
    termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may
    not be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by
    its terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

        (c)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of an
    Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason
    of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days
    after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the
    extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be
    exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
    terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

        (d)  DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  If an Optionee dies (i) while an Employee or
    Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6)
    months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as
    determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the
    Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the
    Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to
    exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and
    terminated his or her employment six (6) months (or such other period of
    time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator)
    after the date of death; or (ii) within ninety (90) days after the
    termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or Chairman, the Option or
    SAR may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months (or such other
    period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the
    Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or by a
    person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or
    inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had
    accrued at the date of termination. If the Option or SAR is not so exercised
    within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the
    Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be
    exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
    terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

<PAGE>
        (e)  BUYOUT PROVISIONS.  The Administrator may at any time offer to buy
    out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option or SAR previously granted
    based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and
    communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

    12.  STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.

        (a)  RIGHTS TO PURCHASE.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either
    alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan
    and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator
    determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall
    advise the Optionee in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions
    and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that
    the Optionee shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the
    time within which the Optionee must accept such offer. The offer shall be
    accepted by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the
    Administrator.

        (b)  REPURCHASE OPTION.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise,
    the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon
    the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the
    Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The purchase price
    for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall be the original price
    paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of
    the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate
    determined by the Administrator.

        (c)  OTHER PROVISIONS.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms,
    provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be
    determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

        (d)  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is
    exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a
    shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered
    upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No
    adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record
    date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as
    provided in Section 15 of the Plan.

    13.  TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS, SARS AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.  Unless
determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed
of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title
1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and may be exercised, during
the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes
an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such Option, SAR or Stock
Purchase Right shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the
Administrator deems appropriate.

    14.  STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX OBLIGATIONS.  When an
Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option,
SAR or Stock Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay
the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the
Optionee may satisfy the withholding tax obligation by electing to have the
Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if
any, that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount
required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld
shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to
be determined (the "Tax Date").

    All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall
be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be
subject to the following restrictions:

        (i) the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax Date;
    and

<PAGE>
        (ii) all elections shall be subject to the consent or disapproval of the
    Administrator.

    In the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an Optionee and
the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because no election is
filed under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall receive the full
number of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
is exercised but such Optionee shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back
to the Company the proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.

    15.  ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER OR
ASSET SALE.

        (a)  CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action by the
    shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by
    each outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of
    shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the
    Plan but as to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been
    granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or
    expiration of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price
    per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR or
    Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or
    decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a
    stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or
    reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in
    the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of
    consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
    convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been
    "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made
    by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding
    and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the
    Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into
    shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason
    thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of
    Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.

        (b)  DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed
    dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and
    Stock Purchase Rights will terminate immediately prior to the consummation
    of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The
    Administrator may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances,
    declare that any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate as of a
    date fixed by the Administrator and give each Optionee the right to exercise
    his or her Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the
    Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option, SAR or Stock
    Purchase Right would not otherwise be exercisable.

        (c)  MERGER OR ASSET SALE.  Unless otherwise determined by the
    Administrator, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another
    corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,
    each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an
    equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a
    Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the
    successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or
    Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to
    exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned
    Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or
    exercisable. If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested
    and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a
    merger or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in
    writing or electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    be fully vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the
    date of such notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this
    paragraph, the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered
    assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right
    confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock
    subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the
    merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other

<PAGE>

    securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by
    holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
    transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
    type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the
    outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration
    received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the
    succesor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the
    consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be
    received upon the exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for
    each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
    Right, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its
    Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received
    by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.

        (d)  CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a "Change in Control" of the
    Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by
    the Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the
    following acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

           (i) Any Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding as of the
       date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred that are not
       yet exercisable and vested on such date shall become fully exercisable
       and vested; and

          (ii) The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase
       Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or
       after grant, be cashed-out. The amount at which such Options, SARs and
       Stock Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of
       (x) the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
       Right. The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, in the
       event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate of the
       Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option,
       SAR or Stock Purchase Right by bequest or inheritance.

        (e)  DEFINITION OF "CHANGE IN CONTROL".  For purposes of this
    Section 15, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the
    following:

           (i) When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a
       Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting
       as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities
       of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined
       voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or

           (ii) The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval,
       and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
       Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

        (f)  CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For purposes of this Section 15, "Change
    in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the
    highest Fair Market Value at any time within the 60-day period immediately
    preceding the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the
    Administrator (the "60-Day Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or
    offered, as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or
    bona fide offer related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time
    within the 60-Day Period.

    16.  DATE OF GRANT.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other
later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination
shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of
such grant.

<PAGE>
    17.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a)  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time amend, alter,
    suspend or terminate the Plan.

        (b)  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Company shall obtain shareholder
    approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to
    comply with Applicable Laws.

        (c)  EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.  No amendment, alteration,
    suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any
    Optionee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the
    Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee
    and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the
    Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with
    respect to Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights granted under the Plan
    prior to the date of such termination.

    18.  CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.

        (a)  LEGAL COMPLIANCE.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the
    exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of
    such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of
    such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject
    to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

        (b)  INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS.  As a condition to the exercise of an
    Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person
    exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant
    at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only
    for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such
    Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation
    is required.

    19.  INABILITY TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY.  The inability of the Company to obtain
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale
of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect
of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority
shall not have been obtained.

    20.  RESERVATION OF SHARES.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

    21.  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is
adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the
degree required under Applicable Laws.

    22.  NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the
contrary, with respect to any employee who is resident outside of the United
States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the
Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or to
meet the objectives of the Plan. The Committee may, where appropriate,
establish one or more sub-plans for this purpose.

        Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

     NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's
     management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a
     fair statement of interim periods presented have been included. The results
     for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be
     expected for the entire year. Certain amounts in the Condensed Consolidated
     Balance Sheet as of September 25, 1999, have been reclassified to conform
     to the 2000 presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements
     and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's
     annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year
     ended September 25, 1999, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
     the year ended September 25, 1999 (the 1999 Form 10-K). All information is
     based on the Company's fiscal calendar.

     NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common
     shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
     outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
     dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
     number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
     include the number of additional common shares that would have been
     outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. The
     dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per
     share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of
     convertible securities is reflected using the if-converted method.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
     earnings per share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):

     Options to purchase approximately 1,853,108 and 160,000 shares of common
     stock were outstanding as of July 1, 2000, and June 26, 1999, respectively,
     that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for
     the quarters then ended because the options' exercise price was greater
     than the average market price of the Company's common stock during those
     periods and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.

     During the first two quarters of 1999, the Company had outstanding $661
     million of unsecured convertible subordinated debentures (the Debentures)
     which were convertible by their holders into approximately 45.2 million
     shares of common stock. The weighted-average common shares represented by
     the Debentures upon conversion were included in the computation of diluted
     earnings per share for the three and nine month periods ended June 26,
     1999, using the if-converted method. On April 14, 1999, the Company called
     for redemption the Debentures. As a result, debenture holders converted
     virtually all of the outstanding debentures to 45.2 million shares of the
     Company's common stock during the third quarter of 1999. For additional
     disclosures regarding the Debentures, see the 1999 Form 10-K.

     NOTE 4 - NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

     The Company holds significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM),
     Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai)
     and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These investments are reflected in
     the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments
     and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be
     carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
     reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
     income. The combined fair value of these investments was $1.236 billion and
     $339 million as of July 1, 2000, and September 25, 1999, respectively.
     The combined fair value of these investments has declined to
     approximately $1.062 billion as of July 28, 2000. The Company believes it
     is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair
     value of these investments in the future.

     ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design
     and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology.
     As of September 25, 1999, the Company held approximately 80 million shares
     of ARM stock with a fair value of $226 million. Share data for ARM
     presented in this Form 10-Q has been adjusted to reflect ARM's four-for-one
     stock split in April of 1999 and its five-for-one stock split in April of
     2000. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold approximately 5
     million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $51 million
     and a gain before taxes of $50 million. During the nine months ended July
     1, 2000, the Company has sold approximately 38 million shares of ARM stock
     for net proceeds of approximately $288 million and gains before taxes of
     approximately $284 million. During the third quarter of 1999, the Company
     sold approximately 50 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $105
     million and a gain before taxes of $101 million. During the nine months
     ended June 26, 1999, the Company sold approximately 148 million shares of
     ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $201 million and a gain before
     taxes of approximately $188. The fair value of the Company's investment in
     ARM is approximately $450 million as of July 1, 2000.

     In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an
     Internet service provider (ISP). The investment is in EarthLink's Series C
     Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible by the Company after
     January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common
     stock. Concurrent with this investment, Earthlink and the Company entered
     into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in
     the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will
     profit from each new Mac customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP
     service, and EarthLink will become the default ISP in Apple's Internet
     Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United
     States. The fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink is
     approximately $110 million as of July 1, 2000.

     During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in
     Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel
     display production capacity. The investment, in the form of three year
     unsecured bonds, is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of
     Samsung common stock beginning in July 2000. The bonds carry an annual
     coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at
     their maturity. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung is
     approximately $188 million as of July 1, 2000.

     In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global
     Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of
     convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of
     Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of
     Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. The Company is restricted
     from selling more than 25% of its shares within one year after the date of
     the closing of the public offering of Akamai's stock. Beginning in the
     first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as
     available-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai is
     approximately $488 million as of July 1, 2000.

     the Company's Chief Executive Officer options under the Company's 1998
     Executive Officer Stock Plan to purchase 20 million shares of common stock

     NOTE 6 - COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

     Comprehensive income is comprised of two components, net income and other
     comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
     expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting
     principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are
     excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is
     comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
     subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and
     from unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on marketable securities
     categorized as available-for-sale. See Note 4 for additional information
     regarding available-for-sale securities. The components of comprehensive

     NOTE 7 - SPECIAL CHARGES

     RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

     During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring
     actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge.
     This charge was comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various
     operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95
     employees associated with consolidation of various domestic and
     international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for
     severance, $2.5 million had been spent by July 1, 2000, and the remainder
     is expected to be spent over the following two quarters. Of the $3 million
     accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized
     by April 1, 2000.

     During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring
     actions resulting in a charge to operations of $21 million comprised of $11
     million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of
     the Company's outsourced data center, substantially all of which had been
     spent by the end of the third quarter of 2000, and $10 million for contract
     cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements
     previously discontinued, substantially all of which had been utilized by
     the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2000.

     EXECUTIVE BONUS

     In December 1999, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special
     executive bonus for past services for the Company's Chief Executive Officer
     in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the company of
     approximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible.
     Approximately half of the total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The
     other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the
     purchase.

     NOTE 8 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

     The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
     Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, and

     Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable operating segment provides similar products
     and services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the
     same as those described in the 1999 Form 10-K.


                                       9

<PAGE>

     The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on
     net sales and operating income. Operating income for each segment includes
     revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the
     segment. Net sales are based on the location of the customers. Operating
     income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
     expenses that are managed outside the reportable segment. Costs excluded
     from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, income
     taxes, and nonrecurring charges for purchased in-process research and
     development, restructuring, and acquisition related costs. Corporate
     expenses include research and development, manufacturing expenses not
     included in segment cost of sales, corporate marketing expenses, and other
     separately managed general and administrative expenses. The Company does
     not include intercompany transfers between segments for management
     reporting purposes. Summary information by segment follows (in millions):

     NOTE 9 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1,
     "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
     Internal Use," which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of
     computer software intended for internal use. The adoption of SOP 98-1 in
     fiscal 2000 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
     results of operations or financial position during the quarter and nine
     months ended July 1, 2000.

     In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
     "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued.
     SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 138, establishes accounting and
     reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and
     exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all
     derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
     position and measure those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are
     not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative
     is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value
     will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
     assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in
     other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
     In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
     Hedging Activities- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
     133," was issued. The statement defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133
     until the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Company continues to
     review the effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 133, the Company does
     not currently believe its adoption will have a material impact on its
     financial position or overall trends in results of operations and does not
     believe adoption will result in significant changes to its financial risk
     management practices. However, the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 133 on
     the Company's results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of
     the Company's derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of
     adoption and may result in more pronounced quarterly fluctuations in other
     income and expense.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
     Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
     Statements." The objective of this SAB is to provide further guidance on
     revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature
     addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. The Company is
     required to adopt the guidance in the SAB no later than the fourth quarter
     of its fiscal year 2001. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have
     a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
     operations. The SEC has recently indicated it intends to issue further
     guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by SAB No.
     101. Until such time as this additional guidance is issued, the Company is
     unable to assess the impact, if any, it may have on its financial position
     or results of operations.

     NOTE 10 - CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are
     discussed in detail in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to
     certain other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the
     ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The
     results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however,
     in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential
     liability related to any legal proceedings and claims that would have a
     material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
     operations.

     The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax
     deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made
     certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed
     deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most
     of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS
     proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although
     most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still
     remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management
     believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may
     result from tax examinations.

<PAGE>

Net sales increased $267 million or 17% to $1.825 billion in the third quarter
of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999. On a year-over-year basis,
quarterly net sales increased in all of the Company's geographic operating
segments. The primary source of this growth was an overall 12% increase in
Macintosh unit sales, which reflects strong unit growth in the Americas and
Europe somewhat offset by a decline in unit sales in Japan. Further contributing
to year-over-year quarterly growth in net sales was a 4% increase in the average
revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net sales generated by
hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales.

For the first nine months of 2000, net sales increased $1.315 billion or 27%
over the same period in 1999. A 28% increase in year-to-date Macintosh unit
sales, reflective of strong growth in all of the Company's geographic operating
segments, was the principal cause of the increase in net sales during the first
nine months of 2000.

Net sales declined sequentially during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the
second quarter of 2000 by $120 million or 6%. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales
decreased 3% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the second quarter.
The sequential decline in both net sales and unit sales during the third quarter
was primarily the result of a sequential quarterly decline in iMac unit sales of
6% and a sequential decline in the average revenue per Macintosh system. The
Company believes that iMac unit sales during the third quarter were negatively
impacted by anticipation of product updates expected at the beginning of the
fourth quarter. The average revenue per Macintosh system for the third quarter
of 2000 declined 4% from the second quarter to $1,749. This decline was due to a
shift during the quarter towards lower-priced versions of its consumer products
purchased by the Company's education customers and by price protection
recognized during the third quarter resulting from planned product transitions
in the fourth quarter.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's
reportable geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, and Japan. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar
hardware and software products and similar services. Further information
regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in this Form 10-Q in the
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8, "Segment
Information and Geographic Data," and in the 1999 Form 10-K.

AMERICAS

Net sales in the Americas segment during the third quarter of 2000 increased
$140 million or 16% compared to the same period in 1999. Macintosh quarterly
unit sales in the Americas increased 10% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting
strong growth in unit sales of professional products, particularly PowerBooks,
and the impact on unit sales of iBook which was first shipped at the beginning
of fiscal 2000. These increases in unit sales were partially offset by an 8%
decline in unit sales of iMac ahead of the anticipated product updates at the
beginning of the fourth quarter. During the third quarter of 2000, the Americas
segment represented approximately 56% of the Company's total net sales compared
to 57% during the same quarter in 1999.

For the first nine months of 2000, net sales in the Americas segment increased
$571 million or 22% from the same period in 1999, while Macintosh unit sales
increased 24%. The results experienced by the Americas segment during the first
nine months of 2000 versus the same period in 1999 reflect the Company's overall
results characterized by strong year-to-date growth in sales of iMac and
PowerBook products, sales of iBook which was first shipped at the beginning of
fiscal 2000, and stable unit sales of the Company's Power Macintosh products.

EUROPE

Net sales in the Europe segment increased $56 million or 19% during the third
quarter of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999, while the segment's
Macintosh unit sales increased 33%. Growth in year-over-year unit sales was
experienced in the Europe segment in all four of the Company's principal product
families. Sequentially, net sales in the Europe segment declined $116 million or
25% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the second quarter, while
Macintosh unit sales declined 19%. The sequential decline in the Europe's
segment net sales and unit sales is attributable primarily to two factors.
First, like the Americas segment, Europe's results in the third quarter of 2000
as compared to the second quarter reflect a sequential decline in iMac unit
sales in anticipation of upcoming product updates. Second, the Company has
historically experienced a modest seasonal decline in net sales in Europe during
its third fiscal quarter.

JAPAN

Net sales in Japan rose 13% or $34 million during the third quarter of 2000 as
compared to the same quarter in 1999. However, the segment's quarterly Macintosh
unit sales decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis. The Japan segment's unit
sales during the third quarter of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999
reflect declines in unit sales of the Company's desktop products, particularly
iMac, prior to the anticipated product introductions in the fourth quarter,
partially offset by increases in sales of portable products. This shift in mix
towards higher-priced portable products led to the year-over-year increase in
net sales.

GROSS MARGIN

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2000 was 29.8% compared to 27.4% for the
same quarter in 1999 and 28.2% for the second quarter of 2000. Gross margin
during the third quarter of 2000 was favorably impacted by two principal
factors. First, component costs incurred to manufacture the Company's products
were lower during the third quarter of 2000 compared to both the previous
quarter and to the same quarter in 1999. Second, during the third quarter of
2000 the Company's mix of product sales shifted somewhat away from its consumer
products towards its higher margin professional desktop and portable products.

There can be no assurance targeted gross margin levels will be achieved or
current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general,
gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide
global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles,
potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside
manufacturing services, fluctuations in freight costs incurred to deliver the
Company's products to market, and potential changes to the Company's product
mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling
prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand
for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take
into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time;
however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in
the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding special charges,
increased $35 million or 14% during the third quarter of 2000 as compared to the
same period in 1999 and declined $9 million or 3% from the second quarter of
2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of
2000 increased $123 million or 16% as compared to the same period in 1999.
However, as a result of growing net sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses fell to 14% of net sales during the first nine months of 2000 compared
to 16% during the same period in 1999. The absolute year-over-year increases in
selling, general and administrative expenses for both the third quarter and the
first nine months of 2000 are primarily the result of higher variable selling
and marketing expenses resulting from the year-over-year increase in net sales
and due to higher discretionary spending on marketing and advertising in 2000 as
compared to 1999.

Expenditures for research and development increased 21% between the third
quarter of fiscal 2000 and the same quarter in 1999 and increased 20% during the
first nine months of 2000 compared to the same period in 1999. These increases
resulted primarily from increased spending in 2000 to support product
development activities and increased research and development headcount.

SPECIAL CHARGES

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions
resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was
comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5
million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with
consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing
functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent
by July 1, 2000, and the remainder is expected to be spent over the following
two quarters. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets,
substantially all was utilized by April 1, 2000.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past
services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the company of
approximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible.
Approximately half of the total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The other
half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the purchase.

TOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

Interest and other income and expense (net) increased $28 million or 117% to $52
million during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999
and increased $88 million or 166% for the first nine months of 2000 over the
same period in 1999. These increases are attributable primarily to two factors.
First, interest income increased $18 million or 48% between the third quarter of
2000 and the third quarter of 1999 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investment balances and due to an increase in the overall yield
earned on the Company's investment portfolio resulting from higher market
interest rates and a modest lengthening of the portfolio's average maturity.
Second, as the result of conversion to common stock of the Company's convertible
subordinated debentures during the third quarter of 1999, interest expense
declined $6 million or 55% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the same
quarter in 1999 and decreased $27 million or 64% for the comparable nine month
periods.

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold approximately 5 million
shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $51 million and a gain
before taxes of $50 million. During the nine months ended July 1, 2000, the
Company has sold approximately 38 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds
of approximately $288 million and gains before taxes of approximately $284
million. During the third quarter of 1999, the Company sold approximately 50
million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $105 million and a gain before
taxes of $101 million. During the nine months ended June 26, 1999, the Company
sold approximately 148 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of
approximately $201 million and a gain before taxes of approximately $188.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

As of July 1, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible
temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $535 million before being
offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the
Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based
on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of July 1, 2000,
a valuation allowance of $40 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset
for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance
primarily relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to
tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company will continue to
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the
need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2000 was
approximately 33% and includes the effect of the special executive bonus
accrued during that quarter. The effective tax rate during the first quarter
of 2000 without this charge was approximately 25%. The Company's effective
tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2000, was approximately 26%. The
effective tax rate without the special executive bonus for the nine months
ended July 1, 2000, is also 26%. This effective rate is less than the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to the reversal of a
portion of the previously established valuation allowance for tax loss and
credit carryforwards and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no
U.S. taxes were provided.

       each period.
   (c) Based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales

As of July 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $3.8 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $600 million over the
same balances at the end of fiscal 1999. For the nine months ended July 1, 2000,
the Company's primary source of cash was $668 million in cash flows from
operating activities. Cash generated by operations was primarily from net income
of $616 million and a combined increase in accounts payable and other current
liabilities of $392 million partially offset by an increase in accounts
receivable of $286 million. In addition to operating cash flow, other
significant cash flow items during the nine months ended July 1, 2000 included
net purchases of short-term investments of $582 million, $232 million utilized
for the purchase of long-term investments, $76 million for the purchase of
property, plant and equipment, and cash proceeds from the sale of ARM stock of
$288 million.

In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company
to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire
shares over any specified period of time. During the third quarter of 2000,
approximately 1 million shares of common stock were repurchased at a cost of
approximately $50 million. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company has repurchased a total of 4.5 million shares of its common stock at a
total cost of $166 million.

On November 18, 1999, the Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit
agreement with Bank of America. Loans under the agreement pay interest at LIBOR
plus 1%, and the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% of the
unused portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this
credit facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the
Company with an additional source of short-term liquidity.

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its cash
requirements over the next twelve months, including any cash that may be
utilized by its stock repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current
non-investment grade debt ratings, if the Company should need to obtain
short-term borrowings, there can no assurance such borrowings could be obtained
at favorable rates. The inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates
could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

The Company holds significant investments in ARM, Samsung, Akamai and EarthLink.
These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as
non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized
gains and

                                       17

<PAGE>

losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The combined fair value of these investments was $1.236
billion and $339 million as of July 1, 2000, and September 25, 1999,
respectively. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be
significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future.
Additional information regarding these investment may be found in this Form 10-Q
in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 4,
"Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments."

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition to
the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are many factors
that will affect the Company's future results and business, which may cause the
actual results to differ from those currently expected. The Company's future
operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the Company's
ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically
innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand patterns. Inherent
in this process are a number of factors that the Company must successfully
manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and a favorable
financial condition.

Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future
operating results and financial condition include, among other things, continued
competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the
Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company;
risks associated with international operations, including economic and labor
conditions, regional economic problems, political instability, tax laws, and
currency fluctuations; increasing dependence on third-parties for manufacturing
and other outsourced functions such as logistics; the availability of key
components on terms acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of
certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently
obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC
microprocessors developed by and obtained from IBM and Motorola and the final
assembly of certain of the Company's products; the Company's ability to supply
products in certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of
latent defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to
the marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue
to make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party
software for particular applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate
and retain key employees; the effect of previously undetected Y2K compliance
issues; managing the continuing impact of the European Union's transition to the
Euro as its common legal currency; continuing fluctuations in the fair value of
the Company's non-current debt and equity investments, and the Company's ability
to retain the operational and cost benefits derived from its recently completed
restructuring programs.

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" in
the Company's 1999 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW REGARDING MARKET RISK CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL
RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN
THIS FORM 10-Q REGARDING MARKET RISK. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1999 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to the Company's investments in debt securities and long-term debt
obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places
its investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is
to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds
by limiting market and credit risk. Excluding those investments classified as
non-current debt and equity investments, all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be
cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and twelve months
are considered to be short-term investments. As of July 1, 2000,
substantially all of the Company's investments in debt securities have
maturities less than 12 months.

During the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative
transactions, including interest rate swaps and floors, with financial
institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest
income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate
interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the
Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The
Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce
the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold
or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk
management.

Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar
and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a
stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may
negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.
dollars.

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with
financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed
transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's
foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its
existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company
may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial
either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related
currency's historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange
forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The
premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in
other current assets and marked to market through earnings.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and
interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities
of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign
exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and
floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its
underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively,
from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the
effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the
anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no
assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign
exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for
recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any
given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the
underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's
operating results and financial position.

For a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign currency
related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's
1999 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the Company's exposure
to interest rate and foreign currency risks since the date of the 1999 Form
10-K.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are
discussed in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other
legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal
proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

                                      BY-LAWS

                                         OF

                                APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

                             (a California corporation)


                        (as amended through April 20, 2000)


                                     Article I

                                      OFFICES

     SECTION 1.1:   PRINCIPAL OFFICE.  The principal executive office for the
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop,
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board of Directors is hereby granted full
power and authority to change the location of the principal executive office
from one location to another.

     SECTION 1.2:   OTHER OFFICES.  One or more branch or other subordinate
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at such
place or places within or without the State of California as it deems
appropriate.


                                     Article II

                                     DIRECTORS

     SECTION 2.1:   EXERCISE OF CORPORATE POWERS.  Except as otherwise provided
by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation or by the
laws of the State of California now or hereafter in force, the business and
affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be
exercised by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 2.2:   NUMBER.  The number of directors of the corporation shall be
not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of directors
shall be six (6) until changed within the limits specified above, by a by-law
amending this section, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the
shareholders. The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a definite
number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly adopted
amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this by-law
duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment
reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number less
than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a
meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action
by written consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum number of
authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated minimum
number of directors minus one.

     SECTION 2.3:   NEED NOT BE SHAREHOLDERS.  The directors of this corporation
need not be shareholders of this corporation.

     SECTION 2.4:   COMPENSATION.  Directors and members of committees may
receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed or
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained
shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

     SECTION 2.5:   ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE. Through and until immediately
prior to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, the
directors shall be divided into two classes,  designated Class I and Class II,
each consisting of one-half of the directors or  as close an approximation as
possible, and each director shall serve for a term  running until the second
annual meeting of shareholders succeeding his or her  election and until his or
her successor shall have been duly elected and  qualified; provided, however,
that the terms of all directors shall expire at  the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000. Commencing at the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, each director shall be elected to
serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in the following fiscal year
or until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

     SECTION 2.6:   VACANCIES.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of Directors
shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any director, or if
the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the shareholders fail, at
any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director is elected, to elect
the full authorized number of directors to be voted for at that meeting.  The
Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a director if he or she is
declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony or if,
within 60 days after notice of his or her election, he or she does not accept
the office.  Any vacancy, except for a vacancy created by removal of a director
as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, may be filled by a


                                      -1-
<PAGE>

person selected by a majority of the remaining directors then in office,
whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of removal of
directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders.  The shareholders
may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the
directors.  Any such election by written consent requires the consent of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling of
any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to
vote for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held
to elect the entire Board of Directors.  The term of office of any director
shall terminate upon such election of a successor.  Any director may resign
effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any,
the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of
Directors of this corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for
the effectiveness of such resignation.  Ifthe resignation is effective at a
future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation
becomes effective.  A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall
not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of
office.

     SECTION 2.7:   REMOVAL. The entire Board of Directors or any individual
director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the
entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the
votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would
be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without regard to
whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same
total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent,
all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number of directors
elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the
number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected.
If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same
meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares
is entitled to elect one or more directors under authority granted by the
Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the provisions of this Section
2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the vote of the
outstanding shares as a whole.

     SECTION 2.8:   POWERS AND DUTIES.  Without limiting the generality or
extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of Directors
pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby provided that the Board
of Directors shall have full power with respect to the following matters:

                              MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

     SECTION 10.1:  PLACE OF MEETINGS.  Meetings (whether regular, special or
adjourned) of the shareholders of this corporation shall be held at the
principal executive office for the transaction of business of this corporation,
or at any place within or without the State which may be designated by written
consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, or which may be
designated by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Any meeting shall be valid
wherever held if held by the written consent of all the shareholders entitled to
vote thereat, given either before or after the meeting and filed with the
Secretary of this corporation.

     SECTION 10.2:  ANNUAL MEETINGS.  The annual meeting of the shareholders
shall be held at the hour of 10:00 a.m. on the last Wednesday in January in each
year , if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next
succeeding business day not a legal holiday or at such other time in a
particular year as may be designated by written consent of all the shareholders
entitled to vote thereat or which may be designated by resolution of the Board
of Directors.  Such annual meetings shall be held at the place provided pursuant
to Section 10.1 hereof.  Said annual meetings shall be held for the purpose of
the election of directors, for the making of reports of the affairs of this
corporation and for the transaction of such other business as may come before
the meeting.

     SECTION 10.3:  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the shareholders for
any purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time by the President or
by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members thereof, or by one or more
holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent (10%) of the votes
on the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8.  Upon request in
writing sent by registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Vice
President or Secretary, or delivered to any such officer in person, by any
person or persons entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders (such
request, if sent by a shareholder or shareholders, to include the information
required by Section 10.13), it shall be the duty of such officer, subject to the
immediately succeeding sentence, to cause notice to be given to the shareholders
entitled to vote that a meeting will be requested by the person or persons
calling the meeting, the date of which meeting, which shall be set by such
officer, to be not less than 35 days nor more than 60 days after such request
or, if applicable, determination of the validity of such request pursuant to the
immediately succeeding sentence.  Within seven days after receiving such a
written request from a shareholder or shareholders of the corporation, the Board
of Directors shall determine whether shareholders owning not less than ten
percent (10%) of the shares as of the record date established pursuant to
Section 10.8 for such request support the call of a special meeting and notify
the requesting party or parties of its finding.

     SECTION 10.4:  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Notice of any meeting of shareholders
shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date
of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat by the Secretary or
an Assistant Secretary, or other person charged with that duty, or if there be
no such officer or person, or in case of his or her neglect or refusal, by any
director or shareholder.  The notice shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the
business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (ii) in
the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at
the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to present for action by the
shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such
action except that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal
relating to approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of
this corporation, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of
this corporation or winding up of this corporation.  The notice of any meeting
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for election.
Written notice shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder, either (i)
personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, charges
prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's address appearing
on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder to this
corporation for the purpose of notice.  If a shareholder gives no address or no
such address appears on the books of this corporation, notice shall be deemed to
have been given if sent by mail or other means of written communication
addressed to the place where the principal executive office of this corporation
is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the county in which such office is located.  The noice shall be deemed to
have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written communication
and addressed as hereinbefore provided.  An affidavit of delivery or mailing of
any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.4, executed by
the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie
evidence of the giving of the notice.  If any notice addressed to the
shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of the
corporation is returned to this corporation by the United States Postal Service
marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver
the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall be
deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be
available for the shareholder upon written demand of the shareholder at the
principal executive office of this corporation for a period of one year from the
date of the giving of the notice to all other shareholders.

     SECTION 10.5:  CONSENT TO SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS.  The transactions of any
meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as
valid as though had at a


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present
either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting,
each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy,
signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting
or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers, consents or
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting.  Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a
meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of
matters required by law to be included in the notice but not so included, if
such objection is expressly made at the meeting.  Neither the business to be
transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of
shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to
approval of contracts between this corporation and any of its directors,
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this
corporation or winding up the affairs of this corporation.

     SECTION 10.6:  QUORUM.  The presence in person or by proxy of the holders
of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Shares shall not be
counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the
meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the
meeting.  The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a
quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a
quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a
majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

     SECTION 10.7:  ADJOURNED MEETINGS.  Any shareholders' meeting, whether or
not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a
majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or
represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 10.6 hereof, in
the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such meeting.
When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days or if after adjournment a new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at a
meeting.  Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of
the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted
thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is
taken.  At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

     SECTION 10.8:  VOTING RIGHTS.  Only persons in whose names shares entitled
to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close of business
on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be fixed for the
determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section 2.8(k) hereof, then
on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.  In the absence of
any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable
statute relating to the election of directors or to other particular matters,
each such person shall be entitled to one vote for each share.

     In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors may
fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  Any
shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent or request a special meeting of the
shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice to the Secretary,
request the Board of Directors to fix a record date.  The Board of Directors
shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28) days after the date
on which such request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.

     SECTION 10.9:  ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENTS.  Any action which may be taken
at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting
and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than
the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving such written consent or
consents from shareholders of the corporation, the Board of Directors shall
determine whether holders of outstanding shares as of the record date
established pursuant to Section 10.8 having not less than the minimum number of
votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted have properly
consented thereto in writing and notify the requesting party of its finding.
Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in
writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) contracts between this
corporation and any of its directors, (ii) indemnification of any person, (iii)
reorganization of this corporation or (iv) distributions to shareholders upon
winding up of this corporation in certain circumstances without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given at least 10 days before the
consummation of the action authorized by such approval, and prompt notice shall
be given of the taking of any other corporate action approved by shareholders
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent, to those shareholders
entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder
shall conform to the requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.
When written consents are given with


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from the persons
in whose names such shares stand on the books of this corporation at the time
such respective consens are given, or any shareholder's proxy holder, or a
transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder or
their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received
by this corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of
shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the
Secretary of this corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  Such revocation
is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected by
written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to
vote for the election of directors.

     SECTION 10.10: ELECTIONS OF DIRECTORS. In any election of directors, the
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares
entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by
such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with
respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.  Elections
of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a shareholder at
the meeting and before the voting begins.

     SECTION 10.11: PROXIES.  Every person entitled to vote or execute consents
shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents
authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person's duly
authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this corporation.  No proxy
shall be valid (1) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically
made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and applicable
law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof, unless
the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such
proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may be effected by a writing
delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating that the proxy is revoked
or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting
in person by, the person executing the proxy.  A proxy is not revoked by the
death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written
notice of such death or incapacity is received by this corporation.  A proxy
which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified
therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the
following: (1) a pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase
or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of
such person's shares in this corporation to the maker of the proxy, (3) a
creditor or creditors of this corporation or the shareholder who extended or
continued credit to this corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the
proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension
or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the
credit, (4) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of
this corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if
the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of
employment, the name of the employee and the period of employmet contracted for,
(5) a person designated by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or
a voting trust agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is
given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or
equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the
obligation secured by it.  Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability
specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option
or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares
of this corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is
paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a
provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of
the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its
irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares.  Every form
of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity to specify approval
or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate
space marked "abstain", whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain
from voting his or her shares on the proposal.  A proxy marked "abstain" by the
shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for
or against such proposal.  In any election of directors, any form of proxy in
which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which
is marked by a shareholder "withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating
that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not
be voted either for or against the election of a director.

     SECTION 10.12: INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  Before any meeting of shareholders,
the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than nominees for office to
act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no
inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of the meeting may, and on
the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint
inspectors of election at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either
one (1) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request
of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or
their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three
(3) inspectors are to be appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails
to appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairman of the meeting may, and upon
the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person
to fill that vacancy.

     These inspectors shall:

          (a)  Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power
of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and
the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

          (b)  Receive votes, ballots, or consents;


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

          (c)  Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way
arising in connection with the right to vote;

          (d)  Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

          (e)  Determine when the polls shall close;

          (f)  Determine the result; and

          (g)  Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or
vote with fairness to all shareholders.

     SECTION 10.13:  ADVANCE NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR
NOMINATIONS.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought before
a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given timely
notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such
nomination or nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in the event
less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting
is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be
so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure was made.  To be  in proper written form a shareholder's notice to
the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address of the shareholder who
intends to make the nominations or propose the business and, as the case may be,
of the person or persons to be nominated or of the business to be proposed, (ii)
a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the
Corporation that intends to vote such stock at such meeting and, if applicable,
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice, (iii) if applicable, a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee or any
other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the
nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (iv) such other
information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to be proposed by
such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed
pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated,
or intended to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be
proposed, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable,
the consent of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The
chairman of a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the nomination
of any person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the
foregoing procedure.

                                     Article XI

Annual Meeting") and at such other times as may be designated from time to time
by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Notice of the time and place of all
regular meetings shall be given in the same manner as for special meetings,
except that no such notice need be given if (l) the time and place of such
meetings are fixed by the Board of Directors or (2) the Regular Annual Meeting
is held at the principal place of business provided at Section 1.1 hereof and on
the date specified in Section 10.2 hereof.

     SECTION 11.3:  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board of

     SECTION 11.4:  NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board
of Directors shall be held upon no less than four days' notice by mail or 48
hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph to each

or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its
commencement, the lack of notice to such director.  Any oral notice given
personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a
person at the home or office of the director who the person giving the notice
has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director.  A notice or
waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any meeting of the Board.  If
the address of a director is not shown on the records and is not readily
ascertainable, notice shall be addressed to him at the city or place in which
the meetings of the directors are regularly held.  If the meeting is adjourned
for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall

     SECTION 11.5:  QUORUM. A majority of all directors elected by the
shareholders and appointed to fill vacancies as provided in Section 2.6 hereof
shall constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors for the transaction of
business.  Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors
present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the
Board of Directors subject to (a) provisions of law relating to interested
directors, (b) indemnification of agents of this corporation and (c) Section
12.9 hereof.  A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is

the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a
majority of the required quorum for such meeting.

     SECTION 11.6:  CONFERENCE TELEPHONE.  Members of the Board of Directors may
participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment, so long as all directors participating in such meeting
can hear one another.  Participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 11.6
constitutes presence in person at such meeting.

     SECTION 11.7:  WAIVER OF NOTICE AND CONSENT.  The transactions of any
meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held,
shall be as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and

of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to
holding such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers,
consents and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part
of the minutes of the meeting.

     SECTION 11.8:  ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING.  Any action required or permitted
by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if
all members of the Board of Directors shall individually or collectively consent
in writing to such action.  Such written consent or consents shall be filed with
the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors. Such action by written
consent shall have the same force and effect as the unanimous vote of such
directors.

     SECTION 11.9:  COMMITTEES.  The provisions of this Article XI apply also to
committees of the Board of Directors and action by such committees, mutatis
mutandis.

money and notes of this corporation, and all written contracts of this
corporation, shall be signed by such officer or officers, agent or agents, as
the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.  No officer, agent, or
employee of this corporation shall have the power to bind this corporation by
contract or otherwise unless authorized to do so by these By-Laws or by the
Board of Directors.

     SECTION 12.2:  SHARES HELD BY THE CORPORATION.  Shares in other
corporations standing in the name of this corporation may be voted or
represented and all rights incident thereto may be exercised on behalf of the
corporation by any officer of this corporation authorized so to do by resolution
of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 12.3:  CERTIFICATES OF STOCK.  There shall be issued to every
holder of shares in this corporation a certificate or certificates signed in the

Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer or the Secretary
or any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and the class or
series of shares owned by the shareholder.  Any or all of the signatures on the
certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar
who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate
shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by this corporation with the same effect
as if such person were an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of

317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding (as
defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by reason of the fact that

agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,

this Article XVI.

     SECTION 16.4:  INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE.  The indemnification provided by
this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which

Incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an agreement in
effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in
the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid,
which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

          (b)  That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly
imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

       4.     ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

              (a)    COMPOSITION OF ADMINISTRATOR.  The Plan may be administered
by (i) the Board or (ii) a Committee designated by the Board, which Committee
shall be constituted in such a manner as to satisfy the applicable securities
laws, California corporate law and the Code (collectively, "APPLICABLE LAWS").

                     Once a Committee has been appointed pursuant to this
Section 4(a), such Committee shall continue to serve in its designated capacity
until otherwise directed by the Board.  From time to time the Board may increase
the size of the Committee and appoint additional members thereof, remove members
(with or without cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill
vacancies (however caused) and remove all members of the Committee and
thereafter directly administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted by the
Applicable Laws.

              (b)    POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Subject to the provisions of
the Plan and, in the case of the Committee, subject to the specific duties
delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the
authority, in its discretion:  (i) to determine the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock in accordance with the Plan; (ii) to determine, in accordance with
Section 8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per Share of Options and SARs to be
granted; (iii) to determine the Employees to whom, and the time or times at
which, Options and SARs shall be granted and the number of Shares to be
represented by each Option or SAR (including, without limitation, whether or not
a corporation shall be excluded


<PAGE>

from the definition of Affiliated Company); (iv) to construe and interpret
the provisions of the Plan and any agreements or certificates issued under or
in connection with the Plan; (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Option or SAR granted
hereunder (including, but not limited to, any restriction or limitation, or
any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions regarding any
Option or SAR or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such
factors as the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion); (vi)
to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vii) to prescribe,
amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (viii) to
modify or amend each Option or SAR or accelerate the exercise date of any
Option or SAR; (ix) to reduce the exercise price of any Option or SAR to the
then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock
covered by such Option or SAR shall have declined since the date the Option
or SAR was granted; (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the
Company any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Option or SAR
previously granted by the Administrator; and (xi) to make all other
determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the
Plan.

              (c)    EFFECT OF DECISIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATOR.  All decisions,
determinations and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and
binding on all Optionees and any other holders of any Options.

       5.     ELIGIBILITY.  The Administrator may grant Options and SARs only to
individuals who are Employees or who are consultants to the Company, or a
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company.  In no event may an Option or SAR be granted
to any individual who, at the time of grant, is an Officer or Director.  An
Employee who has been granted an Option or SAR may, if he or she is otherwise
eligible, be granted an additional Option or Options, SAR or SARs.  Each Option
shall be evidenced by a written Option agreement, which shall be in such form
and contain such provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem
appropriate.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator may, at any
time, or from time to time, authorize the Company, with the consent of the
respective recipients, to issue new Options or Options in exchange for the
surrender and cancellation of any or all outstanding Options, other options,
SARs or other stock appreciation rights.

       Neither the Plan nor any Option or SAR agreement shall confer upon any
Optionee any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company (or
any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliated Company), nor shall it interfere in any way
with the Optionee's right or the right of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary
or Affiliated Company) to terminate the Optionee's employment at any time or for
any reason.

       If an Option or SAR is granted to an individual who is a consultant to
the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, all references in the Plan to
"Employee" shall be deemed to include the term "consultant" and all references
in the Plan to "employment," "Continuous Status as an Employee" and
"termination of employment" shall be deemed to refer to the individual's
consultancy or status as a consultant.

       6.     TERM OF PLAN.  The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption
by the Board.  It shall continue in effect for a term of ten years unless sooner
terminated under Section 14 of the Plan.

       7.     TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be ten (10) years
from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Option agreement.

       8.     EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

              (a)    EXERCISE PRICE.  The per Share exercise price for the
Shares issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is determined by
the Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 100% of the Fair Market


<PAGE>

Value of Common Stock, determined as of the date of grant of the Option.  In
the event that the Administrator shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise
price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of
that reduction.

              (b)    METHOD OF PAYMENT.  The consideration to be paid for the
Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment,
shall be determined by the Administrator and may consist of (i) cash, (ii)
check, (iii) promissory note, (iv) other Shares which have a Fair Market Value
on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as
to which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery of a properly executed
exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly
deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds required to pay the
exercise price, or (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment
and/or any other consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted under
applicable corporate law.

       9.     STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

              (a)    GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion
of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of
an Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time
thereafter during the term of the Option.  The following provisions apply to
SARs that are granted in connection with Options:

       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by
       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.
       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal
       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the
       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related
       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the
       surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the
       foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be
       paid upon exercise of an SAR; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such limit shall
       not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.

       (ii)   When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent
       surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.

       (iii)  An SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the
       related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on
       which the related Option expires.

       (iv)   An SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value
       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.

              (b)    INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the
Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options.  The following
provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to
       receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair
       Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,
       as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the
       Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date
       on which the SAR was granted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrator
       may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of an SAR.

       (ii)   SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as
       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement.


<PAGE>

              (c)    FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the
exercise of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination
of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
determine.  Shares issued upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their
Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

       10.    METHOD OF EXERCISE.

              (a)    PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any
Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under
such conditions as determined by the Administrator and as shall be permissible
under the terms of the Plan.

              An Option or SAR shall be deemed to be exercised when written
notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the
terms of the Option or SAR by the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR
and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised
has been received by the Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the
Administrator and permitted by the Option agreement, consist of any
consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(b) of the Plan.
Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the
Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock,
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.  No adjustment will be made for a
dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock
certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option
or SAR may not be exercised with respect to a fraction of a Share.

              (b)    TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of
an Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason of
the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety days after the
date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that
it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date the
Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time
from the date of grant.

              (c)    DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  In the event of the death of an
Optionee:

       (i)    Who is at the time of death an Employee and who shall have been in
       Continuous Status as an Employee since the date of grant of the Option,
       the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months (or
       such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined
       by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's
       estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by
       bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise
       that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated
       his or her employment six (6) months (or such other period of time not
       exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator) after
       the date of death; or

       (ii)   Within ninety days after the termination of Continuous Status as
       an Employee, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within six
       (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months
       as determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the
       Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the
       Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to
       exercise that had accrued at the date of termination.

              Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not
be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.


<PAGE>

              (d)    STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX
OBLIGATIONS. When an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the
exercise of an Option or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay
the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the
Optionee may satisfy the withholding tax obligation by electing to have the
Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR, if any, that number of
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be
withheld.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be
determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be
determined (the "TAX DATE").

              All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this
purpose shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and
shall be subject to the following restrictions:

              (i)    the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax
Date; and

              (ii)   all elections shall be subject to the consent or
disapproval of the Administrator.

       11.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS.  Options and SARs may not be sold,
pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other
than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Administrator may grant Nonstatutory Stock Options that are
freely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an Optionee or holder
of an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An Option or an SAR may be exercised,
during the lifetime of the Optionee or SAR holder, only by the Optionee or SAR
holder or by a transferee permitted by this Section 11.

       12.    ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION OR MERGER.

              (a)    CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action
by the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each
outstanding Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been authorized
for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have yet been
granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration
of an Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each such
outstanding Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or
decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common
Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number of issued
Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not
be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."  Such
adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that
respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided
herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or
securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no
adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price
of Shares subject to an Option or SAR.

              (b)    DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options and SARs will
terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless


<PAGE>

otherwise provided by the Administrator.  The Administrator may, in the
exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or
SAR shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator and give each
Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or any part
of the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR
would not otherwise be exercisable.

              (c)    SALE OF ASSETS OR MERGER. Subject to the provisions of
Section 12(d), in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another
corporation, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent
option or stock appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor
corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the
Administrator determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of
such assumption or substitution, that the Optionee shall have the right to
exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as
to which the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.  If the
Administrator makes an Option or SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or
substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall
notify the Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a
period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR
will terminate upon the expiration of such period.  For purposes of this
paragraph, an Option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed if,
following the sale of assets or merger, the Option confers the right to
purchase, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately
prior to the sale of assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or
other securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
transaction (and if such holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the sale of
assets or merger was not solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or its
parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation and
the participant, provide for the per share consideration to be received upon
exercise of te Option to be solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or
its parent equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by
holders of Common Stock in the sale of assets or merger.

              (d)    CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a "Change in Control"
of the Company, as defined in Section 12(e), unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following
acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

       (i)    Any Options and SARs outstanding as of the date such Change in
       Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable and
       vested on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested; and

       (ii)   The value of all outstanding Options and SARs shall, unless
       otherwise determined by the Administrator at or after grant, be
       cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options and SARs shall be cashed
       out shall be equal to the excess of (x) the Change in Control Price (as
       defined below) over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by
       the Option or SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee
       or, in the event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate
       of the Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the
       Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance.

              (e)    "DEFINITION OF "CHANGE IN CONTROL".  For purposes of this
Section 12, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

       ( i )  When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a
       Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting
       as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities
       of the Company representing


<PAGE>

       fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's
       then outstanding securities; or

       (ii)   The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval,
       and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
       Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

              (f)    CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For purposes of this Section 12,
"Change in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the
highest Fair Market Value at any time within the sixty-day period immediately
preceding the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the
Administrator (the "SIXTY-DAY PERIOD"), or (ii) the highest price paid or
offered, as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or
bona fide offer related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time
within the Sixty-Day Period.

       13.    TIME OF GRANTING OPTIONS AND SARS.  The date of grant of an Option
or SAR shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination granting such Option or SAR.  Notice of the determination shall be
given to each Employee to whom an Option or SAR is so granted within a
reasonable time after the date of such grant.

       14.    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

              (a)    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time
amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as it may deem advisable.

              (b)    EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.  Any such amendment,
alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair the rights of
any Optionee or SAR holder under any grant theretofore made without his or her
consent.  Such Options and SARs shall remain in full force and effect as if this
Plan had not been amended or terminated.

       15.    CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.  Shares shall not be issued
with respect to an Option or SAR unless the exercise of such Option or SAR and
the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all
relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon
which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to
the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

              As a condition to the exercise of an Option or SAR or the issuance
of Shares upon exercise of an Option or SAR, the Company may require the person
exercising such Option or SAR to represent and warrant at the time of any such
exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any
present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of
counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the
aforementioned relevant provisions of law.

              Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory
body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to
be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall
relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the non-issuance or sale of
such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

       16.    RESERVATION OF SHARES.  The Company, during the term of this Plan,
will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

       17.    NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to
the contrary, with respect to any employee who is resident outside of the
United States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of
the Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or
to meet the objectives of the Plan. The Committee may, where appropriate,
establish one or more sub-plans for this purpose.

                           (AS AMENDED THROUGH 6/27/00)

    1.  PURPOSES OF THE PLAN.  The purposes of this Stock Plan are:

       to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of
       substantial responsibility;

       to provide additional incentive to the Chairman and/or Executive Officers
       and other key employees; and

       to promote the success of the Company's business.

    Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options (as defined
under Section 422 of the Code) or Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by
the Administrator at the time of grant. Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may
be granted under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of
Options. Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

    2.  DEFINITIONS.  As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

    administration of stock option plans under U.S. state corporate laws, U.S.
    federal and state securities laws, the Code, any stock exchange or quotation
    system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted and the applicable laws

        (j)  "CONTINUOUS STATUS AS CHAIRMAN" unless determined otherwise by the

    not be considered interrupted in the case of medical leave, military leave,
    family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the Administrator,
    provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in termination as
    Chairman with the Company. Neither service as a Director nor payment of a
    director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to constitute status as
    "Chairman" by the Company.

    provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in termination of
    the employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the
    case may be, under the terms of the respective Company policy for such
    leave; however, vesting may be tolled while an employee is on an approved
    leave of absence under the terms of the respective Company policy for such
    leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers between locations of the Company
    or between the Company, its Subsidiaries, or its successor; For purposes
    of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety days, unless

    contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved
    by the Company is not so guaranteed, on the 91st day of such leave any
    Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as
    an Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a
    Nonstatutory Stock Option. Neither service as a Chairman nor as a Director
    nor payment of a director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to
    constitute 'employment' by the Company.

       the closing bid, if no sales were reported) as quoted on such exchange or
       system, on the date of determination or, if the date of determination is
       not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day, as reported in
       THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or such other source as the Administrator deems
       reliable;

           (ii) If the Common Stock is regularly quoted by a recognized
       securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, the Fair Market
       Value of a Share of Common Stock shall be the mean between the high bid
       and low asked prices for the Common Stock on the date of determination
       or, if there are no quoted prices on the date of determination, on the
       last day on which there are quoted prices prior to the date of

reacquired Common Stock.

    In the discretion of the Administrator, any or all of the Shares authorized
under the Plan may be subject to SARs issued pursuant to the Plan.

    If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right issued under the Plan should
expire or become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in
full, the unpurchased Shares which were subject thereto shall become available
for other Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights under this Plan (unless the
Plan has terminated); however, should the Company reacquire Shares which were
issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR, such Shares shall not
become available for future grant under the Plan. If Shares of Restricted Stock
are repurchased by the Company at their original purchase price, such shares
shall become available for future grant under the Plan.

    4.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a)  PROCEDURE.

           (i) MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES. If permitted by Rule 16b-3
       promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto, as in
       effect at the time that discretion is being exercised with respect to the
       Plan, and by the legal requirements of the Applicable Laws relating to

       neither Directors nor Officers.

           (ii) SECTION 162(m). To the extent that the Administrator determines
       it to be desirable to qualify Options or SARs granted hereunder as
       "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
       the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more
       "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

<PAGE>
          (iii) RULE 16b-3. To the extent desirable to qualify transactions

       under Rule 16b-3.

           (iv) OTHER ADMINISTRATION. Other than as provided above, the Plan
       shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which
       committee shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.

        (b)  POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Subject to the provisions of the

           (ii) to select the person(s) to whom Options, SARs and Stock Purchase
       Rights may be granted hereunder;

          (iii) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered
       by each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;

           (iv) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

           (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the
       terms of the Plan, of any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted
       hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the
       exercise price, the date of grant, the time or times when Options, SARs
       or Stock Purchase Rights may be exercised (which may be based on
       performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture
       restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR
       or Stock Purchase Right or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto,
       based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole
       discretion, shall determine;

           (vi) to reduce the exercise price of any Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market
       Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
       Right shall have declined since the date the Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right was granted;

          (vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards
       granted pursuant to the Plan;

         (viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating
       to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans
       established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment
       under foreign tax laws;

           (ix) to modify or amend each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
       (subject to Section 17(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary
       authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options
       longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;

           (x) to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by
       electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon
       exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right that number of Shares
       having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.
       The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on
       the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All
       elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall
       be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may
       deem necessary or advisable;

           (xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any
       instrument required to effect the grant of an Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right previously granted by the Administrator; and

<PAGE>
          (xii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable
       for administering the Plan.

        (c)  EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR'S DECISION.  The Administrator's decisions,
    determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all
    Optionees and any other holders of Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights.

    5.  ELIGIBILITY.  Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights
may be granted to the Chairman, Executive Officers and other key employees or to
such other individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has
offered a position of Chairman or Executive Officer. Incentive Stock Options may
be granted only to Executive Officers and other key employees.

    6.  LIMITATIONS.

        (a) Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an
    Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,
    notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair
    Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
    exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year
    (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds
    $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For
    purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into
    account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of
    the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to
    such Shares is granted.

        (b) Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's
    relationship as an Employee with or Chairman of the Company, nor shall they
    interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to
    terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.

        (c) The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options and SARs:

           (i) No participant shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the
       Company, Options or SARs to purchase more than 17,000,000 Shares;

           (ii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in
       connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described
       in Section 15;

          (iii) If an Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the
       Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a
       transaction described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted
       against the limits set forth in subsections (i) above. For this purpose,
       if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction
       will be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a
       new Option or SAR.

    7.  TERM OF PLAN.  Subject to Section 21 of the Plan, the Plan shall become
effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in effect for a term
of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 16 of the Plan.

    8.  TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be stated in the
Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10)
years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an
Optionee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock
representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the
Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such
shorter term as may be provided in the Agreement.

<PAGE>
    9.  OPTION EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

        (a)  EXERCISE PRICE.  The per share exercise price for the Shares to be
    issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the
    Administrator, subject to the following:

           (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option;

              (A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock
           Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent
           (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or
           any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no
           less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of
           grant; or

               (B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in
           paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall
           be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date
           of grant;

           (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share
       exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a
       Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as 'performance-based
       compensation' within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per
       Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value
       per Share on the date of grant;

          (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per
       Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share
       on the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a
       merger or other corporate transaction.

        (b)  WAITING PERIOD AND EXERCISE DATES.  At the time an Option is
    granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may
    be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied
    before the Option may be exercised.

        (c)  FORM OF CONSIDERATION.  The Administrator shall determine the
    acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the
    method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the
    Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the
    time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of:

           (i) cash;

           (ii) check;

          (iii) promissory note;

           (iv) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon
       exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six
       months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the
       date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as
       to which said Option shall be exercised;

           (v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise
       program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

           (vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the
       Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's
       participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or
       arrangement;

          (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

         (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance
       of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

<PAGE>
    10.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

        (a)  GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion of the
    Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of an
    Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time
    thereafter during the term of the Option. The following provisions apply to
    SARs that are granted in connection with Options:

           (i) The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by
       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.
       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal
       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the
       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related
       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the
       surrendered portion of the related Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
       the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon
       exercise of a SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict
       the exercisability of the related Option;

           (ii) When a SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent
       surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable;

          (iii) A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the
       related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on
       which the related Option expires; and

           (iv) A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value
       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.

        (b)  INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator,
    SARs may be granted without related Options. The following provisions apply
    to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

           (i) The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to
       receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair
       Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,
       as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the
       Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date
       on which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the Administrator
       may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of a SAR;
       and

           (ii) SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as
       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's Agreement.

        (c)  FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the
    exercise of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any
    combination of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole
    discretion, may determine. Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall be
    valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

        (d)  RULE 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional
    restrictions as may be required to be contained in the Plan or Agreement in
    order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by Rule
    16b-3.

    11.  EXERCISE OF OPTION OR SAR.

        (a)  PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any Option or SAR
    granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan
    and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the
    Administrator and set forth in the Agreement. An Option may not be exercised
    for a fraction of a Share.

<PAGE>
        An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives:
    (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms
    of the Option or SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or
    SAR, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option
    is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of
    payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Agreement and
    the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the
    name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the
    Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by
    the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
    transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any
    other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned
    Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue
    (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised.
    No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the
    record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided
    in Section 15 of the Plan.

        Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares
    thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the
    Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
    Exercise of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised,
    result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be
    available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be
    exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.

        (b)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS STATUS AS CHAIRMAN.  Upon termination of
    an Optionee's Continuous Status as Chairman (other than termination by
    reason of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within
    ninety (90) days after the date of such termination, exercise his or her
    Option or SAR to the extent that it was exercisable at the date of such
    termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may
    not be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by
    its terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

        (c)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of an
    Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason
    of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days
    after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the
    extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be
    exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
    terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

        (d)  DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  If an Optionee dies (i) while an Employee or
    Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6)
    months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as
    determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the
    Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the
    Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to
    exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and
    terminated his or her employment six (6) months (or such other period of
    time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator)
    after the date of death; or (ii) within ninety (90) days after the
    termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or Chairman, the Option or
    SAR may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months (or such other
    period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the
    Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or by a
    person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or
    inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had
    accrued at the date of termination. If the Option or SAR is not so exercised
    within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the
    Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be
    exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
    terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

<PAGE>
        (e)  BUYOUT PROVISIONS.  The Administrator may at any time offer to buy
    out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option or SAR previously granted
    based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and
    communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

    12.  STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.

        (a)  RIGHTS TO PURCHASE.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either
    alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan
    and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator
    determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall
    advise the Optionee in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions
    and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that
    the Optionee shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the
    time within which the Optionee must accept such offer. The offer shall be
    accepted by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the
    Administrator.

        (b)  REPURCHASE OPTION.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise,
    the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon
    the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the
    Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The purchase price
    for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall be the original price
    paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of
    the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate
    determined by the Administrator.

        (c)  OTHER PROVISIONS.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms,
    provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be
    determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

        (d)  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is
    exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a
    shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered
    upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No
    adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record
    date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as
    provided in Section 15 of the Plan.

    13.  TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS, SARS AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.  Unless
determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed
of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title
1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and may be exercised, during
the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes
an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such Option, SAR or Stock
Purchase Right shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the
Administrator deems appropriate.

    14.  STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX OBLIGATIONS.  When an
Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option,
SAR or Stock Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay
the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the
Optionee may satisfy the withholding tax obligation by electing to have the
Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if
any, that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount
required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld
shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to
be determined (the "Tax Date").

    All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall
be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be
subject to the following restrictions:

        (i) the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax Date;
    and

<PAGE>
        (ii) all elections shall be subject to the consent or disapproval of the
    Administrator.

    In the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an Optionee and
the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because no election is
filed under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall receive the full
number of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
is exercised but such Optionee shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back
to the Company the proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.

    15.  ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER OR
ASSET SALE.

        (a)  CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action by the
    shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by
    each outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of
    shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the
    Plan but as to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been
    granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or
    expiration of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price
    per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR or
    Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or
    decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a
    stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or
    reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in
    the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of
    consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
    convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been
    "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made
    by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding
    and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the
    Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into
    shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason
    thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of
    Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.

        (b)  DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed
    dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and
    Stock Purchase Rights will terminate immediately prior to the consummation
    of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The
    Administrator may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances,
    declare that any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate as of a
    date fixed by the Administrator and give each Optionee the right to exercise
    his or her Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the
    Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option, SAR or Stock
    Purchase Right would not otherwise be exercisable.

        (c)  MERGER OR ASSET SALE.  Unless otherwise determined by the
    Administrator, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another
    corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,
    each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an
    equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a
    Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the
    successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or
    Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to
    exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned
    Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or
    exercisable. If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested
    and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a
    merger or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in
    writing or electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    be fully vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the
    date of such notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this
    paragraph, the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered
    assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right
    confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock
    subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the
    merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other

<PAGE>

    securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by
    holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
    transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
    type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the
    outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration
    received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the
    succesor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the
    consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be
    received upon the exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for
    each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
    Right, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its
    Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received
    by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.

        (d)  CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a "Change in Control" of the
    Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by
    the Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the
    following acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

           (i) Any Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding as of the
       date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred that are not
       yet exercisable and vested on such date shall become fully exercisable
       and vested; and

          (ii) The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase
       Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or
       after grant, be cashed-out. The amount at which such Options, SARs and
       Stock Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of
       (x) the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
       Right. The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, in the
       event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate of the
       Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option,
       SAR or Stock Purchase Right by bequest or inheritance.

        (e)  DEFINITION OF "CHANGE IN CONTROL".  For purposes of this
    Section 15, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the
    following:

           (i) When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a
       Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting
       as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities
       of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined
       voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or

           (ii) The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval,
       and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
       Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

        (f)  CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For purposes of this Section 15, "Change
    in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the
    highest Fair Market Value at any time within the 60-day period immediately
    preceding the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the
    Administrator (the "60-Day Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or
    offered, as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or
    bona fide offer related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time
    within the 60-Day Period.

    16.  DATE OF GRANT.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other
later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination
shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of
such grant.

    17.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a)  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time amend, alter,
    suspend or terminate the Plan.

        (b)  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Company shall obtain shareholder
    approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to
    comply with Applicable Laws.

        (c)  EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.  No amendment, alteration,
    suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any
    Optionee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the
    Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee
    and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the
    Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with
    respect to Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights granted under the Plan
    prior to the date of such termination.

    18.  CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.

        (a)  LEGAL COMPLIANCE.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the
    exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of
    such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of
    such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject
    to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

        (b)  INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS.  As a condition to the exercise of an
    Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person
    exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant
    at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only
    for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such
    Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation
    is required.

    19.  INABILITY TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY.  The inability of the Company to obtain
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale
of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect
of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority
shall not have been obtained.

    20.  RESERVATION OF SHARES.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

    21.  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is
adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the
degree required under Applicable Laws.

    22.  NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the
contrary, with respect to any employee who is resident outside of the United
States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the
Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or to
meet the objectives of the Plan. The Committee may, where appropriate,
establish one or more sub-plans for this purpose.

        Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

     NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's
     management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a
     fair statement of interim periods presented have been included. The results
     for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be
     expected for the entire year. Certain amounts in the Condensed Consolidated
     Balance Sheet as of September 25, 1999, have been reclassified to conform
     to the 2000 presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements
     and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's
     annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year
     ended September 25, 1999, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
     the year ended September 25, 1999 (the 1999 Form 10-K). All information is
     based on the Company's fiscal calendar.

     NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common
     shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
     outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
     dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
     number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
     include the number of additional common shares that would have been
     outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. The
     dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per
     share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of
     convertible securities is reflected using the if-converted method.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
     earnings per share (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):

     Options to purchase approximately 1,853,108 and 160,000 shares of common
     stock were outstanding as of July 1, 2000, and June 26, 1999, respectively,
     that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for
     the quarters then ended because the options' exercise price was greater
     than the average market price of the Company's common stock during those
     periods and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.

     During the first two quarters of 1999, the Company had outstanding $661
     million of unsecured convertible subordinated debentures (the Debentures)
     which were convertible by their holders into approximately 45.2 million
     shares of common stock. The weighted-average common shares represented by
     the Debentures upon conversion were included in the computation of diluted
     earnings per share for the three and nine month periods ended June 26,
     1999, using the if-converted method. On April 14, 1999, the Company called
     for redemption the Debentures. As a result, debenture holders converted
     virtually all of the outstanding debentures to 45.2 million shares of the
     Company's common stock during the third quarter of 1999. For additional
     disclosures regarding the Debentures, see the 1999 Form 10-K.

     NOTE 4 - NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

     The Company holds significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM),
     Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai)
     and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These investments are reflected in
     the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments
     and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be
     carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
     reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
     income. The combined fair value of these investments was $1.236 billion and
     $339 million as of July 1, 2000, and September 25, 1999, respectively.
     The combined fair value of these investments has declined to
     approximately $1.062 billion as of July 28, 2000. The Company believes it
     is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair
     value of these investments in the future.

     ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design
     and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology.
     As of September 25, 1999, the Company held approximately 80 million shares
     of ARM stock with a fair value of $226 million. Share data for ARM
     presented in this Form 10-Q has been adjusted to reflect ARM's four-for-one
     stock split in April of 1999 and its five-for-one stock split in April of
     2000. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold approximately 5
     million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $51 million
     and a gain before taxes of $50 million. During the nine months ended July
     1, 2000, the Company has sold approximately 38 million shares of ARM stock
     for net proceeds of approximately $288 million and gains before taxes of
     approximately $284 million. During the third quarter of 1999, the Company
     sold approximately 50 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $105
     million and a gain before taxes of $101 million. During the nine months
     ended June 26, 1999, the Company sold approximately 148 million shares of
     ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $201 million and a gain before
     taxes of approximately $188. The fair value of the Company's investment in
     ARM is approximately $450 million as of July 1, 2000.

     In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an
     Internet service provider (ISP). The investment is in EarthLink's Series C
     Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible by the Company after
     January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common
     stock. Concurrent with this investment, Earthlink and the Company entered
     into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in
     the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will
     profit from each new Mac customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP
     service, and EarthLink will become the default ISP in Apple's Internet
     Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United
     States. The fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink is
     approximately $110 million as of July 1, 2000.

     During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in
     Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel
     display production capacity. The investment, in the form of three year
     unsecured bonds, is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of
     Samsung common stock beginning in July 2000. The bonds carry an annual
     coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at
     their maturity. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung is
     approximately $188 million as of July 1, 2000.

     In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global
     Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of
     convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of
     Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of
     Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. The Company is restricted
     from selling more than 25% of its shares within one year after the date of
     the closing of the public offering of Akamai's stock. Beginning in the
     first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as
     available-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai is
     approximately $488 million as of July 1, 2000.

     NOTE 5 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

     On June 21, 2000, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split in the
     form of a stock dividend. Accordingly, share and per share information
     presented in this Form 10-Q has been adjusted to reflect this stock split.
     On April 20, 2000, the Company's shareholders approved an increase in the
     number of the Company's authorized shares from 320,000,000 to 900,000,000.

     During the second quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors granted
     the Company's Chief Executive Officer options under the Company's 1998
     Executive Officer Stock Plan to purchase 20 million shares of common stock
     at an exercise price of $43.59 per share, the then fair value of the
     underlying common stock (share and per share figures for this option grant
     are adjusted for the June 2000 two-for-one stock split). A summary of the
     Company's stock option activity and related information for the nine-month

     In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the
     Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This
     repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific
     number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time.
     During the third quarter of 2000, approximately 1 million shares of common
     stock were repurchased at a cost of approximately $50 million. Since
     inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company has repurchased a total
     of 4.5 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $166 million.

     NOTE 6 - COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

     Comprehensive income is comprised of two components, net income and other
     comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
     expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting
     principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are
     excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is
     comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those
     subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and
     from unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on marketable securities
     categorized as available-for-sale. See Note 4 for additional information
     regarding available-for-sale securities. The components of comprehensive
     income, net of tax, are as follows (in millions):

     NOTE 7 - SPECIAL CHARGES

     RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

     During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring
     actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge.
     This charge was comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various
     operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95
     employees associated with consolidation of various domestic and
     international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for
     severance, $2.5 million had been spent by July 1, 2000, and the remainder
     is expected to be spent over the following two quarters. Of the $3 million
     accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized
     by April 1, 2000.

     During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring
     actions resulting in a charge to operations of $21 million comprised of $11
     million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of
     the Company's outsourced data center, substantially all of which had been
     spent by the end of the third quarter of 2000, and $10 million for contract
     cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements
     previously discontinued, substantially all of which had been utilized by
     the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2000.

     EXECUTIVE BONUS

     In December 1999, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special
     executive bonus for past services for the Company's Chief Executive Officer
     in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the company of
     approximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible.
     Approximately half of the total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The
     other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the
     purchase.

     NOTE 8 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

     The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
     Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, and
     Japan. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The
     European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and
     Africa. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes
     Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary,
     Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable operating segment provides similar products
     and services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the
     same as those described in the 1999 Form 10-K.


                                       9

<PAGE>

     The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on
     net sales and operating income. Operating income for each segment includes
     revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the
     segment. Net sales are based on the location of the customers. Operating
     income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
     expenses that are managed outside the reportable segment. Costs excluded
     from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, income
     taxes, and nonrecurring charges for purchased in-process research and
     development, restructuring, and acquisition related costs. Corporate
     expenses include research and development, manufacturing expenses not
     included in segment cost of sales, corporate marketing expenses, and other
     separately managed general and administrative expenses. The Company does
     not include intercompany transfers between segments for management
     reporting purposes. Summary information by segment follows (in millions):

     NOTE 9 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1,
     "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
     Internal Use," which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of
     computer software intended for internal use. The adoption of SOP 98-1 in
     fiscal 2000 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
     results of operations or financial position during the quarter and nine
     months ended July 1, 2000.

     In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
     "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued.
     SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 138, establishes accounting and
     reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and
     exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all
     derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
     position and measure those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are
     not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative
     is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value
     will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
     assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in
     other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
     In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
     Hedging Activities- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
     133," was issued. The statement defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133
     until the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Company continues to
     review the effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 133, the Company does
     not currently believe its adoption will have a material impact on its
     financial position or overall trends in results of operations and does not
     believe adoption will result in significant changes to its financial risk
     management practices. However, the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 133 on
     the Company's results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of
     the Company's derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of
     adoption and may result in more pronounced quarterly fluctuations in other
     income and expense.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
     Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
     Statements." The objective of this SAB is to provide further guidance on
     revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature
     addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. The Company is
     required to adopt the guidance in the SAB no later than the fourth quarter
     of its fiscal year 2001. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have
     a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
     operations. The SEC has recently indicated it intends to issue further
     guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by SAB No.
     101. Until such time as this additional guidance is issued, the Company is
     unable to assess the impact, if any, it may have on its financial position
     or results of operations.

     NOTE 10 - CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are
     discussed in detail in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to
     certain other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the
     ordinary course of business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The
     results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however,
     in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential
     liability related to any legal proceedings and claims that would have a
     material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
     operations.

     The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax
     deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made
     certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed
     deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most
     of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS
     proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although
     most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still
     remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management
     believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may
     result from tax examinations.

Net sales increased $267 million or 17% to $1.825 billion in the third quarter
of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999. On a year-over-year basis,
quarterly net sales increased in all of the Company's geographic operating
segments. The primary source of this growth was an overall 12% increase in
Macintosh unit sales, which reflects strong unit growth in the Americas and
Europe somewhat offset by a decline in unit sales in Japan. Further contributing
to year-over-year quarterly growth in net sales was a 4% increase in the average
revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net sales generated by
hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales.

For the first nine months of 2000, net sales increased $1.315 billion or 27%
over the same period in 1999. A 28% increase in year-to-date Macintosh unit
sales, reflective of strong growth in all of the Company's geographic operating
segments, was the principal cause of the increase in net sales during the first
nine months of 2000.

Net sales declined sequentially during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the
second quarter of 2000 by $120 million or 6%. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales
decreased 3% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the second quarter.
The sequential decline in both net sales and unit sales during the third quarter
was primarily the result of a sequential quarterly decline in iMac unit sales of
6% and a sequential decline in the average revenue per Macintosh system. The
Company believes that iMac unit sales during the third quarter were negatively
impacted by anticipation of product updates expected at the beginning of the
fourth quarter. The average revenue per Macintosh system for the third quarter
of 2000 declined 4% from the second quarter to $1,749. This decline was due to a
shift during the quarter towards lower-priced versions of its consumer products
purchased by the Company's education customers and by price protection
recognized during the third quarter resulting from planned product transitions
in the fourth quarter.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's
reportable geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, and Japan. The
Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment
includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan
segment includes only Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar
hardware and software products and similar services. Further information
regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in this Form 10-Q in the
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8, "Segment
Information and Geographic Data," and in the 1999 Form 10-K.

AMERICAS

Net sales in the Americas segment during the third quarter of 2000 increased
$140 million or 16% compared to the same period in 1999. Macintosh quarterly
unit sales in the Americas increased 10% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting
strong growth in unit sales of professional products, particularly PowerBooks,
and the impact on unit sales of iBook which was first shipped at the beginning
of fiscal 2000. These increases in unit sales were partially offset by an 8%
decline in unit sales of iMac ahead of the anticipated product updates at the
beginning of the fourth quarter. During the third quarter of 2000, the Americas
segment represented approximately 56% of the Company's total net sales compared
to 57% during the same quarter in 1999.

For the first nine months of 2000, net sales in the Americas segment increased
$571 million or 22% from the same period in 1999, while Macintosh unit sales
increased 24%. The results experienced by the Americas segment during the first
nine months of 2000 versus the same period in 1999 reflect the Company's overall
results characterized by strong year-to-date growth in sales of iMac and
PowerBook products, sales of iBook which was first shipped at the beginning of
fiscal 2000, and stable unit sales of the Company's Power Macintosh products.

EUROPE

Net sales in the Europe segment increased $56 million or 19% during the third
quarter of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999, while the segment's
Macintosh unit sales increased 33%. Growth in year-over-year unit sales was
experienced in the Europe segment in all four of the Company's principal product
families. Sequentially, net sales in the Europe segment declined $116 million or
25% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the second quarter, while
Macintosh unit sales declined 19%. The sequential decline in the Europe's
segment net sales and unit sales is attributable primarily to two factors.
First, like the Americas segment, Europe's results in the third quarter of 2000
as compared to the second quarter reflect a sequential decline in iMac unit
sales in anticipation of upcoming product updates. Second, the Company has
historically experienced a modest seasonal decline in net sales in Europe during
its third fiscal quarter.

JAPAN

Net sales in Japan rose 13% or $34 million during the third quarter of 2000 as
compared to the same quarter in 1999. However, the segment's quarterly Macintosh
unit sales decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis. The Japan segment's unit
sales during the third quarter of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999
reflect declines in unit sales of the Company's desktop products, particularly
iMac, prior to the anticipated product introductions in the fourth quarter,
partially offset by increases in sales of portable products. This shift in mix
towards higher-priced portable products led to the year-over-year increase in
net sales.

GROSS MARGIN

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2000 was 29.8% compared to 27.4% for the
same quarter in 1999 and 28.2% for the second quarter of 2000. Gross margin
during the third quarter of 2000 was favorably impacted by two principal
factors. First, component costs incurred to manufacture the Company's products
were lower during the third quarter of 2000 compared to both the previous
quarter and to the same quarter in 1999. Second, during the third quarter of
2000 the Company's mix of product sales shifted somewhat away from its consumer
products towards its higher margin professional desktop and portable products.

There can be no assurance targeted gross margin levels will be achieved or
current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general,
gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant
downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide
global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles,
potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside
manufacturing services, fluctuations in freight costs incurred to deliver the
Company's products to market, and potential changes to the Company's product
mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling
prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand
for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take
into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time;
however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in
the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding special charges,
increased $35 million or 14% during the third quarter of 2000 as compared to the
same period in 1999 and declined $9 million or 3% from the second quarter of
2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of
2000 increased $123 million or 16% as compared to the same period in 1999.
However, as a result of growing net sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses fell to 14% of net sales during the first nine months of 2000 compared
to 16% during the same period in 1999. The absolute year-over-year increases in
selling, general and administrative expenses for both the third quarter and the
first nine months of 2000 are primarily the result of higher variable selling
and marketing expenses resulting from the year-over-year increase in net sales
and due to higher discretionary spending on marketing and advertising in 2000 as
compared to 1999.

Expenditures for research and development increased 21% between the third
quarter of fiscal 2000 and the same quarter in 1999 and increased 20% during the
first nine months of 2000 compared to the same period in 1999. These increases
resulted primarily from increased spending in 2000 to support product
development activities and increased research and development headcount.

SPECIAL CHARGES

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions
resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was
comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5
million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with
consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing
functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent
by July 1, 2000, and the remainder is expected to be spent over the following
two quarters. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets,
substantially all was utilized by April 1, 2000.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past
services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the company of
approximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible.
Approximately half of the total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The other
half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the purchase.

TOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

Interest and other income and expense (net) increased $28 million or 117% to $52
million during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999
and increased $88 million or 166% for the first nine months of 2000 over the
same period in 1999. These increases are attributable primarily to two factors.
First, interest income increased $18 million or 48% between the third quarter of
2000 and the third quarter of 1999 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investment balances and due to an increase in the overall yield
earned on the Company's investment portfolio resulting from higher market
interest rates and a modest lengthening of the portfolio's average maturity.
Second, as the result of conversion to common stock of the Company's convertible
subordinated debentures during the third quarter of 1999, interest expense
declined $6 million or 55% during the third quarter of 2000 compared to the same
quarter in 1999 and decreased $27 million or 64% for the comparable nine month
periods.

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold approximately 5 million
shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $51 million and a gain
before taxes of $50 million. During the nine months ended July 1, 2000, the
Company has sold approximately 38 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds
of approximately $288 million and gains before taxes of approximately $284
million. During the third quarter of 1999, the Company sold approximately 50
million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $105 million and a gain before
taxes of $101 million. During the nine months ended June 26, 1999, the Company
sold approximately 148 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of
approximately $201 million and a gain before taxes of approximately $188.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

As of July 1, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible
temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $535 million before being
offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the
Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based
on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of July 1, 2000,
a valuation allowance of $40 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset
for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance
primarily relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to
tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company will continue to
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the
need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

The Company's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2000 was
approximately 33% and includes the effect of the special executive bonus
accrued during that quarter. The effective tax rate during the first quarter
of 2000 without this charge was approximately 25%. The Company's effective
tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2000, was approximately 26%. The
effective tax rate without the special executive bonus for the nine months
ended July 1, 2000, is also 26%. This effective rate is less than the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to the reversal of a
portion of the previously established valuation allowance for tax loss and
credit carryforwards and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no
U.S. taxes were provided.

   (b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for
       each period.
   (c) Based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales
       adjusted for the change in inventory.

As of July 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $3.8 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $600 million over the
same balances at the end of fiscal 1999. For the nine months ended July 1, 2000,
the Company's primary source of cash was $668 million in cash flows from
operating activities. Cash generated by operations was primarily from net income
of $616 million and a combined increase in accounts payable and other current
liabilities of $392 million partially offset by an increase in accounts
receivable of $286 million. In addition to operating cash flow, other
significant cash flow items during the nine months ended July 1, 2000 included
net purchases of short-term investments of $582 million, $232 million utilized
for the purchase of long-term investments, $76 million for the purchase of
property, plant and equipment, and cash proceeds from the sale of ARM stock of
$288 million.

In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company
to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does
not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire
shares over any specified period of time. During the third quarter of 2000,
approximately 1 million shares of common stock were repurchased at a cost of
approximately $50 million. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the
Company has repurchased a total of 4.5 million shares of its common stock at a
total cost of $166 million.

On November 18, 1999, the Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit
agreement with Bank of America. Loans under the agreement pay interest at LIBOR
plus 1%, and the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% of the
unused portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this
credit facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the
Company with an additional source of short-term liquidity.

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its cash
requirements over the next twelve months, including any cash that may be
utilized by its stock repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current
non-investment grade debt ratings, if the Company should need to obtain
short-term borrowings, there can no assurance such borrowings could be obtained
at favorable rates. The inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates
could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

The Company holds significant investments in ARM, Samsung, Akamai and EarthLink.
These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as
non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as
available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized
gains and

                                       17

<PAGE>

losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The combined fair value of these investments was $1.236
billion and $339 million as of July 1, 2000, and September 25, 1999,
respectively. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be
significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future.
Additional information regarding these investment may be found in this Form 10-Q
in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 4,
"Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments."

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition to
the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are many factors
that will affect the Company's future results and business, which may cause the
actual results to differ from those currently expected. The Company's future
operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the Company's
ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically
innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand patterns. Inherent
in this process are a number of factors that the Company must successfully
manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and a favorable
financial condition.

Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future
operating results and financial condition include, among other things, continued
competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the
Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company;
risks associated with international operations, including economic and labor
conditions, regional economic problems, political instability, tax laws, and
currency fluctuations; increasing dependence on third-parties for manufacturing
and other outsourced functions such as logistics; the availability of key
components on terms acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of
certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently
obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC
microprocessors developed by and obtained from IBM and Motorola and the final
assembly of certain of the Company's products; the Company's ability to supply
products in certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of
latent defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to
the marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue
to make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party
software for particular applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate
and retain key employees; the effect of previously undetected Y2K compliance
issues; managing the continuing impact of the European Union's transition to the
Euro as its common legal currency; continuing fluctuations in the fair value of
the Company's non-current debt and equity investments, and the Company's ability
to retain the operational and cost benefits derived from its recently completed
restructuring programs.

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" in
the Company's 1999 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW REGARDING MARKET RISK CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL
RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN
THIS FORM 10-Q REGARDING MARKET RISK. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE 1999 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to the Company's investments in debt securities and long-term debt
obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places
its investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is
to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds
by limiting market and credit risk. Excluding those investments classified as
non-current debt and equity investments, all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be
cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and twelve months
are considered to be short-term investments. As of July 1, 2000,
substantially all of the Company's investments in debt securities have
maturities less than 12 months.

During the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative
transactions, including interest rate swaps and floors, with financial
institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest
income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate
interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the
Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The
Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce
the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold
or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk
management.

Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar
and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a
stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may
negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.
dollars.

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with
financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks
associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed
transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's
foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its
existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company
may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial
either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related
currency's historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange
forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The
premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in
other current assets and marked to market through earnings.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and
interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities
of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign
exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and
floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its
underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively,
from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the
effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the
anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no
assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign
exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for
recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any
given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the
underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's
operating results and financial position.

For a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign currency
related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's
1999 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the Company's exposure
to interest rate and foreign currency risks since the date of the 1999 Form
10-K.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are
discussed in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other
legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of
management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal
proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

The annual meeting of shareholders was held on April 20, 2000. All matters voted
on were approved. The results are as follows:

Exhibit 3.3
                                      BY-LAWS

                                         OF

                                APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

                             (a California corporation)


                        (as amended through April 20, 2000)


                                     Article I

                                      OFFICES

     SECTION 1.1:   PRINCIPAL OFFICE.  The principal executive office for the
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop,
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board of Directors is hereby granted full
power and authority to change the location of the principal executive office
from one location to another.

     SECTION 1.2:   OTHER OFFICES.  One or more branch or other subordinate
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at such
place or places within or without the State of California as it deems
appropriate.


                                     Article II

                                     DIRECTORS

     SECTION 2.1:   EXERCISE OF CORPORATE POWERS.  Except as otherwise provided
by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this corporation or by the
laws of the State of California now or hereafter in force, the business and
affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be
exercised by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 2.2:   NUMBER.  The number of directors of the corporation shall be
not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of directors
shall be six (6) until changed within the limits specified above, by a by-law
amending this section, duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the
shareholders. The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a definite
number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly adopted
amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by an amendment to this by-law
duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment
reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number less
than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a
meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action
by written consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum number of
authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated minimum
number of directors minus one.

     SECTION 2.3:   NEED NOT BE SHAREHOLDERS.  The directors of this corporation
need not be shareholders of this corporation.

     SECTION 2.4:   COMPENSATION.  Directors and members of committees may
receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed or
determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein contained
shall be construed to preclude any director from serving this corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

     SECTION 2.5:   ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE. Through and until immediately
prior to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, the
directors shall be divided into two classes,  designated Class I and Class II,
each consisting of one-half of the directors or  as close an approximation as
possible, and each director shall serve for a term  running until the second
annual meeting of shareholders succeeding his or her  election and until his or
her successor shall have been duly elected and  qualified; provided, however,
that the terms of all directors shall expire at  the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000. Commencing at the annual meeting of
shareholders to be held in fiscal year 2000, each director shall be elected to
serve until the annual meeting of shareholders held in the following fiscal year
or until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

     SECTION 2.6:   VACANCIES.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of Directors
shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any director, or if
the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the shareholders fail, at
any annual meeting of shareholders at which any director is elected, to elect
the full authorized number of directors to be voted for at that meeting.  The
Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a director if he or she is
declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony or if,
within 60 days after notice of his or her election, he or she does not accept
the office.  Any vacancy, except for a vacancy created by removal of a director
as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, may be filled by a


                                      -1-
<PAGE>

person selected by a majority of the remaining directors then in office,
whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of removal of
directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders.  The shareholders
may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the
directors.  Any such election by written consent requires the consent of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling of
any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to
vote for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be held
to elect the entire Board of Directors.  The term of office of any director
shall terminate upon such election of a successor.  Any director may resign
effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any,
the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or the Board of
Directors of this corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for
the effectiveness of such resignation.  Ifthe resignation is effective at a
future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation
becomes effective.  A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall
not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of
office.

     SECTION 2.7:   REMOVAL. The entire Board of Directors or any individual
director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the
entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the
votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would
be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without regard to
whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same
total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent,
all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number of directors
elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the
number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected.
If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same
meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares
is entitled to elect one or more directors under authority granted by the
Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the provisions of this Section
2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the vote of the
outstanding shares as a whole.

     SECTION 2.8:   POWERS AND DUTIES.  Without limiting the generality or
extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of Directors
pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby provided that the Board
of Directors shall have full power with respect to the following matters:

          (a)  To purchase, lease, and acquire any and all kinds of property,

determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any
meeting, or entitled to receive any payment of any dividend or other
distribution, or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any other lawful action; and in such case only shareholders of record
on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting
or to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise
the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on
the books of this corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid.  The
Board of Directors may close the books of this corporation against transfers of
shares during the whole or any part of such period.

of every certificate surrendered for cancellation.

          (d)  To keep a supply of certificates for shares of this corporation,

performed by such transfer agent or transfer agents.

          (e)  To transfer upon the share books of this corporation any and all

been signed or authenticated in the manner provided in Section 12.3 hereof.

          (g)  Generally to do and perform all such duties as pertain to such
office and as may be required by the Board of Directors.

of the corporation) or an "executive officer" of the corporation for the
purposes of Section 14 of the Act or (b) a "corporate officer" for the purposes
of Section 312 of the California Corporation Code (the "Code"), except in any

                              MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

     SECTION 10.1:  PLACE OF MEETINGS.  Meetings (whether regular, special or
adjourned) of the shareholders of this corporation shall be held at the
principal executive office for the transaction of business of this corporation,
or at any place within or without the State which may be designated by written
consent of all the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, or which may be
designated by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Any meeting shall be valid
wherever held if held by the written consent of all the shareholders entitled to
vote thereat, given either before or after the meeting and filed with the
Secretary of this corporation.

     SECTION 10.2:  ANNUAL MEETINGS.  The annual meeting of the shareholders
shall be held at the hour of 10:00 a.m. on the last Wednesday in January in each
year , if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next
succeeding business day not a legal holiday or at such other time in a
particular year as may be designated by written consent of all the shareholders
entitled to vote thereat or which may be designated by resolution of the Board
of Directors.  Such annual meetings shall be held at the place provided pursuant
to Section 10.1 hereof.  Said annual meetings shall be held for the purpose of
the election of directors, for the making of reports of the affairs of this
corporation and for the transaction of such other business as may come before
the meeting.

     SECTION 10.3:  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the shareholders for
any purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time by the President or
by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members thereof, or by one or more
holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent (10%) of the votes
on the record date established pursuant to Section 10.8.  Upon request in
writing sent by registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Vice
President or Secretary, or delivered to any such officer in person, by any
person or persons entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders (such
request, if sent by a shareholder or shareholders, to include the information
required by Section 10.13), it shall be the duty of such officer, subject to the
immediately succeeding sentence, to cause notice to be given to the shareholders
entitled to vote that a meeting will be requested by the person or persons
calling the meeting, the date of which meeting, which shall be set by such
officer, to be not less than 35 days nor more than 60 days after such request
or, if applicable, determination of the validity of such request pursuant to the
immediately succeeding sentence.  Within seven days after receiving such a
written request from a shareholder or shareholders of the corporation, the Board
of Directors shall determine whether shareholders owning not less than ten
percent (10%) of the shares as of the record date established pursuant to
Section 10.8 for such request support the call of a special meeting and notify
the requesting party or parties of its finding.

     SECTION 10.4:  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Notice of any meeting of shareholders
shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date
of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat by the Secretary or
an Assistant Secretary, or other person charged with that duty, or if there be
no such officer or person, or in case of his or her neglect or refusal, by any
director or shareholder.  The notice shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the
business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (ii) in
the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at
the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to present for action by the
shareholders, but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such
action except that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal
relating to approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of
this corporation, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of
this corporation or winding up of this corporation.  The notice of any meeting
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for election.
Written notice shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder, either (i)
personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, charges
prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's address appearing
on the books of this corporation or given by such shareholder to this
corporation for the purpose of notice.  If a shareholder gives no address or no
such address appears on the books of this corporation, notice shall be deemed to
have been given if sent by mail or other means of written communication
addressed to the place where the principal executive office of this corporation
is located, or if published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the county in which such office is located.  The noice shall be deemed to
have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written communication
and addressed as hereinbefore provided.  An affidavit of delivery or mailing of
any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.4, executed by
the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima facie
evidence of the giving of the notice.  If any notice addressed to the
shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of the
corporation is returned to this corporation by the United States Postal Service
marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver
the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall be
deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be
available for the shareholder upon written demand of the shareholder at the
principal executive office of this corporation for a period of one year from the
date of the giving of the notice to all other shareholders.

     SECTION 10.5:  CONSENT TO SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS.  The transactions of any
meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as
valid as though had at a


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present
either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting,
each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy,
signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting
or an approval of the minutes thereof.  All such waivers, consents or
approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting.  Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a
meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of
matters required by law to be included in the notice but not so included, if
such objection is expressly made at the meeting.  Neither the business to be
transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of
shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to
approval of contracts between this corporation and any of its directors,
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this
corporation or winding up the affairs of this corporation.

     SECTION 10.6:  QUORUM.  The presence in person or by proxy of the holders
of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Shares shall not be
counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the
meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the
meeting.  The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a
quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a
quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a
majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

     SECTION 10.7:  ADJOURNED MEETINGS.  Any shareholders' meeting, whether or
not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a
majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or
represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in Section 10.6 hereof, in
the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such meeting.
When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days or if after adjournment a new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at a
meeting.  Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of
the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted
thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is
taken.  At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

     SECTION 10.8:  VOTING RIGHTS.  Only persons in whose names shares entitled
to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close of business
on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be fixed for the
determination of shareholders of record pursuant to Section 2.8(k) hereof, then
on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.  In the absence of
any contrary provision in the Articles of Incorporation or in any applicable
statute relating to the election of directors or to other particular matters,
each such person shall be entitled to one vote for each share.

     In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors may
fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and
which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  Any
shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent or request a special meeting of the
shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice to the Secretary,
request the Board of Directors to fix a record date.  The Board of Directors
shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28) days after the date
on which such request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.

     SECTION 10.9:  ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENTS.  Any action which may be taken
at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting
and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than
the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving such written consent or
consents from shareholders of the corporation, the Board of Directors shall
determine whether holders of outstanding shares as of the record date
established pursuant to Section 10.8 having not less than the minimum number of
votes which would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted have properly
consented thereto in writing and notify the requesting party of its finding.
Unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in
writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) contracts between this
corporation and any of its directors, (ii) indemnification of any person, (iii)
reorganization of this corporation or (iv) distributions to shareholders upon
winding up of this corporation in certain circumstances without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given at least 10 days before the
consummation of the action authorized by such approval, and prompt notice shall
be given of the taking of any other corporate action approved by shareholders
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent, to those shareholders
entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder
shall conform to the requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.
When written consents are given with


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from the persons
in whose names such shares stand on the books of this corporation at the time
such respective consens are given, or any shareholder's proxy holder, or a
transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder or
their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received
by this corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of
shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the
Secretary of this corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  Such revocation
is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected by
written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to
vote for the election of directors.

     SECTION 10.10: ELECTIONS OF DIRECTORS. In any election of directors, the
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares
entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by
such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with
respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.  Elections
of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made by a shareholder at
the meeting and before the voting begins.

     SECTION 10.11: PROXIES.  Every person entitled to vote or execute consents
shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents
authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person's duly
authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this corporation.  No proxy
shall be valid (1) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically
made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 10.11 and applicable
law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof, unless
the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such
proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may be effected by a writing
delivered to the Secretary of this corporation stating that the proxy is revoked
or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting
in person by, the person executing the proxy.  A proxy is not revoked by the
death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written
notice of such death or incapacity is received by this corporation.  A proxy
which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified
therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the
following: (1) a pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase
or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of
such person's shares in this corporation to the maker of the proxy, (3) a
creditor or creditors of this corporation or the shareholder who extended or
continued credit to this corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the
proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension
or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the
credit, (4) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of
this corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if
the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of
employment, the name of the employee and the period of employmet contracted for,
(5) a person designated by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or
a voting trust agreement.  In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is
given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or
equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the
obligation secured by it.  Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability
specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option
or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares
of this corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is
paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust
agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a
provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of
the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its
irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares.  Every form
of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity to specify approval
or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate
space marked "abstain", whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain
from voting his or her shares on the proposal.  A proxy marked "abstain" by the
shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for
or against such proposal.  In any election of directors, any form of proxy in
which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which
is marked by a shareholder "withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating
that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not
be voted either for or against the election of a director.

     SECTION 10.12: INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  Before any meeting of shareholders,
the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than nominees for office to
act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its adjournment.  If no
inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of the meeting may, and on
the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint
inspectors of election at the meeting.  The number of inspectors shall be either
one (1) or three (3).  If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request
of one or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or
their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three
(3) inspectors are to be appointed.  If any person appointed as inspector fails
to appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairman of the meeting may, and upon
the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person
to fill that vacancy.

     These inspectors shall:

          (a)  Determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power
of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and
the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

          (b)  Receive votes, ballots, or consents;


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

          (c)  Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way
arising in connection with the right to vote;

          (d)  Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

          (e)  Determine when the polls shall close;

          (f)  Determine the result; and

          (g)  Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or
vote with fairness to all shareholders.

     SECTION 10.13:  ADVANCE NOTICE OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR
NOMINATIONS.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought before
a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given timely
notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such
nomination or nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in the event
less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting
is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be
so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure was made.  To be  in proper written form a shareholder's notice to
the Secretary shall set forth (i) the name and address of the shareholder who
intends to make the nominations or propose the business and, as the case may be,
of the person or persons to be nominated or of the business to be proposed, (ii)
a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the
Corporation that intends to vote such stock at such meeting and, if applicable,
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice, (iii) if applicable, a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee or any
other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the
nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (iv) such other
information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to be proposed by
such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed
pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated,
or intended to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be
proposed, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable,
the consent of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The
chairman of a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the nomination
of any person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the
foregoing procedure.

                                     Article XI

317(a) of the Code), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding (as
defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), arising by reason of the fact that

Article XVI, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a
director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or
agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or

that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in
this Article XVI.

     SECTION 16.4:  INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE.  The indemnification provided by
this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which

official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are

such liability under the provisions of this Article XVI.

under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or advance is mandated
by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction,
in any circumstance where it appears:

          (a)  That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles of
Incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders or an agreement in
effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in
the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid,
which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

          (b)  That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly
imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

modify or amend each Option or SAR or accelerate the exercise date of any
Option or SAR; (ix) to reduce the exercise price of any Option or SAR to the
then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock
covered by such Option or SAR shall have declined since the date the Option
or SAR was granted; (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the
Company any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Option or SAR
previously granted by the Administrator; and (xi) to make all other
determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the
Plan.

              (c)    EFFECT OF DECISIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATOR.  All decisions,
determinations and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and
binding on all Optionees and any other holders of any Options.

       5.     ELIGIBILITY.  The Administrator may grant Options and SARs only to
individuals who are Employees or who are consultants to the Company, or a
Subsidiary or Affiliated Company.  In no event may an Option or SAR be granted
to any individual who, at the time of grant, is an Officer or Director.  An
Employee who has been granted an Option or SAR may, if he or she is otherwise
eligible, be granted an additional Option or Options, SAR or SARs.  Each Option
shall be evidenced by a written Option agreement, which shall be in such form
and contain such provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem
appropriate.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator may, at any
time, or from time to time, authorize the Company, with the consent of the
respective recipients, to issue new Options or Options in exchange for the
surrender and cancellation of any or all outstanding Options, other options,
SARs or other stock appreciation rights.

       Neither the Plan nor any Option or SAR agreement shall confer upon any
Optionee any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company (or
any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliated Company), nor shall it interfere in any way
with the Optionee's right or the right of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary
or Affiliated Company) to terminate the Optionee's employment at any time or for
any reason.

       If an Option or SAR is granted to an individual who is a consultant to
the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, all references in the Plan to
"Employee" shall be deemed to include the term "consultant" and all references
in the Plan to "employment," "Continuous Status as an Employee" and
"termination of employment" shall be deemed to refer to the individual's
consultancy or status as a consultant.

       6.     TERM OF PLAN.  The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption
by the Board.  It shall continue in effect for a term of ten years unless sooner
terminated under Section 14 of the Plan.

       7.     TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be ten (10) years
from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Option agreement.

       8.     EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

              (a)    EXERCISE PRICE.  The per Share exercise price for the
Shares issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is determined by
the Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 100% of the Fair Market


<PAGE>

Value of Common Stock, determined as of the date of grant of the Option.  In
the event that the Administrator shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise
price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of
that reduction.

              (b)    METHOD OF PAYMENT.  The consideration to be paid for the
Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment,
shall be determined by the Administrator and may consist of (i) cash, (ii)
check, (iii) promissory note, (iv) other Shares which have a Fair Market Value
on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as
to which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery of a properly executed
exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly
deliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds required to pay the
exercise price, or (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment
and/or any other consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted under
applicable corporate law.

       9.     STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

              (a)    GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion
of the Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of
an Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time
thereafter during the term of the Option.  The following provisions apply to
SARs that are granted in connection with Options:

       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by
       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.
       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal
       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the
       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related
       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the
       surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the
       foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be
       paid upon exercise of an SAR; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such limit shall
       not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.

       (ii)   When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent
       surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.

       (iii)  An SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the
       related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on
       which the related Option expires.

       (iv)   An SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value
       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.

              (b)    INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the
Administrator, SARs may be granted without related Options.  The following
provisions apply to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to
       receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair
       Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,
       as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the
       Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date
       on which the SAR was granted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrator
       may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of an SAR.

       (ii)   SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as
       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement.


<PAGE>

              (c)    FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the
exercise of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination
of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
determine.  Shares issued upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their
Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

       10.    METHOD OF EXERCISE.

              (a)    PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any
Option or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under
such conditions as determined by the Administrator and as shall be permissible
under the terms of the Plan.

              An Option or SAR shall be deemed to be exercised when written
notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the
terms of the Option or SAR by the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR
and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised
has been received by the Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the
Administrator and permitted by the Option agreement, consist of any
consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(b) of the Plan.
Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the
Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock,
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.  No adjustment will be made for a
dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock
certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option
or SAR may not be exercised with respect to a fraction of a Share.

              (b)    TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of
an Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason of
the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety days after the
date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that
it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date the
Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time
from the date of grant.

              (c)    DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  In the event of the death of an
Optionee:

       (i)    Who is at the time of death an Employee and who shall have been in
       Continuous Status as an Employee since the date of grant of the Option,
       the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months (or
       such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined
       by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's
       estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by
       bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise
       that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated
       his or her employment six (6) months (or such other period of time not
       exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator) after
       the date of death; or

       (ii)   Within ninety days after the termination of Continuous Status as
       an Employee, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within six
       (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months
       as determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the
       Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the
       Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to
       exercise that had accrued at the date of termination.

              Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not
be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.


<PAGE>

              (d)    STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX
OBLIGATIONS. When an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the
exercise of an Option or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay
the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the
Optionee may satisfy the withholding tax obligation by electing to have the
Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR, if any, that number of
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be
withheld.  The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be
determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be
determined (the "TAX DATE").

              All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this
purpose shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and
shall be subject to the following restrictions:

              (i)    the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax
Date; and

              (ii)   all elections shall be subject to the consent or
disapproval of the Administrator.

       11.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS.  Options and SARs may not be sold,
pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other
than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Administrator may grant Nonstatutory Stock Options that are
freely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an Optionee or holder
of an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An Option or an SAR may be exercised,
during the lifetime of the Optionee or SAR holder, only by the Optionee or SAR
holder or by a transferee permitted by this Section 11.

       12.    ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION OR MERGER.

              (a)    CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action
by the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each
outstanding Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been authorized
for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have yet been
granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration
of an Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each such
outstanding Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or
decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common
Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number of issued
Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not
be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."  Such
adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that
respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided
herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or
securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no
adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price
of Shares subject to an Option or SAR.

              (b)    DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options and SARs will
terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless


<PAGE>

otherwise provided by the Administrator.  The Administrator may, in the
exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or
SAR shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Administrator and give each
Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or any part
of the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR
would not otherwise be exercisable.

              (c)    SALE OF ASSETS OR MERGER. Subject to the provisions of
Section 12(d), in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another
corporation, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent
option or stock appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor
corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the
Administrator determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of
such assumption or substitution, that the Optionee shall have the right to
exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as
to which the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.  If the
Administrator makes an Option or SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or
substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall
notify the Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a
period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR
will terminate upon the expiration of such period.  For purposes of this
paragraph, an Option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed if,
following the sale of assets or merger, the Option confers the right to
purchase, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately
prior to the sale of assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or
other securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by
holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
transaction (and if such holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the sale of
assets or merger was not solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or its
parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation and
the participant, provide for the per share consideration to be received upon
exercise of te Option to be solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or
its parent equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by
holders of Common Stock in the sale of assets or merger.

              (d)    CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a "Change in Control"
of the Company, as defined in Section 12(e), unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following
acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

       (i)    Any Options and SARs outstanding as of the date such Change in
       Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable and
       vested on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested; and

       (ii)   The value of all outstanding Options and SARs shall, unless
       otherwise determined by the Administrator at or after grant, be
       cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options and SARs shall be cashed
       out shall be equal to the excess of (x) the Change in Control Price (as
       defined below) over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by
       the Option or SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee
       or, in the event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate
       of the Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the
       Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance.

              (e)    "DEFINITION OF "CHANGE IN CONTROL".  For purposes of this
Section 12, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

       ( i )  When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a
       Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting
       as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities
       of the Company representing


<PAGE>

       fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's
       then outstanding securities; or

       (ii)   The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval,
       and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
       Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

              (f)    CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For purposes of this Section 12,
"Change in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the
highest Fair Market Value at any time within the sixty-day period immediately
preceding the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the
Administrator (the "SIXTY-DAY PERIOD"), or (ii) the highest price paid or
offered, as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or
bona fide offer related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time
within the Sixty-Day Period.

       13.    TIME OF GRANTING OPTIONS AND SARS.  The date of grant of an Option
or SAR shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination granting such Option or SAR.  Notice of the determination shall be
given to each Employee to whom an Option or SAR is so granted within a
reasonable time after the date of such grant.

       14.    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

              (a)    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time
amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as it may deem advisable.

              (b)    EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.  Any such amendment,
alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair the rights of
any Optionee or SAR holder under any grant theretofore made without his or her
consent.  Such Options and SARs shall remain in full force and effect as if this
Plan had not been amended or terminated.

       15.    CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.  Shares shall not be issued
with respect to an Option or SAR unless the exercise of such Option or SAR and
the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all
relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon
which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to
the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

              As a condition to the exercise of an Option or SAR or the issuance
of Shares upon exercise of an Option or SAR, the Company may require the person
exercising such Option or SAR to represent and warrant at the time of any such
exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any
present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of
counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the
aforementioned relevant provisions of law.

              Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory
body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to
be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall
relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the non-issuance or sale of
such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

       16.    RESERVATION OF SHARES.  The Company, during the term of this Plan,
will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

       17.    NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to
the contrary, with respect to any employee who is resident outside of the
United States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of
the Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or
to meet the objectives of the Plan. The Committee may, where appropriate,
establish one or more sub-plans for this purpose.

                       1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN
                           (AS AMENDED THROUGH 6/27/00)

    1.  PURPOSES OF THE PLAN.  The purposes of this Stock Plan are:

       to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of
       substantial responsibility;

       to provide additional incentive to the Chairman and/or Executive Officers
       and other key employees; and

       to promote the success of the Company's business.

    Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options (as defined
under Section 422 of the Code) or Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by
the Administrator at the time of grant. Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may
be granted under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of
Options. Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

    2.  DEFINITIONS.  As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

        (a)  "ADMINISTRATOR" means the Board or any of its Committees as shall
    be administering the Plan, in accordance with Section 4 of the Plan.

        (b)  "AGREEMENT" means an agreement between the Company and an Optionee
    evidencing the terms and conditions of an individual Option, SAR or Stock
    Purchase Right grant. The Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions
    of the Plan.

        (c)  "APPLICABLE LAWS" means the requirements relating to the
    administration of stock option plans under U.S. state corporate laws, U.S.
    federal and state securities laws, the Code, any stock exchange or quotation
    system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted and the applicable laws
    of any foreign country or jurisdiction where Options, SARs or Stock Purchase
    Rights are, or will be, granted under the Plan.

        (i)  "COMPANY" means Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation.

        (j)  "CONTINUOUS STATUS AS CHAIRMAN" unless determined otherwise by the
    Administrator, means the absence of any interruption or termination as
    Chairman of the Board with the Company. Continuous Status as Chairman shall
    not be considered interrupted in the case of medical leave, military leave,
    family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the Administrator,
    provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in termination as
    Chairman with the Company. Neither service as a Director nor payment of a
    director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to constitute status as
    "Chairman" by the Company.

        (k)  "CONTINUOUS STATUS AS AN EMPLOYEE" means the absence of any
    interruption or termination of the employment relationship with the Company
    or any Subsidiary. Continuous Status as an Employee shall not be

<PAGE>

    considered interrupted in the case of (i) medical leave, military leave,
    family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the Administrator,
    provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in termination of
    the employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the
    case may be, under the terms of the respective Company policy for such
    leave; however, vesting may be tolled while an employee is on an approved
    leave of absence under the terms of the respective Company policy for such
    leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers between locations of the Company
    or between the Company, its Subsidiaries, or its successor; For purposes
    of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety days, unless
    reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or
    contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved
    by the Company is not so guaranteed, on the 91st day of such leave any
    Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as
    an Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a
    Nonstatutory Stock Option. Neither service as a Chairman nor as a Director
    nor payment of a director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to
    constitute 'employment' by the Company.

        (l) "Director" means a member of the Board.

       (m) "Employee" means any person employed by the Company or any Parent or
    Subsidiary of the Company subject to (k) above.

    determined as follows:

           (i) If the Common Stock is listed on any established stock exchange
       or a national market system, including without limitation the Nasdaq
       National Market or The Nasdaq SmallCap Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market,
       its Fair Market Value shall be the closing sales price for such stock (or
       the closing bid, if no sales were reported) as quoted on such exchange or
       system, on the date of determination or, if the date of determination is
       not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day, as reported in
       THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or such other source as the Administrator deems
       reliable;

           (ii) If the Common Stock is regularly quoted by a recognized
       securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, the Fair Market

Plan has terminated); however, should the Company reacquire Shares which were
issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR, such Shares shall not
become available for future grant under the Plan. If Shares of Restricted Stock
are repurchased by the Company at their original purchase price, such shares

    4.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a)  PROCEDURE.

           (i) MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES. If permitted by Rule 16b-3
       promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto, as in
       effect at the time that discretion is being exercised with respect to the
       Plan, and by the legal requirements of the Applicable Laws relating to
       the administration of stock plans such as the Plan, if any, the Plan may
       (but need not) be administered by different administrative bodies with
       respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors who are
       Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) Employees who are
       neither Directors nor Officers.

           (ii) SECTION 162(m). To the extent that the Administrator determines
       it to be desirable to qualify Options or SARs granted hereunder as
       "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
       the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more
       "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

<PAGE>
          (iii) RULE 16b-3. To the extent desirable to qualify transactions
       hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated
       hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption
       under Rule 16b-3.

           (iv) OTHER ADMINISTRATION. Other than as provided above, the Plan
       shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which
       committee shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.

        (b)  POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Subject to the provisions of the
    Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties
    delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the
    authority, in its discretion:

           (i) to determine the Fair Market Value;

           (ii) to select the person(s) to whom Options, SARs and Stock Purchase
       Rights may be granted hereunder;

          (iii) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered
       by each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;

           (iv) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

           (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the
       terms of the Plan, of any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted
       hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the
       exercise price, the date of grant, the time or times when Options, SARs
       or Stock Purchase Rights may be exercised (which may be based on
       performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture
       restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR
       or Stock Purchase Right or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto,
       based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole
       discretion, shall determine;

           (vi) to reduce the exercise price of any Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market
       Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
       Right shall have declined since the date the Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right was granted;

          (vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards
       granted pursuant to the Plan;

         (viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating
       to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans
       established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment
       under foreign tax laws;

           (ix) to modify or amend each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
       (subject to Section 17(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary
       authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options
       longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;

           (x) to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by
       electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon
       exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right that number of Shares
       having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.
       The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on
       the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All
       elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall
       be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may
       deem necessary or advisable;

           (xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any
       instrument required to effect the grant of an Option, SAR or Stock
       Purchase Right previously granted by the Administrator; and

<PAGE>
          (xii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable
       for administering the Plan.

        (c)  EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR'S DECISION.  The Administrator's decisions,
    determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all
    Optionees and any other holders of Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights.

    5.  ELIGIBILITY.  Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights
may be granted to the Chairman, Executive Officers and other key employees or to
such other individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has
offered a position of Chairman or Executive Officer. Incentive Stock Options may
be granted only to Executive Officers and other key employees.

    6.  LIMITATIONS.

        (a) Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an
    Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,
    notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair
    Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
    exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year
    (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds
    $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For
    purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into
    account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of
    the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to
    such Shares is granted.

        (b) Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's
    relationship as an Employee with or Chairman of the Company, nor shall they
    interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to
    terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.

        (c) The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options and SARs:

           (i) No participant shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the
       Company, Options or SARs to purchase more than 17,000,000 Shares;

           (ii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in
       connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described
       in Section 15;

          (iii) If an Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the
       Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a
       transaction described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted
       against the limits set forth in subsections (i) above. For this purpose,
       if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction
       will be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a
       new Option or SAR.

    7.  TERM OF PLAN.  Subject to Section 21 of the Plan, the Plan shall become
effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in effect for a term
of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 16 of the Plan.

    8.  TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be stated in the
Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10)
years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an
Optionee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock
representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the
Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such
shorter term as may be provided in the Agreement.

<PAGE>
    9.  OPTION EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

        (a)  EXERCISE PRICE.  The per share exercise price for the Shares to be
    issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the
    Administrator, subject to the following:

           (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option;

              (A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock
           Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent
           (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or
           any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no
           less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of
           grant; or

               (B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in
           paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall
           be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date
           of grant;

           (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share
       exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a
       Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as 'performance-based
       compensation' within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per
       Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value
       per Share on the date of grant;

          (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per
       Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share
       on the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a
       merger or other corporate transaction.

        (b)  WAITING PERIOD AND EXERCISE DATES.  At the time an Option is
    granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may
    be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied
    before the Option may be exercised.

        (c)  FORM OF CONSIDERATION.  The Administrator shall determine the
    acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the
    method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the
    Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the
    time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of:

           (i) cash;

           (ii) check;

          (iii) promissory note;

           (iv) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon
       exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six
       months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the
       date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as
       to which said Option shall be exercised;

           (v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise
       program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

           (vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the
       Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's
       participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or
       arrangement;

          (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

         (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance
       of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

<PAGE>
    10.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

        (a)  GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion of the
    Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of an
    Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time
    thereafter during the term of the Option. The following provisions apply to
    SARs that are granted in connection with Options:

           (i) The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by
       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.
       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal
       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the
       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related
       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the
       surrendered portion of the related Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
       the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon
       exercise of a SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict
       the exercisability of the related Option;

           (ii) When a SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent
       surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable;

          (iii) A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the
       related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on
       which the related Option expires; and

           (iv) A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value
       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.

        (b)  INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator,
    SARs may be granted without related Options. The following provisions apply
    to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

           (i) The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to
       receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair
       Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,
       as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the
       Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date
       on which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the Administrator
       may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of a SAR;
       and

           (ii) SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as
       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's Agreement.

        (c)  FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the
    exercise of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any
    combination of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole
    discretion, may determine. Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall be
    valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

        (d)  RULE 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional
    restrictions as may be required to be contained in the Plan or Agreement in
    order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by Rule
    16b-3.

    11.  EXERCISE OF OPTION OR SAR.

        (a)  PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any Option or SAR
    granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan
    and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the
    Administrator and set forth in the Agreement. An Option may not be exercised
    for a fraction of a Share.

<PAGE>
        An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives:
    (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms
    of the Option or SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or
    SAR, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option
    is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of
    payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Agreement and
    the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the
    name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the
    Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by
    the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
    transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any
    other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned
    Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue
    (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised.
    No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the
    record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided
    in Section 15 of the Plan.

        Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares
    thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the
    Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
    Exercise of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised,
    result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be
    available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be
    exercisable to the extent it has been exercised.

        (b)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS STATUS AS CHAIRMAN.  Upon termination of
    an Optionee's Continuous Status as Chairman (other than termination by
    reason of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within
    ninety (90) days after the date of such termination, exercise his or her
    Option or SAR to the extent that it was exercisable at the date of such
    termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may
    not be exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by
    its terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

        (c)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of an
    Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason
    of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days
    after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the
    extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be
    exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
    terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

        (d)  DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  If an Optionee dies (i) while an Employee or
    Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6)
    months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as
    determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the
    Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the
    Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to
    exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and
    terminated his or her employment six (6) months (or such other period of
    time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the Administrator)
    after the date of death; or (ii) within ninety (90) days after the
    termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or Chairman, the Option or
    SAR may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months (or such other
    period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined by the
    Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or by a
    person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or
    inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had
    accrued at the date of termination. If the Option or SAR is not so exercised
    within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the
    Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be
    exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its
    terms due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

<PAGE>
        (e)  BUYOUT PROVISIONS.  The Administrator may at any time offer to buy
    out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option or SAR previously granted
    based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and
    communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

    12.  STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.

        (a)  RIGHTS TO PURCHASE.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either
    alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan
    and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator
    determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall
    advise the Optionee in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions
    and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that
    the Optionee shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the
    time within which the Optionee must accept such offer. The offer shall be
    accepted by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the
    Administrator.

        (b)  REPURCHASE OPTION.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise,
    the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon
    the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the
    Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The purchase price
    for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall be the original price
    paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of
    the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate
    determined by the Administrator.

        (c)  OTHER PROVISIONS.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms,
    provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be
    determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

        (d)  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is
    exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a
    shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered
    upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No
    adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record
    date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as
    provided in Section 15 of the Plan.

    13.  TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS, SARS AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.  Unless
determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed
of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title
1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and may be exercised, during
the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes
an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such Option, SAR or Stock
Purchase Right shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the
Administrator deems appropriate.

    14.  STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX OBLIGATIONS.  When an
Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option,
SAR or Stock Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax
withholding under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay
the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the
Optionee may satisfy the withholding tax obligation by electing to have the
Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if
any, that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount
required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld
shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to
be determined (the "Tax Date").

    All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall
be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be
subject to the following restrictions:

        (i) the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax Date;
    and

        (ii) all elections shall be subject to the consent or disapproval of the
    Administrator.

    In the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an Optionee and
the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because no election is
filed under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall receive the full
number of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
is exercised but such Optionee shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back
to the Company the proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.

    15.  ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER OR
ASSET SALE.

        (a)  CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action by the
    shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by
    each outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of
    shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the
    Plan but as to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been
    granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or
    expiration of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price
    per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR or
    Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or
    decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a
    stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or
    reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in
    the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of
    consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
    convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been
    "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made
    by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding
    and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the
    Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into
    shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason
    thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of
    Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.

        (b)  DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed
    dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and
    Stock Purchase Rights will terminate immediately prior to the consummation
    of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The
    Administrator may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances,
    declare that any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate as of a
    date fixed by the Administrator and give each Optionee the right to exercise
    his or her Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the
    Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option, SAR or Stock
    Purchase Right would not otherwise be exercisable.

        (c)  MERGER OR ASSET SALE.  Unless otherwise determined by the
    Administrator, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another
    corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,
    each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an
    equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a
    Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the
    successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or
    Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to
    exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned
    Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or
    exercisable. If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested
    and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a
    merger or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in
    writing or electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    be fully vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the
    date of such notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall
    terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this
    paragraph, the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered
    assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right
    confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock
    subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the
    merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other

<PAGE>

    securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by
    holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the
    transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
    type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the
    outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration
    received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the
    succesor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the
    consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be
    received upon the exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for
    each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
    Right, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its
    Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received
    by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.

        (d)  CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a "Change in Control" of the
    Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by
    the Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the
    following acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

           (i) Any Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding as of the
       date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred that are not
       yet exercisable and vested on such date shall become fully exercisable
       and vested; and

          (ii) The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase
       Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or
       after grant, be cashed-out. The amount at which such Options, SARs and
       Stock Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of
       (x) the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the exercise
       price of the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
       Right. The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, in the
       event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate of the
       Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option,
       SAR or Stock Purchase Right by bequest or inheritance.

        (e)  DEFINITION OF "CHANGE IN CONTROL".  For purposes of this
    Section 15, a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the
    following:

           (i) When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a
       Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting
       as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities
       of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined
       voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or

           (ii) The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval,
       and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
       Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

        (f)  CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For purposes of this Section 15, "Change
    in Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the
    highest Fair Market Value at any time within the 60-day period immediately
    preceding the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the
    Administrator (the "60-Day Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or
    offered, as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or
    bona fide offer related to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time
    within the 60-Day Period.

    16.  DATE OF GRANT.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase
Right shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other
later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination
shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of
such grant.

    17.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a)  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time amend, alter,
    suspend or terminate the Plan.

        (b)  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Company shall obtain shareholder
    approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to
    comply with Applicable Laws.

        (c)  EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.  No amendment, alteration,
    suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any
    Optionee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the
    Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee
    and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the
    Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with
    respect to Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights granted under the Plan
    prior to the date of such termination.

    18.  CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.

        (a)  LEGAL COMPLIANCE.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the
    exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of
    such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of
    such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject
    to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

        (b)  INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS.  As a condition to the exercise of an
    Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person
    exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant
    at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only
    for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such
    Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation
    is required.

    19.  INABILITY TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY.  The inability of the Company to obtain
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale
of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect
of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority
shall not have been obtained.

    20.  RESERVATION OF SHARES.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

    21.  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is
adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the
degree required under Applicable Laws.

    22.  NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the
contrary, with respect to any employee who is resident outside of the United
States, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the
Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or to
meet the objectives of the Plan. The Committee may, where appropriate,
establish one or more sub-plans for this purpose.
