APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim periods are not 
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These
 financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for 
the fiscal year ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 Form 10-K").

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 
("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share." In accordance with SFAS 128, primary 
earnings per share have been replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully 
diluted earnings per share have been replaced with diluted earnings per share 
which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and 
convertible securities. Prior periods have been presented to conform to SFAS 
128; however, as the Company had a net loss in the prior periods presented,
basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary loss per share 
previously reported.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the 
computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, 
except net income (loss) and per share amounts):

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated 
notes (the "Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately 
22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common 
shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share for the periods presented because the effect of 
using the if-converted method would be anti-dilutive. For additional 
disclosures regarding the outstanding preferred stock, employee stock options 
and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

Note 3 - Restructuring Activities
In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a 
restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring profitability to the 
Company's operations. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased 
demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new 
strategic direction. These actions resulted in a net charge of $179 million 
after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996. During 
1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring 
actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a 
$217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those 
actions, including approximately $8 million of costs related to the termination
of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The combined restructuring 
actions consist of terminating approximately 3,600 full-time employees, 
approximately 3,300 of whom have been terminated from the second quarter of 
1996 through March 27, 1998, excluding employees who were hired by SCI 
Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's Fountain, 
Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center facility, 
respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of 
those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and equipment
to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various 
operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies 
that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring
actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $223 million and 
noncash asset write-downs of $60 million from the second quarter of 1996 
through March 27, 1998. During the third quarter of 1997 and the first and 
second quarters of 1998, the Company made adjustments to the categories and 
timing of expected restructure spending based on revised estimates. The 
Company expects that the remaining $113 million accrued balance as of March 
27, 1998 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $71 million over 
the next six months and $15 million thereafter. The Company expects that most 
of the contemplated restructuring actions related to the plan will be completed
during fiscal 1998 and will be financed through current working capital and, 
if necessary, short-term borrowings.

The following table depicts the restructuring activity through March 27, 1998:

Note 4 - Power Computing Asset Acquisition
On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets 
of Power Computing Corporation ("PCC"), a licensed distributor of the Mac OS 
operating system. In addition to the acquisition of certain assets such as 
PCC's customer database and the license to distribute the Mac OS, the Company 
has the right to retain certain key employees of PCC. The agreement with PCC 
also includes a release of claims between the parties. The total purchase 
price was approximately $110 million, of which $75 million was expensed in the 
fourth quarter of 1997 as "termination of license agreement" and $35 million 
was recorded as goodwill in the second quarter of 1998.  The goodwill will be 
amortized over three years.  The purchase price was comprised of approximately 
4.2 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at $80 million, 
forgiveness of $28 million of receivables due from PCC, and assumption by the 
Company of $2 million of certain customer support liabilities of PCC.  

Note 5 - Stock Option Exchange
In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's key 
employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option exchange 
program which allowed employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of 
their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of greater 
than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise price of 
$13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on December 19, 
1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in December 1997.  A 
total of 4.4 million options with a weighted-average exercise price of $20.01 
per share were exchanged for new options as a result of this program.

Note 6 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" which 
establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of software 
revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the Company to modify 
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not 
expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated results of operations.

Note 7 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the 
Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings 
and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing 
petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax 
adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of 
issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in 
dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations.

Note 8 - Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 1997 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation.

Note 9 - Subsequent Events
As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of 
ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom 
involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related 
technology.  On April 16, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of 
its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market. The 
Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign 
income taxes of approximately $23.4 million.  This amount will be recognized 
as other income in the third quarter of 1998.  Foreign income taxes on this 
gain are expected to be approximately $7.25 million. The Company's remaining 
investment in ARM will be increased in the third quarter of 1998 by 
approximately $16 million to a total of approximately $21 million to reflect 
its 25.9% ownership interest in the net book value of ARM following its 
initial public offering. The Company will continue to account for its 
investment in ARM using the equity method.  

The Company's cash and cash equivalents as of March 27, 1998 and September 
26, 1997 include $161 million and $165 million, respectively, pledged as 
collateral to support letters of credit primarily associated with the 
Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. On April 24, 1998, SCI 
notified the Company that certain performance measures defined within the 
letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company and, that effective as 
of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount pledged as collateral by
the Company to support the letter of credit will be reduced by $100 million. 
Should the Company fail to meet those performance measures in the future, it 
is possible that some or all of the letter of credit and supporting collateral 
would have to be reestablished.

Net Sales

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates and 
discounts. Net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 1998 were 
$1.4 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, decreases of 12% and 20%, 
respectively, over the corresponding periods in 1997. The decline in net sales 
is attributable to several factors. The Company experienced a $60 million 
decrease in net sales between the second quarter of 1998 and the same period 
in 1997 of certain imaging products the Company is discontinuing. In addition, 
between the second quarter of 1998 and the same period in 1997, there was a 
$223 million decline in revenues from the sale of PowerBooks due to stronger 
than usual sales of PowerBooks in the second quarter of 1997 related to new 
product introductions. Net sales in Asia were adversely affected primarily by 
the region's current economic problems, declining 31% or $250 million 
during the first six months of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997. 
Lastly, the average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net 
sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 
18% and 5%, respectively, between the second quarter and first six months of  
1998 compared to the corresponding periods in 1997 reflecting the effect of 
aggressive pricing on the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems introduced 
in 1998, the decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral 
products, and the overall industry trend towards lower-priced products.  The 
effect on net sales of these decreases were partially offset by an 8% increase 
in unit sales of Macintosh computer systems during the second quarter of 1998 
as compared to the same period in 1997.

Net sales decreased 11% in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the first 
quarter of 1998 primarily due to a decrease in the average revenue per 
Macintosh system. Also, the second quarter of each fiscal year has 
historically  been the Company's weakest due to lower demand from its 
consumer and education markets in that time frame. Unit sales of peripheral 
products decreased 45% in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the prior 
quarter reflecting the continuing phase-out of  certain peripheral products. 
The average revenue per Macintosh system decreased 13% in the second quarter 
of 1998 compared with the first quarter of 1998, primarily due to lower priced 
G3 Macintosh systems comprising a higher portion of total computer units 
shipped, the overall decline in peripheral unit sales, and in response to 
continuing industry wide pricing pressures. The effect on net sales of these 
decreases was partially offset by a 2% increase in total Macintosh computer 
system unit sales during the second quarter of 1998 compared to the prior 
quarter. Net sales for the current quarter were also positively affected by 
continued strong sales of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems, which 
accounted for approximately 51%of computer systems shipped during the second 
quarter of 1998 as compared to 21% of computer systems shipped during the 
prior quarter. In addition, net sales continued to be positively impacted 
through the Company's marketing of many of its products directly to end users 
in the U.S. through theCompany's on-line store, which opened in November 1997. 
The Company generated  $16 million in revenue from its on-line store during 
the second quarter of 1998. 


                                     13

International sales for the three and six month periods in 1998 represented 
50% of consolidated net sales in each of the periods versus 49% and 53%, 
respectively, for the same periods in 1997. International net sales fell 11% 
in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the same period of 1997 primarily 
due to decreased revenue in the European and Japanese markets as a result of 
significant decreases in the average revenue per Macintosh system and in 
peripheral unit sales, partially offset by increases in unit sales of 
Macintosh systems. Domestic net sales declined 13% in the second quarter of 
1998 over the comparable period of 1997 also due to decreases in the average 
revenue per Macintosh system and in peripheral unit sales, partially offset 
by increases in unit sales of Macintosh systems

The Company does not currently anticipate significant sequential quarterly 
revenue growth before the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, and year-over-year 
revenue growth is not expected before the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The 
foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's actual results could 
differ because of several factors, including those set forth below in the 
subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition".

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales during the second quarter and 
the first six months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, 
and increased during the second quarter of 1998 from 22% to 25% of sales 
compared to the first quarter of 1998. These increases were primarily a result 
of a shift in revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh 
G3 systems as well as benefits derived from new distribution channel policies.

The Company believes gross margins of at least 23% are sustainable through 
the end of fiscal 1998. The foregoing statement is forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect 
Future Results and Financial Condition".

There can be no assurance that current gross margin levels will be maintained. 
In general, gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due 
to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing 
pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential 
changes to the Company's product mix. In response to these downward 
pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with 
respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's 
ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to 
stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy 
and pricing take into account changes in foreign currency exchange rates over 
time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly 
affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the second quarter and the first six months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and decreased in amount 
during the second quarter of 1998 compared with the first quarter of 1998. 
These reductions are due to various restructuring actions which resulted in 
reductions in headcount and cancellation of certain research and development 
projects. 

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the second quarter and the first six months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and decreased in amount 
but remained relatively comparable as a percentage of sales during the second 
quarter of 1998 compared to the first quarter of 1998. These decreases are due 
to various restructuring actions which resulted in reductions in headcount, 
the closing of facilities, the write-down of assets, and changes to 
distribution channel policies.

Special Charges

During the second quarter of 1997, the Company recognized a $375 million 
charge for in-process research and development in connection with the 
acquisition of NeXT and a $155 million charge for restructuring costs. For 
further information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, see Note 3 
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the Company's 
debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for using the 
equity method, certain foreign exchange gains and losses and other 
miscellaneous income and expense items.

As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of 
ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United 
Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and 
related technology.  On April 16, 1998, ARM completed an initial public 
offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National 
Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before 
foreign income taxes of approximately $23.4 million.  This amount will be 
recognized as other income in the third quarter of fiscal 1998. The Company 
will continue to account for its investment in ARM using the equity method.




                                     15

Provision for Income Taxes

The Company's tax rate was 3.8% for the first six months of 1998. The tax 
provision for this period consisted entirely of foreign taxes. The Company 
expects to recognize in the third quarter approximately $7.25 million of 
foreign income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of ARM shares.

As of March 27, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $691 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of March 27, 1998, a valuation allowance of $209 million was recorded 
against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not 
be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset 
representing tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's 
ability to generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. 
Management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. 
income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax 
planning strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior 
to their expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, 
there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of 
future U.S. taxable income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets 
considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates 
of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company 
will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 
increased to $1,823 million as of March 27, 1998, from $1,459 million as of 
September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of 
March 27, 1998 and September 26, 1997 include $161 million and $165 
million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit 
primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the terms 
of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI.
On April 24, 1998, SCI notified the Company that certain performance measures 
defined within the letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company and 
that effective as of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount pledged 
as collateral by the Company to support the letter of credit will be reduced 
by $100 million.  Should the Company fail to meet those performance measures 
in the future, it is possible that some or all of the letter of credit and 
supporting collateral would have to be reestablished.

Cash generated by operations during the first six months of 1998 totaled $296 
million. Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of positive 
earnings and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially 
offset by  decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

                                     16
<PAGE>

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $12 
million in the first six months of 1998, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing machinery and equipment. The Company expects that the level 
of capital expenditures in the second half of 1998 will be consistent with the 
first half.

 The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments balances, and ability, if necessary, to effect other short-term 
borrowings, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next 
twelve months. Expected cash requirements over the next twelve months include
an estimated $86 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, most 
of which will be effected during 1998. No assurance can be given that any 
additional required financing could be obtained should the restructuring plan 
take longer to implement than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company 
is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, 
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. The company's senior and subordinated long-term debt 
ratings remain B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's Rating 
Agency, and B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services.  Both 
rating agencies continue to have the Company on negative outlook.  These 
actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in future periods, require 
the Company to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of its 
letters of credit and require the Company to agree to more stringent debt 
covenants than in the past.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a 
number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In 
addition to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are 
many factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which 
may cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The
Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon 
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued competitive 
pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; risks 
associated with international operations, including economic and labor 
conditions, political instability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; 


                                     17
<PAGE>

increasing dependence on third-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced 
functions such as logistics; the availability of key components on terms 
acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of certain components 
essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from 
sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by 
and obtained from IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products 
in certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely 
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate the technologies of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT"), which 
was acquired in 1997; the Company's ability to successfully implement its 
strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; 
the effects of significant adverse publicity; the availability of third-party 
software for particular applications; the effect of year 2000 compliance 
issues; the Company's ability to successfully replace its existing transaction 
systems in the U.S.; and the impact on the Company's sales, market share and 
gross margins as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing 
program.   

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition"

                             Apple Computer, Inc.

                       1997 Director Stock Option Plan

1.  Purposes.    The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services 
of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as 
members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the 
incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals 
by granting such individuals Options to purchase shares of Common Stock.

2.  Administration.   The Administrator will be responsible for 
administering the Plan. The Administrator will have authority to adopt such 
rules as it may deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan, and 
shall have authority to interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan and 
any agreements and notices under the Plan and to make determinations

date of grant.

    (d)   Term of Options.

effect as of the effective date of such removal from the Board. Whether a 
Non-Employee Director is removed by the Board for "cause" shall be 
determined by the Board in accordance with the By-Laws of the 
Company.

        (iv)  Exercise Following Other Terminations of Service.    If a Non-

Employee Director, but only to the extent the Option was exercisable at 
the time of the Non-Employee Director's termination, at any time within 
ninety (90) days after the date of such termination of service, subject to the 
earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 4(d)(i) above.

    (e)   Time and Manner of Exercise of Options.

         (i)  Notice of Exercise.    Subject to the other terms and conditions 
hereof, a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Option, to the extent 
such Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the 
Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be 
exercisable for a fractional share. The date of exercise of an Option shall 
be the later of (A) the date on which the Company receives such written 
notice and (B) the date on which the conditions provided in Section 
4(e)(ii) are satisfied.

        (ii)  Method of Payment.  The consideration to be paid for the 
shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A) cash, (B) 
check, (C) other shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of

the Option shall be exercised and which have been owned by the Non-
Employee Director for at least six (6) months at the time of exercise, (D) 
delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable
instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount 
of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E) any combination of 
the foregoing methods of payment.

       (iii)  Stockholder Rights.   A Non-Employee Director shall have 
no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock 
issuable upon exercise of an Option until a certificate evidencing such 

                                      26
<PAGE>

shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to 
Section 4(e)(v), and no adjustment shall be made for dividends or 
distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record 
date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall 
become the holder of record thereof.

        (iv)  Limitation on Exercise.    No Option shall be exercisable 
unless the Common Stock subject thereto has been registered under the 
Securities Act and qualified under applicable state "blue sky" laws in 
connection with the offer and sale thereof, or the Company has 
determined that an exemption from registration under the Securities Act 
and from qualification wider such state "blue sky" laws is available.

         (v)  Issuance of Shares.    Subject to the foregoing conditions, as 
soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of 
exercise and payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of 
shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall 
deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee 
Director's death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the 
principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be 
acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such 
Beneficiary), one or more stock certificates for the appropriate number of 
shares of Common Stock Issued in connection with such exercise. Shares 
sold in connection with a "cashless exercise" described in clause C of 
Section 4(e)(ii) shall be delivered to the broker referred to therein in 
accordance with the procedures established by the Company from time to 
time.

    (f)   Restrictions on Transfer. An Option may not be transferred, 
pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of 
descent and distribution; provided, however,  that an Option may be 
transferred to a Non-Employee Director's family members or to one or more 
trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such 
family members. The Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee 
Director's lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or 
entity to whom  the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous 
sentence. No assignment or transfer of the Option, or of the rights 
represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or 
otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest 
in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Option, but 
immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Option the same shall 
terminate and be of no force or effect.

5.  Designation of Beneficiary.	 
	
    (a)   Beneficiary Designations.    Each Non-Employee Director 
may designate a Beneficiary to exercise an Option upon the Non-Employee 
Director's death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form.


                                      27
<PAGE>

    (b)   Change of Beneficiary Designation.    A Non-Employee 
Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later 
Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator. The 
execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the 
Administrator will revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.

6.  Change in Control.

Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event 
of a Change in Control of the Company, the following provisions shall apply:

    (a)   Any Options outstanding as of the date such Change in 
Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable and vested 
on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested.

    (b)   The value of all outstanding Options (to the extent not 
previously exercised) shall be cashed out on the date of the Change in 
Control. The amount at which such Options shall be cashed out shall be equal 
to the excess, if any, of (i) the Change in Control Price over (ii) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option. The cash-out 
proceeds shall be paid to the Non-Employee Director or, in the event of death 
of the Non-Employee Director prior to payment, to the Beneficiary thereof.

    (c)   If the Administrator shall receive an opinion from a nationally 
recognized firm of accountants to the Company that the cash-out provisions in 
Section 6(b) above with respect to Options will prohibit the utilization of 
"pooling of interests" accounting in connection with the transaction resulting
in the Change in Control of the Company, then the following shall apply, but
only to the extent necessary to permit such accounting treatment: (i) the 
provisions of Section 6(b) shall not apply to the Options, (ii) each such 
Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable as of the date such
opinion is received by the Administrator, and (iii) the Administrator shall 
promptly inform each Non-Employee Director of such opinion and of the 
accelerated vesting and exercisability of the Option sufficiently prior to the 
anticipated date of the Change in Control, so as to permit the Option to be 
exercised prior to the date of the Change in Control.

7.  Recapitalization or Reorganization.

    (a)   Authority of the Company and Shareholders.   The existence 
of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the 
Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize any 
adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's 
capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, 
any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of 
bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are 
superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof or which are 
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the dissolution or 
liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its 
assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a 
similar character or otherwise.

                                      28
<PAGE>

    (b)   Change in Capitalization.  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of the Plan, in the event of any change in the outstanding Common 
Stock by reason of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, 
consolidation,  stock split, combination or exchange of shares (a "change in 
Capitalization"),  (i) such proportionate adjustments as may be necessary (in 
the form determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) to reflect 
such change shall be made to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of 
Non-Employee Directors under the Plan with respect to tile aggregate number of 
shares of Common Stock authorized to be awarded under the Plan, the number 
of shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Option and the 
exercise prices in respect thereof and the number of shares of Common Stock 
covered by future Option grants and (ii) the Administrator may make such 
other adjustments, consistent with the foregoing, as it deems appropriate in 
its sole discretion.

    (c)   Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed 
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each outstanding Option will vest 
and become exercisable on a date prior to the consummation of the proposed 
action that is reasonably sufficient to enable the Non-Employee Directors to 
exercise their Options.

8.  Termination and Amendment of the Plan.

    (a)   Termination.   The Plan shall terminate on the tenth 
anniversary of the Effective Date, Following such date, no further grants of 
Options shall be made pursuant to the Plan.

    (b)   General Power of Board.   Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time terminate, 
modify, suspend or amend the Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that 
no such termination, modification, suspension or amendment shall be effective 
without shareholder approval if such approval is required to comply with any 
applicable law or stock exchange rule; and provided further, that the Board 
may not, without shareholder approval, increase the maximum number of shares 
issuable under the Plan except as provided in Section 7(b) above.
	
    (c)   When Non-Employee Directors' Consents Required.   The 
Board may not alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan without the consent 
of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely 
affect his or her rights with respect to Options that have previously been 
granted.

9.  Miscellaneous.

    (a)   No Right to Reelection.   Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed 
to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any of its 
members for reelection by the Company's stockholders, nor confer upon any 
Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board for any 
period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation

                                    29
<PAGE>

    (b)   Securities Law Restrictions.   The Administrator may require 
each Non-Employee Director purchasing or acquiring shares of Common Stock 
pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-
Employee Director is acquiring the shares for investment and not with a view 
to the distribution thereof. All certificates for shares of Common Stock 
delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and 
other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules,
regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, 
and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Administrator may 
cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make 
appropriate reference to such restrictions. No shares of Common Stock shall be 
issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such 
issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all 
applicable federal and state securities laws.

    (c)   Expenses.    The costs and expenses of administering the Plan 
shall be borne by the Company.

Date, subject to the approval thereof by the stockholders of the Company by no

                       1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN


1.  Purposes of the Plan.  The purposes of this Stock Plan are:

      to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of 
      substantial responsibility, 

      to provide additional incentive to the Chairman and/or Executive 
      Officers, and 

      to promote the success of the Company's business.  

  Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options (as defined 
under  Section 422 of the Code) or Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by
the Administrator at the time of grant.  Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may
be granted under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of 
Options.  Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

2.  Definitions. As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

    evidencing the terms and conditions of an individual Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase grant.  The Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of 
    the Plan.

    administration of stock option plans under U. S. state corporate laws, U.S.
    federal and state securities laws, the Code, any stock exchange or 
    quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted and the

    (j)   "Continuous Status as Chairman"  unless determined otherwise by the

    Chairman of the Board with the Company.  Continuous Status as Chairman 
    shall not be considered interrupted in the case of medical leave, military 
    leave, family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the 
    Administrator, provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in 
    termination as Chairman with the Company.   Neither service as a Director

    the employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the 
    case may be, under the terms of the respective Company policy for such 
    leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers between locations of the Company or

    contract.  If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved 
    by the Company is not so guaranteed, on the 91st day of such leave any 
    Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as an
    Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a Non-
    statutory Stock Option.  Neither service as a Chairman nor as a Director
    nor payment of a director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to 
    constitute "employment" by the Company.

    not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day, as reported in 
    The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Administrator deems 
    reliable;

        (ii)	 If the Common Stock is regularly quoted by a recognized

shares shall become available for future grant under the Plan.
	
4.  Administration of the Plan.

   (a)    Procedure.

         (i)	 Multiple Administrative Bodies.  If permitted by Rule 16b-3 
    promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto, as in 
    effect at the time that discretion is being exercised with respect to the 
    Plan ("Rule 16b-3"), and by the legal requirements of the Applicable Laws

    Plan may (but need not) be administered by different administrative bodies 
    with respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors who are 
    Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) Employees who are 
    neither Directors nor Officers.

        (ii)  Section 162(m).   To the extent that the Administrator determines
    it to be desirable to qualify Options or SARs granted hereunder as 
    "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of 
    the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more 
    "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

       (iii)	 Rule 16b-3.   To the extent desirable to qualify transactions 
    hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated 
    hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption 
    under Rule 16b-3.
                                     36
<PAGE>
        (iv)  Other Administration.  Other than as provided above, the Plan 
    shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which committee 
    shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws. 

    (b)  Powers of the Administrator.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, 
    and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by
    the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority, 
    in its discretion:

         (i)	 to determine the Fair Market Value;

        (ii)  to select the person(s) to whom Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
    Rights may be granted hereunder;

       (iii)	 to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered 
    by each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;

        (iv)	 to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

         (v)  to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the 
    terms of the Plan, of any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted 
    hereunder.  Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the 
    exercise price, the date of grant, the time or times when Options, SARs or 
    Stock Purchase Rights may be exercised (which may be based on performance 
    criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, 
    and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in 
    each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, 
    shall determine;

        (vi)  to reduce the exercise price of any Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market 
    Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase 
    Right shall have declined since the date the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase 
    Right was granted;

       (vii)  to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards 
    granted pursuant to the Plan;

      (viii)  to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to 
    the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans 
    established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment 
    under foreign tax laws;

        (ix)  to modify or amend each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
    (subject to Section 16(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary 
    authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options 
    longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;

        (x)  to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by 
    electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon 
   
                                     37
<PAGE>
    
    exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right that number of Shares 
    having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.  
    The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on 
    the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.  All 
    elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be 
    made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem 
    necessary or advisable;

        (xi)  to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any 
    instrument required to effect the grant of an Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right previously granted by the Administrator; and

       (xii)  to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable 
    for administering the Plan.

    (c)  Effect of Administrator's Decision.  The Administrator's decisions, 
    determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all 
    Optionees and any other holders of Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights.

5.  Eligibility.  Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights
may be granted to the Chairman and Executive Officers or to such other 
individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has offered a 
position of Chairman or Executive Officer.  Incentive Stock Options may be 
granted only to Executive Officers.  

6.  Limitations.

    (a)   Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an 
    Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  However, 
    notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair 
    Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options 
    are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year
    (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds 
    $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  
    For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken 
    into account in the order in which they were granted.  The Fair Market 
    Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with 
    respect to such Shares is granted.

    (b)   Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall 
    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the 
    Optionee's relationship as an Employee with the Company, nor shall they 
    interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to 
    terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.

    (c)   The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options and SARs:

         (i)  No participant shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the 
    Company, Options to purchase more than 17,000,000 Shares.

                                     38
<PAGE>

        (ii)  The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in 
    connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in 
    Section 15. 

       (iii)  If an Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the 
    Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a 
    transaction described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted 
    against the limits set forth in subsections (i) above.  For this purpose, 
    if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction will 
    be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a new 
    Option or SAR.

7.  Term of Plan.  Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, the Plan shall become 
effective upon its adoption by the Board.  It shall continue in effect for a 
term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 16 of the Plan.

8.  Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be stated in the Agreement.
In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10) years from
the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Agreement. 
Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, 
at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more
than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of 
stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive 
Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter 
term as may be provided in the Agreement.
	
9.  Option Exercise Price and Consideration.

    (a)  Exercise Price.  The per share exercise price for the Shares to be 
issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the 
Administrator, subject to the following:

         (i)  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option

           (A)  granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock 
    Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) 
    of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent 
    or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of 
    the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

           (B)  granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in 
    paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall be no 
    less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

        (ii)  In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share 
    exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator.  In the case of a 
    Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based 
    compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per 
    Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value 
    per Share on the date of grant.

                                     39

<PAGE>

       (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per 
    Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share 
    on the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a 
    merger or other corporate transaction.

    (b)   Waiting Period and Exercise Dates.  At the time an Option is 
granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be 
exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before 
the Option may be exercised. 

    (c)   Form of Consideration.  The Administrator shall determine the 
acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the 
method of payment.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator
shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant.  
Such consideration may consist entirely of:

         (i)  cash;

        (ii)  check;

       (iii)  promissory note;
		    
        (iv)	 other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon 
    exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six 
    months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the 
    date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as 
    to which said Option shall be exercised;

         (v)  consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise 
    program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

        (vi)  a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the 
    Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's 
    participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or 
    arrangement;

       (vii)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

       (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance 
    of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

10. Stock Appreciation Rights.

    (a)   Granted in Connection with Options.  At the sole discretion of the 
Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of an 
Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time 
thereafter during the term of the Option.  The following provisions apply to 
SARs that are granted in connection with Options:


                                     40
<PAGE>


         (i)  The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by 
    surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.  
    The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal 
    to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the 
    SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related 
    Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the 
    surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
  

    the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon 
    exercise of an SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict 
    the exercisability of the related Option;

        (ii)  When a SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent 
    surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable;

       (iii)  A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that 
    the related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date 
    on which the related Option expires; and

        (iv)  A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market 
    Value of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the 
    exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.
 
    (b)   Independent SARs.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator, SARs 
may be granted without related Options.  The following provisions apply to 
SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

         (i)  The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to 
    receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair 
    Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the 
    SAR, as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of 
    the Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the 
    date on which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the 
    Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon 
    exercise of a SAR; and

        (ii)  SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as 
    the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement. 

    (c)  Form of Payment.  The Company's obligation arising upon the exercise 
of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination of 
Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may 
determine.  Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall be valued at their 
Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

    (d)   Rule 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional 
restrictions as may be required to be contained in the plan or SAR agreement in 
order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.


                                     41
<PAGE>

11.	Exercise of Option or SAR.

    (a)  Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder. Any Option or SAR
granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and
at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator 
and set forth in the Agreement.  An Option may not be exercised for a fraction 
of a Share.

    An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: 
(i)  written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms of 
the Option or SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR, and 
(ii)  full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is 
exercised.  Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment
authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Agreement and the Plan.  
Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the 
Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his 
or her spouse.  Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate 
entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the
Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a 
shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding 
the exercise of the Option.  The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) 
such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised.  No adjustment will be 
made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the 
date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

    Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares 
thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the 
Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  Exercise 
of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised, result in a 
decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be available for 
purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be exercisable to the extent 
it has been exercised.
		
    (b)  Termination of Continuous Status as Chairman.   Upon termination of 
an Optionee's Continuous Status as Chairman (other than termination by reason 
of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days 
after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the 
extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised 
after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

    (c)   Termination of Continuous Employment.   Upon termination of an 
Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason of 
the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days 
after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the 
extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised 
after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

                                     42
<PAGE>		
    (d)  Death of Optionee.  If an Optionee dies (i) while an Employee or 
Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months 
(or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined 
by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or 
by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or 
inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have 
accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated his or her employment 
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months 
as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death; or (ii) within 
ninety (90) days after the termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or 
Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within six (6) 
months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as 
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's
estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by 
bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that 
had accrued at the date of termination.  If the Option or SAR is not so 
exercised within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, 
and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be 
exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms 
due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

    (e)  Buyout Provisions.  The Administrator may at any time offer to buy 
out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option or SAR previously granted based 
on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and 
communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

12. Stock Purchase Rights.

    (a)   Rights to Purchase.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either 
alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan 
and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan.  After the Administrator 
determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall 
advise the offeree in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions and 
restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the 
offeree shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the time 
within which the offeree must accept such offer.  The offer shall be accepted 
by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the Administrator.

    (b)   Repurchase Option.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, 
the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon the 
voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the 
Company for any reason (including death or Disability).  The purchase price for 
Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall be the original price paid 
by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the 
purchaser to the Company.  The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate 
determined by the Administrator.

    (c)   Other Provisions.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms, 
provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined 
by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 
                                     43
<PAGE>
    (d)  Rights as a Shareholder.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is 
exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a 
shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered 
upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company.  No 
adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record 
date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as 
provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

13.  Transferability of Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights.  Unless 
determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase 
Right may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or 
disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or 
distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by 
the Code or Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and may be 
exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.  If the 
Administrator makes an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall contain such additional terms and 
conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.

14.  Stock Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax Obligations.   When an 
Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option, 
SAR or Stock Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax withholding 
under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay the Company an 
amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may 
satisfy the withholding tax obligation (including, at the election of the 
Optionee, any additional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in 
order to satisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax in 
connection with the exercise) by electing to have the Company withhold from 
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to be 
issued upon exercise of the SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if any, that number 
of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be 
withheld (and any additional amount desired to be withheld, as aforesaid). The 
Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date 
that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined (the "Tax Date").

    All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose 
shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall 
be subject to the following restrictions:

         (i)  the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax 
    Date; and
        (ii)	 all elections shall be subject to the consent or disapproval of 
    the Administrator.

    In the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an 
Optionee and the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because 
no election is filed under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall 
receive the full number of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right is exercised but such Optionee shall be 
unconditionally obligated to tender back to the Company the proper 
number of Shares on the Tax Date.

15.  Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger or Asset 
Sale. 

    (a)   Changes in Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by the 
shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by 
each outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of shares 
of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as 
to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been granted or 
which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price per share of Common 
Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, 
shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number 
of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock 
split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or 
any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock 
effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, 
that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be 
deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."  Such 
adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect 
shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided herein, 
no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities 
convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment 
by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares 
of Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.

    (b)  Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the proposed dissolution
or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
Rights  will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed 
action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.  The Administrator 
may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that 
any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right  shall terminate as of a date fixed by 
the Administrator and give each Optionee the right to exercise his or her 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
would not otherwise be exercisable.

    (c)  Merger or Asset Sale.  Unless otherwise determined by the 
Administrator, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another 
corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,
each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an 
equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a 
Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.  In the event that the 
successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to 
exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or 
exercisable.  If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested 
and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger 
or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in writing or 
electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully 

                                     45
<PAGE>
vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such 
notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the 
expiration of such period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option, 
SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered assumed if, following the 
merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or 
receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the 
consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received 
in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held 
on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice 
of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration 
received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the 
successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent 
of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received 
upon the exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for each Share 
of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, to be 
solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair 
market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common 
Stock in the merger or sale of assets.

    (d)   Change in Control.  In the event of a "Change in Control" of the 
Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by the 
Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following 
acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

         (i)	 Any Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding 
    as of the date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred that 
    are not yet exercisable and vested on such date shall become fully 
    exercisable and vested; and

        (ii)	 The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
    Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or after 
    grant, be cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options, SARs and Stock 
    Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of (x) 
    the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the exercise price 
    of the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.  
    The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, in the event of 
    death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate of the Optionee or to 
    a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right by bequest or inheritance.

    (e)   Definition of "Change in Control".  For purposes of this Section 14, 
a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

         (i)	 When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 14(d) 
    and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a 
    Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting 
    as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 
    under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the 
    Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting 
    power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or
                                     46
<PAGE>

        (ii)	 The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval, 
    and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
    Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

    (f)   Change in Control Price.  For purposes of this Section 14, "Change in 
Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the highest 
Fair Market Value at any time within the 60-day period immediately preceding 
the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the Administrator 
(the "60-Day Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered, as determined
by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer related 
to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time within the 60-Day Period.

16. Date of Grant.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the 
determination granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other 
later date as is determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the determination 
shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of 
such grant.

17. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

    (a)   Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at any time amend, alter, 
suspend or terminate the Plan.  

    (b)   Shareholder Approval.  The Company shall obtain shareholder approval 
of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with 
Applicable Laws. 

    (c)   Effect of Amendment or Termination.  No amendment, alteration, 
suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee, 
unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, 
which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company. 
Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to 
exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right granted under the Plan prior to the date of such 
termination.

18. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.  

    (a)   Legal Compliance.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the 
exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of such 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of such 
Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the 
approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

    (b)   Investment Representations.  As a condition to the exercise of an 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person 
exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant 
at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for 

                                     47
<PAGE>


investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares 
if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is 
required.

19. Inability to Obtain Authority.  The inability of the Company to obtain 
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is 
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and 
sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in 
respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite 
authority shall not have been obtained.

20. Reservation of Shares.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will 
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

21. Shareholder Approval.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the 
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan 
is adopted.  Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to 
the degree required under Applicable Laws.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim periods are not 
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These
 financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for 
the fiscal year ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 Form 10-K").

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 
("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share." In accordance with SFAS 128, primary 
earnings per share have been replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully 
diluted earnings per share have been replaced with diluted earnings per share 
which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and 
convertible securities. Prior periods have been presented to conform to SFAS 
128; however, as the Company had a net loss in the prior periods presented,
basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary loss per share 
previously reported.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the 
computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, 
except net income (loss) and per share amounts):

Note 3 - Restructuring Activities
In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a 
restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring profitability to the 
Company's operations. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased 
demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new 
strategic direction. These actions resulted in a net charge of $179 million 
after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996. During 
1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring 
actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a 
$217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those 
actions, including approximately $8 million of costs related to the termination
of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The combined restructuring 
actions consist of terminating approximately 3,600 full-time employees, 
approximately 3,300 of whom have been terminated from the second quarter of 
1996 through March 27, 1998, excluding employees who were hired by SCI 
Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's Fountain, 
Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center facility, 
respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of 
those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and equipment
to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various 
operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies 
that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring
actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $223 million and 
noncash asset write-downs of $60 million from the second quarter of 1996 
through March 27, 1998. During the third quarter of 1997 and the first and 
second quarters of 1998, the Company made adjustments to the categories and 
timing of expected restructure spending based on revised estimates. The 
Company expects that the remaining $113 million accrued balance as of March 
27, 1998 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $71 million over 
the next six months and $15 million thereafter. The Company expects that most 
of the contemplated restructuring actions related to the plan will be completed
during fiscal 1998 and will be financed through current working capital and, 
if necessary, short-term borrowings.

The following table depicts the restructuring activity through March 27, 1998:

Note 4 - Power Computing Asset Acquisition
On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets 
of Power Computing Corporation ("PCC"), a licensed distributor of the Mac OS 
operating system. In addition to the acquisition of certain assets such as 
PCC's customer database and the license to distribute the Mac OS, the Company 
has the right to retain certain key employees of PCC. The agreement with PCC 
also includes a release of claims between the parties. The total purchase 
price was approximately $110 million, of which $75 million was expensed in the 
fourth quarter of 1997 as "termination of license agreement" and $35 million 
was recorded as goodwill in the second quarter of 1998.  The goodwill will be 
amortized over three years.  The purchase price was comprised of approximately 
4.2 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at $80 million, 
forgiveness of $28 million of receivables due from PCC, and assumption by the 
Company of $2 million of certain customer support liabilities of PCC.  

Note 5 - Stock Option Exchange
In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's key 
employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option exchange 
program which allowed employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of 
their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of greater 
than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise price of 
$13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on December 19, 
1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in December 1997.  A 
total of 4.4 million options with a weighted-average exercise price of $20.01 
per share were exchanged for new options as a result of this program.

Note 6 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" which 
establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of software 
revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the Company to modify 
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not 
expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated results of operations.

Note 7 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the 
Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings 
and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing 
petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax 
adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of 
issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in 
dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations.

Note 8 - Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 1997 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation.

Note 9 - Subsequent Events
As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of 
ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom 
involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related 
technology.  On April 16, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of 
its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market. The 
Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign 
income taxes of approximately $23.4 million.  This amount will be recognized 
as other income in the third quarter of 1998.  Foreign income taxes on this 
gain are expected to be approximately $7.25 million. The Company's remaining 
investment in ARM will be increased in the third quarter of 1998 by 
approximately $16 million to a total of approximately $21 million to reflect 
its 25.9% ownership interest in the net book value of ARM following its 
initial public offering. The Company will continue to account for its 
investment in ARM using the equity method.  

The Company's cash and cash equivalents as of March 27, 1998 and September 
26, 1997 include $161 million and $165 million, respectively, pledged as 
collateral to support letters of credit primarily associated with the 
Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. On April 24, 1998, SCI 
notified the Company that certain performance measures defined within the 
letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company and, that effective as 
of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount pledged as collateral by
the Company to support the letter of credit will be reduced by $100 million. 
Should the Company fail to meet those performance measures in the future, it 
is possible that some or all of the letter of credit and supporting collateral 
would have to be reestablished.

Net Sales

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates and 
discounts. Net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 1998 were 
$1.4 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, decreases of 12% and 20%, 
respectively, over the corresponding periods in 1997. The decline in net sales 
is attributable to several factors. The Company experienced a $60 million 
decrease in net sales between the second quarter of 1998 and the same period 
in 1997 of certain imaging products the Company is discontinuing. In addition, 
between the second quarter of 1998 and the same period in 1997, there was a 
$223 million decline in revenues from the sale of PowerBooks due to stronger 
than usual sales of PowerBooks in the second quarter of 1997 related to new 
product introductions. Net sales in Asia were adversely affected primarily by 
the region's current economic problems, declining 31% or $250 million 
during the first six months of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997. 
Lastly, the average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net 
sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 
18% and 5%, respectively, between the second quarter and first six months of  
1998 compared to the corresponding periods in 1997 reflecting the effect of 
aggressive pricing on the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems introduced 
in 1998, the decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral 
products, and the overall industry trend towards lower-priced products.  The 
effect on net sales of these decreases were partially offset by an 8% increase 
in unit sales of Macintosh computer systems during the second quarter of 1998 
as compared to the same period in 1997.

Net sales decreased 11% in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the first 
quarter of 1998 primarily due to a decrease in the average revenue per 
Macintosh system. Also, the second quarter of each fiscal year has 
historically  been the Company's weakest due to lower demand from its 
consumer and education markets in that time frame. Unit sales of peripheral 
products decreased 45% in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the prior 
quarter reflecting the continuing phase-out of  certain peripheral products. 
The average revenue per Macintosh system decreased 13% in the second quarter 
of 1998 compared with the first quarter of 1998, primarily due to lower priced 
G3 Macintosh systems comprising a higher portion of total computer units 
shipped, the overall decline in peripheral unit sales, and in response to 
continuing industry wide pricing pressures. The effect on net sales of these 
decreases was partially offset by a 2% increase in total Macintosh computer 
system unit sales during the second quarter of 1998 compared to the prior 
quarter. Net sales for the current quarter were also positively affected by 
continued strong sales of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems, which 
accounted for approximately 51%of computer systems shipped during the second 
quarter of 1998 as compared to 21% of computer systems shipped during the 
prior quarter. In addition, net sales continued to be positively impacted 
through the Company's marketing of many of its products directly to end users 
in the U.S. through theCompany's on-line store, which opened in November 1997. 
The Company generated  $16 million in revenue from its on-line store during 
the second quarter of 1998. 


                                     13
<PAGE>

International sales for the three and six month periods in 1998 represented 
50% of consolidated net sales in each of the periods versus 49% and 53%, 
respectively, for the same periods in 1997. International net sales fell 11% 
in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the same period of 1997 primarily 
due to decreased revenue in the European and Japanese markets as a result of 
significant decreases in the average revenue per Macintosh system and in 
peripheral unit sales, partially offset by increases in unit sales of 
Macintosh systems. Domestic net sales declined 13% in the second quarter of 
1998 over the comparable period of 1997 also due to decreases in the average 
revenue per Macintosh system and in peripheral unit sales, partially offset 
by increases in unit sales of Macintosh systems

The Company does not currently anticipate significant sequential quarterly 
revenue growth before the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, and year-over-year 
revenue growth is not expected before the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The 
foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's actual results could 
differ because of several factors, including those set forth below in the 
subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition".

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales during the second quarter and 
the first six months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, 
and increased during the second quarter of 1998 from 22% to 25% of sales 
compared to the first quarter of 1998. These increases were primarily a result 
of a shift in revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh 
G3 systems as well as benefits derived from new distribution channel policies.

The Company believes gross margins of at least 23% are sustainable through 
the end of fiscal 1998. The foregoing statement is forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect 
Future Results and Financial Condition".

There can be no assurance that current gross margin levels will be maintained. 
In general, gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due 
to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing 
pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential 
changes to the Company's product mix. In response to these downward 
pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with 
respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's 
ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to 
stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy 
and pricing take into account changes in foreign currency exchange rates over 
time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly 
affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the second quarter and the first six months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and decreased in amount 
during the second quarter of 1998 compared with the first quarter of 1998. 
These reductions are due to various restructuring actions which resulted in 
reductions in headcount and cancellation of certain research and development 
projects. 

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the second quarter and the first six months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and decreased in amount 
but remained relatively comparable as a percentage of sales during the second 
quarter of 1998 compared to the first quarter of 1998. These decreases are due 
to various restructuring actions which resulted in reductions in headcount, 
the closing of facilities, the write-down of assets, and changes to 
distribution channel policies.

Special Charges

During the second quarter of 1997, the Company recognized a $375 million 
charge for in-process research and development in connection with the 
acquisition of NeXT and a $155 million charge for restructuring costs. For 
further information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, see Note 3 
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the Company's 
debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for using the 
equity method, certain foreign exchange gains and losses and other 
miscellaneous income and expense items.

As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of 
ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United 
Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and 
related technology.  On April 16, 1998, ARM completed an initial public 
offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National 
Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before 
foreign income taxes of approximately $23.4 million.  This amount will be 
recognized as other income in the third quarter of fiscal 1998. The Company 
will continue to account for its investment in ARM using the equity method.




                                     15

Provision for Income Taxes

The Company's tax rate was 3.8% for the first six months of 1998. The tax 
provision for this period consisted entirely of foreign taxes. The Company 
expects to recognize in the third quarter approximately $7.25 million of 
foreign income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of ARM shares.

As of March 27, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $691 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of March 27, 1998, a valuation allowance of $209 million was recorded 
against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not 
be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset 
representing tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's 
ability to generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. 
Management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. 
income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax 
planning strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior 
to their expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, 
there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of 
future U.S. taxable income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets 
considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates 
of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company 
will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 
increased to $1,823 million as of March 27, 1998, from $1,459 million as of 
September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of 
March 27, 1998 and September 26, 1997 include $161 million and $165 
million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit 
primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the terms 
of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI.
On April 24, 1998, SCI notified the Company that certain performance measures 
defined within the letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company and 
that effective as of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount pledged 
as collateral by the Company to support the letter of credit will be reduced 
by $100 million.  Should the Company fail to meet those performance measures 
in the future, it is possible that some or all of the letter of credit and 
supporting collateral would have to be reestablished.

Cash generated by operations during the first six months of 1998 totaled $296 
million. Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of positive 
earnings and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially 
offset by  decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

                                     16
<PAGE>

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $12 
million in the first six months of 1998, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing machinery and equipment. The Company expects that the level 
of capital expenditures in the second half of 1998 will be consistent with the 
first half.

 The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments balances, and ability, if necessary, to effect other short-term 
borrowings, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next 
twelve months. Expected cash requirements over the next twelve months include
an estimated $86 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, most 
of which will be effected during 1998. No assurance can be given that any 
additional required financing could be obtained should the restructuring plan 
take longer to implement than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company 
is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, 
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. The company's senior and subordinated long-term debt 
ratings remain B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's Rating 
Agency, and B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services.  Both 
rating agencies continue to have the Company on negative outlook.  These 
actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in future periods, require 
the Company to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of its 
letters of credit and require the Company to agree to more stringent debt 
covenants than in the past.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a 
number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In 
addition to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are 
many factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which 
may cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The
Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon 
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued competitive 
pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; risks 
associated with international operations, including economic and labor 
conditions, political instability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; 


                                     17
<PAGE>

increasing dependence on third-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced 
functions such as logistics; the availability of key components on terms 
acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of certain components 
essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from 
sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by 
and obtained from IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products 
in certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely 
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate the technologies of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT"), which 
was acquired in 1997; the Company's ability to successfully implement its 
strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; 
the effects of significant adverse publicity; the availability of third-party 
software for particular applications; the effect of year 2000 compliance 
issues; the Company's ability to successfully replace its existing transaction 
systems in the U.S.; and the impact on the Company's sales, market share and 
gross margins as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing 
program.   

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" 
in the Company's 1997 Form 10-K.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period

EXHIBIT 10.A.50		

                             Apple Computer, Inc.

                       1997 Director Stock Option Plan

                         (Effective as of August 5, 1997)







































                                     23
<PAGE>



                             Apple Computer, Inc.

                       1997 Director Stock Option Plan

1.  Purposes.    The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services 
of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as 
members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the 
incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals 
by granting such individuals Options to purchase shares of Common Stock.

2.  Administration.   The Administrator will be responsible for 
administering the Plan. The Administrator will have authority to adopt such 
rules as it may deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan, and 
shall have authority to interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan and 
any agreements and notices under the Plan and to make determinations 
pursuant to any Plan provision. Each interpretation, determination or other 
action made or taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final 
and binding on all persons. The Administrator shall not be liable for any 
action or determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to 
indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company's 
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws as such documents may be amended from 
time to time.

3.  Shares Available.

Subject to the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Plan, the maximum 
number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan shall 
not exceed 400,000 shares (the "Section 3 Limit"').  Either authorized and 
unissued shares of Common Stock or treasury shares may be delivered 
pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of determining the number of shares that 
remain available for issuance under the Plan, the following rules shall apply:

    (a)   the number of shares of Common Stock underlying Options 
shall be charged against the Section 3 Limit; and
			
    (b)   the Section 3 Limit shall be increased by (i) the number of 
shares subject to an Option which lapses, expires or is otherwise terminated 
without the issuance of such shares, and (ii) the number of shares, if any, 
tendered to pay the exercise price of an  Option.

4.  Options.  Each Non-Employee Director shall receive grants of 
Options under the Plan as follows

    (a)   Option Grants.





                                      24

<PAGE>


         (i)  Initial Grants.   Non-Employee Directors who were members 
of the Board on the day prior to the Effective Date shall be granted an 
Initial Option to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock as of August 
14, 1997 ("Initial Grant Date"), provided that such individual continues to 
serve as a Non-Employee Director through the Initial Grant Date. Non-
Employee Director who were elected or appointed to  the Board on the 
Effective Date  an Initial Option to purchase 30,000 shares of Common 
Stock on the Initial Grant Due, provided  that such individual continues to 
serve as a Non-Employee Director through the Initial Grant Date. Non-
Employee Directors who are elected or appointed to the Board after the 
Effective Date shall be granted an Initial Option to purchase 30,000 shares 
of Common Stock as of the date of their election or appointment to the 
Board. The provisions of this Section 4(a)(i) shall not apply to any 
member of the Board who first becomes a Non-Employee Director by 
reason of such member's ceasing to be an employee of the Company and 
its Subsidiaries.

        (ii)  Annual Grants.   Each Non-Employee Director shall receive 
an Annual Option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock on the 
fourth anniversary of the Non-Employee Director's initial election or 
appointment to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereof, 
provided  that the individual has remained in continuous service as a 
director of the Company through such anniversary date and is a Non-
Employee Director on the applicable anniversary date.

    (b)   Exercise Period.   The per share exercise price of each Option 
shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of 
grant of the Option determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

    (c)   Vesting.     Initial Options shall vest and become exercisable in 
annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the 
date of grant, provided  that the Non-Employee Director has remained in 
continuous service as a director of the Company through each such anniversary 
date. Annual Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their
date of grant.

    (d)   Term of Options.

         (i)  Ten-Year Term.   Each Option shall expire ten (10) years from 
its date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.

        (ii)  Exercise Following Termination of Service Due to Death.  If 
a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of 
such Non-Employee Director's death, the Options granted to such Non-
Employee Director may be exercised by such Non-Employee Director's 

Beneficiary, but only to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time 
of the Non-Employee Director's death, at any time within three (3) years 
alter the date of such termination of service, subject to the earlier 
expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 4(d)(i) above. At the 

                                      25
<PAGE>
end of such three-year period, the vested portion of the Option shall 
expire. The unvested portion of the Option shall expire on the date of the 
Non-Employee Director's death.

       (iii)  Termination of Options if a Non-Employee Director is 
Removed from the Board for Cause.  In the event a Non-Employee 
Director is removed from the Board for "cause," all Options granted to 
such Non-Employee Director (whether or not then vested and 
exercisable) shall immediately terminate and be of no further force and 
effect as of the effective date of such removal from the Board. Whether a 
Non-Employee Director is removed by the Board for "cause" shall be 
determined by the Board in accordance with the By-Laws of the 
Company.

        (iv)  Exercise Following Other Terminations of Service.    If a Non-
Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason 
other than death or removal from the Board for cause, the Options 
granted to such Non-Employee Director may be exercised by such Non-
Employee Director, but only to the extent the Option was exercisable at 
the time of the Non-Employee Director's termination, at any time within 
ninety (90) days after the date of such termination of service, subject to the 
earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 4(d)(i) above. 
At the end of such ninety-day period, the vested portion of the Option 
shall expire. The unvested portion of the Option shall expire on the date 
of the Non-Employee Director's termination of service with the Board.

    (e)   Time and Manner of Exercise of Options.

         (i)  Notice of Exercise.    Subject to the other terms and conditions 
hereof, a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Option, to the extent 
such Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the 
Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be 
exercisable for a fractional share. The date of exercise of an Option shall 
be the later of (A) the date on which the Company receives such written 
notice and (B) the date on which the conditions provided in Section 
4(e)(ii) are satisfied.

        (ii)  Method of Payment.  The consideration to be paid for the 
shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A) cash, (B) 
check, (C) other shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of 
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares as to which 
the Option shall be exercised and which have been owned by the Non-
Employee Director for at least six (6) months at the time of exercise, (D) 
delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable
instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount 
of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E) any combination of 
the foregoing methods of payment.

       (iii)  Stockholder Rights.   A Non-Employee Director shall have 
no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock 
issuable upon exercise of an Option until a certificate evidencing such 

                                      26
<PAGE>

shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to 
Section 4(e)(v), and no adjustment shall be made for dividends or 
distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record 
date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall 
become the holder of record thereof.

        (iv)  Limitation on Exercise.    No Option shall be exercisable 
unless the Common Stock subject thereto has been registered under the 
Securities Act and qualified under applicable state "blue sky" laws in 
connection with the offer and sale thereof, or the Company has 
determined that an exemption from registration under the Securities Act 
and from qualification wider such state "blue sky" laws is available.

         (v)  Issuance of Shares.    Subject to the foregoing conditions, as 
soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of 
exercise and payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of 
shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall 
deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee 
Director's death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the 
principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be 
acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such 
Beneficiary), one or more stock certificates for the appropriate number of 
shares of Common Stock Issued in connection with such exercise. Shares 
sold in connection with a "cashless exercise" described in clause C of 
Section 4(e)(ii) shall be delivered to the broker referred to therein in 
accordance with the procedures established by the Company from time to 
time.

    (f)   Restrictions on Transfer. An Option may not be transferred, 
pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of 
descent and distribution; provided, however,  that an Option may be 
transferred to a Non-Employee Director's family members or to one or more 
trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such 
family members. The Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee 
Director's lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or 
entity to whom  the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous 
sentence. No assignment or transfer of the Option, or of the rights 
represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or 
otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest 
in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Option, but 
immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Option the same shall 
terminate and be of no force or effect.

5.  Designation of Beneficiary.	 
	
    (a)   Beneficiary Designations.    Each Non-Employee Director 
may designate a Beneficiary to exercise an Option upon the Non-Employee 
Director's death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form.


                                      27
<PAGE>

    (b)   Change of Beneficiary Designation.    A Non-Employee 
Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later 
Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator. The 
execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the 
Administrator will revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.

6.  Change in Control.

Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event 
of a Change in Control of the Company, the following provisions shall apply:

    (a)   Any Options outstanding as of the date such Change in 
Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable and vested 
on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested.

    (b)   The value of all outstanding Options (to the extent not 
previously exercised) shall be cashed out on the date of the Change in 
Control. The amount at which such Options shall be cashed out shall be equal 
to the excess, if any, of (i) the Change in Control Price over (ii) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option. The cash-out 
proceeds shall be paid to the Non-Employee Director or, in the event of death 
of the Non-Employee Director prior to payment, to the Beneficiary thereof.

    (c)   If the Administrator shall receive an opinion from a nationally 
recognized firm of accountants to the Company that the cash-out provisions in 
Section 6(b) above with respect to Options will prohibit the utilization of 
"pooling of interests" accounting in connection with the transaction resulting
in the Change in Control of the Company, then the following shall apply, but
only to the extent necessary to permit such accounting treatment: (i) the 
provisions of Section 6(b) shall not apply to the Options, (ii) each such 
Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable as of the date such
opinion is received by the Administrator, and (iii) the Administrator shall 
promptly inform each Non-Employee Director of such opinion and of the 
accelerated vesting and exercisability of the Option sufficiently prior to the 
anticipated date of the Change in Control, so as to permit the Option to be 
exercised prior to the date of the Change in Control.

7.  Recapitalization or Reorganization.

    (a)   Authority of the Company and Shareholders.   The existence 
of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the 
Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize any 
adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's 
capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, 
any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of 
bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are 
superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof or which are 
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the dissolution or 
liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its 
assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a 
similar character or otherwise.

<PAGE>

    (b)   Change in Capitalization.  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of the Plan, in the event of any change in the outstanding Common 
Stock by reason of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, 
consolidation,  stock split, combination or exchange of shares (a "change in 
Capitalization"),  (i) such proportionate adjustments as may be necessary (in 
the form determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) to reflect 
such change shall be made to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of 
Non-Employee Directors under the Plan with respect to tile aggregate number of 
shares of Common Stock authorized to be awarded under the Plan, the number 
of shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Option and the 
exercise prices in respect thereof and the number of shares of Common Stock 
covered by future Option grants and (ii) the Administrator may make such 
other adjustments, consistent with the foregoing, as it deems appropriate in 
its sole discretion.

    (c)   Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed 
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each outstanding Option will vest 
and become exercisable on a date prior to the consummation of the proposed 
action that is reasonably sufficient to enable the Non-Employee Directors to 
exercise their Options.

8.  Termination and Amendment of the Plan.

    (a)   Termination.   The Plan shall terminate on the tenth 
anniversary of the Effective Date, Following such date, no further grants of 
Options shall be made pursuant to the Plan.

    (b)   General Power of Board.   Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time terminate, 
modify, suspend or amend the Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that 
no such termination, modification, suspension or amendment shall be effective 
without shareholder approval if such approval is required to comply with any 
applicable law or stock exchange rule; and provided further, that the Board 
may not, without shareholder approval, increase the maximum number of shares 
issuable under the Plan except as provided in Section 7(b) above.
	
    (c)   When Non-Employee Directors' Consents Required.   The 
Board may not alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan without the consent 
of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely 
affect his or her rights with respect to Options that have previously been 
granted.

9.  Miscellaneous.

    (a)   No Right to Reelection.   Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed 
to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any of its 
members for reelection by the Company's stockholders, nor confer upon any 
Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board for any 
period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation

                                    29
<PAGE>

    (b)   Securities Law Restrictions.   The Administrator may require 
each Non-Employee Director purchasing or acquiring shares of Common Stock 
pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-
Employee Director is acquiring the shares for investment and not with a view 
to the distribution thereof. All certificates for shares of Common Stock 
delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and 
other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules,
regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, 
and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Administrator may 
cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make 
appropriate reference to such restrictions. No shares of Common Stock shall be 
issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such 
issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all 
applicable federal and state securities laws.

    (c)   Expenses.    The costs and expenses of administering the Plan 
shall be borne by the Company.

    (d)   Applicable Law.   Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan 
and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to 
conflicts of law principles.

    (e)   Effective Date.   The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective 
Date, subject to the approval thereof by the stockholders of the Company by no

                       1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN


1.  Purposes of the Plan.  The purposes of this Stock Plan are:

      to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of 
      substantial responsibility, 

      to provide additional incentive to the Chairman and/or Executive 
      Officers, and 

      to promote the success of the Company's business.  

  Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options (as defined 
under  Section 422 of the Code) or Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by
the Administrator at the time of grant.  Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may
be granted under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of 
Options.  Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

2.  Definitions. As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

    administering the Plan, in accordance with Section 4 of the Plan.

    administration of stock option plans under U. S. state corporate laws, U.S.
    federal and state securities laws, the Code, any stock exchange or

    shall not be considered interrupted in the case of medical leave, military 
    leave, family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the 
    Administrator, provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in 
    termination as Chairman with the Company.   Neither service as a Director

    the employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the 
    case may be, under the terms of the respective Company policy for such 
    leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers between locations of the Company or

    Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety days, unless 
    reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or 
    contract.  If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved 
    by the Company is not so guaranteed, on the 91st day of such leave any 
    Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as an
    Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a Non-
    statutory Stock Option.  Neither service as a Chairman nor as a Director

    The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Administrator deems

    criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, 
    and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in 
    each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, 
    shall determine;

        (vi)  to reduce the exercise price of any Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market

    having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.  
    The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on

may be granted to the Chairman and Executive Officers or to such other 
individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has offered a 
position of Chairman or Executive Officer.  Incentive Stock Options may be 
granted only to Executive Officers.  

6.  Limitations.

    (a)   Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an 
    Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  However, 
    notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair 
    Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options 
    are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year
    (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds 
    $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  
    For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken 
    into account in the order in which they were granted.  The Fair Market 
    Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with 
    respect to such Shares is granted.

    (b)   Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall 
    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the 
    Optionee's relationship as an Employee with the Company, nor shall they 
    interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to 
    terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.

    (c)   The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options and SARs:

         (i)  No participant shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the 
    Company, Options to purchase more than 17,000,000 Shares.

                                     38
<PAGE>

        (ii)  The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in 
    connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in 
    Section 15. 

       (iii)  If an Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the 
    Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a 
    transaction described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted 
    against the limits set forth in subsections (i) above.  For this purpose, 
    if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction will 
    be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a new 
    Option or SAR.

7.  Term of Plan.  Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, the Plan shall become 
effective upon its adoption by the Board.  It shall continue in effect for a 
term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 16 of the Plan.

8.  Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be stated in the Agreement.
In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10) years from
the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Agreement. 
Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, 
at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more
than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of 
stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive 
Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter 
term as may be provided in the Agreement.
	
9.  Option Exercise Price and Consideration.

    (a)  Exercise Price.  The per share exercise price for the Shares to be 
issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the 
Administrator, subject to the following:

         (i)  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option

           (A)  granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock 
    Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) 
    of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent 
    or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of 
    the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

           (B)  granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in 
    paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall be no 
    less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

        (ii)  In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share 
    exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator.  In the case of a 
    Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based 
    compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per 
    Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value 
    per Share on the date of grant.

                                     39

<PAGE>

       (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per 
    Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share 
    on the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a 
    merger or other corporate transaction.

    (b)   Waiting Period and Exercise Dates.  At the time an Option is 
granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be 
exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before 
the Option may be exercised. 

    (c)   Form of Consideration.  The Administrator shall determine the 
acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the 
method of payment.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator
shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant.  
Such consideration may consist entirely of:

         (i)  cash;

        (ii)  check;

       (iii)  promissory note;
		    
        (iv)	 other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon 
    exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six 
    months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the 
    date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as 
    to which said Option shall be exercised;

         (v)  consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise 
    program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

        (vi)  a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the 
    Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's 
    participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or 
    arrangement;

       (vii)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

       (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance 
    of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

10. Stock Appreciation Rights.

    (a)   Granted in Connection with Options.  At the sole discretion of the 
Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of an 
Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time 
thereafter during the term of the Option.  The following provisions apply to 
SARs that are granted in connection with Options:


                                     40
<PAGE>


         (i)  The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by 
    surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.  
    The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal 
    to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the 
    SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related 
    Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the 
    surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
  

    the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon 
    exercise of an SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict 
    the exercisability of the related Option;

        (ii)  When a SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent 
    surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable;

       (iii)  A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that 
    the related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date 
    on which the related Option expires; and

        (iv)  A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market 
    Value of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the 
    exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.
 
    (b)   Independent SARs.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator, SARs 
may be granted without related Options.  The following provisions apply to 
SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

         (i)  The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to 
    receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair 
    Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the 
    SAR, as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of 
    the Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the 
    date on which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the 
    Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon 
    exercise of a SAR; and

        (ii)  SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as 
    the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement. 

    (c)  Form of Payment.  The Company's obligation arising upon the exercise 
of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination of 
Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may 
determine.  Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall be valued at their 
Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

    (d)   Rule 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional 
restrictions as may be required to be contained in the plan or SAR agreement in 
order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.


                                     41
<PAGE>

11.	Exercise of Option or SAR.

    (a)  Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder. Any Option or SAR
granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and
at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator 
and set forth in the Agreement.  An Option may not be exercised for a fraction 
of a Share.

    An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: 
(i)  written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms of 
the Option or SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR, and 
(ii)  full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is 
exercised.  Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment
authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Agreement and the Plan.  
Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the 
Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his 
or her spouse.  Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate 
entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the
Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a 
shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding 
the exercise of the Option.  The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) 
such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised.  No adjustment will be 
made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the 
date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

    Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares 
thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the 
Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  Exercise 
of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised, result in a 
decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be available for 
purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be exercisable to the extent 
it has been exercised.
		
    (b)  Termination of Continuous Status as Chairman.   Upon termination of 
an Optionee's Continuous Status as Chairman (other than termination by reason 
of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days 
after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the 
extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised 
after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

    (c)   Termination of Continuous Employment.   Upon termination of an 
Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason of 
the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days 
after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the 
extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised 
after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

                                     42
<PAGE>		
    (d)  Death of Optionee.  If an Optionee dies (i) while an Employee or 
Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months 
(or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined 
by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or 
by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or 
inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have 
accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated his or her employment 
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months 
as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death; or (ii) within 
ninety (90) days after the termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or 
Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within six (6) 
months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as 
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's
estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by 
bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that 
had accrued at the date of termination.  If the Option or SAR is not so 
exercised within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, 
and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be 
exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms 
due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

    (e)  Buyout Provisions.  The Administrator may at any time offer to buy 
out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option or SAR previously granted based 
on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and 
communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

12. Stock Purchase Rights.

    (a)   Rights to Purchase.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either 
alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan 
and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan.  After the Administrator 
determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall 
advise the offeree in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions and 
restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the 
offeree shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the time 
within which the offeree must accept such offer.  The offer shall be accepted 
by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the Administrator.

    (b)   Repurchase Option.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, 
the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon the 
voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the 
Company for any reason (including death or Disability).  The purchase price for 
Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall be the original price paid 
by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the 
purchaser to the Company.  The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate 
determined by the Administrator.

    (c)   Other Provisions.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms, 
provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined 
by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 
                                     43
<PAGE>
    (d)  Rights as a Shareholder.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is 
exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a 
shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered 
upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company.  No 
adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record 
date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as 
provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

13.  Transferability of Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights.  Unless 
determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase 
Right may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or 
disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or 
distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by 
the Code or Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and may be 
exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.  If the 
Administrator makes an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall contain such additional terms and 
conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.

14.  Stock Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax Obligations.   When an 
Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option, 
SAR or Stock Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax withholding 
under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay the Company an 
amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may 
satisfy the withholding tax obligation (including, at the election of the 
Optionee, any additional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in 
order to satisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax in 
connection with the exercise) by electing to have the Company withhold from 
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to be 
issued upon exercise of the SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if any, that number 
of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be 
withheld (and any additional amount desired to be withheld, as aforesaid). The 
Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date 
that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined (the "Tax Date").

    All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose 
shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall 
be subject to the following restrictions:

         (i)  the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax 
    Date; and
        (ii)	 all elections shall be subject to the consent or disapproval of 
    the Administrator.

    In the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an 
Optionee and the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because 
no election is filed under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall 
receive the full number of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right is exercised but such Optionee shall be 
unconditionally obligated to tender back to the Company the proper 
number of Shares on the Tax Date.

                                     44

15.  Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger or Asset 
Sale. 

    (a)   Changes in Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by the 
shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by 
each outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of shares 
of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as 
to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been granted or 
which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price per share of Common 
Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, 
shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number 
of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock 
split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or 
any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock 
effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, 
that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be 
deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."  Such 
adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect 
shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided herein, 
no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities 
convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment 
by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares 
of Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.

    (b)  Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the proposed dissolution
or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
Rights  will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed 
action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.  The Administrator 
may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that 
any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right  shall terminate as of a date fixed by 
the Administrator and give each Optionee the right to exercise his or her 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
would not otherwise be exercisable.

    (c)  Merger or Asset Sale.  Unless otherwise determined by the 
Administrator, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another 
corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,
each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an 
equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a 
Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.  In the event that the 
successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to 
exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or 
exercisable.  If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested 
and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger 
or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in writing or 
electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully 

                                     45
<PAGE>
vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such 
notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the 
expiration of such period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option, 
SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered assumed if, following the 
merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or 
receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the 
consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received 
in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held 
on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice 
of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration 
received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the 
successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent 
of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received 
upon the exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for each Share 
of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, to be 
solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair 
market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common 
Stock in the merger or sale of assets.

    (d)   Change in Control.  In the event of a "Change in Control" of the 
Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by the 
Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following 
acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

         (i)	 Any Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding 
    as of the date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred that 
    are not yet exercisable and vested on such date shall become fully 
    exercisable and vested; and

        (ii)	 The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
    Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or after 
    grant, be cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options, SARs and Stock 
    Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of (x) 
    the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the exercise price 
    of the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.  
    The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, in the event of 
    death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate of the Optionee or to 
    a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right by bequest or inheritance.

    (e)   Definition of "Change in Control".  For purposes of this Section 14, 
a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

         (i)	 When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 14(d) 
    and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a 
    Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting 
    as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 
    under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the 
    Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting 
    power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or
                                     46
<PAGE>

        (ii)	 The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval, 
    and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
    Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

    (f)   Change in Control Price.  For purposes of this Section 14, "Change in 
Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the highest 
Fair Market Value at any time within the 60-day period immediately preceding 
the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the Administrator 
(the "60-Day Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered, as determined
by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer related 
to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time within the 60-Day Period.

16. Date of Grant.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the 
determination granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other 
later date as is determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the determination 
shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of 
such grant.

17. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

    (a)   Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at any time amend, alter, 
suspend or terminate the Plan.  

    (b)   Shareholder Approval.  The Company shall obtain shareholder approval 
of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with 
Applicable Laws. 

    (c)   Effect of Amendment or Termination.  No amendment, alteration, 
suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee, 
unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, 
which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company. 
Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to 
exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right granted under the Plan prior to the date of such 
termination.

18. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.  

    (a)   Legal Compliance.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the 
exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of such 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of such 
Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the 
approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

    (b)   Investment Representations.  As a condition to the exercise of an 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person 
exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant 
at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for 

                                     47
<PAGE>


investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares 
if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is 
required.

19. Inability to Obtain Authority.  The inability of the Company to obtain 
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is 
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and 
sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in 
respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite 
authority shall not have been obtained.

20. Reservation of Shares.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will 
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

21. Shareholder Approval.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the 
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan 
is adopted.  Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to 
the degree required under Applicable Laws.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the Company's 
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim results 
have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless 
specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited). The results for interim periods are not 
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These
 financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the 
Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for 
the fiscal year ended September 26, 1997, included in its Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 1997 (the "1997 Form 10-K").

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 
("SFAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share." In accordance with SFAS 128, primary 
earnings per share have been replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully 
diluted earnings per share have been replaced with diluted earnings per share 
which includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and 
convertible securities. Prior periods have been presented to conform to SFAS 
128; however, as the Company had a net loss in the prior periods presented,
basic and diluted loss per share are the same as the primary loss per share 
previously reported.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common 
shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of 
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive 
potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the 
treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is 
reflected using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the 
computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, 
except net income (loss) and per share amounts):

The Company has outstanding $661 million of unsecured convertible subordinated 
notes (the "Notes") which are convertible by their holders into approximately 
22.6 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $29.205 per share 
subject to the adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. The common 
shares represented by these Notes were not included in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share for the periods presented because the effect of 
using the if-converted method would be anti-dilutive. For additional 
disclosures regarding the outstanding preferred stock, employee stock options 
and the Notes, see the 1997 Form 10-K.

Note 3 - Restructuring Activities
In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a 
restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring profitability to the 
Company's operations. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased 
demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new 
strategic direction. These actions resulted in a net charge of $179 million 
after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 1996. During 
1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring 
actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a 
$217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those 
actions, including approximately $8 million of costs related to the termination
of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. The combined restructuring 
actions consist of terminating approximately 3,600 full-time employees, 
approximately 3,300 of whom have been terminated from the second quarter of 
1996 through March 27, 1998, excluding employees who were hired by SCI 
Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's Fountain, 
Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data center facility, 
respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of 
those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and equipment
to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various 
operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies 
that are not central to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring
actions under the plan have resulted in cash expenditures of $223 million and 
noncash asset write-downs of $60 million from the second quarter of 1996 
through March 27, 1998. During the third quarter of 1997 and the first and 
second quarters of 1998, the Company made adjustments to the categories and 
timing of expected restructure spending based on revised estimates. The 
Company expects that the remaining $113 million accrued balance as of March 
27, 1998 will result in cash expenditures of approximately $71 million over 
the next six months and $15 million thereafter. The Company expects that most 
of the contemplated restructuring actions related to the plan will be completed
during fiscal 1998 and will be financed through current working capital and, 
if necessary, short-term borrowings.

The following table depicts the restructuring activity through March 27, 1998:

Note 4 - Power Computing Asset Acquisition
On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets 
of Power Computing Corporation ("PCC"), a licensed distributor of the Mac OS 
operating system. In addition to the acquisition of certain assets such as 
PCC's customer database and the license to distribute the Mac OS, the Company 
has the right to retain certain key employees of PCC. The agreement with PCC 
also includes a release of claims between the parties. The total purchase 
price was approximately $110 million, of which $75 million was expensed in the 
fourth quarter of 1997 as "termination of license agreement" and $35 million 
was recorded as goodwill in the second quarter of 1998.  The goodwill will be 
amortized over three years.  The purchase price was comprised of approximately 
4.2 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at $80 million, 
forgiveness of $28 million of receivables due from PCC, and assumption by the 
Company of $2 million of certain customer support liabilities of PCC.  

Note 5 - Stock Option Exchange
In order to address concerns regarding the retention of the Company's key 
employees, in December 1997 the Board of Directors approved an option exchange 
program which allowed employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of 
their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price of greater 
than $13.6875 on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise price of 
$13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on December 19, 
1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in December 1997.  A 
total of 4.4 million options with a weighted-average exercise price of $20.01 
per share were exchanged for new options as a result of this program.

Note 6 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" which 
establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of software 
revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 1997 and may require the Company to modify 
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not 
expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated results of operations.

Note 7 - Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the 
Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings 
and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition or results of operations.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing 
petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute 
have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax 
adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of 
issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in 
dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations.

Note 8 - Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 1997 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation.

Note 9 - Subsequent Events
As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of 
ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United Kingdom 
involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related 
technology.  On April 16, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of 
its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market. The 
Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign 
income taxes of approximately $23.4 million.  This amount will be recognized 
as other income in the third quarter of 1998.  Foreign income taxes on this 
gain are expected to be approximately $7.25 million. The Company's remaining 
investment in ARM will be increased in the third quarter of 1998 by 
approximately $16 million to a total of approximately $21 million to reflect 
its 25.9% ownership interest in the net book value of ARM following its 
initial public offering. The Company will continue to account for its 
investment in ARM using the equity method.  

The Company's cash and cash equivalents as of March 27, 1998 and September 
26, 1997 include $161 million and $165 million, respectively, pledged as 
collateral to support letters of credit primarily associated with the 
Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. On April 24, 1998, SCI 
notified the Company that certain performance measures defined within the 
letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company and, that effective as 
of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount pledged as collateral by
the Company to support the letter of credit will be reduced by $100 million. 
Should the Company fail to meet those performance measures in the future, it 
is possible that some or all of the letter of credit and supporting collateral 
would have to be reestablished.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations 

This section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking 
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results

Net Sales

Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates and 
discounts. Net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 1998 were 
$1.4 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, decreases of 12% and 20%, 
respectively, over the corresponding periods in 1997. The decline in net sales 
is attributable to several factors. The Company experienced a $60 million 
decrease in net sales between the second quarter of 1998 and the same period 
in 1997 of certain imaging products the Company is discontinuing. In addition, 
between the second quarter of 1998 and the same period in 1997, there was a 
$223 million decline in revenues from the sale of PowerBooks due to stronger 
than usual sales of PowerBooks in the second quarter of 1997 related to new 
product introductions. Net sales in Asia were adversely affected primarily by 
the region's current economic problems, declining 31% or $250 million 
during the first six months of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997. 
Lastly, the average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net 
sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales, fell 
18% and 5%, respectively, between the second quarter and first six months of  
1998 compared to the corresponding periods in 1997 reflecting the effect of 
aggressive pricing on the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems introduced 
in 1998, the decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral 
products, and the overall industry trend towards lower-priced products.  The 
effect on net sales of these decreases were partially offset by an 8% increase 
in unit sales of Macintosh computer systems during the second quarter of 1998 
as compared to the same period in 1997.

Net sales decreased 11% in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the first 
quarter of 1998 primarily due to a decrease in the average revenue per 
Macintosh system. Also, the second quarter of each fiscal year has 
historically  been the Company's weakest due to lower demand from its 
consumer and education markets in that time frame. Unit sales of peripheral 
products decreased 45% in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the prior 
quarter reflecting the continuing phase-out of  certain peripheral products. 
The average revenue per Macintosh system decreased 13% in the second quarter 
of 1998 compared with the first quarter of 1998, primarily due to lower priced 
G3 Macintosh systems comprising a higher portion of total computer units 
shipped, the overall decline in peripheral unit sales, and in response to 
continuing industry wide pricing pressures. The effect on net sales of these 
decreases was partially offset by a 2% increase in total Macintosh computer 
system unit sales during the second quarter of 1998 compared to the prior 
quarter. Net sales for the current quarter were also positively affected by 
continued strong sales of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems, which 
accounted for approximately 51%of computer systems shipped during the second 
quarter of 1998 as compared to 21% of computer systems shipped during the 
prior quarter. In addition, net sales continued to be positively impacted 
through the Company's marketing of many of its products directly to end users 
in the U.S. through theCompany's on-line store, which opened in November 1997. 
The Company generated  $16 million in revenue from its on-line store during 
the second quarter of 1998. 


                                     13
<PAGE>

International sales for the three and six month periods in 1998 represented 
50% of consolidated net sales in each of the periods versus 49% and 53%, 
respectively, for the same periods in 1997. International net sales fell 11% 
in the second quarter of 1998 compared with the same period of 1997 primarily 
due to decreased revenue in the European and Japanese markets as a result of 
significant decreases in the average revenue per Macintosh system and in 
peripheral unit sales, partially offset by increases in unit sales of 
Macintosh systems. Domestic net sales declined 13% in the second quarter of 
1998 over the comparable period of 1997 also due to decreases in the average 
revenue per Macintosh system and in peripheral unit sales, partially offset 
by increases in unit sales of Macintosh systems

The Company does not currently anticipate significant sequential quarterly 
revenue growth before the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, and year-over-year 
revenue growth is not expected before the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The 
foregoing statements are forward looking. The Company's actual results could 
differ because of several factors, including those set forth below in the 
subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition".

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales during the second quarter and 
the first six months of 1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997, 
and increased during the second quarter of 1998 from 22% to 25% of sales 
compared to the first quarter of 1998. These increases were primarily a result 
of a shift in revenue mix towards the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh 
G3 systems as well as benefits derived from new distribution channel policies.

The Company believes gross margins of at least 23% are sustainable through 
the end of fiscal 1998. The foregoing statement is forward looking. The 
Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including 
those set forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect 
Future Results and Financial Condition".

There can be no assurance that current gross margin levels will be maintained. 
In general, gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due 
to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing 
pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, and potential 
changes to the Company's product mix. In response to these downward 
pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with 
respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's 
ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to 
stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy 
and pricing take into account changes in foreign currency exchange rates over 
time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly 
affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the second quarter and the first six months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and decreased in amount 
during the second quarter of 1998 compared with the first quarter of 1998. 
These reductions are due to various restructuring actions which resulted in 
reductions in headcount and cancellation of certain research and development 
projects. 

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a 
percentage of net sales during the second quarter and the first six months of 
1998 compared to the corresponding periods of 1997 and decreased in amount 
but remained relatively comparable as a percentage of sales during the second 
quarter of 1998 compared to the first quarter of 1998. These decreases are due 
to various restructuring actions which resulted in reductions in headcount, 
the closing of facilities, the write-down of assets, and changes to 
distribution channel policies.

Special Charges

During the second quarter of 1997, the Company recognized a $375 million 
charge for in-process research and development in connection with the 
acquisition of NeXT and a $155 million charge for restructuring costs. For 
further information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, see Note 3 
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net

Interest and other income (expense), net, is comprised of interest income on 
the Company's cash and investment balances, interest expense on the Company's 
debt, gains and losses recognized on investments accounted for using the 
equity method, certain foreign exchange gains and losses and other 
miscellaneous income and expense items.

As of March 27, 1998, the Company owned 37.4% of the outstanding stock of 
ARM Holdings plc ("ARM"), a privately held company in the United 
Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and 
related technology.  On April 16, 1998, ARM completed an initial public 
offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National 
Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before 
foreign income taxes of approximately $23.4 million.  This amount will be 
recognized as other income in the third quarter of fiscal 1998. The Company 
will continue to account for its investment in ARM using the equity method.




                                     15
<PAGE>


Provision for Income Taxes

The Company's tax rate was 3.8% for the first six months of 1998. The tax 
provision for this period consisted entirely of foreign taxes. The Company 
expects to recognize in the third quarter approximately $7.25 million of 
foreign income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of ARM shares.

As of March 27, 1998, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $691 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. 
As of March 27, 1998, a valuation allowance of $209 million was recorded 
against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not 
be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset 
representing tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's 
ability to generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. 
Management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. 
income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax 
planning strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior 
to their expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, 
there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of 
future U.S. taxable income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets 
considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates 
of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company 
will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 
increased to $1,823 million as of March 27, 1998, from $1,459 million as of 
September 26, 1997. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of 
March 27, 1998 and September 26, 1997 include $161 million and $165 
million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit 
primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the terms 
of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI.
On April 24, 1998, SCI notified the Company that certain performance measures 
defined within the letter of credit agreement had been met by the Company and 
that effective as of May 29, 1998, the letter of credit and the amount pledged 
as collateral by the Company to support the letter of credit will be reduced 
by $100 million.  Should the Company fail to meet those performance measures 
in the future, it is possible that some or all of the letter of credit and 
supporting collateral would have to be reestablished.

Cash generated by operations during the first six months of 1998 totaled $296 
million. Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of positive 
earnings and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially 
offset by  decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and 
payments related to restructuring actions.

                                     16
<PAGE>

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $12 
million in the first six months of 1998, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing machinery and equipment. The Company expects that the level 
of capital expenditures in the second half of 1998 will be consistent with the 
first half.

 The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments balances, and ability, if necessary, to effect other short-term 
borrowings, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next 
twelve months. Expected cash requirements over the next twelve months include
an estimated $86 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, most 
of which will be effected during 1998. No assurance can be given that any 
additional required financing could be obtained should the restructuring plan 
take longer to implement than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company 
is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, 
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to 
non-investment grade. The company's senior and subordinated long-term debt 
ratings remain B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's Rating 
Agency, and B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services.  Both 
rating agencies continue to have the Company on negative outlook.  These 
actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in future periods, require 
the Company to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of its 
letters of credit and require the Company to agree to more stringent debt 
covenants than in the past.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a 
number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  In 
addition to the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report, there are 
many factors that will affect the Company's future results and business which 
may cause the actual results to differ from those currently expected. The
Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon 
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of 
the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that 
the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future 
operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and 
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition include, among other things, continued competitive 
pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; risks 
associated with international operations, including economic and labor 
conditions, political instability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; 


                                     17
<PAGE>

increasing dependence on third-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced 
functions such as logistics; the availability of key components on terms 
acceptable to the Company; the continued availability of certain components 
essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from 
sole or limited sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by 
and obtained from IBM and Motorola; the Company's ability to supply products 
in certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely 
delivery of future versions of the Mac OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate the technologies of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT"), which 
was acquired in 1997; the Company's ability to successfully implement its 
strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; 
the effects of significant adverse publicity; the availability of third-party 
software for particular applications; the effect of year 2000 compliance 
issues; the Company's ability to successfully replace its existing transaction 
systems in the U.S.; and the impact on the Company's sales, market share and 
gross margins as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing 
program.   

For a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future 
results and financial condition, see "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and 
Analysis -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition" 
in the Company's 1997 Form 10-K.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are 
discussed in detail in the 1997 Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the period 
ended December 27, 1997. The Company is also subject to certain other legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
and which have not been fully adjudicated.  The results of  legal proceedings 
cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the 
Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings 
and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial 
condition or results of operations.

                             Apple Computer, Inc.

                       1997 Director Stock Option Plan

                         (Effective as of August 5, 1997)







































                                     23
<PAGE>



                             Apple Computer, Inc.

                       1997 Director Stock Option Plan

1.  Purposes.    The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services 
of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as 
members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the 
incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals 
by granting such individuals Options to purchase shares of Common Stock.

2.  Administration.   The Administrator will be responsible for 
administering the Plan. The Administrator will have authority to adopt such 
rules as it may deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan, and 
shall have authority to interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan and 
any agreements and notices under the Plan and to make determinations 
pursuant to any Plan provision. Each interpretation, determination or other 
action made or taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final 
and binding on all persons. The Administrator shall not be liable for any 
action or determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to 
indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company's 
Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws as such documents may be amended from 
time to time.

3.  Shares Available.

Subject to the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Plan, the maximum 
number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan shall 
not exceed 400,000 shares (the "Section 3 Limit"').  Either authorized and 
unissued shares of Common Stock or treasury shares may be delivered 
pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of determining the number of shares that 
remain available for issuance under the Plan, the following rules shall apply:

    (a)   the number of shares of Common Stock underlying Options 
shall be charged against the Section 3 Limit; and
			
    (b)   the Section 3 Limit shall be increased by (i) the number of 
shares subject to an Option which lapses, expires or is otherwise terminated 
without the issuance of such shares, and (ii) the number of shares, if any, 
tendered to pay the exercise price of an  Option.

4.  Options.  Each Non-Employee Director shall receive grants of 
Options under the Plan as follows

    (a)   Option Grants.





                                      24

<PAGE>


         (i)  Initial Grants.   Non-Employee Directors who were members 
of the Board on the day prior to the Effective Date shall be granted an 
Initial Option to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock as of August 
14, 1997 ("Initial Grant Date"), provided that such individual continues to 
serve as a Non-Employee Director through the Initial Grant Date. Non-
Employee Director who were elected or appointed to  the Board on the 
Effective Date  an Initial Option to purchase 30,000 shares of Common 
Stock on the Initial Grant Due, provided  that such individual continues to 
serve as a Non-Employee Director through the Initial Grant Date. Non-
Employee Directors who are elected or appointed to the Board after the 
Effective Date shall be granted an Initial Option to purchase 30,000 shares 
of Common Stock as of the date of their election or appointment to the 
Board. The provisions of this Section 4(a)(i) shall not apply to any 
member of the Board who first becomes a Non-Employee Director by 
reason of such member's ceasing to be an employee of the Company and 
its Subsidiaries.

        (ii)  Annual Grants.   Each Non-Employee Director shall receive 
an Annual Option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock on the 
fourth anniversary of the Non-Employee Director's initial election or 
appointment to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereof, 
provided  that the individual has remained in continuous service as a 
director of the Company through such anniversary date and is a Non-
Employee Director on the applicable anniversary date.

    (b)   Exercise Period.   The per share exercise price of each Option 
shall be the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of 
grant of the Option determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

    (c)   Vesting.     Initial Options shall vest and become exercisable in 
annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the 
date of grant, provided  that the Non-Employee Director has remained in 
continuous service as a director of the Company through each such anniversary 
date. Annual Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their
date of grant.

    (d)   Term of Options.

         (i)  Ten-Year Term.   Each Option shall expire ten (10) years from 
its date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.

        (ii)  Exercise Following Termination of Service Due to Death.  If 
a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of 
such Non-Employee Director's death, the Options granted to such Non-
Employee Director may be exercised by such Non-Employee Director's 

Beneficiary, but only to the extent the Option was exercisable at the time 
of the Non-Employee Director's death, at any time within three (3) years 
alter the date of such termination of service, subject to the earlier 
expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 4(d)(i) above. At the 

                                      25
<PAGE>
end of such three-year period, the vested portion of the Option shall 
expire. The unvested portion of the Option shall expire on the date of the 
Non-Employee Director's death.

       (iii)  Termination of Options if a Non-Employee Director is 
Removed from the Board for Cause.  In the event a Non-Employee 
Director is removed from the Board for "cause," all Options granted to 
such Non-Employee Director (whether or not then vested and 
exercisable) shall immediately terminate and be of no further force and 
effect as of the effective date of such removal from the Board. Whether a 
Non-Employee Director is removed by the Board for "cause" shall be 
determined by the Board in accordance with the By-Laws of the 
Company.

        (iv)  Exercise Following Other Terminations of Service.    If a Non-
Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason 
other than death or removal from the Board for cause, the Options 
granted to such Non-Employee Director may be exercised by such Non-
Employee Director, but only to the extent the Option was exercisable at 
the time of the Non-Employee Director's termination, at any time within 
ninety (90) days after the date of such termination of service, subject to the 
earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 4(d)(i) above. 
At the end of such ninety-day period, the vested portion of the Option 
shall expire. The unvested portion of the Option shall expire on the date 
of the Non-Employee Director's termination of service with the Board.

    (e)   Time and Manner of Exercise of Options.

         (i)  Notice of Exercise.    Subject to the other terms and conditions 
hereof, a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Option, to the extent 
such Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the 
Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be 
exercisable for a fractional share. The date of exercise of an Option shall 
be the later of (A) the date on which the Company receives such written 
notice and (B) the date on which the conditions provided in Section 
4(e)(ii) are satisfied.

        (ii)  Method of Payment.  The consideration to be paid for the 
shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A) cash, (B) 
check, (C) other shares which have a Fair Market Value on the date of 
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares as to which 
the Option shall be exercised and which have been owned by the Non-
Employee Director for at least six (6) months at the time of exercise, (D) 
delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable
instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount 
of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E) any combination of 
the foregoing methods of payment.

       (iii)  Stockholder Rights.   A Non-Employee Director shall have 
no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock 
issuable upon exercise of an Option until a certificate evidencing such 

                                      26
<PAGE>

shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to 
Section 4(e)(v), and no adjustment shall be made for dividends or 
distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record 
date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall 
become the holder of record thereof.

        (iv)  Limitation on Exercise.    No Option shall be exercisable 
unless the Common Stock subject thereto has been registered under the 
Securities Act and qualified under applicable state "blue sky" laws in 
connection with the offer and sale thereof, or the Company has 
determined that an exemption from registration under the Securities Act 
and from qualification wider such state "blue sky" laws is available.

         (v)  Issuance of Shares.    Subject to the foregoing conditions, as 
soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of 
exercise and payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of 
shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall 
deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee 
Director's death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the 
principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be 
acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such 
Beneficiary), one or more stock certificates for the appropriate number of 
shares of Common Stock Issued in connection with such exercise. Shares 
sold in connection with a "cashless exercise" described in clause C of 
Section 4(e)(ii) shall be delivered to the broker referred to therein in 
accordance with the procedures established by the Company from time to 
time.

    (f)   Restrictions on Transfer. An Option may not be transferred, 
pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of 
descent and distribution; provided, however,  that an Option may be 
transferred to a Non-Employee Director's family members or to one or more 
trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such 
family members. The Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee 
Director's lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or 
entity to whom  the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous 
sentence. No assignment or transfer of the Option, or of the rights 
represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or 
otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest 
in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Option, but 
immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Option the same shall 
terminate and be of no force or effect.

5.  Designation of Beneficiary.	 
	
    (a)   Beneficiary Designations.    Each Non-Employee Director 
may designate a Beneficiary to exercise an Option upon the Non-Employee 
Director's death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form.


                                      27
<PAGE>

    (b)   Change of Beneficiary Designation.    A Non-Employee 
Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later 
Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator. The 
execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the 
Administrator will revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.

6.  Change in Control.

Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event 
of a Change in Control of the Company, the following provisions shall apply:

    (a)   Any Options outstanding as of the date such Change in 
Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable and vested 
on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested.

    (b)   The value of all outstanding Options (to the extent not 
previously exercised) shall be cashed out on the date of the Change in 
Control. The amount at which such Options shall be cashed out shall be equal 
to the excess, if any, of (i) the Change in Control Price over (ii) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option. The cash-out 
proceeds shall be paid to the Non-Employee Director or, in the event of death 
of the Non-Employee Director prior to payment, to the Beneficiary thereof.

    (c)   If the Administrator shall receive an opinion from a nationally 
recognized firm of accountants to the Company that the cash-out provisions in 
Section 6(b) above with respect to Options will prohibit the utilization of 
"pooling of interests" accounting in connection with the transaction resulting
in the Change in Control of the Company, then the following shall apply, but
only to the extent necessary to permit such accounting treatment: (i) the 
provisions of Section 6(b) shall not apply to the Options, (ii) each such 
Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable as of the date such
opinion is received by the Administrator, and (iii) the Administrator shall 
promptly inform each Non-Employee Director of such opinion and of the 
accelerated vesting and exercisability of the Option sufficiently prior to the 
anticipated date of the Change in Control, so as to permit the Option to be 
exercised prior to the date of the Change in Control.

7.  Recapitalization or Reorganization.

    (a)   Authority of the Company and Shareholders.   The existence 
of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the 
Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize any 
adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's 
capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company, 
any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of 
bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose rights are 
superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof or which are 
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the dissolution or 
liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its 
assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a 
similar character or otherwise.

                                      28
<PAGE>

    (b)   Change in Capitalization.  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of the Plan, in the event of any change in the outstanding Common 
Stock by reason of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, 
consolidation,  stock split, combination or exchange of shares (a "change in 
Capitalization"),  (i) such proportionate adjustments as may be necessary (in 
the form determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) to reflect 
such change shall be made to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of 
Non-Employee Directors under the Plan with respect to tile aggregate number of 
shares of Common Stock authorized to be awarded under the Plan, the number 
of shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Option and the 
exercise prices in respect thereof and the number of shares of Common Stock 
covered by future Option grants and (ii) the Administrator may make such 
other adjustments, consistent with the foregoing, as it deems appropriate in 
its sole discretion.

    (c)   Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed 
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each outstanding Option will vest 
and become exercisable on a date prior to the consummation of the proposed 
action that is reasonably sufficient to enable the Non-Employee Directors to 
exercise their Options.

8.  Termination and Amendment of the Plan.

    (a)   Termination.   The Plan shall terminate on the tenth 
anniversary of the Effective Date, Following such date, no further grants of 
Options shall be made pursuant to the Plan.

    (b)   General Power of Board.   Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time terminate, 
modify, suspend or amend the Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that 
no such termination, modification, suspension or amendment shall be effective 
without shareholder approval if such approval is required to comply with any 
applicable law or stock exchange rule; and provided further, that the Board 
may not, without shareholder approval, increase the maximum number of shares 
issuable under the Plan except as provided in Section 7(b) above.
	
    (c)   When Non-Employee Directors' Consents Required.   The 
Board may not alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan without the consent 
of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely 
affect his or her rights with respect to Options that have previously been 
granted.

9.  Miscellaneous.

    (a)   No Right to Reelection.   Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed 
to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any of its 
members for reelection by the Company's stockholders, nor confer upon any 
Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board for any 
period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation

                                    29
<PAGE>

    (b)   Securities Law Restrictions.   The Administrator may require 
each Non-Employee Director purchasing or acquiring shares of Common Stock 
pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-
Employee Director is acquiring the shares for investment and not with a view 
to the distribution thereof. All certificates for shares of Common Stock 
delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and 
other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules,
regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, 
and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Administrator may 
cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make 
appropriate reference to such restrictions. No shares of Common Stock shall be 
issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such 
issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all 
applicable federal and state securities laws.

    (c)   Expenses.    The costs and expenses of administering the Plan 
shall be borne by the Company.

    (d)   Applicable Law.   Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan 
and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to 
conflicts of law principles.

    (e)   Effective Date.   The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective 
Date, subject to the approval thereof by the stockholders of the Company by no

                       1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN


1.  Purposes of the Plan.  The purposes of this Stock Plan are:

      to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of 
      substantial responsibility, 

      to provide additional incentive to the Chairman and/or Executive 
      Officers, and 

      to promote the success of the Company's business.  

  Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options (as defined 
under  Section 422 of the Code) or Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by
the Administrator at the time of grant.  Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may
be granted under the Plan in connection with Options or independently of 
Options.  Stock Purchase Rights may also be granted under the Plan.

2.  Definitions. As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

    (a)   "Administrator" means the Board or any of its Committees as shall be 
    administering the Plan, in accordance with Section 4 of the Plan.

    (b)   "Agreement" means an agreement between the Company and an Optionee 
    evidencing the terms and conditions of an individual Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase grant.  The Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of 
    the Plan.

    (c)  "Applicable Laws" means the requirements relating to the 
    administration of stock option plans under U. S. state corporate laws, U.S.
    federal and state securities laws, the Code, any stock exchange or 
    quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted and the 
    applicable laws of any foreign country or jurisdiction where Options, SARs
    or Stock Purchase Rights are, or will be, granted under the Plan.

    (d)   "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company.

    (e)   "Chairman"  means the Chairman of the Board.

    (h)   "Common Stock" means the common stock of the Company.

    (i)   "Company" means Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation.

    (j)   "Continuous Status as Chairman"  unless determined otherwise by the 
    Administrator, means the absence of any interruption or termination as 
    Chairman of the Board with the Company.  Continuous Status as Chairman 
    shall not be considered interrupted in the case of medical leave, military 
    leave, family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the 
    Administrator, provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in 
    termination as Chairman with the Company.   Neither service as a Director 
    nor payment of a director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to 
    constitute status as "Chairman" by the Company.   

(k)  "Continuous Status as an Employee" means the absence of any 
    interruption or termination of the employment relationship with the 
    Company or any Subsidiary.  Continuous Status as an Employee shall not be 
    considered interrupted in the case of  (i) medical leave, military leave, 
    family leave, or any other leave of absence approved by the Administrator, 
    provided, in each case, that such leave does not result in termination of 
    the employment relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the 
    case may be, under the terms of the respective Company policy for such 
    leave; or (ii) in the case of transfers between locations of the Company or 
    between the Company, its Subsidiaries, or its successor.  For purposes of 
    Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety days, unless 
    reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or 
    contract.  If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved 
    by the Company is not so guaranteed, on the 91st day of such leave any 
    Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as an
    Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a Non-
    statutory Stock Option.  Neither service as a Chairman nor as a Director
    nor payment of a director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to 
    constitute "employment" by the Company.

    (l)   "Director" means a member of the Board.

    or Subsidiary of the Company subject to (i) above.

    system, on the date of determination or, if the date of determination is 
    not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day, as reported in 
    The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Administrator deems 
    reliable;

        (ii)	 If the Common Stock is regularly quoted by a recognized 
    securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, the Fair Market 
    Value of a Share of Common Stock shall be the mean between the high bid and
    low asked prices for the Common Stock on the date of determination or, if 
    there are no quoted prices on the date of determination, on the last day on
    which there are quoted prices prior to the date of determination, as 
    reported in The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the 
    Administrator deems reliable; or

under the Plan or for which SARs or Stock Purchase Rights may be granted and 
exercised is 17,000,000  Shares.  The Shares may be authorized, but unissued, 
or reacquired Common Stock.  

    In the discretion of the Administrator, any or all of the Shares 
authorized under the Plan may be subject to SARs issued pursuant to the Plan.

    If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right issued under the Plan should 
expire or become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in
full, the unpurchased Shares which were subject thereto shall become available 
for other Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights under this Plan (unless the 
Plan has terminated); however, should the Company reacquire Shares which were 
issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR, such Shares shall not 
become available for future grant under the Plan.  If Shares of Restricted 
Stock are repurchased by the Company at their original purchase price, such 
shares shall become available for future grant under the Plan.
	
4.  Administration of the Plan.

   (a)    Procedure.

         (i)	 Multiple Administrative Bodies.  If permitted by Rule 16b-3 
    promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto, as in 
    effect at the time that discretion is being exercised with respect to the 
    Plan ("Rule 16b-3"), and by the legal requirements of the Applicable Laws 
    relating to the administration of stock plans such as the Plan, if any, the
    Plan may (but need not) be administered by different administrative bodies 
    with respect to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors who are 
    Employees, (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) Employees who are 
    neither Directors nor Officers.

        (ii)  Section 162(m).   To the extent that the Administrator determines
    it to be desirable to qualify Options or SARs granted hereunder as 
    "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of 
    the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more 
    "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

       (iii)	 Rule 16b-3.   To the extent desirable to qualify transactions 
    hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated 
    hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption 
    under Rule 16b-3.
                                     36
<PAGE>
        (iv)  Other Administration.  Other than as provided above, the Plan 
    shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which committee 
    shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws. 

    (b)  Powers of the Administrator.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, 
    and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by
    the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority, 
    in its discretion:

         (i)	 to determine the Fair Market Value;

        (ii)  to select the person(s) to whom Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
    Rights may be granted hereunder;

       (iii)	 to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered 
    by each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;

        (iv)	 to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

         (v)  to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the 
    terms of the Plan, of any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted 
    hereunder.  Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the 
    exercise price, the date of grant, the time or times when Options, SARs or 
    Stock Purchase Rights may be exercised (which may be based on performance 
    criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, 
    and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in 
    each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, 
    shall determine;

        (vi)  to reduce the exercise price of any Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market 
    Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase 
    Right shall have declined since the date the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase 
    Right was granted;

       (vii)  to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards 
    granted pursuant to the Plan;

      (viii)  to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to 
    the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans 
    established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment 
    under foreign tax laws;

        (ix)  to modify or amend each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
    (subject to Section 16(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary 
    authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options 
    longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;

        (x)  to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by 
    electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon 
   
                                     37
<PAGE>
    
    exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right that number of Shares 
    having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.  
    The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on 
    the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.  All 
    elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be 
    made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem 
    necessary or advisable;

        (xi)  to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any 
    instrument required to effect the grant of an Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right previously granted by the Administrator; and

       (xii)  to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable 
    for administering the Plan.

    (c)  Effect of Administrator's Decision.  The Administrator's decisions, 
    determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all 
    Optionees and any other holders of Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights.

5.  Eligibility.  Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights
may be granted to the Chairman and Executive Officers or to such other 
individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has offered a 
position of Chairman or Executive Officer.  Incentive Stock Options may be 
granted only to Executive Officers.  

6.  Limitations.

    (a)   Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an 
    Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  However, 
    notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair 
    Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options 
    are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year
    (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds 
    $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  
    For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken 
    into account in the order in which they were granted.  The Fair Market 
    Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with 
    respect to such Shares is granted.

    (b)   Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall 
    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the 
    Optionee's relationship as an Employee with the Company, nor shall they 
    interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to 
    terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.

    (c)   The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options and SARs:

         (i)  No participant shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the 
    Company, Options to purchase more than 17,000,000 Shares.

                                     38
<PAGE>

        (ii)  The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in 
    connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in 
    Section 15. 

       (iii)  If an Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the 
    Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a 
    transaction described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted 
    against the limits set forth in subsections (i) above.  For this purpose, 
    if the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction will 
    be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a new 
    Option or SAR.

7.  Term of Plan.  Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, the Plan shall become 
effective upon its adoption by the Board.  It shall continue in effect for a 
term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 16 of the Plan.

8.  Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be stated in the Agreement.
In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be ten (10) years from
the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Agreement. 
Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, 
at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more
than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of 
stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive 
Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter 
term as may be provided in the Agreement.
	
9.  Option Exercise Price and Consideration.

    (a)  Exercise Price.  The per share exercise price for the Shares to be 
issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the 
Administrator, subject to the following:

         (i)  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option

           (A)  granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock 
    Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) 
    of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent 
    or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of 
    the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

           (B)  granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in 
    paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall be no 
    less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

        (ii)  In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share 
    exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator.  In the case of a 
    Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based 
    compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per 
    Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value 
    per Share on the date of grant.

                                     39

<PAGE>

       (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per 
    Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share 
    on the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a 
    merger or other corporate transaction.

    (b)   Waiting Period and Exercise Dates.  At the time an Option is 
granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be 
exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before 
the Option may be exercised. 

    (c)   Form of Consideration.  The Administrator shall determine the 
acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the 
method of payment.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator
shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant.  
Such consideration may consist entirely of:

         (i)  cash;

        (ii)  check;

       (iii)  promissory note;
		    
        (iv)	 other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon 
    exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six 
    months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the 
    date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as 
    to which said Option shall be exercised;

         (v)  consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise 
    program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

        (vi)  a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the 
    Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's 
    participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or 
    arrangement;

       (vii)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

       (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance 
    of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

10. Stock Appreciation Rights.

    (a)   Granted in Connection with Options.  At the sole discretion of the 
Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any part of an 
Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or at any time 
thereafter during the term of the Option.  The following provisions apply to 
SARs that are granted in connection with Options:


                                     40
<PAGE>


         (i)  The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by 
    surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.  
    The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal 
    to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the 
    SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related 
    Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the 
    surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
  

    the Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon 
    exercise of an SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict 
    the exercisability of the related Option;

        (ii)  When a SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent 
    surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable;

       (iii)  A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that 
    the related Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date 
    on which the related Option expires; and

        (iv)  A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market 
    Value of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the 
    exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.
 
    (b)   Independent SARs.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator, SARs 
may be granted without related Options.  The following provisions apply to 
SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:

         (i)  The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to 
    receive from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair 
    Market Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the 
    SAR, as of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of 
    the Common Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the 
    date on which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the 
    Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon 
    exercise of a SAR; and

        (ii)  SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as 
    the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement. 

    (c)  Form of Payment.  The Company's obligation arising upon the exercise 
of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination of 
Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may 
determine.  Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall be valued at their 
Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.

    (d)   Rule 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional 
restrictions as may be required to be contained in the plan or SAR agreement in 
order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.


                                     41
<PAGE>

11.	Exercise of Option or SAR.

    (a)  Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder. Any Option or SAR
granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and
at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator 
and set forth in the Agreement.  An Option may not be exercised for a fraction 
of a Share.

    An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: 
(i)  written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the terms of 
the Option or SAR) from the person entitled to exercise the Option or SAR, and 
(ii)  full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is 
exercised.  Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment
authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Agreement and the Plan.  
Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the 
Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his 
or her spouse.  Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate 
entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the
Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a 
shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding 
the exercise of the Option.  The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) 
such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised.  No adjustment will be 
made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the 
date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

    Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares 
thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the 
Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  Exercise 
of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised, result in a 
decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be available for 
purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be exercisable to the extent 
it has been exercised.
		
    (b)  Termination of Continuous Status as Chairman.   Upon termination of 
an Optionee's Continuous Status as Chairman (other than termination by reason 
of the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days 
after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the 
extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised 
after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

    (c)   Termination of Continuous Employment.   Upon termination of an 
Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee (other than termination by reason of 
the Optionee's death), the Optionee may, but only within ninety (90) days 
after the date of such termination, exercise his or her Option or SAR to the 
extent that it was exercisable at the date of such termination.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be exercised 
after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms due to 
the passage of time from the date of grant.

                                     42
<PAGE>		
    (d)  Death of Optionee.  If an Optionee dies (i) while an Employee or 
Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within six (6) months 
(or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined 
by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's estate or 
by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or 
inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have 
accrued had the Optionee continued living and terminated his or her employment 
six (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months 
as determined by the Administrator) after the date of death; or (ii) within 
ninety (90) days after the termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or 
Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within six (6) 
months (or such other period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months as 
determined by the Administrator) following the date of death by the Optionee's
estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by 
bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that 
had accrued at the date of termination.  If the Option or SAR is not so 
exercised within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, 
and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may not be 
exercised after the date the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by its terms 
due to the passage of time from the date of grant.

    (e)  Buyout Provisions.  The Administrator may at any time offer to buy 
out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option or SAR previously granted based 
on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and 
communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

12. Stock Purchase Rights.

    (a)   Rights to Purchase.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either 
alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan 
and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan.  After the Administrator 
determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall 
advise the offeree in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions and 
restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the 
offeree shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the time 
within which the offeree must accept such offer.  The offer shall be accepted 
by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the Administrator.

    (b)   Repurchase Option.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, 
the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon the 
voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the 
Company for any reason (including death or Disability).  The purchase price for 
Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall be the original price paid 
by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the 
purchaser to the Company.  The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate 
determined by the Administrator.

    (c)   Other Provisions.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms, 
provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined 
by the Administrator in its sole discretion. 
                                     43
<PAGE>
    (d)  Rights as a Shareholder.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is 
exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a 
shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered 
upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company.  No 
adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record 
date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as 
provided in Section 14 of the Plan.

13.  Transferability of Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights.  Unless 
determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase 
Right may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or 
disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or 
distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by 
the Code or Title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and may be 
exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.  If the 
Administrator makes an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable, such 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall contain such additional terms and 
conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.

14.  Stock Withholding to Satisfy Withholding Tax Obligations.   When an 
Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option, 
SAR or Stock Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax withholding 
under applicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay the Company an 
amount required to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may 
satisfy the withholding tax obligation (including, at the election of the 
Optionee, any additional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in 
order to satisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax in 
connection with the exercise) by electing to have the Company withhold from 
the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to be 
issued upon exercise of the SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if any, that number 
of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be 
withheld (and any additional amount desired to be withheld, as aforesaid). The 
Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date 
that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined (the "Tax Date").

    All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose 
shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall 
be subject to the following restrictions:

         (i)  the election must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax 
    Date; and
        (ii)	 all elections shall be subject to the consent or disapproval of 
    the Administrator.

    In the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an 
Optionee and the Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because 
no election is filed under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall 
receive the full number of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right is exercised but such Optionee shall be 
unconditionally obligated to tender back to the Company the proper 
number of Shares on the Tax Date.

15.  Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution, Merger or Asset 
Sale. 

    (a)   Changes in Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by the 
shareholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by 
each outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of shares 
of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as 
to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been granted or 
which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price per share of Common 
Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, 
shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number 
of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock 
split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or 
any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock 
effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, 
that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be 
deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."  Such 
adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect 
shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided herein, 
no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities 
convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment 
by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares 
of Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.

    (b)  Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the proposed dissolution
or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
Rights  will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed 
action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.  The Administrator 
may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that 
any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right  shall terminate as of a date fixed by 
the Administrator and give each Optionee the right to exercise his or her 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
would not otherwise be exercisable.

    (c)  Merger or Asset Sale.  Unless otherwise determined by the 
Administrator, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another 
corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,
each outstanding Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an 
equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a 
Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.  In the event that the 
successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to 
exercise the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned 
Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or 
exercisable.  If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested 
and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger 
or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in writing or 
electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully 

                                     45
<PAGE>
vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such 
notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the 
expiration of such period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option, 
SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered assumed if, following the 
merger or sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or 
receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the 
consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received 
in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held 
on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice 
of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration 
received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the 
successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent 
of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received 
upon the exercise of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for each Share 
of Optioned Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, to be 
solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair 
market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common 
Stock in the merger or sale of assets.

    (d)   Change in Control.  In the event of a "Change in Control" of the 
Company, as defined in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by the 
Administrator prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following 
acceleration and valuation provisions shall apply:

         (i)	 Any Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding 
    as of the date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred that 
    are not yet exercisable and vested on such date shall become fully 
    exercisable and vested; and

        (ii)	 The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock Purchase 
    Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator at or after 
    grant, be cashed-out.  The amount at which such Options, SARs and Stock 
    Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal to the excess of (x) 
    the Change in Control Price (as defined below) over (y) the exercise price 
    of the Common Stock covered by the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.  
    The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee or, in the event of 
    death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate of the Optionee or to 
    a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option, SAR or Stock 
    Purchase Right by bequest or inheritance.

    (e)   Definition of "Change in Control".  For purposes of this Section 14, 
a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

         (i)	 When any "person", as such term is used in Sections 14(d) 
    and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a 
    Company employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting 
    as trustee) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 
    under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the 
    Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting 
    power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or
                                     46
<PAGE>

        (ii)	 The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval, 
    and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
    Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.

    (f)   Change in Control Price.  For purposes of this Section 14, "Change in 
Control Price" shall be, as determined by the Administrator, (i) the highest 
Fair Market Value at any time within the 60-day period immediately preceding 
the date of determination of the Change in Control Price by the Administrator 
(the "60-Day Period"), or (ii) the highest price paid or offered, as determined
by the Administrator, in any bona fide transaction or bona fide offer related 
to the Change in Control of the Company, at any time within the 60-Day Period.

16. Date of Grant.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right 
shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the 
determination granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other 
later date as is determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the determination 
shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of 
such grant.

17. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.

    (a)   Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at any time amend, alter, 
suspend or terminate the Plan.  

    (b)   Shareholder Approval.  The Company shall obtain shareholder approval 
of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with 
Applicable Laws. 

    (c)   Effect of Amendment or Termination.  No amendment, alteration, 
suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee, 
unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, 
which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company. 
Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to 
exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options, SAR or 
Stock Purchase Right granted under the Plan prior to the date of such 
termination.

18. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.  

    (a)   Legal Compliance.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the 
exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of such 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of such 
Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the 
approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

    (b)   Investment Representations.  As a condition to the exercise of an 
Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may require the person 
exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right to represent and warrant 
at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for 

                                     47
<PAGE>


investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares 
if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is 
required.

19. Inability to Obtain Authority.  The inability of the Company to obtain 
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is 
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and 
sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in 
respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite 
authority shall not have been obtained.

20. Reservation of Shares.  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will 
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

21. Shareholder Approval.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the 
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan 
is adopted.  Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to 
the degree required under Applicable Laws.
