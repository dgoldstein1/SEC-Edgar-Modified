Exhibit 99.1


Apple Reports Second Fiscal Quarter Results

Company Recaps Extensive New Product Offerings and
Restructuring Progress.

CUPERTINO, Calif. April 16, 1997  Apple Computer, Inc. today announced
financial results for the Company's fiscal 1997 second quarter ended March
28, 1997. Revenues for the quarter were $1.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion
in the quarter ended Dec. 27, 1996 and $2.2 billion in the quarter ended March
29, 1996. International sales accounted for 49 percent of total revenues in
the current quarter.

As previously indicated, the Company incurred two large charges of a non-
operating nature during the quarter. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company recorded a charge of $375 million for the write-off of
in-process research and development activity related to its Feb. 4, 1997
acquisition of NeXT Software, Inc.

Additionally, the Company recorded a charge of $155 million to increase
reserves to cover the costs of restructuring activities previously announced
by the Company on March 14, 1997.

The Company's total loss for the quarter was $708 million, or $(5.64) per
share, compared to a net loss of $120 million, or $(.96) per share in the
December 1996 quarter and a net loss of $740 million, or $(5.99) per share, in
the year-ago quarter. Exclusive of the charges for restructuring and the
write-off of in-process research and development, the Company's current quarter
loss from operations was $186 million, or $(1.48) per share.

Gross margins for the quarter were 19 percent, compared to 19 percent in the
December quarter, and compared to -19 percent (or 9 percent before inventory
adjustments) in the year-ago quarter.

Aside from the charges for restructuring and the write-off of in-process
research and development, operating expenses for the quarter were $489
million, down $32 million from the December quarter and down $65 million
from the year ago quarter.

"While the operating results are disappointing, we made significant progress
toward executing our strategic plans during the quarter," said Apple chairman
and chief executive officer Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio. "We've streamlined our
organization and narrowed our focus, were divesting non-core assets, and we're
executing a plan to reduce annual operating expenses by $500 million. We've
also made great progress toward strengthening Apples competitive position by
introducing several exciting new products to the market, and we've completed
the NeXT acquisition, paving the way for delivery of our modern OS, code-named
'Rhapsody.'"

<PAGE>                               5

"We experienced continued success in asset management during the quarter," said
Apple executive vice president and chief financial officer Fred Anderson. "Our
cash balance at the end of Q2 was in excess of $1.4 billion, our inventories
were just over $500 million, and despite the quarter's loss, we generated
positive cash flow from operations."

"We expect to see rapid improvements in the Company's financial performance as
the results of restructuring kick in," added Anderson. "We anticipate higher
revenues and a significantly reduced operating loss in the Company's third
fiscal quarter and continued progress toward our goal of returning to
profitability in the fourth quarter."

New Products
Apple introduced an array of new products in recent weeks. On April 4, the
Company announced the Power Macintosh(R) 6500 series of computers for home
and small business customers, including the first 300 MHz system to hit the
personal computer market. In addition, the Company introduced two PC-compatible
computers, the Power Macintosh 7300/180, which includes a 166 MHz Intel Pentium
processor; and the Power Macintosh 4400/200, which includes a 133 MHz Cyrix
PR166 6x86 processor.

Earlier in the quarter, Apple announced the Macintosh PowerBook(R) 3400 series,
featuring the first 240 MHz notebook computer on the market, as well as a new
line of Power Macintosh computers for business, professional publishing, and
Internet/media authoring.

For education customers, Apple introduced its most comprehensive lineup of
new products in 20 years, including the eMate(TM) 300, three powerful
all-in-one desktop models, two models in a powerful new tower design, and
three new solution bundles for secondary schools.

Claris (R) Corporation, Apple's wholly-owned software subsidiary, achieved
record-breaking revenues of $70 million during the quarter. Revenue growth was
driven in large part by an unprecedented level of operating system upgrades
to Mac (R) OS 7.6, introduced in January.

"In the last three months, we executed one of the most exciting and 0
comprehensive series of product introductions in the history of Apple," said
Apple executive vice president of marketing Guerrino De Luca. "These products
demonstrate the ongoing innovation at Apple and our commitment to providing
distinctive, powerful, easy-to-use products to meet the needs of our
customers."

Except for the historical information contained herein, the statements
regarding establishing competitive leadership, effecting innovation,
continuing focus on certain industry growth areas, reduction of the Company's
operating expenses and losses, and the timing of execution of the Company's
business plans are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation,
continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the effect competitive
factors and the Company's reaction to them may have on consumer and business
buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; the consequences
competitive factors and buying decisions may have on current inventory
valuations; the Company's ability to successfully integrate the personnel,
products and operations of NeXT Software; the ability of the Company to make
timely delivery of successful technological innovations to the marketplace;
the ability of the Company to successfully resolve its quality issues; the
effect of any future losses on the Company's needs for liquidity; the effect
of the announced business restructuring on the future performance of the
Company, especially the performance of the Company's employees; and the need
for any future restructuring, and the effect that it might have on the
performance of the Company. More information on potential factors that could
affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Form 10-K
for the 1996 fiscal year and will also be included in the Company's Form 10-Q
for the second fiscal quarter, to be filed with the SEC.

Exhibit 99.1


Apple Reports Second Fiscal Quarter Results

Company Recaps Extensive New Product Offerings and
Restructuring Progress.

CUPERTINO, Calif. April 16, 1997  Apple Computer, Inc. today announced
financial results for the Company's fiscal 1997 second quarter ended March
28, 1997. Revenues for the quarter were $1.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion
in the quarter ended Dec. 27, 1996 and $2.2 billion in the quarter ended March
29, 1996. International sales accounted for 49 percent of total revenues in
the current quarter.

As previously indicated, the Company incurred two large charges of a non-
operating nature during the quarter. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company recorded a charge of $375 million for the write-off of
in-process research and development activity related to its Feb. 4, 1997
acquisition of NeXT Software, Inc.

Additionally, the Company recorded a charge of $155 million to increase
reserves to cover the costs of restructuring activities previously announced
by the Company on March 14, 1997.

The Company's total loss for the quarter was $708 million, or $(5.64) per
share, compared to a net loss of $120 million, or $(.96) per share in the
December 1996 quarter and a net loss of $740 million, or $(5.99) per share, in
the year-ago quarter. Exclusive of the charges for restructuring and the
write-off of in-process research and development, the Company's current quarter
loss from operations was $186 million, or $(1.48) per share.

Gross margins for the quarter were 19 percent, compared to 19 percent in the
December quarter, and compared to -19 percent (or 9 percent before inventory
adjustments) in the year-ago quarter.

Aside from the charges for restructuring and the write-off of in-process
research and development, operating expenses for the quarter were $489
million, down $32 million from the December quarter and down $65 million
from the year ago quarter.

"While the operating results are disappointing, we made significant progress
toward executing our strategic plans during the quarter," said Apple chairman
and chief executive officer Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio. "We've streamlined our
organization and narrowed our focus, were divesting non-core assets, and we're
executing a plan to reduce annual operating expenses by $500 million. We've
also made great progress toward strengthening Apples competitive position by
introducing several exciting new products to the market, and we've completed
the NeXT acquisition, paving the way for delivery of our modern OS, code-named
'Rhapsody.'"

<PAGE>                               5

"We experienced continued success in asset management during the quarter," said
Apple executive vice president and chief financial officer Fred Anderson. "Our
cash balance at the end of Q2 was in excess of $1.4 billion, our inventories
were just over $500 million, and despite the quarter's loss, we generated
positive cash flow from operations."

"We expect to see rapid improvements in the Company's financial performance as
the results of restructuring kick in," added Anderson. "We anticipate higher
revenues and a significantly reduced operating loss in the Company's third
fiscal quarter and continued progress toward our goal of returning to
profitability in the fourth quarter."

New Products
Apple introduced an array of new products in recent weeks. On April 4, the
Company announced the Power Macintosh(R) 6500 series of computers for home
and small business customers, including the first 300 MHz system to hit the
personal computer market. In addition, the Company introduced two PC-compatible
computers, the Power Macintosh 7300/180, which includes a 166 MHz Intel Pentium
processor; and the Power Macintosh 4400/200, which includes a 133 MHz Cyrix
PR166 6x86 processor.

Earlier in the quarter, Apple announced the Macintosh PowerBook(R) 3400 series,
featuring the first 240 MHz notebook computer on the market, as well as a new
line of Power Macintosh computers for business, professional publishing, and
Internet/media authoring.

For education customers, Apple introduced its most comprehensive lineup of
new products in 20 years, including the eMate(TM) 300, three powerful
all-in-one desktop models, two models in a powerful new tower design, and
three new solution bundles for secondary schools.

Claris (R) Corporation, Apple's wholly-owned software subsidiary, achieved
record-breaking revenues of $70 million during the quarter. Revenue growth was
driven in large part by an unprecedented level of operating system upgrades
to Mac (R) OS 7.6, introduced in January.

"In the last three months, we executed one of the most exciting and 0
comprehensive series of product introductions in the history of Apple," said
Apple executive vice president of marketing Guerrino De Luca. "These products
demonstrate the ongoing innovation at Apple and our commitment to providing
distinctive, powerful, easy-to-use products to meet the needs of our
customers."

Except for the historical information contained herein, the statements
regarding establishing competitive leadership, effecting innovation,
continuing focus on certain industry growth areas, reduction of the Company's
operating expenses and losses, and the timing of execution of the Company's
business plans are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Potential risks and uncertainties include, without limitation,
continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the effect competitive
factors and the Company's reaction to them may have on consumer and business
buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; the consequences
competitive factors and buying decisions may have on current inventory
valuations; the Company's ability to successfully integrate the personnel,
products and operations of NeXT Software; the ability of the Company to make
timely delivery of successful technological innovations to the marketplace;
the ability of the Company to successfully resolve its quality issues; the
effect of any future losses on the Company's needs for liquidity; the effect
of the announced business restructuring on the future performance of the
Company, especially the performance of the Company's employees; and the need
for any future restructuring, and the effect that it might have on the
performance of the Company. More information on potential factors that could
affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Form 10-K
for the 1996 fiscal year and will also be included in the Company's Form 10-Q
for the second fiscal quarter, to be filed with the SEC.

Exhibit 99.1


Apple Reports Second Fiscal Quarter Results

Company Recaps Extensive New Product Offerings and
Restructuring Progress.

CUPERTINO, Calif. April 16, 1997  Apple Computer, Inc. today announced
financial results for the Company's fiscal 1997 second quarter ended March
28, 1997. Revenues for the quarter were $1.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion
in the quarter ended Dec. 27, 1996 and $2.2 billion in the quarter ended March
29, 1996. International sales accounted for 49 percent of total revenues in
the current quarter.

As previously indicated, the Company incurred two large charges of a non-
operating nature during the quarter. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company recorded a charge of $375 million for the write-off of
in-process research and development activity related to its Feb. 4, 1997
acquisition of NeXT Software, Inc.

Additionally, the Company recorded a charge of $155 million to increase
reserves to cover the costs of restructuring activities previously announced
by the Company on March 14, 1997.

The Company's total loss for the quarter was $708 million, or $(5.64) per
share, compared to a net loss of $120 million, or $(.96) per share in the
December 1996 quarter and a net loss of $740 million, or $(5.99) per share, in
the year-ago quarter. Exclusive of the charges for restructuring and the
write-off of in-process research and development, the Company's current quarter
loss from operations was $186 million, or $(1.48) per share.

Gross margins for the quarter were 19 percent, compared to 19 percent in the
December quarter, and compared to -19 percent (or 9 percent before inventory
adjustments) in the year-ago quarter.

Aside from the charges for restructuring and the write-off of in-process
research and development, operating expenses for the quarter were $489
million, down $32 million from the December quarter and down $65 million
from the year ago quarter.

"While the operating results are disappointing, we made significant progress
toward executing our strategic plans during the quarter," said Apple chairman
and chief executive officer Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio. "We've streamlined our
organization and narrowed our focus, were divesting non-core assets, and we're
executing a plan to reduce annual operating expenses by $500 million. We've
also made great progress toward strengthening Apples competitive position by
introducing several exciting new products to the market, and we've completed
the NeXT acquisition, paving the way for delivery of our modern OS, code-named
'Rhapsody.'"

"We experienced continued success in asset management during the quarter," said
Apple executive vice president and chief financial officer Fred Anderson. "Our
cash balance at the end of Q2 was in excess of $1.4 billion, our inventories
were just over $500 million, and despite the quarter's loss, we generated
positive cash flow from operations."

"We expect to see rapid improvements in the Company's financial performance as
the results of restructuring kick in," added Anderson. "We anticipate higher
revenues and a significantly reduced operating loss in the Company's third
fiscal quarter and continued progress toward our goal of returning to
profitability in the fourth quarter."

New Products
Apple introduced an array of new products in recent weeks. On April 4, the
Company announced the Power Macintosh(R) 6500 series of computers for home
and small business customers, including the first 300 MHz system to hit the
personal computer market. In addition, the Company introduced two PC-compatible
computers, the Power Macintosh 7300/180, which includes a 166 MHz Intel Pentium
processor; and the Power Macintosh 4400/200, which includes a 133 MHz Cyrix
PR166 6x86 processor.

Earlier in the quarter, Apple announced the Macintosh PowerBook(R) 3400 series,
featuring the first 240 MHz notebook computer on the market, as well as a new
line of Power Macintosh computers for business, professional publishing, and
Internet/media authoring.

For education customers, Apple introduced its most comprehensive lineup of
new products in 20 years, including the eMate(TM) 300, three powerful
all-in-one desktop models, two models in a powerful new tower design, and
three new solution bundles for secondary schools.

Claris (R) Corporation, Apple's wholly-owned software subsidiary, achieved
record-breaking revenues of $70 million during the quarter. Revenue growth was
driven in large part by an unprecedented level of operating system upgrades
to Mac (R) OS 7.6, introduced in January.

"In the last three months, we executed one of the most exciting and 0
comprehensive series of product introductions in the history of Apple," said
Apple executive vice president of marketing Guerrino De Luca. "These products
demonstrate the ongoing innovation at Apple and our commitment to providing
distinctive, powerful, easy-to-use products to meet the needs of our
customers."
