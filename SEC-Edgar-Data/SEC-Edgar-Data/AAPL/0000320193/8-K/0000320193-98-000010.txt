Items 1 through 7 not applicable.

Item 8.  Change in Fiscal Year.

         The Company's By-laws provide that each fiscal quarter of the 
Corporation shall be comprised of 13 weeks each of which shall end at midnight 
on Friday of such week, and the fiscal months in any one calendar quarter 
shall be comprised of at least four consecutive calendar weeks with one week 
to be added, at management's discretion, to any one month during such fiscal 
year.  On December 15, 1998 the Company amended its By-laws to provide that 
each fiscal quarter shall end at midnight Saturday of such week, rather than 
Friday.  For the current year, the Company's fiscal year end will be 
September 25, 1999.  Accordingly, the first quarter of fiscal 1999 will end 
on December 26, 1998; the second quarter will end on March 27, 1999; and, the 
third quarter will end on June 26, 1999.  The Company is making this change 
in order to improve the coordination and efficiency of period-end shipping and 
billing activities and does not anticipate that this change will have any 
effect on the amount of revenue recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 
1999. This change is not deemed a change in fiscal year end for the purpose 
of reporting subject to Rule 13a-10 or 15d-10, therefore, a transition report 
is not required to be filed.
