              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (Unaudited)


1.   Basis of Presentation
     ---------------------

     The consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared by the
     Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote
     disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
     condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The Company
     believes the disclosures included in the unaudited consolidated condensed
     financial statements, when read in conjunction with the consolidated
     financial statements of the Company as of July 2, 1999 and notes thereto,
     are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

     The consolidated condensed financial statements reflect, in the opinion of
     management, all material adjustments necessary to summarize fairly the
     consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
     such periods.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

     The results of operations for the three and six month periods ended
     December 31, 1999 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
     expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.

     The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52
     or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30.  Accordingly, fiscal
     1999 was 52 weeks and ended on July 2, 1999 and fiscal 2000 will be 52
     weeks and will end on June 30, 2000.

</TABLE>

     For the quarter and six months ended December 31, 1999, all options to
     purchase shares of common stock, including 8.3 million shares and 6.9
     million shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted
     net loss per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.  Options to
     purchase 3.1 million shares and 10.1 million shares of common stock were
     outstanding during the quarter and six months ended January 1, 1999,
     respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted net
     income per share because the options' exercise price was greater than the
     average market price of the common stock and, therefore, the effect would
     be antidilutive.

4.   Income Taxes
     ------------

     The effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for
     the six months ended December 31, 1999 was 534% compared with a 40%
     effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for the
     six months ended January 1, 1999.  The higher effective tax rate used to
     record the provision for income taxes for the six months ended December 31,
     1999 resulted primarily from the effects of net non-deductible charges
     associated with the acquisition of the minority interest in Seagate
     Software, the net gain from the sales of VERITAS Software Corporation
     ("VERITAS") and SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") common stock and activity
     related to the Company's equity interest in VERITAS.  Excluding these
     items, the Company's settlement of litigation with Rodime PLC (the "Rodime
     Settlement") and certain non-recurring restructuring costs, the pro forma
     effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for the
     six months ended December 31, 1999 would have been 28%.  The pro forma
     effective tax rate of 28% is less than the statutory rate because a portion
     of the Company's anticipated foreign operating income is not subject to
     foreign income taxes and is considered to be permanently reinvested in non-
     U.S. operations.

6.   Restructuring Costs
     -------------------

     In the quarters ended October 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, the Company
     recorded restructuring charges of $112 million and $23 million,
     respectively, for a total of $135 million.  These charges were a result of
     a restructuring plan established to align the Company's global workforce
     and manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market
     requirements and necessitated by the Company's improved productivity and
     operating efficiencies (the "fiscal 2000 restructuring plan").  These
     actions include workforce reductions, capacity reductions including closure
     of facilities or portions of facilities, write-off of excess equipment and
     consolidation of operations in the Company's recording media operations,
     disc drive assembly and test facilities, printed circuit board assembly
     manufacturing, recording head operations, software operations, customer
     service operations, sales and marketing activities, and research and
     development activities.  The restructuring charges were comprised of $48
     million for the write-off of excess manufacturing, assembly and test
     equipment formerly utilized in Singapore, Thailand and Northern California;
     $46 million for employee termination costs; $29 million for the write-off
     of owned facilities located in Singapore; $5 million in lease termination
     and holding costs; $5 million in renovation costs to restore facilities in
     Singapore and Northern

                                       8

     California to their pre-lease condition; and $2 million in contract
     cancellations associated with one of the Singapore facilities. Prior to
     this period, there was no indication of permanent impairment of the assets
     associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities.

     In connection with the restructuring activities taken to date, the Company
     plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 11,300 employees.
     Approximately 8,800 of the 11,300 employees had been terminated as of
     December 31, 1999.  As a result of employee terminations and the write-off
     of equipment and facilities in connection with the restructuring charges
     recorded in the quarters ended October 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999
     related to the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan, the Company estimates that
     after completion of these restructuring activities, annual salary and
     depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately $82 million and $73
     million, respectively.  As the Company implements additional actions
     pursuant to the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan, the Company anticipates
     that additional charges will be taken related to these actions and that the
     implementation of the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan will be substantially
     complete by September 30, 2000.

     In connection with the restructuring plan implemented in fiscal 1999,
     approximately 800 of the planned workforce reduction of 1,250 employees had
     been terminated as of December 31, 1999. As a result of employee
     terminations and the write-off or write-down of equipment and facilities in
     connection with the fiscal 1999 restructuring plan, the Company estimates
     that after completion of these restructuring activities, annual salary and
     depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately $27 million and $16
     million, respectively.  The Company anticipates that the implementation of
     the fiscal 1999 restructuring plan will be substantially complete by the
     end of March 2000.

          The following table summarizes the Company's restructuring
     activities for the six months ended December 31, 1999:

8.   Comprehensive Income (As amended June 14, 2000)
     -----------------------------------------------

     During the quarter ended October 1, 1999, Gadzoox Networks Inc.
     ("Gadzoox"), a company in which Seagate Technology holds a 19.89% interest,
     completed an initial public offering of its common stock. The Company is
     required to account for its investment under Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
     and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). The Company has identified this
     investment as "available-for-sale". Under SFAS 115, an available-for-sale
     security is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and unrealized
     holding gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in a separate
     component of stockholders' equity called accumulated other comprehensive
     income, until realized. The Company recorded an unrealized gain on
     securities, net of tax, of $146 million to record its investment in Gadzoox
     at fair value as of October 1, 1999. For the six months ended December 31,
     1999, the Company recorded net unrealized gains on securities of $117
     million, net of tax, with respect to its investment in Gadzoox.

                                       10

     The recorded investment in SanDisk has been amended to revise the
     calculation of its fair value, unrealized holding gain and related taxes.
     As a result, the balance sheet caption amounts of other assets, deferred
     income tax liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income increased
     by $310 million, $122 million and $188 million, respectively. No other
     financial statements were affected by this matter.

     During the quarter ended December 31, 1999, the Company identified its
     investment in SanDisk as "available-for-sale" after it had sold 1,000,000
     shares of stock it held in SanDisk resulting in a final ownership
     percentage of 15.8%.  The Company recorded an unrealized gain on securities
     of $285 million, net of $184 million of tax, to record its investment in
     SanDisk at fair value as of December 31, 1999.

     The components of comprehensive income, net of related tax, for the three
     and six months ended December 31, 1999 and January 1, 1999 were as follows

9.   Equity Investment in VERITAS Software Corporation
     -------------------------------------------------

     During the quarters ended October 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, the
     Company's Seagate Software Holdings, Inc. ("Seagate Software") subsidiary
     sold 12,349,001 and 6,000,000 shares of VERITAS Software Corporation common
     stock, adjusted for a 3 for 2 stock split on November 22, 1999, for
     proceeds of $397 million and $437 million, respectively, net of
     underwriting discounts and commissions. Seagate Software acquired such
     shares in connection with Seagate Software's contribution of its Network &
     Storage Management Group business to VERITAS. The sale of shares of VERITAS
     common stock by Seagate Software in the quarters ended October 1, 1999 and
     December 31, 1999 resulted in pre-tax gains of $193 million and $344
     million, respectively. As of December 31, 1999, the Company held
     approximately 33% of the outstanding common stock of VERITAS. The Company
     accounts for its investment in VERITAS under the equity

</TABLE>

     The Company's recorded equity in the net income of VERITAS for the three
     and six months ended December 31, 1999 was $9 million and $7 million,
     respectively, and differs from the Company's proportionate share of
     VERITAS' reported net loss for the three and six months ended September 30,
     1999.  This difference is primarily because the Company eliminates from
     VERITAS' net income (loss) the effect of VERITAS' accounting for the
     Network & Storage Management Group business contribution, including
     VERITAS' amortization expense related to intangible assets.

     The Company's activity related to equity interest in VERITAS for the three
     and six months ended December 31, 1999 consisted of the recorded equity in
     the net income of VERITAS of $9 million and $7 million, respectively, as
     described above, and the Company's amortization expense for goodwill and
     other intangible assets relating to the investment in VERITAS amounting to
     $93 million and $190 million, respectively.


10.  Seagate Software Reorganization
     -------------------------------

     On October 20, 1999, the stockholders of Seagate Software, a majority-owned
     subsidiary of the Company, approved  the merger of Seagate Daylight Merger
     Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with and into Seagate
     Software.  Seagate Software's assets consist of the assets of the
     Information Management Group ("IMG") and its investment in the common stock
     of VERITAS Software Corporation.  The merger was effected on October 20,
     1999.  As a result of the merger, Seagate Software became a wholly-owned
     subsidiary of the Company.  In connection with the merger, Seagate
     Software's stockholders and optionees received payment in the form of 3.23
     shares of the Company's common stock per share of Seagate Software common
     stock less any amounts due for the payment of the exercise price for such
     options.  All outstanding Seagate Software stock options were accelerated
     immediately prior to the merger.  Seagate Technology issued 9,124,046
     shares to optionees and minority stockholders of Seagate Software.

     In connection with the reorganization, Seagate Software also formed a
     wholly-owned subsidiary that assumed the name "Seagate Software, Inc."
     ("Software Operating Company").  Seagate Software transferred the IMG
     assets into Software Operating Company.  This new company, Software
     Operating Company, is now the operating entity for the IMG business.  A new
     stock option plan has been established for Software Operating Company, and
     employees of the IMG business are eligible to participate in the plan.

     Seagate Software accounted for the exchange of shares of its common stock
     as the acquisition of a minority interest for Seagate Software common stock
     outstanding and vested more than six months held by employees and all stock
     held by former employees and consultants.  The fair value of the shares of
     Seagate Technology issued was $19 million and was recorded as purchase
     price and allocated to the assets and liabilities received.  The Company
     accounted for the exchange of shares of its common stock for stock options
     in Seagate Software held by employees and stock held and vested by
     employees less than six months as the settlement of an earlier stock award.
     During the quarter ended December 31, 1999, the Company recorded
     compensation expense of $284 million, plus $2 million in payroll taxes,
     related to the purchase of minority interest in Seagate Software.

11.  Subsequent Events - Acquisition of XIOtech Corporation
     -------------------------------------------------------

     On January 28, 2000, the Company acquired XIOtech Corporation ("XIOtech"),
     a provider of virtual storage and Storage Area Network (SAN) solutions, for
     Seagate Technology

                                       13
<PAGE>

     common stock with a value of $360 million. The acquisition will be
     accounted for under the purchase method. The purchase price allocation is
     preliminary and it has been allocated based on the estimated fair market
     value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired as well as in-process
     research and development costs.

     In the quarter ending March 31, 2000, the Company expects to record a
     charge of approximately $105 million associated with the purchased in-
     process research and development costs.  The excess of the purchase price
     over the net assets is approximately $241 million, will be recorded as
     goodwill and other intangibles and will be amortized on a straight-line
     basis over two to seven years.


12.  Litigation
     ----------

     In late 1992, Rodime PLC filed a complaint alleging infringement on a
     certain patent. The process of litigation ensued and elapsed through
     January 2000. On January 18, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the
     Company's petition for certiorari. On the following day, through a
     mediation process, the Company and Rodime agreed to a settlement amount of
     $45 million to bring the related litigation to an end. As a result, a
     previously recorded estimate of related settlement costs was revised and a
     charge of $39 million was recorded in the three months ended December 31,
     1999. See Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a description of legal
     proceedings.
