ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

        Stock Split to be Effected as a Stock Dividend

        On September 9, 1999, Intuit Inc. ( the "Company") announced that its
Board of Directors had declared a three-for-one stock split, to be effected as a
stock dividend of two shares of common stock for each share of the Company's
common stock outstanding. Stockholders of record on September 20, 1999, will be
entitled to two additional shares of common stock for each share of the
Company's common stock held on that date.

        The payment date for the stock dividend will be September 30, 1999. On
or about that date, the new shares will be mailed to stockholders by the
Company's transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The Company
expects that its outstanding common stock will begin to trade on a post-split
basis on October 1, 1999.

        Pursuant to Rule 416 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
Registration Statement filed by Intuit on Form S-3 dated May 7, 1999 (File
