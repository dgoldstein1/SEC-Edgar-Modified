                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS





To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Computing Resources, Inc.


In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of retained earnings and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Computing
Resources, Inc. (the Company) at December 31, 1998, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 10, on March 2, 1999, the Company's stockholders agreed to
sell 100% of the stock in the Company to Intuit Inc.

1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    NATURE OF BUSINESS
    Computing Resources, Inc. (Company) primarily provides payroll processing
    and payroll tax filing services to customers located throughout the United
    States. The Company establishes relationships with banks and provides its
    services to the banks' customers. The Company obtains new customers
    generally through the sales efforts of these banks.

    BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
    The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
    Computing Resources, Inc. and its 79% owned subsidiary, Computing
    Transaction Corporation. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

    PAYROLL TAX FILING SERVICES
    In connection with its payroll processing and payroll tax filing services,
    the Company files on behalf of customers federal and state tax returns,
    handles related regulatory correspondence and amendments, absorbs regulatory
    charges for certain penalties and interest, collects funds for payment of
    taxes due, holds such funds in trust until payment is due, and remits the
    funds to the appropriate taxing authority. For such services, the Company
    receives fees from customers and an investment return on funds which are
    held in trust. Funds held in trust are invested in various money market
    accounts and municipal securities. The amount of collected but unremitted
    funds varies significantly during the year and averaged $101.5 million in
    1998. The amount of such funds as of December 31, 1998, approximated $160.5
    million.

    The Company's payroll tax filing service is subject to various risks
    resulting from errors and omissions in the payment of payroll taxes and
    related payroll tax filings. Errors and omissions have occurred in the past
    and may occur in the future in connection with such services. The Company
    reimburses their customers for penalties imposed by tax authorities for late
    filings or underpayment of taxes which are a direct result of the Company's
    actions. To date such penalties have not been significant. However, there
    can be no assurance that any liabilities associated with such penalties will
    not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
    condition or results of operations. In 1998, the Company had incurred
    approximately $416,000 of payroll warranty costs as a result of errors made
    by the Company.

    USE OF ESTIMATES
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
    accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of
    revenue and expense during the period. Actual results could differ from
    these estimates.

    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
    The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
    original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

    CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
    The Company and its subsidiary maintain cash accounts in several commercial
    banks and with an investment services company. The bank accounts are insured
    by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $100,000 per bank
    per company. The investment services company provides insurance by the
    Security Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC) which insures cash balances
    up to $100,000 and securities up to $400,000. At December 31, 1998,
    approximately $516,000 of the Company's cash deposit is insured. A
    significant portion of the Company's existing and new customers are derived
    from a single banking relationship; approximately 70% of the Company's
    service revenue is derived from services provided to this bank's customers.

    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
    using both straight-line and accelerated methods. Purchased software is
    stated at cost. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over
    lives ranging from three to five years.

    The estimated useful lives of the assets are:

</TABLE>


    Maintenance, repairs and renewals that neither materially add to the value
    of the asset nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as
    incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of property and equipment are
    included in income. The Company capitalizes interest as a component of
    property, plant and equipment constructed for its own use. No interest was
    capitalized in 1998.

    REVENUE RECOGNITION
    Revenue from payroll processing and payroll tax filing services under client
    contracts is recognized as the services are performed. Interest income
    earned on unremitted payroll tax funds invested is recognized as earned and
    reflected as a component of service income.

    INCOME TAXES
    The Company has elected to be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of
    the Internal Revenue Code. Under those provisions, the Company does not pay
    federal corporate income taxes on its taxable income. Instead, the
    stockholders are liable for individual federal income taxes on their
    respective shares of the Company's taxable income.

    The Company has not made such an election for state income tax purposes and
    is, therefore, subject to state income taxes on cash basis income earned
    outside the State of Nevada, as Nevada has no state income tax.

    Computing Transaction Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company, has not
    elected Subchapter S status and calculates federal and state income taxes
    based on accrual basis income.

    The Company reports income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires
    the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or
    liability and its reported amount in the financial statements.

    Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in
    effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided
    under currently enacted tax law. Valuation allowances are established when
    necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
    realized.

    BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
    Earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares
    of common stock outstanding. The Company has not issued any common stock
    options or warrants. As a result there is no difference between basic and
    diluted earnings per share.

    IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
    In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
    130, Reporting Comprehensive Income (Statement 130). Statement 130
    establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income
    and its components; however, the adoption of this Statement had no impact on
    the Company's net income or stockholders' equity. The Company did not have
    any items required to be included in other comprehensive income during 1998.

    In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
    131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
    (Statement 131). Statement 131 establishes standards for the way that
    enterprises subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission rules and regulations report selected information about
    operating segments in annual financial statements and interim financial
    reports. Statement 131 also establishes standards for related disclosures
    about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Inasmuch
    as the Company's activities are all directed at providing services related
    to payroll processing, the Company believes that it operates in a single
    business segment consistent with the objectives and basic principles of
    Statement 131.

4.  LINE OF CREDIT

    In September 1998, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement with
    a bank for a total commitment of $4 million which expires June 30, 2000. As
    of December 31, 1998, the Company had drawn $2 million on the line which
    bears interest at prime or LIBOR plus 1.35%, at the Company's option. During
    1998, the Company elected to have interest calculated using the LIBOR option
    (7% at December 31, 1998). For the year ended December 31, 1998, interest
    expense on the line of credit totaled $33,064. The line of credit is
    personally guaranteed by the shareholders.

    The line of credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which
    require, among other things, the maintenance of defined levels of tangible
    net worth and limitations on future indebtedness and payment of dividends.
    At December 31, 1998, the Company did not comply with the covenant
    requirements listed above for which the Company received waivers and
    amendments in February 1999.


5.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    In addition to certain property leases with related parties as described in
    Note 9, the Company leases office space and equipment under terms of various
    operating leases. Certain leases contain renewal options ranging up to five
    years.

    The Company's future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases,
    including leases with related parties, are as follows:
<TABLE>

<S>                   <C>
      1999            $1,191,967
      2000             1,042,895
      2001               844,598
      2002               552,772
      2003               528,282

                      $4,375,360
                      ==========
</TABLE>


    Rental expense charged to operations for all operating leases for the year
    ended December 31, 1998, approximated $1,129,000.

    In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims
    and litigation. The Company does not believe that the resolution of these
    matters will have a material impact on the consolidated financial
    statements.


6.  INCOME TAXES

    At December 31, 1998, the Company's income tax provision consists of current
    state income tax expense of approximately $66,000 and deferred tax expense
    of approximately $6,000. Temporary differences relate to prepaid expenses,
    accounts receivable, accumulated depreciation, accounts payable and accrued
    expenses.

    The net deferred tax amounts at December 31, 1998, consist of deferred tax
    assets and deferred tax liabilities of approximately $9,000 and $3,000,
    respectively.

    In 1998, the Company's subsidiary used $300,482 of available federal net
    operating loss carryforwards and $80,735 of available state net operating
    loss carryforwards to offset federal and state taxable income. At December
    31, 1998, there were no available state net operating loss carryforwards. At
    December 31, 1998, available federal net operating loss carryforwards which
    may be applied against future taxable income approximated $256,000; these
    carryforwards expire from 2007 to 2010. As the utilization of these
    carryforwards is uncertain, a valuation allowance of 100% of these amounts
    has been recorded at December 31, 1998. Under the provisions of the Internal
    Revenue Code, the amount and benefit from net operating loss carryforwards
    may be limited in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, a
    cumulative stock ownership change of more than 50% over a three year period,
    as defined.


7.  HEALTH INSURANCE

    The Company maintains a partially self-insured health plan for qualified
    employees. The Company pays claims up to $35,000 per year per employee.
    Total annual claims exceeding $410,000 are covered by a third party
    insurance carrier. At December 31, 1998, the Company had accrued
    approximately $143,000 relating to claims payable and an estimate of
    incurred but unreported claims.


8.  RETIREMENT PLAN

    The Company has a 401(k) plan and trust (Plan) for the benefit of salaried,
    hourly and commissioned employees. Eligible employees may elect to have
    their compensation reduced by up to 20% for contributions to the Plan. The
    Company may make discretionary contributions to the Plan. The Company did
    not make a contribution to the Plan in 1998. Employees contributed
    approximately $233,000 to the Plan during 1998.

9.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

    The principal stockholder of the Company is the owner of Nevada Typesetting,
    which provides printing services and supplies to the Company. The Company
    paid approximately $388,000 to Nevada Typesetting for services provided
    during 1998. At December 31, 1998, accounts payable included $15,000 owed to
    Nevada Typesetting. As discussed in Note 10, the Company acquired Nevada
    Typesetting in January 1999.

    The Company leases its principal facility from a company affiliated through
    common ownership. The triple net lease commenced in January, 1994 for a
    ten-year term. The current monthly rent of $31,782 is subject to annual
    increases based on the Consumer Price Index.

    The Company leases another building from a company affiliated through common
    ownership. The triple net lease commenced in September 1995 for a ten year
    term. The current monthly rent of $5,616 is subject to annual increases
    based on the Consumer Price Index.

    A disaster recovery facility, located in Fallon, Nevada is owned by a
    company affiliated through common ownership. The affiliate and the Company
    entered into a ten-year, triple net lease agreement to lease the property
    commencing in January, 1996. The current monthly rent of $3,940 is subject
    to annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index.

    Rent expense paid to affiliates during 1998 approximated $497,000.
    Management of the Company views the lease transactions with related parties
    as arms length, which reflect current rental rates for equivalent properties
    in the same location.

    During 1998, the stockholders received net advances from the Company of
    $120,573. Those advances bear interest at approximately 5.4%, which totaled
    $6,000 for 1998.


10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

    In January 1999, the Company purchased the assets of Nevada Typesetting from
    the majority stockholder for approximately $645,000.

    On March 2, 1999, the Company's stockholders agreed to sell 100% of their
    stock in the Company to Intuit Inc. The sale is expected to be finalized in
    May 1999.

                   BALANCE SHEET AND STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

The following pro forma adjustments are required to allocate the purchase price
and acquisition cost to the assets acquired from Computing Resources
Incorporated ("CRI") based on their fair value, as determined by Intuit.

(a) Reflects the estimated allocation of the purchase price, based on fair
    market values, to the historical balance sheet. Purchase price represents
    $100 million cash payment, $25 million stock payment, three annual future
    cash payments of $25 million and estimated acquisition costs of $1.5
    million.

(b) Represents the elimination of CRI's equity accounts.

(c) Amortization of intangible assets and goodwill are based on an estimated
    life of five years. Actual results may differ from these estimates upon
    completion of the purchase price allocation in Intuit's fiscal fourth
    quarter of 1999.

(d) Reflects an increase in common stock for the shares issued in connection
    with the purchase price of CRI for the net assets acquired.

(e) Reflects estimated tax effect of treating CRI as a C corporation instead of
    an S corporation combined with the estimated tax benefit of intangibles
    amortization.
