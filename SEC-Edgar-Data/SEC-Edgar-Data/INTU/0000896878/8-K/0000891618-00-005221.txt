ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

     On November 25, 2000, Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Intuit Insurance Services, Inc. ("IIS"), entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement ("Asset Agreement") pursuant to which selected assets of IIS
will be sold to InsWeb Corp. ("InsWeb"). Under the terms of the Asset Agreement,
Intuit will acquire an equity interest in InsWeb equal to 19.9% of InsWeb's
currently issued shares (or 16.6% measured on a post-closing basis).

     In connection with the asset sale, Intuit and InsWeb will also enter into
a distribution agreement under which InsWeb will become the exclusive consumer
insurance aggregator for Intuit's Quicken.com(R) and QuickenInsurance Web sites
and certain consumer desktop products. In exchange, Intuit will share in
associated revenues, which are subject to certain minimums over the 5-year term
of the distribution agreement.

     The transaction has been approved by the boards of both Intuit and InsWeb
and is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2001, subject to
various conditions, including regulatory clearances and customary closing
conditions.
