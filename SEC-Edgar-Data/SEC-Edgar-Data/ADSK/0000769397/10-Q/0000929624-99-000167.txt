                                 AUTODESK, INC.
              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Basis of Presentation
      ---------------------

The condensed consolidated financial statements of Autodesk, Inc. ("Autodesk" or
the "Company") at April 30, 1998 and 1997 are unaudited and reflect all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the
opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position and operating results for the interim periods. The condensed
consolidated financial statements at April 30, 1998 should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, as restated, and notes
thereto, together with management's discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations, contained in the Company's Annual Report to
Stockholders incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K/A for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998. The results of operations for
the three months ended April 30, 1998 are not necessarily indicative of the
results for the entire fiscal year ending January 31, 1999.

On March 31, 1997, the Company issued approximately 2.9 million shares of its
common stock for all outstanding shares of Softdesk, Inc. ("Softdesk"), a
leading supplier of AutoCAD-based application software for the architecture,
engineering, and construction market, and exchanged Autodesk options for
outstanding Softdesk options. The acquisition of Softdesk was accounted for as a
business combination using the purchase method of accounting. In accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.16,"Accounting for Business
Combinations," the cost of the Softdesk acquisition was allocated to the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed (including in-process research and
development) based on their estimated fair values using valuation methods
believed to be appropriate at the time. The estimated fair value of the in-
process research and development of $55.1 million was expensed in the first
quarter of fiscal 1998 (the period in which the acquisition was consummated) in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No.
2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method." Subsequent to
the Securities and Exchange Commission's letter to the AICPA dated September 9,
1998, regarding its views on in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the
Company has re-evaluated its IPR&D charges on the Softdesk acquisition, revised
the purchase price allocation and restated its financial statements. As a
result, the Company has made an adjustment to decrease the amount previously
expensed as in-process research and development by $35.9 million.

The effect of this adjustment on previously reported consolidated financial
statements as of and for the quarters ended April 30, 1998 and April 30, 1997 is
as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE> 


2.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards
      ------------------------------------

In the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, the Company adopted the provisions of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position
98-1 "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use." This standard requires companies to capitalize qualifying
computer software costs which are incurred during the application development
stage and amortize them over the software's estimated useful life. The adoption
of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
operating results or financial position.

3.   Common Stock Repurchase Programs
     --------------------------------

The Company sold put warrants to an independent third party in December 1997
that entitled the holder of the warrants to sell 1.5 million shares of common
stock to the Company at $38.12 per share. Additionally, the Company purchased
call options from the same independent third party that entitled the Company to
buy 1 million shares at $39.88 per share. The premiums received with respect to
the equity options totaled $4.5 million and equaled the premiums paid.
Consequently, there was no exchange of cash. The put warrants permitted a net
share settlement at the Company's option. In March 1998, the Company exercised
the call option, electing the net share settlement option and retired
approximately 97,000 shares of its common stock. The put warrants expired
unexcercised.

4.   Net Income Per Share
     --------------------

Basic net income per share is calculated using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common stock
equivalents outstanding during the period. A reconciliation of the numerators
and denominators used in the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share
amounts follows:

5.   Change in Accounting Principle
     ------------------------------

Effective February 1, 1998, Autodesk adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS 130"). SFAS 130
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and
its components; however, the adoption of this Statement had no impact on the
Company's net income or stockholders' equity. This Statement requires unrealized
gains or losses on the Company's available-for-sale securities and foreign
currency translation adjustments, which prior to adoption were reported
separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in other comprehensive
income. Prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
requirements of SFAS 130.

Autodesk's total comprehensive income was as follows:

6.   Subsequent Events
     -----------------

On May 4, 1998, the Company acquired various mechanical computer-aided-design
software and technologies from Genius CAD Software GmbH ("Genius"), a German
limited liability company, for approximately $69 million in cash, which includes
fees and expenses. The acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase
method with the results of Genius being included in Autodesk's consolidated
financial statements from the acquisition date.

In May 1998, final judgment was entered in the Vermont Microsystems, Inc.
("VMI") trade secret litigation in the amount of $7.8 million plus accrued
interest. Following entry of judgment, final payment of approximately $8.4
million was made to VMI and charged against a previously recorded litigation
accrual, and the remainder of the escrow account returned to Autodesk. As a
result, the Company plans to record a credit to operating income during the
second quarter of fiscal year 1999 that reflects excess litigation accruals.

RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 31, 1997, the Company issued approximately 2.9 million shares of its
common stock for all outstanding shares of Softdesk, Inc. ("Softdesk"), a
leading supplier of AutoCAD-based application software for the architecture,
engineering, and construction market, and exchanged Autodesk options for
outstanding Softdesk options. The acquisition of Softdesk was accounted for as a
business combination using the purchase method of accounting. In accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.16,"Accounting for Business
Combinations," the cost of the Softdesk acquisition was allocated to the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed (including in-process research and
development) based on their estimated fair values using valuation methods
believed to be appropriate at the time. The estimated fair value of the in-
process research and development of $55.1 million was expensed in the first
quarter of fiscal 1998 (the period in which the acquisition was consummated) in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No.
2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method." Subsequent to
the Securities and Exchange Commission's letter to the AICPA dated September 9,
1998, regarding its views on in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), the
Company has re-evaluated its IPR&D charges on the Softdesk acquisition, revised
the purchase price allocation and restated its financial statements. As a
result, the Company has made an adjustment to decrease the amount previously
expensed as in-process research and development by $35.9 million.

The effect of this adjustment on previously reported consolidated financial
statements as of and for the quarters ended April 30, 1998 and April 30, 1997 is

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Three Months Ended April 30, 1998 and 1997
- ------------------------------------------

Net revenues.  The Company's first quarter net revenues of $187.2 million
increased 57 percent from the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.  The
Company achieved significant net revenue growth in the Americas and Europe when
compared to the same  period in the prior fiscal year while remaining relatively
flat in Asia Pacific.  The Company recorded net revenues in the Americas of
$90.1 million, an 81 percent increase from the same period in the prior fiscal
year, and net revenues in Europe of $68.0 million, an increase of 68 percent.
This net revenue growth was the result of strong demand for new and upgrade
units of AutoCAD Release 14, which began shipping in the second quarter of
fiscal year 1998.  Also contributing to the higher revenues were new and
enhanced products such as Mechanical Desktop 2.0 and AutoCAD LT 97.  Sales of
AutoCAD and AutoCAD upgrades accounted for approximately 69 percent and 70
percent of the Company's consolidated net revenues in the first quarter of
fiscal years 1999 and 1998, respectively.  The stronger value of the US dollar,
relative to certain international currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the
German mark and the French franc, negatively impacted net revenues in the first
quarter of the current fiscal year by $4.4 million when compared to the same
period in the prior fiscal year.  International sales, including exports from
the U.S., accounted for approximately 58 percent of the Company's revenues in
the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 as compared to 64 percent in the same
period of the prior fiscal year.

The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from sales of AutoCAD
software, AutoCAD upgrades, and adjacent products which are interoperable with
AutoCAD.  As such, any factor adversely affecting sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD
upgrades, including such factors as product life cycle,  market acceptance,
product performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, and the
availability of third-party applications, could have a material adverse effect
on the Company's business and consolidated results of operations.  Additionally,
slowdowns in any of the Company's geographical markets, including the current
economic instability in certain countries of the Asia Pacific region, could also
have a material adverse impact on the Company's business and consolidated
results of operations.

Product returns, consisting principally of stock rotation, are recorded as a
reduction of revenues and represented approximately 5 percent of consolidated
revenues in the first quarter of both fiscal years 1999 and 1998.  Although
product returns, comparing the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 to the same
period in the prior year, remained the same as a percentage of consolidated
revenues, management anticipates that product returns in future periods will
continue to be impacted by the timing of new product releases, as well as the
quality and market acceptance of new products.

Cost of revenues.  When expressed as a percentage of net revenues, cost of
revenues decreased approximately 3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year
1999 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. This improvement
resulted from efficiencies in production and distribution activities, and the
mix of product sales.  Cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues has been
and may continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales, royalty rates for
licensed technology embedded in Autodesk's products, and the geographic
distribution of sales.

Marketing and sales.  Marketing and sales expenses were 35 percent and 44
percent of net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal years 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  Actual spending increased 24 percent as a result of higher
employee costs, including increased variable compensation associated with higher
revenues, and higher advertising and promotion costs to support the launch of
new and enhanced products from the Company's market groups, including AutoCAD
Mechanical and MapGuide Release 3.0.  The Company expects to continue to invest
in marketing and sales of its products, to develop market opportunities, and to
promote Autodesk's competitive position.  Accordingly, the Company expects
marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant, both in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of net revenues.

                                       11

Research and development.  Research and development expenses represented 19
percent and 23 percent of net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal years 1999
and 1998, respectively.  Actual research and development spending (including
capitalized software development costs of $1,750,000 recorded in the prior
fiscal year) increased by 20 percent from the same period in the prior fiscal
year due to the addition of software engineers, expenses associated with the
development and translation of new products, and exit costs incurred in the
restructuring of one of the Company's development centers.  The Company
anticipates that research and development expenses will increase in future
periods as a result of product development efforts by the Company's market
groups and incremental personnel costs.  Additionally, the Company intends to
continue recruiting and hiring experienced software developers and to consider
the licensing and acquisition of complementary software technologies and
businesses.

General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses decreased to 15
percent of net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 from 16 percent
of net revenues in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.  In absolute
dollar terms, general and administrative expenses increased 53 percent from the
same period of the prior fiscal year, resulting primarily from increased
employee-related expenses ($3.5 million increase), amortization of intangibles
recorded in connection with the Softdesk merger ($1.9 million increase), and
costs related to the Company's Year 2000 compliance program ($0.9 million).  The
Company currently expects that general and administrative expenses will increase
in future periods to support spending on infrastructure, including continued
investment in Autodesk's worldwide information systems and making any additional
corrections to the Company's hardware and software for compliance in the year
2000; and to amortize goodwill and other intangible assets associated with
recent business combinations.

Charge for acquired in-process research and development. On March 31, 1997, the
Company exchanged 2.9 million shares of its common stock for all of the
outstanding stock of Softdesk, Inc.  Based on the value of Autodesk stock and
options exchanged, the transaction, including transaction costs, was valued at
approximately $94 million.  This transaction was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting with the purchase price being principally
allocated to capitalized software, purchased technologies, and intangible
assets.  Approximately $19.2 million of the total purchase price represented the
value of in-process research and development that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.  Approximately $3.0
million of technology acquired from 3D/Eye during the first quarter of fiscal
year 1998 also represented the value of in-process research and development that
had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
The $19.2 million and the $3.0 million were charged to operations in the first
quarter of fiscal year 1998.  These charges reduced net income for the period by
approximately $21.1 million ($0.46 per share on a diluted basis) and reflect the
fact the one-time charge for acquired in-process research and development
recorded in connection with the Softdesk transaction was not deductible for
income tax purposes.

Interest and other income.  Interest and other income remained relatively flat
in the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 compared to the first quarter of fiscal
year 1998.  Interest and other income in the first quarter was $2.2 million, net
of foreign exchange gains of $14,000, compared to $2.4 million in the same
quarter of the prior fiscal year, including foreign currency losses of $56,000.

Provision for income taxes.  Excluding the impact of nonrecurring charges, the
Company's effective income tax rate was 35.5 percent in the first quarter of
fiscal year 1999 compared to 43 percent in the same quarter of the prior fiscal
year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to tax benefits
associated with the Company's foreign sales corporation and foreign earnings
which are taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate as well as the
reduced impact of nondeductible goodwill amortization.

The Company's United States income tax returns for fiscal years ended January
31, 1992 through 1996, are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS").  On August 27, 1997, the IRS issued a Notice of Deficiency proposing
increases to the amount of the Company's federal income taxes for fiscal years
1992 and 1993.  On November 25, 1997, the Company filed a petition with the
United States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax deficiencies.   Resolution
of these alleged tax deficiencies and any adjustments that may ultimately result
from these examinations are not expected to have a material adverse impact on
the Company's consolidated results of operations or its financial position.

CERTAIN RISK FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS

Autodesk operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
risks, some of which are beyond the Company's control.  The following discussion
highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on
future results of operations.

Competition.  The software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the
availability of desktop computers with continually expanding capabilities at
progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry.  Because of
these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to
intensify in the future.  Increased competition could result in price
reductions, reduced revenues and profit margins, and loss of market share, any
of which could adversely affect Autodesk's business, consolidated results of
operations, and financial condition. The design software market in particular is
characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which
the Company competes, both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies
and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies.

The AEC family of products competes directly with software offered by companies
such as Bentley Systems, Inc. ("Bentley"); Computervision Corporation (a
subsidiary of Parametric Technologies, Inc.) ("Computervision"); CADAM Systems
Company, Inc.; Diehl Graphsoft, Inc.; EaglePoint Software; International
Microcomputer Software, Inc. ("IMSI"); Intergraph Corporation; Ketiv
Technologies; Nemetschek Systems, Inc. and Visio Corporation ("Visio").
Autodesk's MCAD products compete with products offered by Bentley; Visionary
Design Systems; Hewlett-Packard Corporation; Parametric Technologies, Inc.;
Structural Dynamics Research Corporation; Unigraphics; Computervision; Dassault
Systemes ("Dassault"); Solidworks Corporation (a subsidiary of Dassault); and
Baystate Technologies, Inc.  Autodesk's GIS Market Group faces competition from
Bentley; Intergraph; MapInfo Corporation; Earth Sciences Research Institute
("ESRI"); and MCI Systemhouse.  Kinetix product offerings compete with products
offered by other multimedia companies such as Adobe Systems Inc.; Macromedia,
Inc.; and Silicon Graphics, Inc.  The Personal Solutions Group family of
products compete with IMSI; The Learning Company; Visio; Micrografx Inc.; and
others.  Certain of the competitors of Autodesk have greater financial,
technical, sales and marketing, and other resources than Autodesk.

Autodesk believes that the principal factors affecting competition in its
markets are product reliability, performance, ease of use, range of useful
features, continuing product enhancements, reputation, price and training.  In
addition, the availability of third-party application software is a competitive
factor within the CAD market.  Autodesk believes that it competes favorably in
these areas and that its competitive position will depend, in part, upon its
continued ability to enhance existing products, and to develop and market new
products.

In April 1998, the Company received notice that the Federal Trade Commission
("FTC") has undertaken a nonpublic investigation to determine whether Autodesk
or others have engaged in or are engaging in unfair methods of competition.  The
FTC has not made any claims or allegations regarding the Company's current
business practices or policies, nor have any charges been filed.  Autodesk
intends to cooperate fully with the FTC in its inquiry.  The Company does not
believe that the investigation will have a material adverse impact on its
business or consolidated results of operations.

Fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Autodesk has experienced
fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic
regions due to seasonality.  The Company's operating results in Europe during
the third fiscal quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period while the
Asia Pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and
fourth fiscal quarters.

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
The technology industry is particularly susceptible to fluctuations in operating
results within a quarter.  While Autodesk experienced more linear operating
results within the current quarter compared to prior years, historically the
majority of its orders within a fiscal quarter have frequently been concentrated
within the last weeks or days of that quarter.  These fluctuations are caused by
a number of factors, including the relatively long sales cycle of some of
Autodesk's products, the timing of the introduction of new products by Autodesk
or its competitors, and other economic factors experienced by the Company's
customers and the geographic regions in which Autodesk does business.
Additionally, Autodesk's operating expenses are based in part on its
expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term.
Accordingly, any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate
and significant adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.

Similarly, shortfalls in Autodesk's revenues or earnings from levels expected by
securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on
the trading price of the Company's common stock.  Moreover, the Company's stock
price is subject to the volatility generally associated with technology stocks
and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to performance.

Product concentration.  Autodesk derives a substantial portion of its revenues
from sales of AutoCAD software, AutoCAD upgrades, and adjacent products which
are interoperable with AutoCAD. As such, any factor adversely affecting sales of
AutoCAD and AutoCAD upgrades, including such factors as product life cycle,
market acceptance, product performance and reliability, reputation, price
competition, and the availability of third-party applications, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business and consolidated results of
operations.

In April 1998, the Company received notice that the Federal Trade Commission
("FTC") has undertaken a nonpublic investigation to determine whether Autodesk
or others have engaged in or are engaging in unfair methods of competition.  The
FTC has not made any claims or allegations regarding the Company's current
business practices or policies, nor have any charges been filed.  Autodesk
intends to cooperate fully with the FTC in its inquiry.  The Company does not
believe that the investigation will have a material adverse impact on its
business or consolidated results of operations.

Product development and introduction.  The software industry is characterized by
rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and
preferences.  The software products offered by the Company are complex and,
despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors or defects
("bugs"), especially when first introduced.  There can be no assurance that
defects or errors will not occur in future releases of AutoCAD or other software
products offered by the Company.   Such defects or errors could result in
corrective releases to the Company's software products, damage to Autodesk's
reputation, loss of revenues, an increase in product returns, or lack of market
acceptance of its products, any of which could have a material and adverse
effect on the Company's business and consolidated results of operations.

The Company believes that its future results will depend largely upon its
ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability,
performance, ease of use, range of useful features, continuing product
enhancements, reputation, price and training. Delays or difficulties may result
in the delay or cancellation of planned development projects, and could have a
material and adverse effect on Autodesk's business and consolidated results of
operations..  Further, increased competition in the market for design, mapping,
or multimedia software products could also have a negative impact on the
Company's business and consolidated results of operations.  More specifically,
gross margins may be adversely affected if sales of low-end CAD products, which
historically have had lower margins, grow at a faster rate than the Company's
higher-margin products.

Certain of the Company's historical product development activities have been
performed by independent firms and contractors, while other technologies are
licensed from third parties. Autodesk generally either owns or licenses the
software developed by third parties. Because talented development personnel are
in high demand, there can be no assurance that independent developers, including
those who have developed products for the Company in the past, will be able to
provide development support to the Company in the future. Similarly, there can
be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain and renew license
agreements on favorable terms, if at all, and any failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business and consolidated results of
operations.

                                       14

Autodesk's business strategy has historically depended in large part on its
relationships with third-party developers, who provide products that expand the
functionality of the Company's design software.  There can be no assurance that
certain developers will not elect to support other products or otherwise
experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles.  Such
disruption in particular markets could negatively impact these third-party
developers and end users, which could have a material adverse effect on
Autodesk's business and consolidated results of operations.  Further, increased
merger and acquisition activity currently experienced in the technology industry
could affect relationships with other third-party developers, and thus adversely
affect operating results.

International operations.  The Company anticipates that international operations
will continue to account for a significant portion of its consolidated revenues.
Risks inherent in the Company's international operations include the following:
unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs; difficulties in staffing
and managing foreign operations; longer collection cycles; potential changes in
tax laws; greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property; and the impact
of fluctuating exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in
markets where Autodesk does business. During the first three months of fiscal
year 1999, changes in exchange rates from the same period of the prior fiscal
year adversely impacted revenues, principally due to changes in the rate of
exchange between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, the German mark, and the
French franc. The Company's risk management strategy uses derivative financial
instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of
hedging foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, and
other obligations which exist as a part of its ongoing business operations.
Autodesk does not enter into derivative contracts for the purpose of trading or
speculative transactions.  The Company's international results may also be
impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets.
The Company's international results have been impacted by recent unfavorable
economic and political conditions in the Asian markets as described above under
"Results of Operations - Net Revenues."  There can be no assurance that the
economic crisis and currency issues currently being experienced in these markets
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's future international
operations and consequently, on the Company's business and consolidated results
of operations.

Dependence on distribution channels.  The Company sells its software products
primarily to distributors and resellers (value-added resellers, or "VARs").
Autodesk's ability to effectively distribute products depends in part upon the
financial and business condition of its VAR network. Although the Company has
not to date experienced any material problems with its VAR network, computer
software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have
experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in
the future.  The loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of
the Company's major international distributors or large U.S. resellers could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and consolidated
results of operations in future periods. Autodesk's largest international
distributor is Computer 2000 AG in Germany.  Autodesk's largest resellers and
distributors in the United States are Ingram, Avatech, and DLT.

Product returns.  With the exception of certain European distributors,
agreements with the Company's VARs do not contain specific product-return
privileges. However, Autodesk permits its VARs to return product in certain
instances, generally during periods of product transition and during update
cycles. Although product returns, comparing the first quarter of fiscal 1999 to
the same period in the prior year, remained the same as a percentage of
consolidated revenues, management anticipates that product returns in future
periods will continue to be impacted by product update cycles, new product
releases, and software quality.

Autodesk establishes reserves, including reserves for stock balancing and
product rotation, based on estimated future returns of product and after taking
into account channel inventory levels, the timing of new product introductions,
and other factors. While the Company maintains strict measures to monitor
channel inventories and to provide appropriate reserves, actual product returns
may differ from the Company's reserve estimates, and such differences could be
material to Autodesk's consolidated financial statements.

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
Intellectual property.  The Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright
and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, and contractual
provisions to protect its proprietary rights. Despite such efforts to protect
the Company's proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy
aspects of the Company's software products or to obtain and use information that
Autodesk regards as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of the Company's
software products is time-consuming and costly. Although the Company is unable
to measure the extent to which piracy of its software products exists, software
piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. There can be no assurance
that the Company's means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate
or that its competitors will not independently develop similar technology. The
Company expects that software product developers will be increasingly subject to
infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in its industry
segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments
overlap. There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or
claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be
asserted against the Company or that any such assertions will not have a
material adverse effect on its business. Any such claims, whether with or
without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and
diversion of resources, cause product shipment delays, or require the Company to
enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, such royalty or license
agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and
consolidated results of operations.

The Company also relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties,
including software that is integrated with internally developed software and
used in its products to perform key functions. There can be no assurance that
these third-party software licenses will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms, or that the software will be appropriately
supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors. The loss of licenses, or
inability to support, maintain, and enhance any such software, could result in
increased costs, or in delays or reductions in product shipments until
equivalent software could be developed, identified, licensed, and integrated,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and
consolidated results of operations.

Risks associated with recent acquisitions and investments.  The Company
periodically acquires or invests in businesses, software products and
technologies which are complementary to the Company's business through strategic
alliances, debt and equity investments, joint ventures and the like.  The risks
associated with such acquisitions or investments include, among others, the
difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies, the
failure to realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of management's time
and attention.  In addition, such investments and acquisitions may involve
significant transaction-related costs.  There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in overcoming such risks or that such investments and
acquisitions will not have a material adverse impact upon the Company's
business, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, such
investments and acquisitions may contribute to potential fluctuations in
quarterly results of operations due to merger-related costs and charges
associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets
recorded in connection with acquisitions, any of which could negatively impact
results of operations for a given period or cause lack of linearity quarter to
quarter in the Company's operating results or financial condition.

As further described in Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements, on May 4, 1998, the Company acquired the mechanical applications
business of Genius CAD Software GmbH ("Genius"), a German limited liability
company, for $69 million in cash, which includes fees and expenses.  There can
be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the Genius asset purchase and
any future mergers, acquisitions, or asset purchases will be realized.

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
Attraction and Retention of Employees.  The continued growth and success of the
Company depends significantly on the continued service of highly skilled
employees.  Competition for these employees in today's marketplace, especially
in the technology industries, is intense.  The Company's ability to attract and
retain employees is dependent on a number of factors including its continued
ability to grant stock incentive awards.  There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in continuing to recruit new personnel and to retain
existing personnel.  The loss of one or more key employees or the Company's
inability to maintain existing employees or recruit new employees could have a
material adverse impact on the Company.  In addition, the Company may experience
increased compensation costs to attract and retain skilled personnel.

Impact of Year 2000.  Some of the computer programs used by the Company in its
internal operations rely on time-sensitive software that was written using two
digits rather than four to identify the applicable year.  These programs may
recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This
could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of
operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability to process
transactions, send invoices, or engage in similar normal business activities.
Additionally, as the Company is in the business of software production, year
2000 issues may affect the Company's products which are being sold externally.
The Company expects to successfully implement a six-phase year 2000 compliance
program and does not believe that the cost of such procedures will have a
material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.
There can be no assurance, however, that there will not be a delay in the
completion of these procedures or that the cost of such procedures will not
exceed original estimates, either of which could have a material adverse effect
on future results of operations.

In addition to correcting the business and operating systems used by the Company
in the ordinary course of business as described above, the Company has also
reviewed all products it currently produces internally for sale to third parties
to determine compliance of its products. Products currently sold either have
been found to be substantially compliant or are currently being tested for
compliance. However, many Autodesk products run on application systems produced
and sold by third-party vendors. There can be no assurance that these
application systems will be converted in a timely manner, and any failure in
this regard may cause Autodesk products not to function as designed. Any future
costs associated with ensuring that the Company's products are compliant with
the year 2000 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's
results of operations or financial position.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which consist primarily of
high-quality municipal bonds, tax-advantaged money market instruments and U.S.
treasury notes, totaled $367.6 million at April 30, 1998, compared to $301.3
million at January 31, 1998. The $66.3 million increase in cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities was due primarily to cash generated from
operations ($30.7 million) and cash proceeds from the issuance of shares through
employee stock option and stock purchase programs ($43.0 million). This increase
was partially offset by cash used to purchase computer equipment, furniture, and
leasehold improvements ($4.9 million); and to pay dividends on the Company's
common stock ($2.8 million).

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
The Company sold put warrants to an independent third party in December 1997
that entitled the holder of the warrants to sell 1.5 million shares of common
stock to the Company at $38.12 per share.  Additionally, the Company purchased
call options from the same independent third party that entitled the Company to
buy 1 million shares at $39.88 per share. The premiums received with respect to
the equity options totaled $4.5 million and equaled the premiums paid.
Consequently, there was no exchange of cash.  At any given date, the amounts
potentially subject to market risk were generally limited to the amount by which
the per share price of the put warrants exceeds the market value of the
Company's common stock.  The put warrants permitted a net share settlement at
the Company's option.  In March 1998, the Company exercised the call option,
electing the net share settlement option and retired approximately 97,000 shares
of its common stock.  The put warrants expired unexercised.

The Company has an unsecured $40 million bank line of credit, of which $20
million is guaranteed, that may be used from time to time to facilitate short-
term cash flow. At April 30, 1998, there were no borrowings outstanding under
this credit agreement, which expires in January 1999.

The Company's principal commitments at April 30, 1998 consisted of obligations
under operating leases for facilities.  The Company believes that its existing
cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available line of credit, and
cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its currently
anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months.

Longer-term cash requirements, other than normal operating expenses, are
anticipated for development of new software products and enhancement of existing
products; financing anticipated growth; dividend payments; repurchases of the
Company's common stock; and the acquisition of businesses, software products, or
technologies complementary to the Company's business. The Company believes that
its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, available line of

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
- ---------------------------

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In May 1998, final judgment was entered in the Vermont Microsystems, Inc.
("VMI") trade secret litigation in the amount of $7.8 million plus accrued
interest.  Following entry of judgment, final payment of approximately $8.4
million was made to VMI and charged against a previously recorded litigation
accrual, and the remainder of the escrow account returned to Autodesk.  As a
result, the Company plans to record a credit to operating income during the
second quarter of fiscal year 1999 that reflects excess litigation accruals.
