Item 5.  Other Events.

     On January 18, 1999, the Registrant, Autodesk Development B.V.
("Dutchco"), 9066-9771 Quebec Inc., Autodesk Canada Inc., 9066-9854 Quebec
Inc. and Discreet Logic Inc. ("Discreet") entered into Amendment No. 2 to the
Second Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Acquisition and Amalgamation
(the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment further amends the original
acquisition agreement entered into by and among the parties on August 20,
1998, as subsequently amended and restated on September 23, 1998, as
subsequently amended and restated on November 18, 1998, and as subsequently
amended on December 18, 1998 (the "Original Agreeement"). Pursuant to the
Second Amendment, among other things, Dutchco, an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of the Registrant, ultimately will exchange 0.33 shares of the
Registrant's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Autodesk Common
Stock"), for each outstanding common share of Discreet, no par value per share
(each a "Discreet Common Share"), which reduces the previously announced
exchange ratio of 0.48 shares of Autodesk Common Stock for each Discreet
Common Share. In addition, the Second Amendment provides for the extension of 
certain dates under the Original Agreement.

     The acquisition by the Registrant of Discreet is expected to be accounted
for as a pooling-of-interests and its consummation is subject to a number of
conditions specified in the Original Agreement, as amended, including approval
of the Registrant's stockholders and Discreet's shareholders. The Second
Amendment and the Registrant's press release announcing the Second Amendment
are filed as exhibits to this Report.

          AUTODESK REPORTS RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END REVENUES
                                        
SAN RAFAEL, CA. - February 24, 1999 -- Autodesk, Inc. today announced financial
results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 1999.  For the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999, Autodesk reported record net revenue of
$189.1 million versus $181.8 million for the same quarter a year ago.  Net
revenue for fiscal year 1999 also hit a record at $740.2 million, an increase of
20 percent over the revenue last year.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 net income was $25.1 million, or $0.50 per
share on a diluted basis, including the impact of the revaluation of in-process
research and development charges from the acquisitions of Softdesk and Genius,
and the incremental amortization of the associated goodwill and intangible
assets.  Excluding these costs, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year
1999 was $26.7 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.54.

Net income for fiscal year 1999 was $90.6 million, and resulted in $1.85 per
share on a diluted basis, including non-recurring charges as well as incremental
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets from prior acquisitions.
Excluding these costs, net income for fiscal year 1999 was $102.5 million, or
$2.10 per share on a diluted basis.

All vertical design markets posted record revenues during fiscal year 1999, with
sales more than doubling over the previous fiscal year.  Driven by strong demand
for Mechanical Desktopa and Genius products, the MCAD group led the performance
of the vertical markets, with sales increasing 185 percent year over year.  AEC
revenues increased over 50 percent for the year, fueled by strong performance
from Architectural 
<PAGE>
 
Desktop and Land Development Desktop. The success of the GIS product family
continued, with sales nearly doubling over the prior year.

The Personal Solutions Group and Kinetix(R) also reported record results for
fiscal year 1999, driven by strong demand for AutoCAD LT(R), 3D Studio MAX(R)
and 3D Studio VIZ(R). The AutoCAD(R) brand remained strong throughout the
year, with both new seat and upgrade revenues increasing over the previous
year.

"We are proud to have achieved revenue growth of 20 percent or better for the
second consecutive year," said Carol Bartz, CEO of Autodesk.  "Our goal was to
expand our product line with vertical solutions that satisfy the design needs of
our customers.  We have achieved this goal, and Autodesk now provides families
of products that can solve nearly any design problem -- ranging from simple
diagramming to complex 3D visualization.  No other single company can provide
such a complete set of design tools."

A summary of Autodesk's financial results is as follows:
