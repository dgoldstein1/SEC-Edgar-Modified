  AUTODESK TO APPEAL RULING IN VERMONT MICROSYSTEMS LAWSUIT


  San Rafael, Calif. -- December 27, 1994 -- Autodesk, Inc. announced
  that a United States District Judge in Vermont issued an opinion
  ruling in favor of the plaintiff in a trade secret suit brought
  against Autodesk.  The suit, Vermont Microsystems, Inc. v. Autodesk,
  Inc., involved programming techniques used in developing a display
  list driver that was included in AutoCAD Release 12 for Windows and
  AutoCAD LT.  Autodesk strongly denies any wrongdoing and intends to
  appeal this decision.

  The Court awarded $25.5 million to Vermont Microsystems.  However,
  the Court rejected the plaintiff's claim that Autodesk acted
  maliciously or willfully and declined to issue any injunction against
  Autodesk.

  "We are disappointed that the Court did not provide greater
  guidance in the complex arena of intellectual property and what a
  company may reasonably claim as a trade secret," noted Sandra Marin,
  Autodesk's Vice President and General Counsel, adding "This is
  particularly relevant in the software industry, where past experience
  and creative efforts play a major role in product development
  efforts."

  While Autodesk intends to appeal this judgment, and continues to
  vigorously deny any wrongdoing in this matter, the Company will record
  a pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $26 million in its
  fourth fiscal quarter ending January 31, 1995, resulting in a $0.32 to
  $0.35 impact on earnings per share.

  Autodesk is the world's leading supplier of computer-aided design
  automation software and the fifth-largest PC software company in the
  world.  The company develops, markets and supports a family of design
  automation and professional multimedia software and component
  technologies for use on personal computers and workstations.  A global
  company since its founding in 1982, Autodesk markets products in 115
  countries and 18 languages.  Autodesk shares are traded on the Nasdaq
  National Market under the symbol ACAD.  For more information, please
