OVERVIEW
 
    Yahoo! Inc. ("Yahoo!" or the "Company") is a global Internet media company
that offers a branded network of comprehensive information, communication, and
shopping services to millions of users daily. As the first online navigational
guide to the World Wide Web (the "Web"), www.yahoo.com is a leading guide in
terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user reach, and is one of
the most recognized brands associated with the Internet. The Company was
incorporated in California on March 5, 1995 and commenced operations on that
date. In August 1995, the Company commenced selling advertisements on its Web
pages and recognized its initial revenues. In April 1996, the Company completed
its initial public offering.
 
    On October 20, 1997, the Company completed the acquisition of Four11
Corporation ("Four11"), a privately-held online communications and Internet
directory company. Under the terms of the acquisition, which was accounted for
as a pooling of interests, the Company exchanged 6,022,880 shares of Yahoo!
Common Stock for all of Four11's outstanding shares and assumed 593,344 options
and warrants to purchase Yahoo! Common Stock. During the quarter ended December
31, 1997, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $3.9 million for the
acquisition. These costs consisted of investment banking fees, legal and
accounting fees, redundancy costs, and certain other expenses directly related
to the acquisition. The consolidated financial statements for the three years
ended December 31, 1998 and the accompanying notes reflect the Company's
financial position and the results of operations as if Four11 was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company since inception.
 
    On June 10, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding
shares of Viaweb Inc. ("Viaweb"), a provider of software and services for
hosting online stores, through the issuance of 1,574,364 shares of Yahoo! Common
Stock. All outstanding options to purchase Viaweb common stock were converted
into options to purchase 244,504 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock. The acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 16. Under the purchase method of
accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of the
acquisition. Results of operations for Viaweb have been included with those of
the Company for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition.
 
    The total purchase price of the acquisition was $48.6 million including
acquisition expenses of $1.8 million. Of the purchase price, $15.0 million was
assigned to in-process research and development and expensed upon the
consummation of the acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as
determined by the Company and pursuant to discussions with the Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Staff").
 
    Among the factors considered in discussions with the Staff in determining
the amount of the allocation of the purchase price to in-process research and
development were various factors such as estimating the stage of development of
each in-process research and development project at the date of acquisition,
estimating cash flows resulting from the expected revenues generated from such
projects, and discounting the net cash flows, in addition to other assumptions.
The remaining identified intangibles, including the value of purchased
technology and other intangibles will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
three and seven years, respectively. Amortization expense of purchased
technology and other intangible assets was $2.9 million and $2.0 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1998. In addition, other factors
were considered in discussions with the Staff in determining the value assigned
to purchased in-process technology such as research projects in areas supporting
the online store technology (including significant enhancement to the ability of
the product to support multiple users and multiple servers), developing
functionality to support the ability to process credit card orders, and
enhancing the product's user interface by developing functionality that would
allow the product to be used outside of the United States. If none of these
projects is successfully developed, the Company's sales and profitability may be
adversely affected in future
 
                                       2
<PAGE>
periods. Additionally, the failure of any particular individual project in
process could impair the value of other intangible assets acquired. The Company
began to benefit from the purchased in-process technology in late 1998.
 
    Yahoo! is continuing the development efforts associated with online store
technology, credit card processing and to a lesser extent international
functionality. The development efforts with respect to the online store
technology and credit card processing are on schedule with Yahoo!'s original
assumptions with various features having been introduced as of December 31,
1998. Given the complexities of completing the international functionality,
Yahoo! continues to make progress in the development of these features and now
expects to be substantially complete by the end of June 1999.
 
    On July 17, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of WebCal
Corporation ("WebCal"), a privately-held developer and marketer of Web-based
calendaring and scheduling products, and publisher of EventCal, a comprehensive
database of world-wide public events. Under the terms of the acquisition, which
was accounted for as a pooling of interests, the Company exchanged 541,908
shares of Yahoo! Common Stock for all of WebCal's outstanding shares. The
historical operations of WebCal are not material to the Company's financial
position or results of operations, therefore, prior period financial statements
have not been restated for this acquisition.
 
    On October 20, 1998, the Company acquired Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc.
("Yoyodyne"), a privately-held, direct marketing services company. Under the
terms of the acquisition, which was accounted for as a pooling of interests, the
Company exchanged 561,244 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock and options and warrants
to purchase Yahoo! Common Stock for all of Yoyodyne's outstanding shares,
options, and warrants. The consolidated financial statements for the three years
ended December 31, 1998 and the accompanying notes reflect the Company's
financial position and the results of operations as if Yoyodyne was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company since inception. During October 1998, the
Company recorded a one-time charge of $2.1 million for acquisition-related
costs. These costs consisted of broker fees, legal and accounting fees, and
certain other expenses directly related to the acquisition.
 
    On December 17, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
outstanding shares of HyperParallel, Inc. ("HyperParallel"), a company
specializing in data analysis, through the issuance of 74,856 shares of Yahoo!
Common Stock and approximately $700,000 of cash totaling $8.1 million including
acquisition costs. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance
with APB 16. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Results of operations for
HyperParallel have been included with those of the Company for periods
subsequent to the acquisition.
 
    Approximately $2.3 million of the total purchase price was allocated to
in-process research and development. This amount was developed by estimating the
stage of development of each in-process research and development project at the
date of the acquisition, estimating incremental cash flows generated from such
projects, and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a
discount rate of 35%, which represents a premium to the Company's cost of
capital to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful
development of the purchased in-process technology. The projections were based
on management's estimates of market size and growth, expected trends in
advertising and technology, expected research and development and selling and
general administrative expenditures, and the expected timing of new product
introductions. Approximately $1.2 million of the total purchase price was
allocated to existing technology which is being amortized over 3 years. The
value of the existing technology was developed based on similar assumptions
using a discount rate of 25%. The projections used in developing the values
should not be considered an accurate predictor of future performance for several
reasons, including the consideration of many factors outside the control of the
Company. The remaining purchase price of approximately $4.6 million was
allocated to goodwill
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
which is being amortized over 7 years. Tangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed were not material to the Company's financial statements.
 
    The value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined by
identifying three research projects in-progress as of the acquisition date.
These three research projects in-progress focus on technologies surrounding
search tools. Two of the application oriented development projects were 70% and
20% complete as of the acquisition date. These projects are expected to be
completed in the first and fourth quarters, respectively, of 1999. The remaining
project relates to the next release of the current search tool which was
approximately 20% complete as of the acquisition date and is expected to be
completed in the fourth quarter of 1999. Future research and development costs
to be incurred on the individual in-process projects are not expected to be
material to Yahoo!'s financial position or results of operations. In addition,
if none of these projects were successfully developed, Yahoo!'s revenues and
profitability would not be materially adversely affected.
 
    On January 28, 1999, the Company announced the signing of a definitive
agreement to acquire GeoCities, a publicly traded Internet company. Under the
terms of the acquisition, which will be accounted for as a pooling of interests,
the Company will exchange approximately 21,254,000 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock
for approximately 31,403,000 shares of GeoCities common stock. Additionally, the
Company will convert approximately 8,894,000 GeoCities stock options into
approximately 6,019,000 Yahoo! stock options. The acquisition is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 1999 and is subject to certain conditions,
regulatory approval, and approval by GeoCities stockholders. The Company expects
to record a one-time charge in the second quarter of 1999 relating to expenses
incurred with this transaction. GeoCities' operating results for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 included revenues of approximately $18.4
million, $4.6 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, and net losses of
approximately $19.8 million, $8.9 million, and $3.0 million, respectively.
 
    The Company's revenues are derived principally from the sale of banner and
sponsorship advertisements. The Company's standard rates for banner advertising
currently range from approximately $6.00 per thousand impressions for run of
network to approximately $90.00 per thousand impressions for highly targeted
audiences and properties. To date, the duration of the Company's banner
advertising commitments has ranged from one week to two years. Sponsorship
advertising contracts have longer terms (ranging from three months to two years)
than standard banner advertising contracts and also involve more integration
with Yahoo! services, such as the placement of buttons that provide users with
direct links to the advertiser's Web site. Advertising revenues on both banner
and sponsorship contracts are recognized ratably over the period in which the
advertisement is displayed, provided that no significant Company obligations
remain at the end of a period and collection of the resulting receivable is
probable. Company obligations typically include guarantees of minimum number of
"impressions," or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users
of the Company's online properties. To the extent minimum guaranteed impressions
are not met, the Company defers recognition of the corresponding revenues until
the remaining guaranteed impression levels are achieved. The Company also earns
revenue on sponsorship contracts from fees relating to the design, coordination,
and integration of customers' content and links into Yahoo! online media
properties. These development fees are recognized as revenue once the related
activities have been performed and the customer's Web links are available on
Yahoo! online media properties. A number of the Company's agreements provide
that Yahoo! receive revenues from electronic commerce transactions. Currently,
these revenues are recognized by the Company upon notification from the
advertiser of revenues earned by Yahoo!. Revenues from barter transactions are
recognized during the period in which the advertisements are displayed in Yahoo!
properties. Barter transactions are recorded at the fair value of the goods or
services provided or received, whichever is more readily determinable in the
circumstances. To date, revenues from development fees, electronic commerce
transactions, and barter transactions have each been less than 10% of net
revenues.

    In August 1996, the Company entered into agreements with Visa International
Service Association ("VISA") and another party (together, the "Visa Group") to
establish a limited liability company, Yahoo! Marketplace L.L.C., to develop and
operate a navigational service focused on information and resources for the
purchase of consumer products and services over the Internet. During July 1997,
prior to the completion of significant business activities and public launch of
the property, the Company and VISA entered into an agreement under which the
Visa Group released the Company from certain obligations and claims. In
connection with this agreement, Yahoo! issued 2,797,924 shares of Yahoo! Common
Stock to the Visa Group, for which the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash,
pre-tax charge of $21.2 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 1997.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
    NET REVENUES.  Net revenues were $203.3 million, $70.5 million , and $21.5
million for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. The
increases from year to year are due primarily to the increasing number of
advertisers purchasing space on the Company's online media properties as well as
larger and longer-term purchases by certain advertisers. Approximately 3,800
customers advertised on the Company's online media properties during 1998 as
compared to approximately 2,600 and 700 in 1997 and 1996, respectively. No one
customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during the years ended
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and SOFTBANK and its related companies ("SOFTBANK")
accounted for 11% of net revenues during 1996. Advertising purchases by
SOFTBANK, a 30% shareholder of the Company at December 31, 1998, accounted for
approximately 5% and 4% of net revenues during the years ended December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively. Contracted prices on these orders are comparable to
those given to other major customers of the Company. International revenues have
accounted for less than 10% of net revenues during the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997, and 1996. Barter revenues also represented less than 10% of net
revenues during those periods. There can be no assurance that customers will
continue to purchase advertising on the Company's Web pages, that advertisers
will not make smaller and shorter term purchases, or that market prices for
Web-based advertising will not decrease due to competitive or other factors.
Additionally, while the Company has experienced strong revenue growth during the
last three years, management does not believe that this level of revenue growth
will be sustained in future periods.
 
    COST OF REVENUES.  Cost of revenues consists of the expenses associated with
the production and usage of Yahoo! and the Company's other online media
properties. These costs primarily consist of fees paid to third parties for
content included on the Company's online media properties, Internet connection
charges, amortization of purchased technology, prize awards, equipment
depreciation, and compensation. Cost of revenues were $26.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998, or 13% of net revenues, as compared to $10.9 million,
or 15% of net revenues, and $4.7 million, or 22% of net revenues, for the years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The absolute dollar increases in
cost of revenues from year to year are primarily attributable to an increase in
the quantity of content available on the Company's online media properties, the
increased usage of these properties, and the amortization of technology
purchased in the Viaweb acquisition. The Company anticipates that its content
and Internet connection expenses will increase with the quantity and quality of
content available on Yahoo! online media properties, and increased usage of
these properties. As measured in page views (defined as electronic page
displays), the Company delivered an average of approximately 167 million page
views per day in December 1998 compared with an average of approximately 65
million page views per day in December 1997 and an average of approximately 20
million page views per day in December 1996. Yahoo! Japan, an unconsolidated
joint venture of the Company that began operations in April 1996, is included in
these page views figures and accounted for an average of approximately 13
million per day in December 1998, an average of approximately 5 million per day
in December 1997, and an average of approximately 1.4 million per day in
December 1996. The Company anticipates that its content and Internet connection
expenses will continue to increase in absolute
 
                                       5
<PAGE>
dollars for the foreseeable future. The Company currently anticipates cost of
revenues will be in the range of 10% to 13% of net revenues for 1999, however,
anticipated spending levels may vary as a result of acquisitions and future
business combinations.
 
    SALES AND MARKETING.  Sales and marketing expenses were $92.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998, or 45% of net revenues. For the years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1996, sales and marketing expenses were $45.8 million and
$16.2 million, or 65% and 75% of net revenues, respectively. Sales and marketing
expenses consist primarily of advertising and other marketing-related expenses
(which include distribution costs), compensation and employee-related expenses,
sales commissions, and travel costs. The year-to-year increases in absolute
dollars are primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and
distribution costs associated with the Company's aggressive brand-building
strategy, increases in compensation expense associated with growth in its direct
sales force and marketing personnel, expansion in the international subsidiaries
with the addition of subsidiaries in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom
during 1996, Sweden, Australia, Singapore, Korea, Denmark, and Norway during
1997, and Italy, Hong Kong, and Spain as well as Yahoo! guides in Spanish and
Mandarin Chinese languages during 1998, and an increase in sales commissions
associated with the increase in revenues. The Company anticipates that sales and
marketing expenses in absolute dollars will increase in future periods as it
continues to pursue an aggressive brand-building strategy through advertising
and distribution, continues to expand its international operations, and
continues to build its global direct sales organization. As a percentage of net
revenues, the Company currently anticipates that sales and marketing expenses
will be in the range of 40% to 43% for 1999, however, anticipated spending
levels may vary as a result of acquisitions and future business combinations.
 
    PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  Product development expenses were $22.7 million, or
11% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to $12.1
million and $5.7 million, or 17% and 27% of net revenues for the years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Product development expenses consist
primarily of employee compensation relating to developing and enhancing the
features and functionality of Yahoo! online media properties. The year-to-year
increases in absolute dollars are primarily attributable to increases in the
number of engineers that develop and enhance Yahoo! online media properties. To
date, all internal product development costs have been expensed as incurred. The
Company believes that significant investments in product development are
required to remain competitive. Consequently, the Company expects to incur
increased product development expenditures in absolute dollars in future
periods. As a percentage of net revenues, the Company currently anticipates that
product development expenses will range from 10% to 12% during 1999, however,
anticipated spending levels may vary as a result of acquisitions and future
business combinations.
 
    GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative expenses were $11.2
million, or 6% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to
$7.4 million and $5.8 million, or 10% and 27% of net revenues for the years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of compensation and fees for professional services,
and the year-to-year increases in absolute dollars are primarily attributable to
increases in these areas. The Company believes that the absolute dollar level of
general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods, as a result
of an increase in personnel and increased fees for professional services. As a
percentage of net revenues, the Company currently anticipates that general and
administrative expenses will approximate 5% during 1999, however, anticipated
spending levels may vary as a result of acquisitions and future business
combinations.
 
    AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES.  As part of the Viaweb acquisition, the Company
recorded an intangible asset related to goodwill in the amount of $24.3 million.
This asset is being amortized over a seven-year period beginning in June 1998.
 
    OTHER--NON-RECURRING COSTS.  During June 1998, the Company completed the
acquisition of all outstanding shares of Viaweb through the issuance of
1,574,364 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock. All
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
outstanding options to purchase Viaweb common stock were converted into options
to purchase 244,504 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock. During the quarter ended June
30, 1998, the Company recorded a non-recurring charge of $15.0 million for
in-process research and development that had not yet reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use. On October 20, 1998, the Company
completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares, options, and warrants of
Yoyodyne through the issuance of 561,244 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock and
options and warrants to purchase Yahoo! Common Stock. During the quarter ended
December 31, 1998, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $2.1
million for expenses incurred with the transaction. During December 1998, the
Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of HyperParallel
through the issuance of 74,856 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock and some cash.
During the quarter ended December 31, 1998, the Company recorded a non-recurring
charge of $2.3 million for in-process research and development that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
 
    During July 1997, the Company and VISA entered into an agreement under which
the Visa Group released the Company from certain obligations and claims. In
connection with this agreement, Yahoo! issued 2,797,924 shares of Yahoo! Common
Stock to the Visa Group, for which the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash,
pre-tax charge of $21.2 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 1997. In
conjunction with the October 1997 acquisition of Four11 Corporation, the Company
recorded a one-time charge of $3.9 million which consisted of investment banking
fees, legal and accounting fees, redundancy costs, and certain other expenses
directly related to the acquisition.
 
    INVESTMENT INCOME, NET.  Investment income, net of expense, was $14.6
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to $4.5 million and $4.0
million for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The
increase from 1997 to 1998 is primarily attributable to a higher average
investment balance, principally due to proceeds of $250.0 million received by
the Company on July 14, 1998 from a private placement of shares to SOFTBANK.
Investment income in future periods may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in
average cash balances maintained by the Company and changes in the market rates
of its investments.
 
    MINORITY INTERESTS IN OPERATIONS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.  Minority
interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries were $68,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1998 compared to $727,000 and $540,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The decrease from 1997 to 1998 is
primarily attributable to near break-even results in the European and Korean
joint ventures in the aggregate. The increase from 1996 to 1997 is primarily
attributable to the staggered launch dates of the joint ventures. Yahoo! Europe
operations began during the third quarter of 1996 and Yahoo! Korea operations
started in the third quarter of 1997. The Company expects that minority
interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries in the aggregate will
continue to fluctuate in future periods as a function of the results from
consolidated subsidiaries. When, and if, the consolidated subsidiaries become
profitable, the minority interests adjustment on the statement of operations
will reduce the Company's net income by the minority partners' share of the
subsidiaries' net income.
 
    INCOME TAXES.  Yahoo! recorded an income tax provision of $17.8 million in
1998. At December 31, 1998, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards and
research tax credit carryforwards, which if not utilized, will begin to expire
in 2003 through 2010. Deferred tax assets totaled $152.7 million of which
approximately $141 million relates to net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards from the exercise of stock options. When recognized, the
tax benefit of the loss and credit carryforwards is accounted for as a credit to
additional paid-in capital rather than as a reduction of income tax expense. The
Company has a valuation allowance of $135.1 million for deferred tax assets for
which realization is not more-likely-than-not. The Company's 1998 estimated
income tax rate was impacted during the year by the release of the prior year's
valuation allowance, nondeductible acquisition-related charges, and
pre-acquisition losses of companies acquired in 1998.
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
    NET INCOME (LOSS).  The Company recorded net income of $25.6 million or
$0.11 per share diluted for the year ended December 31,1998 compared to net
losses of $25.5 million and $6.4 million, or $0.15, and $0.04 per share diluted
for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Excluding the
effect of the non-recurring charge of $19.4 million incurred in connection with
various 1998 acquisitions and the amortization of $2.9 million and $2.0 million
from the purchased technology and intangible assets acquired in the purchase of
Viaweb, the Company earned $49.9 million or $0.22 per share diluted for the year
ended December 31, 1998. Excluding the effect of the one-time, non-cash, pre-tax
charge of $21.2 million recorded for the restructuring of the Yahoo! Marketplace
agreements with the Visa Group and the one-time charge of $3.9 million recorded
for costs incurred for the acquisition of Four11, the Company's net loss was
$0.4 million or $0.00 per share diluted for the year ended December 31, 1997.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
    Yahoo! invests excess cash predominantly in debt instruments that are highly
liquid, of high-quality investment grade, and predominantly have maturities of
less than one year with the intent to make such funds readily available for
operating purposes. At December 31, 1998, the Company had cash and cash
equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities totaling $482.4
million compared to $108.0 million at December 31, 1997. For the year ended
December 31, 1998, cash provided by operating activities was $110.3 million
compared to cash provided by operating activities of $0.5 million and cash used
for operating activities of $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 1997
and 1996, respectively.
 
    For the year ended December 31, 1998, cash provided by operating activities
of $110.3 million was primarily due to earnings, before non-recurring charges of
$17.3 million and depreciation and amortization of $10.2 million, increases in
deferred revenue (due to invoicing and cash receipts in excess of revenue) and
accrued liabilities, and tax benefits from stock option plans. The increase in
deferred revenue relates principally to overall significant growth in revenue
and increases in advanced payments on several new and relatively longer
sponsorship agreements. For the year ended December 31, 1997, cash provided by
operating activities of $0.5 million was primarily due to increases in accrued
liabilities and deferred revenue, substantially offset by increases in prepaid
expenses and other assets, which resulted primarily from a $5.0 million one-time
non-refundable license payment to Netscape under the Netscape Guide by Yahoo!
agreement and a $2.9 million payment to Netscape under the international
Netscape Net Search program agreement. For the year ended December 31, 1996,
cash used by operating activities was $2.4 million.
 
    Cash used in investing activities was $329.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998. Purchases (net of sales and maturities) of investments in
marketable securities and other assets during the period were $312.8 million and
capital expenditures totaled $11.9 million. Capital expenditures have generally
been comprised of purchases of computer hardware and software as well as
leasehold improvements related to leased facilities, and are expected to
increase in future periods. Cash provided by investing activities was $19.6
million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Sales and maturities (net of
purchases) of investments in marketable securities during the period were $27.9
million and capital expenditures totaled $6.7 million. Cash used in investing
activities was $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. Purchases
(net of sales and maturities) of investments in marketable securities and other
assets during the period were $72.0 million and capital expenditures totaled
$3.4 million.
 
    For the year ended December 31, 1998, cash provided by financing activities
of $281.3 million was due primarily to the issuance of Common Stock to SOFTBANK
in the amount of $250.0 million during July 1998 and the issuance of Common
Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31,
1997, cash provided by financing activities of $9.6 million was due primarily to
the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options. For the
year ended December 31,
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
1996, cash provided by financing activities of $107.2 million was primarily due
to the March 1996 issuance of 5.1 million shares of Convertible Series C
Preferred Stock for aggregate proceeds of $63.8 million, the April 1996 initial
public offering of 17.9 million shares of Common Stock for net proceeds of $35.1
million, and other issuances of Common Stock.
 
    The Company currently has no material commitments other than those under
operating lease agreements. The Company has experienced a substantial increase
in its capital expenditures and operating lease arrangements since its
inception, which is consistent with increased staffing, and anticipates that
this will continue in the future. Additionally, the Company will continue to
evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, and
technologies that are complementary to those of the Company, which may require
the use of cash. Management believes existing cash and investments will be
sufficient to meet the Company's operating requirements for at least the next
twelve months; however, the Company may sell additional equity or debt
securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance its liquidity
position. The sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution
to the Company's shareholders.
 
YEAR 2000 IMPLICATIONS
 
    Many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to
accept only two-digit entries in the date code field and cannot distinguish 21st
century dates from 20th century dates. These date code fields will need to
distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates and, as a result, many
companies' software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in
order to comply with such "Year 2000" requirements. The Company is in the
process of assessing the Year 2000 issue and expects to complete the program by
the spring of 1999. The Company has not incurred material costs to date in this
process, and currently does not believe that the cost of additional actions will
have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
Although Yahoo! currently believes that its systems are Year 2000 compliant in
all material respects, the current systems and products may contain undetected
errors or defects with Year 2000 date functions that may result in material
costs. Although Yahoo! is not aware of any material operational issues or costs
associated with preparing its internal systems for the Year 2000, the Company
may experience serious unanticipated negative consequences (such as significant
downtime for one or more Yahoo! Media properties) or material costs caused by
undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems. In
addition, the Company utilizes third-party equipment, software and content,
including non-information technology systems ("non-IT systems"), such as its
security system, building equipment, and non-IT systems embedded
microcontrollers that may not be Year 2000 compliant. The Company is in the
process of developing a plan to assess whether these third parties are
adequately addressing the Year 2000 issue and whether any of its non-IT systems
have material Year 2000 compliance problems. Failure of such third-party
equipment, software, or content to operate properly with regard to the year 2000
and thereafter could require the Company to incur unanticipated expenses to
remedy any problems, which could have a material adverse effect on its business,
results of operations, and financial condition. Yahoo! is in the process of
fully developing a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may
result if it is unable to achieve Year 2000 readiness of its critical
operations. Finally, the Company is also subject to external forces that might
generally affect industry and commerce, such as utility or transportation
company Year 2000 compliance failures and related service interruptions.
Furthermore, the purchasing patterns of advertisers may be affected by Year 2000
issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current
systems for Year 2000 compliance. The Company does not currently have any
information about the Year 2000 status of its advertising customers. However,
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available for Web advertising or
sponsorship of Web services, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
    The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign
currency fluctuations, and change in the market values of its investments.
 
    INTEREST RATE RISK.  The Company's exposure to market rate risk for changes
in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio. The
Company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment
portfolio. The Company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S.
Government and its agencies, and in high-quality corporate issuers and, by
policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company
protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default, market and
reinvestment risk.
 
    Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning
instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may
have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates,
while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest
rates fall. Due in part to these factors, the Company's future investment income
may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the Company
may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined
in market value due to changes in interest rates.
 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.  International revenues from the Company's foreign
subsidiaries were less than 10% of total revenues. International sales are made
mostly from the Company's foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective
countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country.
These subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency.
Accordingly, all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional
currency.
 
    The Company's international business is subject to risks typical of an
international business, including, but not limited to differing economic
conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other
regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. Accordingly,
the Company's future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes
in these or other factors.
 
    The Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part
from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the United States are
charged to the Company's foreign sales subsidiaries. These intercompany accounts
are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary
in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the
United States. The Company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations
as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars in consolidation. As exchange rates vary, these results, when
translated, may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected
profitability. The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company
in 1998 was not material.
 
    INVESTMENT RISK.  The Company invests in equity instruments of
privately-held, information technology companies for business and strategic
purposes. These investments are included in other long-term assets and are
accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than 20%. For these
non-quoted investments, the Company's policy is to regularly review the
assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in
assessing the carrying values. The Company identifies and records impairment
losses on long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such
assets might be impaired. To date, no such impairment has been recorded. During
1998, certain of these investments in privately-held companies became marketable
equity securities when the investees completed initial public offerings. Such
investments, which are in the Internet industry, are subject to significant
fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market, and
are recorded as long-term investments.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Yahoo! Inc.
 
    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Yahoo! Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1  THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
    THE COMPANY.  Yahoo! Inc. ("Yahoo!" or the "Company") is a global Internet
media company that offers a branded network of comprehensive information,
communication, and shopping services to millions of users daily. The Company was
incorporated in California on March 5, 1995 and commenced operations on that
date. The Company conducts its business within one industry segment.
 
    On October 20, 1998 and 1997, the Company consummated its acquisitions of
Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc. ("Yoyodyne") and Four11 Corporation ("Four11"),
respectively, upon which Yoyodyne's and Four11's shareholders exchanged all of
their shares for shares of the Company's Common Stock in business combinations
that were accounted for as pooling of interests. The consolidated financial
statements for the three years ended December 31, 1998 and the accompanying
notes reflect the Company's financial position and the results of operations as
if Yoyodyne and Four11 were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company since
inception.
 
    Components of the consolidated results of operations of Yahoo! and of Four11
and Yoyodyne prior to their acquisitions by Yahoo! are as follows (in
thousands):

    STOCK SPLITS.  During July 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one Common Stock split. Shareholders of record on July 17, 1998 (the
record date) received one additional share for every share held on that date.
The shares were distributed on July 31, 1998 and the stock split was effective
on August 3, 1998. During January 1999, the Company's Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one Common Stock split. Shareholders of record on January 22,
1999 (the record date) received one additional share for every share held on
that date. The shares were distributed on February 5, 1999 and the stock split
was effective on February 8, 1999. All share numbers in these consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto for all periods presented have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one common stock splits.
 
    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Yahoo! Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The equity and net
loss attributable to the minority shareholder interests that related to the
Company's subsidiaries, are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets
and consolidated statements of operations, respectively. Losses in excess of the
minority interest equity would be charged against the Company. Investments in
entities owned 20% or more but less than

NOTE 1  THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
majority owned and not otherwise controlled by the Company are accounted for
under the equity method.
 
    RECLASSIFICATIONS.  Certain prior years' balances have been reclassified to
conform with the current year's presentation.
 
    REVENUE RECOGNITION.  The Company's revenues are derived principally from
the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. The Company's standard rates
for banner advertising currently range from approximately $6.00 per thousand
impressions for run of network to approximately $90.00 per thousand impressions
for highly targeted audiences and properties. To date, the duration of the
Company's banner advertising commitments has ranged from one week to two years.
Sponsorship advertising contracts have longer terms (ranging from three months
to two years) than standard banner advertising contracts and also involve more
integration with Yahoo! services, such as the placement of buttons that provide
users with direct links to the advertiser's Web site. Advertising revenues on
both banner and sponsorship contracts are recognized ratably over the period in
which the advertisement is displayed, provided that no significant Company
obligations remain at the end of a period and collection of the resulting
receivable is probable. Company obligations typically include guarantees of
minimum number of "impressions," or times that an advertisement appears in pages
viewed by users of the Company's online properties. To the extent minimum
guaranteed impressions are not met, the Company defers recognition of the
corresponding revenues until the remaining guaranteed impression levels are
achieved.
 
    The Company also earns revenue on sponsorship contracts from fees relating
to the design, coordination, and integration of customers' content and links
into Yahoo! online media properties. These development fees are recognized as
revenue once the related activities have been performed and the customer's Web
links are available on Yahoo! online media properties. A number of the Company's
agreements provide that Yahoo! receive revenues from electronic commerce
transactions. Currently, these revenues are recognized by the Company upon
notification from the advertiser of revenues earned by Yahoo!. Revenues from
barter transactions are recognized during the period in which the advertisements
are displayed in Yahoo! properties. Barter transactions are recorded at the fair
value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily
determinable in the circumstances. To date, revenues from development fees,
electronic commerce transactions, and barter transactions have each been less
than 10% of net revenues.
 
    No one customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during 1998 and
1997, and SOFTBANK and its related companies ("SOFTBANK"), a holder of
approximately 30% of the Company's Common Stock at December 31, 1998, accounted
for 11% of net revenues during 1996 (see Note 4).
 
    Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of billings in excess of recognized
revenue relating to advertising contracts and payments received pursuant to
sponsorship advertising contracts in advance of revenue recognition.
 
    PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  Costs incurred in the classification and organization
of listings within Yahoo! properties and the development of new products and
enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred. Material
software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological
feasibility are capitalized. Based upon the Company's product development
process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working
model. Costs incurred by the

NOTE 1  THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Company between completion of the working model and the point at which the
product is ready for general release have been insignificant.
 
    ADVERTISING COSTS.  Advertising production costs are recorded as expense the
first time an advertisement appears. All other advertising costs are expensed as
incurred. The Company does not incur any direct-response advertising costs.
Advertising expense totaled approximately $32.7 million, $10.9 million, and $4.2
million for 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
 
    BENEFIT PLAN.  The Company maintains a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the
"Plan") for its full-time employees. Each participant in the Plan may elect to
contribute from 1% to 17% of his or her annual compensation to the Plan. The
Company matches employee contributions at a rate of 25%. Employee contributions
are fully vested, whereas vesting in matching Company contributions occurs at a
rate of 33.3% per year of employment. During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company's
contributions amounted to $584,000, $263,000, and $81,000, respectively.
 
    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.  The Company
invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its
agencies, and in high-quality corporate issuers. All highly liquid instruments
with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash
equivalents, those with original maturities greater than three months and
current maturities less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are
considered short-term investments, and those with maturities greater than twelve
months from the balance sheet date are considered long-term investments.
 
    The Company's marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale as
of the balance sheet date and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholders' equity. Realized gains or
losses and permanent declines in value, if any, on available-for-sale securities
will be reported in other income or expense as incurred. As of December 31,
1998, the Company recorded net unrealized gains, net of income taxes, of $21.8
million.
 
    The Company invests in equity instruments of privately-held, information
technology companies for business and strategic purposes. These investments are
included in other long-term assets and are accounted for under the cost method
when ownership is less than 20%. For these non-quoted investments, the Company's
policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating
performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values. The
Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets when
events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. To date,
no such impairment has been recorded. During 1998, certain of these investments
in privately-held companies became marketable equity securities when the
investees completed initial public offerings. Such investments, which are in the
Internet industry, are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value
due to the volatility of the stock market, and are recorded as long-term
investments.
 
    CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK.  Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist
primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, and
accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Company's cash, cash equivalents,
and short and long-term investments are managed by four financial institutions.
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned
from customers primarily located in the United States. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains

NOTE 1  THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
reserves for potential credit losses; historically, such losses have been within
management's expectations. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, no one customer
accounted for 10% or more of the accounts receivable balance.
 
    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  Property and equipment, including leasehold
improvements, are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are included in other assets and are
carried at cost less accumulated amortization, which is being provided on a
straight-line basis over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally
three to seven years. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of
its long-lived assets based on expected undiscounted cash flows and recognizes
impairments, if any, based on expected discounted future cash flows.
 
    INCOME TAXES.  Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the
amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not
expected to be realized.
 
    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS') No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." Under APB 25, compensation cost is recognized over the vesting
period based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant between the fair
value of the Company's stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock.
 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.  The functional currency of
the Company's international subsidiaries is the local currency. The financial
statements of these subsidiaries are translated to United States dollars using
year-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of
exchange for the year for revenues, costs, and expenses. Translation gains
(losses), which are deferred and accumulated as a component of shareholders'
equity, were $288,000, ($380,000), and ($63,000) for 1998, 1997, and 1996,
respectively. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions
are included in the consolidated statements of operations and were not
significant during the periods presented. International revenues have accounted
for less than 10% of net revenues in the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997,
and 1996. International assets were not significant at December 31, 1998, 1997,
or 1996.
 
    BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE.  Basic net income (loss) per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of the incremental common
shares issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock (using the
if-converted method) and shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
warrants (using the treasury stock method). For 1998, common equivalent shares
primarily related to shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
approximated 40.0 million shares. Common equivalent shares in 1997 and 1996 were
excluded from the computation as their effect was anti-dilutive.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 
NOTE 1  THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    USE OF ESTIMATES.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
    COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which was
adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 1998. SFAS 130 establishes
standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a financial
statement. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity (net
assets) during a period from non-owner sources. Examples of items to be included
in comprehensive income, which are excluded from net income, include foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as
presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consists of the net
unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax and the cumulative
translation adjustment.
 
    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 133
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and
hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging
activities, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The
Company is currently determining the additional disclosures, if any, that may be
required under this pronouncement. In March 1998, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-1 ("SOP 98-1"),
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use." This standard requires companies to capitalize qualifying
computer software costs which are incurred during the application development
stage and amortize them over the software's estimated useful life. SOP 98-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of SOP 98-1 on its financial statements and
related disclosures.

    At December 31, 1997, short and long-term investments in marketable
securities were classified as available-for-sale and consisted of 81% corporate
debt securities, 8% debt securities of the U.S. Government and its agencies, 4%
municipal debt securities, and 7% foreign debt securities. At December 31, 1997,
the fair value of the investments approximated cost.
 
NOTE 4  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
    During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company recognized net revenues of
approximately $10.3 million, $3.1 million, and $2.4 million, respectively, on
advertising contracts and publication, development, and licensing arrangements
with SOFTBANK and its related companies (such as E*Trade Group, Inc., Kingston
Technology Company, and E-Loan, Inc.), a holder of approximately 30% of the
Company's Common Stock at December 31, 1998. Prices on these contracts were
comparable to those given to other similar customers of the Company.
Additionally, three SOFTBANK-related companies provided Internet access and
sales and marketing-related services for fees of approximately $3.1 million,
$3.2 million, and $2.3 million during 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
Sequoia Capital, a holder of approximately 3% of the Company's Common Stock at
December 31, 1998, was also an investor in one of these SOFTBANK-related
companies.
 
NOTE 5  ACQUISITIONS
 
    ACQUISITION OF NETCONTROLS.  On July 31, 1997, the Company entered into a
stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of
NetControls, Inc. for 148,668 shares of the Company's Common Stock. The
acquisition was recorded as a purchase for accounting purposes and the majority
of the purchase price of approximately $1.4 million is being amortized over the
three-year estimated useful life of the technology acquired. Upon acquisition,
the historical financial results of NetControls, Inc. were de minimis.
 
    ACQUISITION OF FOUR11.  On October 20, 1997, the Company completed the
acquisition of Four11 Corporation, a privately-held online communications and
Internet directory company. Under the terms of the acquisition, which was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, the Company exchanged 6,022,880 shares
of Yahoo! Common Stock for all of Four11's outstanding shares and assumed
593,344 options and warrants to purchase Yahoo! Common Stock. All outstanding
Four11 preferred shares were converted into Four11 common stock immediately
prior to the acquisition. During the quarter ended December 31, 1997, the
Company recorded a one-time charge of $3.9 million for acquisition-related
costs. These costs consisted of investment banking fees, legal and accounting
fees, redundancy costs, and certain other expenses directly related to the
acquisition.

NOTE 5  ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)
    ACQUISITION OF VIAWEB INC.  On June 10, 1998, the Company completed the
acquisition of all outstanding shares of Viaweb, a provider of software and
services for hosting online stores, through the issuance of 1,574,364 shares of
Yahoo! Common Stock. All outstanding options to purchase Viaweb common stock
were converted into options to purchase 244,504 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with the
provisions of APB 16. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase
price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Results of operations for
Viaweb have been included with those of the Company for periods subsequent to
the date of acquisition.
 
    The total purchase price of the acquisition was $48.6 million including
acquisition expenses of $1.8 million. The purchase price was allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as
determined by the Company and pursuant to discussions with the Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Staff") as follows (in thousands):

    Among the factors considered in discussions with the Staff in determining
the amount of the allocation of the purchase price to in-process research and
development were various factors such as estimating the stage of development of
each in-process research and development project at the date of acquisition,
estimating cash flows resulting from the expected revenues generated from such
projects, and discounting the net cash flows, in addition to other assumptions.
The remaining identified intangibles, including the value of purchased
technology and other intangibles will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
three and seven years, respectively. Amortization expense of purchased
technology and other intangible assets was $2.9 million and $2.0 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1998. A deferred tax liability has
been recognized for the difference between the assigned values for book purposes
and the tax bases of assets in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109. In
addition, other factors were considered in discussions with the Staff in
determining the value assigned to purchased in-process technology such as
research projects in areas supporting the online store technology (including
significant enhancement to the ability of the product to support multiple users
and multiple servers), developing functionality to support the ability to
process credit card orders, and enhancing the product's user interface by
developing functionality that would allow the product to be used outside of the
United States. If none of these projects is successfully developed, the
Company's sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods.
Additionally, the failure of any particular individual project in process could
impair the value of other intangible assets acquired. The Company began to
benefit from the purchased in-process technology in late 1998.
 
    Yahoo! is continuing the development efforts associated with online store
technology, credit card processing and to a lesser extent international
functionality. The development efforts with respect to

NOTE 5  ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)
the online store technology and credit card processing are on schedule with
Yahoo!'s original assumptions with various features having been introduced as of
December 31, 1998. Given the complexities of completing the international
functionality, Yahoo! continues to make progress in the development of these
features and now expects to be substantially complete by the end of June 1999.
 
    ACQUISITION OF WEBCAL CORPORATION.  On July 17, 1998, the Company completed
the acquisition of WebCal Corporation ("WebCal"), a privately-held developer and
marketer of Web-based calendaring and scheduling products, and publisher of
EventCal, a comprehensive database of world-wide public events. Under the terms
of the acquisition, which was accounted for as a pooling of interests, the
Company exchanged 541,908 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock for all of WebCal's
outstanding shares. The historical operations of WebCal are not material to the
Company's financial position or results of operations, therefore, prior period
financial statements have not been restated for this acquisition. WebCal's
accumulated deficit on July 17, 1998 was $1.1 million. Net revenues and pre-tax
net loss for WebCal in 1998 through the date of the acquisition approximated
$2,000 and $847,000, respectively.
 
    ACQUISITION OF YOYODYNE ENTERTAINMENT, INC.  On October 20, 1998, the
Company acquired Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc., a privately-held, direct
marketing services company. Under the terms of the acquisition, which was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, the Company exchanged 561,244 shares of
Yahoo! Common Stock and options and warrants to purchase Yahoo! Common Stock for
all of Yoyodyne's outstanding shares, options, and warrants. The consolidated
financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 1998 and the
accompanying notes reflect the Company's financial position and the results of
operations as if Yoyodyne was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company since
inception. During October 1998, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $2.1
million for acquisition-related costs. These costs consisted of broker fees,
legal and accounting fees, and certain other expenses directly related to the
acquisition.
 
    ACQUISITION OF HYPERPARALLEL, INC.  On December 17, 1998, the Company
completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of HyperParallel,
Inc. ("HyperParallel"), a company specializing in data analysis, through the
issuance of 74,856 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock and approximately $700,000 of
cash totaling $8.1 million including acquisition costs. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase in accordance with APB 16. Under the purchase method
of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of the
acquisition. Results of operations for HyperParallel have been included with
those of the Company for periods subsequent to the acquisition.
 
    Approximately $2.3 million of the total purchase price was allocated to
in-process research and development. This amount was developed by estimating the
stage of development of each in-process research and development project at the
date of the acquisition, estimating incremental cash flows generated from such
projects, and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a
discount rate of 35%, which represents a premium to the Company's cost of
capital to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful
development of the purchased in-process technology. The projections were based
on management's estimates of market size and growth, expected trends in
advertising and technology, expected research and development and selling and
general administrative expenditures, and the expected timing of new product
introductions. Approximately $1.2 million of the total purchase price was
allocated to existing technology which is being amortized over 3 years. The
value of the existing technology was developed based on similar assumptions
using a discount rate of 25%. The projections used in developing the values
should not be considered an accurate predictor of

NOTE 5  ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)
future performance for several reasons, including the consideration of many
factors outside the control of the Company. The remaining purchase price of
approximately $4.6 million was allocated to goodwill which is being amortized
over 7 years. Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material
to the Company's financial statements.
 
    The value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined by
identifying three research projects in-progress as of the acquisition date.
These three research projects in-progress focus on technologies surrounding
search tools. Two of the application oriented development projects were 70% and
20% complete as of the acquisition date. These projects are expected to be
completed in the first and fourth quarters, respectively, of 1999. The remaining
project relates to the next release of the current search tool which was
approximately 20% complete as of the acquisition date and is expected to be
completed in the fourth quarter of 1999. Future research and development costs
to be incurred on the individual in-process projects are not expected to be
material to Yahoo!'s financial position or results of operations. In addition,
if none of these projects were successfully developed, Yahoo!'s revenues and
profitability would not be materially adversely affected.

NOTE 6  JOINT VENTURES
 
    YAHOO! JAPAN.  During April 1996, the Company signed a joint venture
agreement with SOFTBANK whereby Yahoo! Japan Corporation was formed to establish
and manage in Japan a Japanese version of the Yahoo! Internet Guide, develop
related Japanese online navigational services, and conduct other related
business. The Company's ownership interest in the joint venture upon inception
was 40%. During November 1997, Yahoo! Japan Corporation completed its initial
public offering, issuing 975 previously unissued shares and raising total
proceeds of approximately $5.5 million. Accordingly, the Company increased its
investment by $1.7 million, recorded as additional paid-in capital, to reflect
the increase in the Company's share of Yahoo! Japan Corporation's net assets.
The investment is being accounted for using the equity method and the Company's
share of net income, to date, has been immaterial. At December 31, 1998, the
carrying value of the investment was $2.9 million and is recorded in other
assets. However, the fair value of the Company's 34% ownership in Yahoo! Japan,
based on the quoted trading price, was approximately $170 million at December
31, 1998.
 
    YAHOO! EUROPE.  On November 1, 1996, the Company signed a joint venture
agreement with a subsidiary of SOFTBANK whereby separate companies were formed
in Germany, the United Kingdom,

and France ("Yahoo! Europe") to establish and manage versions of the Yahoo!
Internet Guide for those countries, develop related online navigational
services, and conduct other related business. The parties have invested a total
of $6.0 million in proportion to their respective equity interests as of
December 31, 1998. The Company has a majority share of approximately 70% in each
of the Yahoo! Europe entities, and therefore, has consolidated their financial
results. During 1998, 1997, and 1996, Yahoo! Europe incurred losses from
operations of $409,000, $1,807,000 and $842,000, respectively. SOFTBANK's
interest in the net assets of Yahoo! Europe at December 31, 1998 and 1997, as
represented by the minority interest on the balance sheet, was $883,000 and
$405,000, respectively.
 
    YAHOO! KOREA.  During August 1997, the Company signed a joint venture
agreement with SOFTBANK and other SOFTBANK affiliate companies whereby Yahoo!
Korea was formed to develop and operate a Korean version of the Yahoo! Internet
Guide, develop related Korean online navigational services, and conduct other
related business. The parties have invested a total of $1.0 million in
proportion to their respective equity interests. The Company has a majority
share of approximately 60% in the joint venture, and therefore, has consolidated
the financial results, which have been insignificant to date. SOFTBANK's
interest in the net assets of Yahoo! Korea at December 31, 1998 and 1997, as
represented by the minority interest on the balance sheet, was $365,000 and
$311,000, respectively.
 
    YAHOO! MARKETPLACE.  On August 26, 1996, Yahoo! entered into agreements with
Visa International Service Association ("VISA") and another party (together, the
"Visa Group") to establish a limited liability company, Yahoo! Marketplace
L.L.C., to develop and operate a navigational service focused on information and
resources for the purchase of consumer products and services over the Internet.
Yahoo!'s principal obligations included a commitment to provide operating
contributions to support implementation of the service including its look and
feel, development of its software, hiring of its management, promotion of the
service, promotion of VISA, a nonexclusive license to Yahoo! Marketplace to use
the Yahoo! brand and search tools, and an agreement that Yahoo! Marketplace
would be used exclusively for the activities defined in the operating agreement.
VISA's key obligations included a commitment to provide operating contributions
including encouraging VISA member banks to participate and utilize the services
of Yahoo! Marketplace, assistance in implementing systems to process payments,
other marketing assistance activities, providing non-exclusive rights to
utilization of the VISA brand, and an agreement not to compete for 18 months by
entering into a similar arrangement with a Yahoo! competitor. As of December 31,
1996, the parties had invested a total of $1.0 million. At December 31, 1996,
Yahoo! owned approximately 55% of the equity interest in Yahoo! Marketplace.
Yahoo! Marketplace incurred start-up losses of $246,000 in 1997 and $637,000 in
1996.
 
    During May 1997, Yahoo! received a letter from VISA formally expressing its
concerns with respect to breach of contract, Yahoo! support obligations, and
exclusivity. In June 1997, Yahoo! conducted numerous discussions concerning
settlement of these obligations and claims and proposed a settlement with the
Visa Group which was signed in July 1997, prior to the completion of significant
business activities and public launch of the property. In connection with this
settlement, Yahoo! issued 2,797,924 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock to the Visa
Group, for which Yahoo! recorded a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax charge of $21.2
million in the second quarter ended June 30, 1997. The settlement ultimately
released Yahoo! from all of its obligations described above. The agreement
settled all disputes and claims arising among the parties with respect to the
interpretation of and the parties' respective performance under the agreements
and released the parties from further liability. It also

released Yahoo! from any other further damage claims by VISA for
non-performance. Yahoo! also forfeited its non-compete commitment from VISA. No
portions of these agreements continued in effect subsequent to the settlement.

    COMMON STOCK.  On April 11, 1996, the Company completed its initial public
offering of 17.9 million shares of its Common Stock. Net proceeds to the Company
aggregated $35.1 million. As of the closing date of the offering, all of the
Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding was converted into an aggregate of
approximately 77 million shares of Common Stock. On July 14, 1998, the Company
received proceeds of $250.0 million in exchange for 5,453,760 newly issued
shares of Yahoo! Common Stock through a private placement with SOFTBANK. The
shares purchased by SOFTBANK are subject to a pre-existing agreement, entered
into in 1996, that prohibits SOFTBANK from purchasing additional shares of the
Company's capital stock if such purchase would result in SOFTBANK owning more
than 35% of the Company's capital stock (assuming the exercise of all
outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock).
 
    STOCK OPTION PLANS.  Pursuant to the consummation of the acquisitions of
Viaweb Inc. and Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc. during 1998, the Company assumed
the Viaweb 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Viaweb Plan") and the 1996 Yoyodyne
Stock Option Plan (the "Yoyodyne Plan"), respectively. As of December 31, 1998,
the Company had five stock-based compensation plans which are described below.
 
    The 1995 Stock Plan (the "Stock Plan"), the 1995 Four11 Stock Option Plan
(the "Four11 Plan"), the Viaweb Plan, and the Yoyodyne Plan (collectively the
"Plans") allow for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, and stock purchase rights to purchase a maximum of 87.6 million shares
of the Company's Common Stock. Under the Plans, incentive stock options may be
granted to employees, directors, and officers of the Company and non-qualified
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to consultants,
employees, directors, and officers of the Company. Options granted under the
Plans are for periods not to exceed ten years, and must be issued at prices not
less than 100% and 85%, for incentive and nonqualified stock options,
respectively, of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant as
determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted to shareholders who own
greater than 10% of the outstanding stock are for periods not to exceed five
years and must be issued at prices not less than 110% of the fair market value
of the stock on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors.
Options granted under the Stock Plan and the Four11 Plan generally vest 25%
after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining
thirty-six month period. Options granted under the Viaweb Plan generally vest
25% on each anniversary over four years. Options granted under the Yoyodyne Plan
have various vesting periods that do not exceed thirty-six months. Options
issued under the Four11 Plan may be exercised prior to vesting and are subject
to repurchase in the event of a voluntary termination, at the original purchase
price. At December 31, 1998, shares subject to repurchase under the provisions
of the Four11 Plan were insignificant.
 
    The 1996 Directors' Stock Option Plan (the "Directors' Plan") provides for
the issuance of up to 1.2 million non-statutory stock options to non-employee
directors of the Company. Each person who becomes a non-employee director of the
Company after the date of the Company's initial public offering will
automatically be granted a non-statutory option (the "First Option") to purchase
240,000

shares of Common Stock upon the date on which such person first becomes a
director. Thereafter, each director of the Company will be granted an annual
option (the "Annual Option") to purchase 30,000 shares of Common Stock. Options
under the Directors' Plan will be granted at the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors and will vest in
equal monthly installments over four years, in the case of the First Option, or
at the end of four years in the case of the Annual Option. Options granted under
the Directors' Plan are for periods not to exceed 10 years.

    Options to purchase approximately 7.9 million shares and 3.3 million shares
were vested at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The weighted average
exercise prices per share for options vested at December 31, 1997 and 1996 were
$0.99 and less than $0.01, respectively. Through December 31, 1998, Yahoo! and
certain acquired entities recorded compensation expense related to certain stock
options issued with exercise prices below the fair market value of the related
common stock. The Company recorded compensation expense in the amount of
$926,000, $1,215,000, and $164,000 in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
Approximately $1,017,000 remains to be amortized over the remaining vesting
periods of the options.
 
    EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  Effective March 6, 1996, the Company's Board
of Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"),
which provides for the issuance of a maximum of 1,800,000 shares of Common
Stock. Eligible employees can have up to 15% of their earnings withheld, up to
certain maximums, to be used to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock on
every December 31(st) and June 30(th). The price of the Common Stock purchased
under the Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
value of the Common Stock on the commencement date of each six-month offering
period or the specified purchase date. During 1998, 126,000 shares were
purchased at prices from $14.72 to $36.10 per share. During 1997, 537,000 shares
were purchased at prices from $1.85 to $4.83 per share. There were no shares
issued under the Purchase Plan during 1996. At December 31, 1998, 1,137,000
shares were available under the Purchase Plan for future issuance.
 
    STOCK COMPENSATION.  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in
accordance with the provisions of APB 25. Had compensation expense been

    Prior to the Company's initial public offering, the fair value of each
option grant was determined on the date of grant using the minimum value method.
Subsequent to the offering, the fair value was determined using the
Black-Scholes model. The weighted average fair market value of an option granted
during 1998, 1997, and 1996 was $26.53, $4.34, and $0.79, respectively. Except
for the volatility assumption which was only used under the Black-Scholes model,
the following range of assumptions was used to perform the calculations:
expected life of 36 months in 1998 and 1997, and 30 months in 1996; risk-free
interest rate ranges of 4.2% to 5.6% during 1998, 5.6% to 6.6% during 1997, and
5.1% to 6.5% during 1996; expected volatility of 67% in 1998, 59% in 1997, and
53% in 1996; and no expected dividend yield for the three years ended December
31, 1998. Because additional stock options are expected to be granted each year,
the above pro forma disclosures are not representative of pro forma effects on
reported financial results for future years.

    As of December 31, 1998, the Company's federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $333 million and $181
million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010, and the state net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2003. The Company's federal and state
research tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes are approximately
$10.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax
credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. Approximately $13 million of
net operating loss carryforwards relate to acquired entities and expire
beginning in 2010. Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be
limited by a cumulative stock ownership change of more than 50%, or by other
limitations.
 
    Deferred tax assets of approximately $141 million as of December 31, 1998
pertain to certain net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards
resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. When recognized, the tax
benefit of these loss and credit carryforwards are accounted for as a credit to
additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision.
Deferred tax assets include approximately $1.6 million related to net operating
loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions. These carryforwards will
expire if not utilized.

    GEOCITIES.  On January 28, 1999, the Company announced the signing of a
definitive agreement to acquire GeoCities, a publicly traded Internet company.
Under the terms of the acquisition, which will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests, the Company will exchange approximately 21,254,000 shares of Yahoo!
Common Stock for approximately 31,403,000 shares of GeoCities common stock.
Additionally, the Company will convert approximately 8,894,000 GeoCities stock
options into approximately 6,019,000 Yahoo! stock options. The acquisition is
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1999 and is subject to certain
conditions, regulatory approval, and approval by GeoCities stockholders. The
Company expects to record a one-time charge in the second quarter of 1999
