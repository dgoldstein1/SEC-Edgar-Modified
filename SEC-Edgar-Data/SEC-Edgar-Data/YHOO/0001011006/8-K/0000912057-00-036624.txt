<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;25, 2000, Yahoo! Inc. ("Yahoo!") filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
The following is an amendment and restatement of the Yahoo! Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;8-A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March&nbsp;12, 1996 (the
"Registration Statement"), setting forth an updated description of Yahoo!'s capital stock. Item&nbsp;1 of the Registration Statement is amended and restated as follows: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yahoo!
is authorized to issue Five Billion (5,000,000,000) shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of undesignated preferred stock,
$0.001 par value per share. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B> Common Stock  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of August 9, 2000 there were 552,563,634 shares of Yahoo! common stock outstanding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Subject to preferences that may be
applicable to any outstanding preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the Yahoo! Board of Directors out of funds legally available
for that purpose. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Yahoo!, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities,
subject to the prior distribution rights of any outstanding preferred stock. The common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking
fund provisions applicable to the common stock. The outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B> Preferred Stock  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Yahoo! Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per
share, in one or more series. The Board of Directors will also have the authority to designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of each such series, including dividend rights,
dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Yahoo! without further action by the stockholders. The issuance of
preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock. In certain circumstances, an issuance of preferred stock could have the
effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. Yahoo! currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B> Delaware Anti-Takeover Law and Charter and Bylaw Provisions  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions
of Delaware law and Yahoo!'s charter documents could make the acquisition of Yahoo! and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult. These provisions are
expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of Yahoo! to negotiate with it first. Yahoo!
believes that the benefits of increased protection of its potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure Yahoo! outweigh the
disadvantages of discouraging such proposals because, among other things, negotiation of such proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo! is subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware general corporation law. In general, the statute prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation
from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date that the person became an
interested stockholder unless, subject to exceptions, the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a
"business combination" includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder. Generally, an "interested stockholder" is a person who,
together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years prior, did own 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change in control of Yahoo! without further action by the stockholders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo!'s
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by
written consent. The Yahoo! Bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders can be called only by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the President. Moreover, the
business permitted to be conducted at any special meeting of stockholders is limited to the business brought before the meeting by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the
President. The Yahoo! Bylaws set forth an advance notice procedure with regard to the nomination, other than by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, of candidates for election as directors
and with regard to business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders." </FONT></P>
