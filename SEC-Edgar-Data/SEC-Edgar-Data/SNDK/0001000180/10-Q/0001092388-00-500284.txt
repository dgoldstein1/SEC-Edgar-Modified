<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	These interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited but reflect, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring
adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of September&nbsp;30, 2000, and the results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30,
2000 and 1999 and cash flows for the nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2000 and 1999. Because all the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles are not included, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto in the Company&#146;s annual report on Form 10-K as of, and for, the year ended December&nbsp;31, 1999. The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December&nbsp;
31, 1999 was d
erived from the audited financial statements.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2000 and 1999 and cash flows for the nine
month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2000 and 1999 are not necessarily indicative of results of operations and cash flows for any future period.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	The Company&#146;s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December&nbsp;31, and each fiscal quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March&nbsp;
31, June&nbsp;30, and September&nbsp;30. The third fiscal quarter of 2000 and 1999 ended on October&nbsp;1, 2000 and September&nbsp;26, 1999, respectively. Fiscal year 2000 is 52&nbsp;weeks long and ends on December&nbsp;31, 2000. Fiscal year 1999 was
53&nbsp;weeks long and ended on January&nbsp;2, 2000. For ease of presentation, the accompanying financial statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.	The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements
to protect its intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that there will not be disputes regarding the Company&#146;s intellectual property rights. Specifically, there can be no assurance that any patents held by the Company will not be
invalidated, that patents will be issued for any of the Company&#146;s pending applications or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued in the primary countries where the Company&#146;s
products can be sold to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the Company. Additionally, competitors of the Company may be able to design around the Company&#146;s patents.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may be necessary to initiate litigation with one or more third parties,
including but not limited to those the Company has notified of possible patent infringement. In addition, one or more of these parties may bring suit against the Company.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, we sued Lexar in the Northern District of California alleging that Lexar&#146;s CompactFlash and PC Cards infringe our U.S. Patent No.
5,602,987 (&#147;&#145;987 Patent&#148;). Lexar disputed this claim and asserted various counter claims, including unfair competition, violation of the Lanham Act, patent misuse, interference with prospective economic advantage, trade defamation,
unenforceability and fraud. On November 14, 2000, in resolution of these actions, Lexar stipulated that SanDisk&#146;s &#145;987 Patent is valid and infringed by Lexar&#146;s current CompactFlash and PC Cards. Lexar will make a lump sum payment of $8.0
million for royalties due on the &#145;987 Patent, through March 31, 2001. Subject to Lexar&#146;s representations and warranties relating to Lexar&#146;s newly designed CompactFlash and PC Cards, SanDisk has stipulated that these designs do not infringe
SanDisk&#146;
s &#145;987 Patent. Lexar entered into a 4% royalty-bearing license agreement for certain Lexar products that may use the &#145;987 Patent beyond March 31, 2001. SanDisk and Lexar have agreed to dismiss with prejudice all pending claims of patent
infringement and counterclaims involving claims of false advertising, unfair competition and patent misuse.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2000, Lexar sued SanDisk in the District of Delaware alleging that our SmartMedia products infringe Lexar&#146;s United States Patent
No. 5,479,638 (&#147;&#145;638 Patent&#148;). In resolution of this action, we will pay Lexar a lump sum payment of $2.0 million for a fully-paid up license for use of the &#145;638 Patent in SmartMedia products.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the settlement, Lexar has provided us with an option for a royalty bearing license to its patents for use in certain future products.</font></p>


<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SanDisk and Lexar have agreed to resolve any future disputes relating to the use by Lexar of the &#145;987 Patent through binding arbitration. We
have also agreed that for a period of seven years, neither SanDisk nor Lexar shall seek injunctive relief against the other in any patent lawsuit. However, at all times, we retain the right to seek injunctive relief to enforce the payment of royalties
pursuant to an arbitrator&#146;s ruling.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;21, 2000, Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. (Mitsubishi Electric) filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court against SanDisk K.K., SanDisk&#146;
s wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan. The complaint alleges that SanDisk K.K., based in Yokohama, Japan, infringes on three Mitsubishi Japanese patents. The Mitsubishi patents in question are #JP2099342, #JP2129071 and #JP2138047. Based on preliminary
information, SanDisk believes that these patents are related primarily to the mechanical construction of memory cards built with a separate connector. In the complaint, Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary injunction halting the sale of SanDisk
CompactFlash and flash ATA memory cards in Japan. Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the case, it believes that Mitsubishi&#146;s claims are without merit. The Company and SanDisk K.K. will vigorously defend itself against
Mitsubishi&#146;s
claims.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, the Company has been contacted by various other parties who have alleged that certain of the Company&#146;s products infringe on
patents that such parties claim to hold. To date no legal actions have been filed in connection with any such infringement, other than as discussed above.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and
sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology, or discontinue the use of certain processes. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time the Company agrees to indemnify certain of its suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement. The scope of such indemnity
varies but may in some instances includes indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorney&#146;s fees. The Company may from time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of such indemnification obligations. Third party claims for patent
infringement are excluded from coverage under the Company&#146;s insurance policies. There can be no assurance that any future obligation to indemnify the Company&#146;s customers or suppliers, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compaq Corporation has opposed in several countries, including the United States, our attempting to register CompactFlash as a trademark. We do not
believe that our failure to obtain registration for the CompactFlash mark will materially harm our business.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention, even if the Company ultimately prevails. In
addition, the results of any litigation matters are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing matters, or any future litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial
condition and results of operations.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.	Certain of the Company&#146;s balance sheet accounts and purchase commitments are denominated in Japanese Yen. The Company enters into foreign
exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effects of movements in currency exchange rates on these instruments are recognized when the related operating revenues and expenses are recognized. The impact of
movements in currency exchange rates on foreign exchange contracts substantially mitigates the related impact on the underlying items hedged. At September&nbsp;30, 2000, forward contracts to sell Japanese Yen with a notional amount of $4.9&nbsp;million
were outstanding. In the third quarter of 2000, the Company had a net foreign currency transaction loss of $0.5&nbsp;million, primarily due to transaction losses on its Japanese yen based assets.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.	Accumulated other comprehensive income presented in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the accumulated unrealized gains and losses on

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was ($18.6)&nbsp;million and $0.2&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2000 and December&nbsp;31, 1999,
respectively.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.	On June&nbsp;30, 2000, the Company and Toshiba closed a transaction providing for the joint development and manufacture of 512&nbsp;megabit and
1&nbsp;gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. As a part of this transaction, the Company and Toshiba formed and contributed initial funding to FlashVision LLC, a joint venture to equip and operate a silicon wafer
manufacturing line in Virginia. The cost of equipping the Virginia wafer manufacturing line is estimated at between $700&nbsp;million and $800&nbsp;million. The Company, as part of its 50%&nbsp;ownership of the joint venture, expects to invest up to
$150&nbsp;million in cash and guarantee equipment lease lines up to an additional $250&nbsp;million. In addition, the Company will share certain research and development costs. SanDisk contributed $15.0&nbsp;million of this investment in FlashVision LLC
in the second quarter
of 2000 and an additional $22.0&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000. The Company does not expect any material revenues from the 512&nbsp;megabit technology for at least one year, and from the 1&nbsp;gigabit technology for at least two years.</font>
</p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.	On January&nbsp;3, 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into UMC. The Company had invested $51.2&nbsp;million in USIC. In exchange for its USIC
shares, the Company received 111&nbsp;million UMC shares. These shares were valued at approximately $396 million at the time of the merger, resulting in a pretax gain of $344.2&nbsp;million ($203.9&nbsp;million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2000. All
of the UMC shares received by the Company as a result of the merger are subject to trading restrictions imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The trading restrictions expired on one-half of the shares on July&nbsp;3, 2000. The remaining shares
will become available for sale over a two year period beginning in January&nbsp;2002. When the shares are ultimately sold, it is likely that the Company will recognize additional gains or losses due to fluctuations in the price of the UMC shares. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2000, the Company received a stock dividend from UMC of 200&nbsp;shares for every 1,000&nbsp;shares of UMC owned, resulting in its ownership
of 22&nbsp;million additional shares of UMC. The shares received as a stock dividend and the 50% of the shares received as a result of the merger that became unrestricted in July&nbsp;2000 were treated as available-for-sale securities under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, at September&nbsp;30, 2000. At September&nbsp;30, 2000, these shares were adjusted to market value and the resulting unrealized loss of $49.4&nbsp;
million dollars in the third quarter of 2000 was included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, on September&nbsp;18, 2000, UMC completed its American Depositary Shares (&#147;ADRs&#148;) offering. In connection with this offering,
SanDisk signed a
lock-up agreement that prohibits the sale of all but 5&nbsp;million of these unrestricted UMC shares for a period of 90&nbsp;days following the completion of the offering. The remaining 50% of the shares received as a result of the merger, that will be
restricted from sale until 2002, are accounted for at their historical cost until such time as the related restrictions lapse.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.	In July&nbsp;2000, SanDisk entered into a definitive agreement to make a $75&nbsp;million equity investment in Tower Semiconductor (&#147;
Tower&#148;) in Israel, resulting in approximately 10%&nbsp;ownership of Tower. In exchange for its investment, SanDisk will receive one seat on the board of directors and a guaranteed portion of the wafer output from the advanced fab Tower plans to build
in Migdal Haemek, Israel. Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will make its investment over a period of approximately 18&nbsp;months if key milestones related to the construction, equipping and wafer production at the new wafer fab are met. Such
contribution will take the form of mandatory warrant exercises at an exercise price of $30.00&nbsp;per share. In the event the key milestones are not achieved, the exercise of such warrants will not be mandatory and the warrants will expire five years
from the date of
 grant. The closing of the transaction is subject to several conditions including the timely approval of a financial incentive </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>package for Tower from the Israeli government, Tower&#146;s ability to secure additional financing from other foundry partners and financial institutions, timely commencement of fab construction and the approval of Tower&#146;s
board. During the third quarter, SanDisk transferred the first $20&nbsp;million of this investment to an escrow account pending the completion of all conditions required for the closing. On October&nbsp;10, 2000, the Israel Finance Minister recommended
the approval of a $250&nbsp;million grant for the construction of the wafer foundry. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2000. We expect first wafer production to commence at the new fab in 2002.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.	On August&nbsp;9, 2000, SanDisk entered into a joint venture, Digital Portal Inc., (&#147;DPI&#148;), with Photo-Me International (&#147;PMI&#148;
) for the manufacture, installation and service of self-service, digital photo printing labs, or kiosks, bearing the SanDisk brand name. Under the agreement, SanDisk and PMI will each make an initial investment of $4 million and secure lease financing for
the purchase of the kiosks. The total value of the lease financing will depend on the number of kiosks deployed by the joint venture. The Company estimates that it will guarantee equipment lease arrangements of approximately $40&nbsp;million over the
first two years of the agreement.  PMI will manufacture the kiosks for the joint venture and will install and maintain the kiosks under contract with the joint venture. The first kiosks are expected to be deployed in retail stores in the United States in
the fi

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Item 2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain statements in this discussion and analysis are forward looking statements under Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as
amended based on current expectations, and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties are discussed below and in our
Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 1999 under the heading &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results.&#148; Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We
undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Overview</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SanDisk was founded in 1988 to develop and market flash data storage systems. We sell our products to the consumer electronics and ind
ustrial/communications markets. In the first nine months of fiscal 2000, approximately 77% of our product sales were attributable to the consumer electronics market, particularly sales of CompactFlash for use in digital camera applications. Our
CompactFlash products have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity FlashDisk and FlashDrive products. In addition, a substantial portion of our CompactFlash products are sold into the retail channel, which usually has
shorter customer order lead-times than our other channels. A majority of our sales to the retail channel are turns business, with orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter, thereby decreasing our ability to accurately forecast future production
needs. We believe sales to the consu
mer market will continue to represent a majority of our sales as the popularity of consumer applications, including digital cameras, increases.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the volume of product sales, availability of foundry capacity, variations in
manufacturing cycle times, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing utilization, the timing of significant orders, competitive pricing pressures, our ability to match supply with demand, changes in product and customer mix, market acceptance
of new or enhanced versions of our products, changes in the channels through which our products are distributed, timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors, the timing of license and royalty revenues, fluctuations in
product costs, increased research and development expenses, and exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, as the proportion of our products sold for use in consumer electronics applications increases, our revenues may become subject to seasonal declines in
the fir
st quarter of each year. See &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results&#151;Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly Which May Adversely Affect Our Stock Price&#148; and &#147;&#151;There is Seasonality in Our Business.&#148;</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in late 1995, we adopted a strategy of licensing our flash technology, including our patent portfolio, to third party manufacturers of
flash products. To date, we have entered into patent cross-license agreements with several companies, and intend to pursue opportunities to enter into additional licenses. Our current </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>10</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>license agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties, or a combination thereof. In some cases, the compensation to us may be partially in the form of guaranteed access to Flash Memory manufacturing capacity
from the licensee company. The timing and amount of royalty payments and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and, in some cases, the timing of sales of products by the
other parties. As a result, license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues, gross margins
and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We market our products using a direct sales organization, distributors, manufacturers&#146; representatives, private label partners, OEMs and
retailers. We expect that sales through the retail channel will comprise an increasing share of our total revenues in the future, and that a substantial portion of our sales into the retail channel will be made to participants that will have the right to
return unsold products. Our policy is to defer recognition of revenues from these sales until the products are sold to the end customers.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of
customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our product revenues for the foreseeable future. We have also experienced significant changes in the composition of our customer base from year to year and expect this pattern to continue as
market demand for our customers&#146; products fluctuates. The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See &#147;
Factors That May Affect Future Results&#151;Sales to a Small Number of Customers Represent a Significant Portion of Our Revenues&#148;.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of our products require silicon wafers, the majority of which are currently manufactured by UMC in Taiwan. Industry-wide demand for
semiconductors increased significantly in 1999 and the first nine months of 2000, due to increased demand in the consumer electronics and cellular phone markets. This increased demand has caused supply constraints for most of this year. However,
semiconductor manufacturers, including UMC and Toshiba have been adding new advanced wafer fab capacity, which in 2001 we expect will ease the tight supply situation of the past year. If industry-wide demand for our products falls below the industry-wide
available supply, the excess capacity could adversely affect our product prices and significantly hurt our profitability. Under our wafer supply agreements, there are limits on the number of wafers we can order and our ability to change that quantity is
restricted. Accordingly, ou
r ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our products is limited. If customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders, which could result in lost sales and lower
revenues. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of flash memory wafers with acceptable prices and yields from our current and future wafer foundries, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. If customer demand
falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our wafer orders, we may end up with excess wafer inventories, which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins. We have from time to time taken write downs for
excess inventories. These adjustments decrease gross margins and have resulted, and could in the future result, in fluctuations in gross margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis. See &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results&#151;Our Operating Results May
Fluctua
te Significantly.&#148;</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export sales are an important part of our business. Our sales may be impacted by changes in economic conditions in our international markets.
Economic conditions in our international markets, including the European Union, may  adversely effect our revenues to the extent that demand for our products in these regions declines. Given the recent economic conditions in the European Union and the
weakness of the Euro currency relative to the United States dollar, our products may be relatively more expensive in Europe, which could result in a decrease of our sales in that region. While most of our sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars, we invoice
certain Japanese customers in Japanese Yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results&#151;Our
international operat
ions make us vulnerable to changing conditions and currency fluctuations.&#148;</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the foreseeable future, we expect to realize a significant portion of our revenues from recently introduced and new products. Typically, new
products initially have lower gross margins than more mature products because the manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation. In addition, manufacturing yields are generally lower at the start of
manufacturing any product at a new foundry. To remain competitive, we are focusing on a number of programs to lower manufacturing costs, including development of future generations of D2 flash and advanced technology wafers. There can be no assurance that
we will successfully </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>11</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>develop such products or processes or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs. In addition, if the industry wide supply of flash memory products grows faster than customer demand, we could experience
increased price competition in the future, which could result in decreased average selling prices and lower gross margins. See &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results&#151;We Must Achieve Acceptable Manufacturing Yields.&#148;</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2><b>Results of Operations</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Product Revenues</i>. Our product revenues were $151.8&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000, up $94.2&nbsp;million or 163% from the third
quarter of 1999. Product revenues for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2000 were $371.6&nbsp;million, up $235.8&nbsp;million or 174% from the same period of the prior year. During the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2000,
total flash memory product units sold increased approximately 230% and 193%, respectively, over the same periods in 1999. The largest increases in both periods came from sales of MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash products. CompactFlash products represented
46% of product revenues and MultiMediaCards 25% of product revenues for the third quarter of 2000. For the nine month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2000, CompactFlash products represented 46% of product revenues and MultiMediaCards represented 22% of
product reve
nues. Flash memory product average selling prices decreased 15% in the third quarter of 2000 and 5% for the first nine months of 2000 compared to the same periods of the prior year due primarily to an increase in sales of our MultiMediaCard product which
have lower average selling prices than our higher capacity products. We expect fourth quarter product revenues to increase between 15% and 20% from third quarter product revenues.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales to the consumer market represented approximately 81% and 77%, respectively, of product revenues for the three and nine month periods ended
September&nbsp;30, 2000, with sales to the telecommunications/industrial market accounting for the remaining 19% and 23%, respectively. Sales to the retail channel represented 25% of product revenues in the third quarter of 2000, up from 23% for the same
period of the previous year. Our mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and will continue to vary in the future, affecting our overall average selling prices and gross margins.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export sales represented 56% and 54%, respectively, of our product revenues for the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2000,
compared to 53% and 47%, respectively, for the same periods of the previous year. We expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our product revenues. For the three month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2000, our top ten
customers represented approximately 56% of our product revenues compared to 55% for the same period in 1999. In the third quarter of 2000, sales to one customer exceeded 10% of product sales. One customer also represented more than 10% of product sales in
the third quarter of 1999. We expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our product revenues for the foreseeable future.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>License and Royalty Revenues</i>. We currently earn patent license fees and royalties under several cross-license agreements. License and royalty
revenues from patent cross-license agreements were $19.0&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000, up from $9.9 million in the same period of the previous year, due primarily to an increase in royalty revenues. In the first nine months of 2000, revenue
from patent license and royalties was $52.5&nbsp;million, up from $28.4 million for the same period of the prior year. Revenues from licenses and royalties decreased to 11% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2000 from 15% in the third quarter of
1999. In the third quarter of 2000, we entered into new cross-license agreements with Hitachi and TDK. Our revenues from patent license and royalties fluctuate quarterly based on the timing of revenue recognition under our various agreements. We expect
license a
nd royalty revenues to be approximately $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2000.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gross Profits</i>. In the third quarter of 2000, gross profits were $69.0&nbsp;million, or 40% of total revenues compared to $23.6&nbsp;million,
or 35% of total revenues in the same period of 1999. Gross profits for the first nine months of 2000 were $170.0&nbsp;million compared to $63.0&nbsp;million for the same period of the previous year. Gross margin was 40% of total revenues for the nine
month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2000 compared to 38% for the same period of 1999.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product gross margin increased to 33% of product revenues in the third quarter of 2000 compared to 24% for the same period in 1999. For the nine
month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2000, product gross margins grew to 32% from 26% for the same period in the prior year. These increases in gross margins were primarily due to the lower cost per megabyte of our 256 Mbit flash memory products which
represented a majority of our shipments in the first </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>12</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>nine months of 2000. We currently expect product gross margins to improve by approximately one-half percent in the fourth quarter of 2000 based on anticipated continuing improvements in manufacturing yields for our 256Mbit&nbsp;
 .24 micron technology.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Research and Development</i>. Research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and payroll related expenses for design and
development engineers, prototype supplies and contract services. Research and development expenses were $13.0&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000, up $6.1&nbsp;million or 87% from $6.9&nbsp;million in the same period of 1999. In the first nine
months of 2000, research and development expenses increased to $32.8&nbsp;million, up $14.7&nbsp;million or 81% from $18.2&nbsp;million in the same period of 1999. These increases were primarily due to increased salary and related expenses associated with
additional personnel, increased project expenses to support the development of new generations of flash data storage products including the 512Mbit and 1&nbsp;Gigabit flash memory co-development with Toshiba, and increased depreciation and amortization
expenses. Resear
ch and development expenses represented 8% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2000 compared to 10% in the third quarter of 1999. For the first nine months of 2000, research and development expenses represented 8% of total revenues compared to 11%
for the same period of the prior year. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in future quarters to support the development and introduction of new generations of flash data storage products, including the 512Mbit and
1&nbsp;Gigabit flash memory co-development and manufacturing joint venture with Toshiba and the development of advanced controller chips.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sales and Marketing</i>. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, benefits and travel expenses for our sales, marketing,
customer service and applications engineering personnel. These expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses, such as independent manufacturer&#146;s representative commissions, advertising and tradeshow expenses. Sales and marketing expenses
were $12.5&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000, up $5.9&nbsp;million or 88% from $6.6&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 1999. In the first nine months of 2000, sales and marketing expenses increased to $34.6&nbsp;million, up $17.0&nbsp;million or
97% from $17.6&nbsp;million in the same period of 1999. These increases were primarily due to increased salary and related expenses due to additional personnel, higher sales commission expenses due to increased product revenues, and increased marketing expe

nses. Sales and marketing expenses represented approximately 7% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2000 compared to 10% in the third quarter of 1999. For the first nine months of 2000, sales and marketing expenses represented 8% of total revenues
compared to 11% for the same period of the prior year. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as sales of our products grow, as we continue to develop the retail channel and brand awareness for our products and as we increase our
market development activities for our Secure Digital Memory Card products.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>General and Administrative</i>. General and administrative expenses include the cost of our finance, information systems, human resources,
stockholder relations, legal and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses were $7.9&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000, up $4.8&nbsp;million or 156% from $3.1&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 1999. In the first nine months
of 2000, general and administrative expenses increased to $18.7&nbsp;million, up $10.3&nbsp;million or 123% from $8.4&nbsp;million in the same period of 1999. These increases were primarily due to increased salary and related expenses associated with
additional personnel, increased legal fees and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to higher trade accounts receivable balances from increased revenues. General and administrative expenses represented 5% and 4%, respectively, of
total revenues for
 the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2000 compared to 5% for the same periods in 1999. In the fourth quarter, we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to grow due primarily to increased legal fees related to the
Lexar trial. See &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results&#151;Risks Associated with Patents, Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation.&#148; General and administrative expenses could also increase substantially in the future if we continue to pursue
litigation to defend our patent portfolio. In addition, we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as our general and administrative functions grow to support our overall growth.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2000 to be between 20% and 25% higher than in the third quarter.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Interest Income</i>. Interest income was $5.9&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000 compared to $1.4&nbsp;million in the third quarter of
1999. The increase in 2000 was due primarily to higher interest income due to the investment of the proceeds from the sale of common stock in our November 1999 follow-on public offering. We expect interest income to decrease in the fourth quarter as we
continue to use cash to invest in the FlashVision Joint Venture and the Tower foundry investment.</font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>13</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Gain on Investment in Foundry</i>. In the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a gain of $344.2 million as a result of the merger of United
Silicon, Inc. (&#147;USIC&#148;) and United Microelectronics Corporation (&#147;UMC&#148;). We had invested $51.2&nbsp;million in USIC. We received 111&nbsp;million shares of UMC in exchange for our USIC shares. These shares were valued at $396 million at
the time of the merger. All of the UMC shares are were subject to trading restrictions imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The trading restrictions expired on one-half of the shares on July&nbsp;3, 2000. The remaining shares will become
available for sale over a two year period beginning in January&nbsp;2002. When the shares are ultimately sold, it is likely that we will recognize additional gains or losses. In May&nbsp;2000, we received a stock dividend of 200&nbsp;UMC shares for every
1,000&nbsp;shares
 of UMC owned, resulting in our ownership of 22&nbsp;million additional UMC shares. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Other Income, Net.</i> Other expense, net was $438,000 in the third quarter of 2000 compared to other income of $1.3&nbsp;million for the same
period of the prior year. The expense in the third quarter was primarily due to foreign exchange losses on our Japanese Yen related transactions. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Provision for Income Taxes</i>. In the third quarter of 2000, we increased our effective tax rate to 36% for fiscal&nbsp;2000, exclusive of the
gain on foundry investment, based on our current assessment of our US and foreign tax obligations. This compares to an effective tax rate of 33% in 1999. The lower effective tax rate in 1999 reflects greater benefits from federal and state tax credits. In
the first quarter of 2000, an additional tax of $140.2&nbsp;million was provided for the gain on foundry investment. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Liquidity and Capital Resources</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;30, 2000, we had working capital of $601.5&nbsp;million, which included $172.3&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents and
$258.9&nbsp;million in short-term investments. Operating activities provided $38.2&nbsp;million of cash in the nine month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2000 primarily from net income and an increase in accounts payable of $34.4&nbsp;million, which were
partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $81.1&nbsp;million and inventories of $31.6&nbsp;million.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2000 of $23.1&nbsp;million consisted of our $36.9&nbsp;million investment in
FlashVision LLC, our foundry joint venture with Toshiba and capital equipment purchases of $19.0&nbsp;million. In addition, we paid $20.0&nbsp;million of our planned $75&nbsp;million investment in Tower Semiconductor. This $20.0&nbsp;million will be held
in escrow until all conditions of closing of the purchase agreement are met. These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds from short term investments of $52.9&nbsp;million. In the first nine months of 2000, cash provided by financing
activities of $10.9&nbsp;million came primarily from the sale of common stock through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacturing of 512&nbsp;megabit and 1&nbsp;
gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. As part of this transaction, SanDisk and Toshiba formed FlashVision LLC, a joint venture to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line in Virginia. The cost of equipping the
Virginia wafer manufacturing line is estimated at between $700&nbsp;million and $800 million. We, as part of our 50%&nbsp;ownership of the joint venture, expect to invest up to $150&nbsp;million in cash, and guarantee equipment lease lines up to an
additional $250&nbsp;million. In addition, we will share certain research and development costs. We made contributions totaling $36.9&nbsp;million to the joint venture during the second and third quarters of 2000.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2000, we entered into a definitive agreement to make a $75&nbsp;million equity investment in Tower Semiconductor resulting in
approximately 10%&nbsp;ownership of Tower. In exchange for its investment, SanDisk will receive one seat on the board of directors and a guaranteed portion of the wafer output from the advanced fab Tower plans to build in Migdal Haemek, Israel. Under the
terms of the agreement, SanDisk will make its investment over a period of approximately 18 months if key milestones related to the construction, equipping and wafer production at the new wafer fab are met. We expect first wafer production to commence at
the new fab in 2002. The closing of the transaction is subject to several conditions including the timely approval of a financial incentive package for Tower from the Israeli government, Tower&#146;s ability to secure additional financing from other
foundry partners and
 financial institutions, timely commencement of fab construction and the approval of Tower&#146;s board. During the third quarter, we transferred the first $20&nbsp;million of this investment to an escrow account pending the completion of all conditions
required for the closing. The additional investment will take the form of mandatory warrant exercises at an exercise price of $30.00&nbsp;per share. In the event the key milestones are not achieved, the exercise of such warrants will not be mandatory and
the warrants will expire five years from the date of grant. On October&nbsp;10, 2000, the Israeli Finance </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>14</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>Minister recommended the approval of a $250&nbsp;million grant for the construction of the wafer foundry. We expect the remaining conditions to closing to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2000. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;9, 2000, SanDisk entered into a joint venture, Digital Portal Inc , (&#147;DPI&#148;), with Photo-Me International (&#147;PMI&#148;)
for the manufacture, installation and service of self-service, digital photo printing labs, or kiosks, bearing the SanDisk brand name. Under the agreement, SanDisk and PMI will each make an initial investment of $4&nbsp;million in the DPI joint venture,
and secure lease financing for the purchase of the kiosks. The total value of the lease financing will depend on the number of kiosks deployed by the joint venture. We estimate that we will guarantee equipment lease arrangements of approximately $40&nbsp;
million over the first two years of the agreement. PMI will manufacture the kiosks for the joint venture and will install and maintain the kiosks under contract with the joint venture. The first kiosks are expected to be deployed in retail stores in the
United
States in the first half of&nbsp;2001.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;2, 2000, SanDisk made a strategic investment of $7.2&nbsp;million in Divio, Inc., a privately-held manufacturer of digital imaging
compression technology and products. Under the agreement, SanDisk will own approximately 10% of Divio and be entitled to one board seat.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on future demand for our products, we may make additional investments, which could be substantial, in assembly and test manufacturing
equipment or foundry capacity to support our business in the future. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments along with the planned capital equipment lease arrangements currently in negotiation related to our
FlashVision LLC and Digital Portal, Inc. joint ventures will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital, capital equipment expenditure and joint venture and Tower foundry investment requirements for, at least the next twelve months.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;3, 2000, the USIC foundry was merged into UMC. We previously invested $51.2&nbsp;million in USIC. In exchange for our USIC shares, we
received 111&nbsp;million UMC shares. These shares were valued at approximately $396&nbsp;million at the time of the merger, resulting in a pretax gain of $344&nbsp;million ($204&nbsp;million after-tax). All the UMC shares we received as a result of the
merger are subject to trading restrictions imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The trading restrictions expired on one-half of the shares on July&nbsp;3, 2000. The remaining shares will become available for sale over a two year period beginning
in January&nbsp;2002. In addition, in May&nbsp;2000 we received a stock dividend of 200&nbsp;UMC shares for every 1,000&nbsp;shares owned, resulting in the ownership of an additional 22&nbsp;million shares. In addition, on September&nbsp;18, 2000, UMC
complet
ed its American Depositary Shares (&#147;ADRs&#148;) offering. In connection with this offering, SanDisk signed a lock-up agreement that prohibits the sale of all but 5 million of the unrestricted UMC shares for a period of 90&nbsp;days following the
completion of the offering. At September&nbsp;30, 2000, the unrealized loss on the available-for-sale portion of our UMC investment was $30.9&nbsp;million. When the shares are ultimately sold, it is likely that we will report additional gains or losses.
To the extent we can liquidate the UMC shares, we will plan to use such funds to support our operations and capital expenditures.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Impact of Currency Exchange Rates </b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of our revenues are denominated in Japanese yen. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. At September&nbsp;30, 2000, a forward contract with a notional amount of $4.9&nbsp;million was outstanding. Future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.</font></p>

<p align=center><font size=2><b>Factors That May Affect Future Results</b></font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our operating results may fluctuate significantly which may adversely affect our stock price.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the
future. This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors, including the following:</font></p>

<ul><font size=2><LI>	unpredictable demand for our products;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	decline in the average selling prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressures;</font></ul>

<ul><font size=2><LI>	adverse changes in product and customer mix;</font></ul>
<CENTER><font size=2>15</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<ul><font size=2><LI>	slower than anticipated market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products;</font></ul>

<ul><font size=2><LI>	changes in our distribution channels;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	timing of license and royalty revenue;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	fluctuations in product costs, particularly due to fluctuations in manufacturing yields and utilization;</font></ul>

<ul><font size=2><LI>	shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit boards required for the manufacturing of our products;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	excess capacity of flash memory from our competitors and our own new flash wafer capacity;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	significant yield losses which could affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and could increase our costs;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	manufacturing flaws affecting the reliability, functionality or performance of our products which could increase our product costs, reduce demand for our products or require product recalls;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	lengthening in manufacturing cycle times due to our suppliers operating at peak capacity;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	increased research and development expenses;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	exchange rate fluctuations, particularly the U.S. dollar to Japanese yen exchange rate;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	changes in general economic conditions, particularly in Japan and the European Union;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business, particularly Taiwan, Japan and the United States;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	difficulty of forecasting and management of inventory levels and</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	expenses related to obsolescence of unsold inventory.</font></ul>
<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Difficulty of estimating silicon wafer needs</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we order silicon wafers from our foundries, we have to estimate the number of silicon wafers needed to fill product orders several months into
the future. If we overestimate this number, we will build excess inventories, which could harm our gross margins and operating results. If we underestimate the number of silicon wafers needed to fill product orders, we may be unable to obtain an adequate
supply of wafers, which could harm our product revenues. Because our largest volume products, CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard, are sold into emerging consumer markets, it has been difficult to accurately forecast future sales. A substantial majority of
our quarterly sales have historically been from orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter. In addition, our product order backlog may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter. </font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Anticipated growth in expense levels</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We increased our expense levels in the first nine months of fiscal&nbsp;2000 to support our growth. We expect operating expenses to continue to
increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal&nbsp;2000 and beyond as a result of the need to hire additional personnel to support expected growth in sales unit volumes, sales and marketing efforts and research and development activities, including our
collaboration with Toshiba providing for the joint development of 512&nbsp;megabit and 1&nbsp;gigabit flash memory chips. We have significant fixed costs and we cannot readily reduce these expenses over the short term. If revenues do not increase
proportionately to operating expenses, or if revenues decrease or do not meet expectations for a particular period, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Variability of average selling prices and gross margins</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our product mix varies quarterly, which affects our overall average selling prices and gross margins. Our CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products,
which currently represent the majority of our product revenues, have </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>16</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity FlashDisk and FlashDrive products. We believe that sales of CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products will continue to represent a significant percentage of
our product revenues as consumer applications, such as digital cameras and digital music players, become more popular. In the first nine months of 2000, average selling prices decreased 5% compared to the same period in 1999, reflecting the Flash memory
supply shortages which prevailed during this period helping to keep prices relatively stable. Current indications are that the Flash supply in the market for our products may be coming more into balance with forecasted demand sometime in 2001. If this
situation materializes in 2001, we expect that price declines for our products could be significant on an annualized basis. If we cannot reduce our product manufacturing costs in 2001 to offset these reduced prices, our gross margins and net profitability
will s
uffer. </font></p>
<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Variability of license fees and royalties</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intellectual property strategy is to cross-license our patents to other manufacturers of flash products. Under these arrangements, we earn
license fees and royalties on individually negotiated terms. The timing of revenue recognition from these payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and on the timing of product shipments by the third parties. This may cause license and royalty
revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Because these revenues have higher gross margins than product revenues, gross margins and net income fluctuate significantly with changes in license and royalty revenues. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>In transitioning to new processes and products, we face production and market acceptance risks.</b></font></p>
<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>General</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successive generations of our products have incorporated semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity per chip. Two important factors that have
enabled us to decrease the cost per megabyte of our flash data storage products are the development of higher capacity semiconductor devices and the implementation of smaller geometry manufacturing processes. A number of challenges exist in achieving a
lower cost per megabyte, including:</font></p>

<ul><font size=2><LI>	overcoming lower yields often experienced in the early production of new semiconductor devices;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	overcoming manufacturing flaws with new processes including manufacturing processes at our subcontractors which may be extremely complex; </font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	problems with design and manufacturing of products that will incorporate these devices; and</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	production delays.</font></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because our products are complex, we periodically experience significant delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products.
Similar delays could occur in the future and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>D2 flash technology</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed new products based on D2 flash technology, a new flash architecture designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell. High
density flash memory, such as D2 flash, is a complex technology that requires strict manufacturing controls and effective test screens. Problems encountered in the shift to volume production for new flash products could impact both reliability and yields,
and result in increased manufacturing costs and reduced product availability. We may not be able to manufacture future generations of our D2 products with yields sufficient to result in lower costs per megabyte. If we are unable to bring future
generations of our 256&nbsp;megabit flash memory into full production as quickly as planned or if we experience unplanned yield or reliability problems, we will not be able to meet our customers&#146; forecasted demand, which would result in lost sales,
reduced revenues a
nd reduced margins. </font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>MultiMediaCard products</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MultiMediaCard presents new challenges in assembly and testing. For example, in the third quarter of 1999, during the MultiMediaCard production
startup phase, we experienced fluctuations in yields which reduced MultiMediaCard product availability, increased manufacturing costs and reduced product margins for this product family. We are currently unable to meet all customer demand for our
MultiMediaCard products. Future yield </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>17</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>problems with our MultiMediaCard products could result in lost sales and reduced revenues. In addition, our gross margins may be harmed by any problems we encounter in the production of our MultiMediaCard products. </font></p>
<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Secure Digital Memory Card products</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 1999, we announced a memorandum of understanding under which we, along with Matsushita and Toshiba, will jointly develop and
promote the Secure Digital Memory Card. The Secure Digital Memory Card is an enhanced version of our MultiMediaCard that will incorporate advanced security and copyright protection features required by the emerging markets for the electronic distribution
of music, video and other copyrighted works. We expect to begin sampling our Secure Digital Memory Card products to key customers in the fourth quarter of 2000 and to begin volume production in the first half of 2001.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secure Digital Memory Card will incorporate a number of new features, including SDMI compliant security and copy protection, a mechanical write
protect switch and a high data transfer rate. We have never built products incorporating these features. Any problems or delays in establishing production capabilities or ramping up production volumes of our Secure Digital Memory Card products could
result in lost sales or increased manufacturing costs in 2001 and beyond. In addition, we cannot be sure that manufacturers of consumer electronic products will develop new products that use the Secure Digital Memory Card or that content providers such as
music studios will agree to distribute their copyrighted content for storage on Secure Digital Memory Cards. For example, in the past two quarters the major US based content providers have  had significant success in U.S. courts in their litigation with
Napster.Co
m and MP3.Com, and this may have slowed down the widespread  distribution of digital music on the internet. Although the Secure Digital Card is designed specifically to address the copy protection rights of the content providers, there can be no
assurance that these content providers will all agree to support it. Furthermore, there is no assurance that consumers will widely adopt Secure Digital Memory Cards because of the requirement to purchase copyrighted content. Conversely, broad acceptance
of our Secure Digital Memory Card by consumers may reduce demand for our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash card products. See &#147;&#151;The success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products.&#148;</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>We depend on third party foundries for silicon wafers.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of our products require silicon wafers. We rely on UMC in Taiwan to supply the majority of our silicon wafers. We depend on UMC to allocate a
portion of its capacity to meet our needs, produce acceptable quality wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields and deliver our wafers on a timely basis at a competitive price. If UMC is unable to satisfy these requirements, our business, financial
condition and operating results may suffer. For example, in September&nbsp;1999, both UMC foundries producing our flash memory wafers were damaged and temporarily shut down by an earthquake in Taiwan. Future earthquakes, aftershocks or other natural
disasters in Taiwan could preclude us from obtaining an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders, and could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2000, the USIC foundry was merged into UMC. Before the merger, we owned 10% of USIC, had the right to appoint one of its directors
and were entitled to 12.5% of its total wafer production. As a result of the merger, we received UMC shares in exchange for our USIC shares. However, we do not have a right to a seat on the board of directors of the combined company. We have received
assurances from the senior management of UMC that it intends to continue to supply us the same wafer capacity at the prices we currently enjoy under our agreement with USIC. UMC has fulfilled its obligations to us in each of the past three quarters.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current wafer capacity and competitive pricing arrangement in our future supply negotiations with UMC.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with UMC, we are obligated to provide a rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders for the next
six calendar months. Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each forecast are binding commitments. The estimates for the remaining months may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month&#146;s forecast. This limits our
ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products. For example, if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our wafer orders, we may end up with excess wafer inventories, which could result in higher
operating expenses and reduced gross margins. Conversely, if customer demand exceeds our forecasts, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers to fill customer orders, which could result in dissatisfied customers, lost sales and lower
revenues. In ad
dition, in February&nbsp;2000, we entered into a capacity and reservation deposit agreement with UMC. To reserve additional foundry capacity under this agreement, we paid UMC a reservation deposit. This deposit will </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>18</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>be refunded to us on a quarterly basis, over the agreement term, if we purchase the full wafer capacity reserved for us.  We may forfeit part of our deposit if we are unable to utilize our reserved capacity within four quarters
of the end of the agreement term. If we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers with acceptable price and yields from any foundry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 2000, we completed qualifications and began volume production of the 256&nbsp;Mbit D2&nbsp;.24&nbsp;micron technology in two
UMC fabs. We now have three UMC fabs producing our .24&nbsp;micron wafers. The yields on these wafers vary from fab to fab due to the relative stage of start-up or production ramp. The third UMC fab to begin production is a new UMC fab and we have been
experiencing lower yields than the two other fabs. There can be no assurances that we will not experience delays in wafer availability, low yields, or undetected manufacturing flaws which may adversely impact the reliable operation of our products. Any
such difficulties may adversely impact our product availability and gross margins.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our investment in new flash memory wafer production may result in increased expenses and fluctuations in operating results.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba to jointly develop future flash memory products and jointly manufacture such product,
once developed. Under this agreement, we expect to invest $150&nbsp;million in cash and guarantee up to $250&nbsp;million in equipment lease lines to equip Toshiba&#146;s Dominion Semiconductor manufacturing clean room with advanced wafer processing
equipment. Toshiba is obligated to invest an equal amount and each of us will equally share the startup expenses and the wafer output. We will use the new production capacity at Dominion to manufacture primarily NAND flash memory wafers with minimum
lithographic feature size of 0.16&nbsp;micron initially, moving to 0.13&nbsp;micron in the future. Such minimum feature sizes are considered today to be among the most advanced for mass production of silicon wafers and have never been used for the high
volume manufacture
of flash memory chips. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how long it will take to equip and commence production at the new facility and achieve adequate yields, reliable operation, and economically attractive product costs based on our new designs.
We have not operated our own wafer fabrication facility in the past and therefore do not have any experience in addressing these challenges. With our investments in the Dominion facility, we are now exposed to the adverse financial impact of any delays or
manufacturing problems associated with the wafer production line. Any problems or delays in commencing production at the new Dominion facility could adversely impact our operating results in fiscal year 2001 and beyond.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to incur substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of manufacturing personnel, facilitizing the clean room and
installing equipment. During the ramp-up period, equipment depreciation begins and line operating expenses increase substantially. While the wafer output is still relatively low, the cost of wafers from the Dominion facility is expected to be
significantly higher than the cost of wafers from our other suppliers. This may negatively impact our overall product gross margins until flash wafer output from Dominion reaches an optimum level, which may never occur. Under the agreement with Toshiba,
we are committed to purchase 50% of the output from the Dominion facility. We will incur startup costs and pay our share of ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize our full share of the Dominion output. Should customer demand for NAND flash
products be less than
 our available supply, we may suffer from reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, in order for us to sell NAND based CompactFlash, MultiMediaCards and SD Cards, we will have to develop new
controllers, printed circuit boards and test algorithms because the architecture of NAND flash is significantly different from our current NOR flash designs. Any delays in the development of these elements could prevent us from taking advantage of the
available NAND output and could adversely affect our results of operations.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2000, SanDisk entered into a definitive agreement to make a $75&nbsp;million equity investment in Tower Semiconductor in Israel. In
exchange for its investment, SanDisk will receive one seat on the board of directors and a guaranteed portion of the wafer output from the advanced fab Tower plans to build in Migdal Haemek, Israel with .18&nbsp;micron process technology which Tower
licensed from Toshiba. We plan to use the Tower wafers for the future manufacture of a portion of our controller chips that are being designed at our design center in Israel. Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will make its investment over a period
of approximately 18&nbsp;months if key milestones related to the construction, equipping and wafer production at the new wafer fab are met. First wafer production is expected at the new fab in 2002. The closing of the transaction is subject to several
conditions incl
uding the timely approval of a financial incentive package for Tower from the Israeli government, Tower&#146;s ability to secure additional financing from other foundry partners and financial institutions, timely commencement of fab construction and the
approval of Tower&#146;s board. During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, we transferred the </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>19</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>first $20&nbsp;million of this investment to an escrow account pending the completion of all conditions required for the closing. Also during the third quarter, the Israeli Government announced that it will provide Tower with a
grant of up to $250&nbsp;million to help fund the construction and equipping of the new fab. The current political unrest in the region does not represent a security problem for Tower since Migdal Haemek is in a secure geographic location. Nevertheless it
may cause unforeseen schedule delays. We cannot assure you that the Tower facility will be completed or will begin production as scheduled, or that the processes needed to fabricate our wafers will be qualified at the new facility. Moreover, we cannot
assure you that this new facility will be able to achieve acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis at a competitive price.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2><b>The success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for demand for our products to grow, the markets for new products that use CompactFlash and the MultiMediaCard, such as portable digital
music players and smart phones, must develop and grow. If sales of these products do not grow, our revenues and profit margins could level off or decline.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we sell our products for use in many new applications, it is difficult to forecast demand. For example, in 1999 and the first half of 2000,
demand for our MultiMediaCard for use in portable digital music players grew faster than anticipated and we were unable to fill all customer orders. During the third quarter, the U.S.&nbsp;Courts ruled against Napster.Com and MP3.Com in two cases
involving unlicensed distribution of copyrighted digital music over the internet. This action is being carefully studied by the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, who have been developing MP3 players using Flash memory cards such as our
MultiMediaCards for storage of music. If these OEMs reduce their production of digital music players in response to these recent court decisions or other factors, demand for our products will decrease. In addition, we believe that these OEMs may redesign
their platforms to work
 with our Secure Digital Memory Card, which we plan to start sampling in the fourth quarter of 2000. Accordingly, we may experience a drop in demand from our MultiMediaCard customers before the new anticipated demand for our Secure Digital Memory Card
picks up.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Secure Digital Memory Card products</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third quarter of 1999, we announced a collaboration under which we will jointly develop the Secure Digital Memory Card, an enhanced version of
our MultiMediaCard, which will incorporate advanced security and copyright protection features required by the emerging markets for the electronic distribution of music, video and other copyrighted works. We expect to begin shipping customer samples of
our Secure Digital Memory Cards in 32 and 64&nbsp;megabyte capacities in the fourth quarter of 2000. The Secure Digital Memory Card is slightly thicker and uses a different interface than our MultiMediaCard. Because of these differences, the Secure
Digital Memory Card will not work in current products that include a MultiMediaCard slot. In order for the market for our Secure Digital Memory Card to develop, manufacturers of digital audio/video and portable computing products must include a Secure
Digital Memory
 Card compatible slot in their products and acquire a license to the security algorithms. If OEM&#146;s do not incorporate Secure Digital Memory Card slots in their products or do not buy our Secure Digital Memory Cards, our business, financial condition
and results of operations may be harmed. In addition, consumers may postpone or altogether forego buying products that utilize our MultiMediaCard in anticipation of new products such as MP3 players and digital camcorders that will incorporate the Secure
Digital Memory Card. If this occurs, sales of our MultiMediaCard products may be harmed. The main competition for the Secure Digital Memory Card is expected to come from the Sony Memory Stick. Sony has substantially greater financial and other resources
than we do and extensive marketing and sales channels and brand recognition. We cannot assure you that our Secure Digital Memory Card will be successful in the face of such competition.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the market for portable digital music players is very new and it is uncertain how quickly consumer demand for these players will grow.
If this market does not grow as quickly as anticipated or our customers are not successful in selling their portable digital music players to consumers, our revenues could be adversely affected. In addition, it is often the case with new consumer markets
that after an initial period of new market formation and initial acceptance by early adopters, the market enters a period of slow growth as standards emerge and infrastructure develops. In the event that this occurs in the portable digital music player
market or other emerging markets, sales of our products would be harmed.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of our new product strategy will depend upon, among other things, the following:</font></p>

gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. As part of this collaboration, we and Toshiba plan to employ Toshiba&#146;s 0.16&nbsp;micron and future 0.13&nbsp;micron NAND flash integrated circuit manufacturing technology and
SanDisk&#146;s multilevel cell flash and controller system technology. During the third quarter, we announced with Toshiba the completion of the joint development of the 512&nbsp;Mbit NAND Flash chip employing Toshiba&#146;s .16&nbsp;micron manufacturing
process technology. We expect cards employing this advanced technology to commence customer shipments in the first half of 2001. The development of 512&nbsp;megabit and 1 gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers is expected to
be complex an

depends on our ability to obtain sufficient flash memory wafers and other components to meet demand. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may lose market share to our competitors. Currently, our supply constraints are forcing some of our
largest customers to seek alternate sources of supply to meet their growing flash memory product needs.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our selling prices may be affected by future excess capacity in the market for flash memory products.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, industry wide demand for flash memory products exceeds the available supply. This has been primarily driven by an explosion in the growth
of cellular phones and the accelerating shift in consumer electronics from analog to digital devices. This strong demand manifested itself in improved bookings visibility and a more stable pricing environment. All major flash memory suppliers, including
SanDisk, have responded to this strong demand by significantly increasing investments in new advanced flash memory production capacity. Current indications are that the Flash supply in the market for our products may be coming more into balance with
forecasted demand sometime in 2001. If this situation materializes in 2001, we expect that price declines for our products could be significant on an annualized basis. If we cannot reduce our product manufacturing costs in 2001 to offset these reduced
prices, our g
ross margins and net profitability will suffer. If one or several of our target markets fail to grow as anticipated, there may be excess supply in the markets for our products. This excess capacity, even if temporary in nature, could cause average
selling prices to drop more than expected, thereby adversely impacting our sales, product gross margins and operating results in future quarters. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our international operations make us vulnerable to changing conditions and currency fluctuations.</b></font></p>
<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Political risks</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the majority of our flash memory wafers are produced by three UMC foundries in Taiwan. We also use a third-party subcontractor in Taiwan
for the assembly and testing of our MultiMediaCard products. We may therefore be affected by the political, economic and military conditions in Taiwan. Taiwan is currently engaged in various political disputes with China and in the past both countries
have conducted military exercises in or near the other&#146;s territorial waters and airspace. The Taiwanese and Chinese governments may escalate these disputes, </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>21</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>resulting in an economic embargo, a disruption in shipping routes or even military hostilities. This could harm our business by interrupting or delaying the production or shipment of flash memory wafers or MultiMediaCard
products by our Taiwanese foundries and subcontractor. See &#147;&#151; We depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors.&#148;</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use a third-party subcontractor in China for the assembly and testing of our CompactFlash products. As a result, our business could be harmed by
the effect of political, economic, legal and other uncertainties in China. Under its current leadership, the Chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic
decentralization. The Chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies and, even if it does continue, these policies may not be successful. The Chinese government may also significantly alter these policies from time to time. In addition,
China does not currently have a comprehensive and highly developed legal system, particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights. As a result, enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain, and the
implementation and
interpretation of such laws may be inconsistent. Such inconsistency could lead to piracy and degradation of our intellectual property protection.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, while the political unrest in Israel has not yet posed a direct security risk to our engineering design center or our foundry investment
in Tower Semiconductor due to their geographic location, it may nevertheless cause unforeseen delays in the development of our products or the construction of the Tower wafer foundry.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Economic risks</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We price our products primarily in U.S. dollars. As a result, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies, our products
could become less competitive in international markets. For example, our products are relatively more expensive in Asia because of the weakness of many Asian currencies relative to the US dollar. In addition, we currently invoice some of our customers in
Japanese yen. Therefore, fluctuations in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the weakness of the Euro may make our products less competitive in Europe relative to
Japanese flash memory suppliers.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales are also highly dependent upon global economic conditions. In fiscal 1998, sales to Japan declined to 31.6% of total product sales from
38.1% in 1997. In 1999, sales to Japan represented 22.4% of product revenue. We believe these declines were primarily due to the Japanese recession.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>General risks</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our international business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any of the following factors:</font></p>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	the need to comply with foreign government regulation;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability, potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business, particularly Taiwan and Japan;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	imposition of regulatory requirements, tariffs, import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions, particularly in China;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection, particularly as we increase our sales through the retail distribution channel;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	potentially adverse tax consequences;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	less protection of our intellectual property rights; and</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions.</font></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2><b>We depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on our vendors, some of which are sole source suppliers, for several of our critical components. We do not have long-term supply agreements
with some of these vendors. Our business, financial condition and </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>22</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>operating results could be significantly harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components. For example, we rely on UMC for the
majority of our flash memory wafers and NEC to supply 100% of certain designs of microcontrollers. In September&nbsp;1999, both UMC foundries producing our flash memory wafers were damaged and temporarily shut down by an earthquake in Taiwan. In addition,
due to industry-wide increasing demand for semiconductors, we have been unable to obtain price reductions from some of our important suppliers. See &#147;-&#151;We depend on third party foundries for silicon wafers.&#148; We have experienced longer order
lead times and spot shortages on standard components due to high industry demand. Shortages of any of these standard components could result in higher manufacturing costs or lower revenues due to production delays or reduced product shipments.
Additionally, where
 possible, we are building buffer inventories of critical components. If we accumulate excess inventories or these buffer inventories become obsolete, we will have to write down inventories which will adversely affect our gross margins and results of
operations. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also rely on third-party subcontractors to assemble and test the memory components for our products. We have no long-term contracts with these
subcontractors and cannot directly control product delivery schedules. This could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems which could increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our operating results.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second half of 1999, we transferred a substantial portion of wafer testing, packaged memory final testing, card assembly and card testing
to Silicon Precision Industries Co., Ltd. in Taiwan and Celestica, Inc. in China. In the second quarter of 2000, we began using Amkor, in the Philippines, as an additional subcontractor for card assembly and testing. In fiscal 2000, we expect that these
three subcontractors will be assembling and testing a majority of our mature, high-volume products. This increased reliance on subcontractors is expected to reduce manufacturing costs and give us access to increased production capacity. During the
transition period, we will continue full operations at our Sunnyvale production facility while simultaneously transferring test equipment and training personnel of our subcontractors. However, we do not have sufficient duplicative production testing
equipment at Sunn
yvale and at our subcontractors. Therefore, any significant problems in this complex transfer of operations may result in a disruption of production and a shortage of product to meet customer demand in the fourth quarter of 2000.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Continuing declines in our average sales prices may result in declines in our gross margins.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the average unit selling prices of our products declined 22% compared to 1998. In the first nine months of fiscal 2000, average unit selling
prices declined 5%. Because flash data storage markets are characterized by intense competition and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet consumer price points, we expect that market-driven pricing pressures will continue or even
accelerate. This will likely result in a further decline in average sales prices for our products. We believe that we may be able to offset declining average unit sales prices by achieving manufacturing cost reductions and developing new products that
incorporate more advanced technologies, include more advanced features and can be sold at stable average gross margins despite continued declines in average selling price per megabyte. However, if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions and
technological advance
s, this could result in lost sales and declining gross margins, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is cyclical and we believe it is currently in a recovery from one of its most severe down cycles. During most of 1997 and
1998, the semiconductor industry experienced significant production over capacity, which reduced margins for substantially all flash memory suppliers. Currently, the markets for our products are supply constrained and our selling prices have stayed
relatively stable. However, many of the leading manufacturers of Flash Memory, including ourselves, have been adding significant amounts of new production capacity, and this may result in excess supply beginning sometime in 2001. If that trend
materializes, it could result in increased competition and reduced average selling prices for our products. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our markets are highly competitive.</b></font></p>
<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Flash memory manufacturers and memory card assemblers</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We compete in an industry characterized by intense competition, rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, declining average selling
prices and rapid product obsolescence. Our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer foundry capacity, </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>23</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers. Our primary competitors include:</font></p>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	storage flash chip producers such as Hitachi Ltd., Samsung Electronics Company Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation;</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	socket flash, linear flash and component manufacturers such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Atmel Corporation, Fujitsu Corporation, Intel Corporation, Macronix International Co., Ltd., Micron Technology, Inc., Mitsubishi Electronic
Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corporation and STMicroelectronics NV; and</font></ul>
<ul><font size=2><LI>	module or card assemblers such as Lexar Media, Inc., M-Systems, Inc., Pretec Electronics Corp., Simple Technology Inc., Sony Corporation, Kingston Technology Company, Panasonic Consumer Electronic Company, Silicon Storage
Technology, Inc., TDK Corporation, Matsushita Battery, Inc. Delkin Devices, Inc.,  Silicon Tek and Viking Components, Inc., who combine controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards.</font></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many companies have been certified by the CompactFlash Association to manufacture and sell their own brand of CompactFlash. We believe
additional manufacturers will enter the CompactFlash market in the future.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have announced an agreement with Matsushita and Toshiba to jointly develop and promote a next generation flash memory card called the Secure
Digital Memory Card. Under this agreement, Secure Digital Memory Card royalty-bearing licenses will be granted to other flash memory card manufacturers, which will increase the competition for our Secure Digital Memory Card, CompactFlash and
MultiMediaCard products. In addition, Matsushita and Toshiba have commenced selling Secure Digital Memory Cards that will compete directly with our products. While other flash card manufacturers will be required to pay the SD Association license fees and
royalties which will be shared between Matsushita, Toshiba and SanDisk, there will be no royalties or license fees payable among the three companies for their respective sales of the Secure Digital Memory Card. Thus, we will forfeit potential royalty
income from Secure Digital
 Memory Card sales by Matsushita and Toshiba.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;30, 2000, we closed a transaction with Toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of 512&nbsp;megabit and 1&nbsp;
gigabit flash memory chips and Secure Digital Memory Card controllers. We and Toshiba will each separately market and sell any products developed and manufactured under this relationship. Accordingly, we will compete directly with Toshiba for sales of
these advanced chips and controllers.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have entered into patent cross-license agreements with several of our leading competitors including Hitachi, Samsung, Toshiba, Intel, SST, Sharp,
SmartDisk and TDK. Under these agreements, each party may manufacture and sell products that incorporate technology covered by the other party&#146;s patents related to flash memory devices. As we continue to license our patents to certain of our
competitors, competition will increase and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Currently, we are engaged in licensing discussions with several of our competitors. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
concluding licensing agreements under terms, which are favorable to us.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Alternative storage media</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that are different from our CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products
including Toshiba&#146;s SmartMedia, Sony Corporation&#146;s Memory Stick, Sony&#146;s standard floppy disk used for digital storage in its Mavica digital cameras, Panasonic&#146;s Mega Storage cards, Iomega&#146;s Clik drive, a miniaturized, mechanical,
removable disk drive, and M-Systems&#146; Diskonchip for embedded storage applications and the Secure MultiMediaCard from Hitachi and Infineon. Each competing standard is mechanically and electronically incompatible with CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard.
If a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs in one of these alternative competing standards, CompactFlash or MultiMediaCard will be eliminated from use in that product.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IBM&#146;s microdrive, a rotating disk drive in a Type II CompactFlash format competes directly with our Type II CompactFlash memory cards for use in
high-end professional digital cameras. M-Systems&#146; Diskonchip 2000 Millennium product competes against our Flash ChipSet products in embedded storage applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances.</font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>24</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to independent industry analysts, Sony&#146;s Mavica digital camera captured a considerable portion of the United States market for digital
cameras in 1998 and 1999. The Mavica uses a standard floppy disk to store digital images and therefore uses no CompactFlash, or any other flash cards. Our sales prospects for CompactFlash cards have been adversely impacted by the success of the Mavica.
Recently, Sony has shifted its focus to the use of its flash Memory Stick in its latest digital camera models.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MultiMediaCard products also have faced significant competition from Toshiba&#146;s SmartMedia flash cards and we expect to face similarly
significant competition from Sony&#146;s Memory Stick. Sony has licensed its proprietary Memory Stick to other companies. If it is adopted and achieves widespread use in future products, sales of our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash products may decline.
Recently, Hitachi, Infineon, Sanyo and Fujitsu have proposed their Secure MultiMediaCard which provides the copy protection function that is included in our Secure Digital Memory Card. Should this initiative gain industry wide acceptance, it may reduce
the widespread adoption of the Secure Digital Memory Card.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2000, Sanyo announced that it is developing a miniature magneto-optical storage device for use in future digital cameras,
music players and camcorders. There can be no assurance that this device will not be adopted by some of our OEM customers.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Alternative flash technologies</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also face competition from products based on multilevel cell flash technology such as Intel&#146;s 64&nbsp;megabit and 128&nbsp;megabit
StrataFlash chips and Hitachi&#146;s 256&nbsp;megabit multilevel cell flash chip. These products compete with our D2 multilevel cell flash technology. Multilevel cell flash is a technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits
of information instead of the traditional single bit stored by the industry standard flash technology. In the second quarter of 1999, Intel announced their new 128&nbsp;megabit multilevel cell chip and Hitachi is currently shipping CompactFlash and
MultiMediaCard products employing their multilevel cell 256&nbsp;megabit flash chip. In addition, Toshiba has begun customer shipments of 32 and 64&nbsp;megabyte SmartMedia cards employing their new 256&nbsp;megabit flash chip. Although Toshiba has not
incorporated multilev
el cell flash technology in their 256&nbsp;megabit flash chip, their use of more advanced lithographic design rules may allow them to achieve a more competitive cost structure than that of our 256&nbsp;megabit D2 flash chip.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we expect to face competition from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets that have
similar or alternative data storage solutions which may be less costly or provide additional features. Price is an important competitive factor in the market for consumer products. Increased price competition could lower gross margins if our average
selling prices decrease faster than our costs and could also result in lost sales.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our business depends upon consumer products.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 and the first nine months of 2000, we received more product revenue and shipped more units of products destined for consumer electronics
applications, principally digital cameras, than for any other application. We believe that these products will encounter intense competition and be more price sensitive than products sold into our other target markets. In addition, we must spend more on
marketing and promotion in consumer markets to establish brand name recognition and preference.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant portion of sales to the consumer electronics market is made through distributors and to retailers. Sales through these channels
typically include rights to return unsold inventory. As a result, we do not recognize revenue until after the product has been sold to the end user. If our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market, there could be substantial product
returns, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of our revenues come from a small number of customers. For example in the first nine months of 2000, sales to our top 10 customers
accounted for approximately 49% of our product revenues. In fiscal 1999, sales to our top 10 customers represented 57% of our product revenues, with sales to one customer accounting for more than 10% of product sales. If we were to lose any of these
customers or experience any material reduction in orders from these customers, our revenues and operating results would suffer. Our sales are generally made by </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>25</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>standard purchase orders rather than long-term contracts. In addition, the composition of our major customer base changes from year to year as the market demand for our customers&#146; products change. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our multiple sales channels may compete for a limited number of customer sales.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web based sales of our products today represent a small but growing portion of our overall sales. Sales on the Internet tend to undercut the
traditional distribution channels and may dramatically change the way our consumer products are purchased in future years. We cannot assure you that we will successfully manage the inherent channel conflicts between our retail channel customers and
customers that wish to purchase directly on the Internet.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>There may be seasonality in our business.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of our products, in particular the sale of CompactFlash products, in the consumer electronics applications market may be subject to
seasonality. As a result, product sales may be impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of each year. In addition, in the past we have experienced a decrease in orders in the first quarter from our
Japanese OEM customers primarily because most customers in Japan operate on a fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of their next fiscal year. For example, our product revenues were 24% lower in the first quarter of
1998 than in the fourth quarter of 1997, mostly due to these seasonal factors. Although we did not experience this seasonality in the first quarter of 2000, we cannot assure you that we will not experience seasonality in the future. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>We must achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment. Semiconductor companies that
supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry&#146;s manufacturing process technology. Low yields may
result from design errors or manufacturing failures. Yield problems may not be determined or improved until an actual product is made and can be tested. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production
process. The risks associated with yields are even greater because we rely on independent offshore foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. If the foundries
cannot achieve th
e planned yields, this will result in higher costs and reduced product availability, and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of our definitive agreement with Toshiba, SanDisk and Toshiba formed FlashVision LLC, a joint venture which will equip and operate a
silicon wafer manufacturing line in Virginia (the Dominion facility) to manufacture 512&nbsp;megabit and 1&nbsp;gigabit flash memory chips. However, we cannot assure you that this manufacturing line will produce satisfactory quantities of wafers with
acceptable prices, reliability and yields. Any failure in this regard could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the construction and operation of this line will cause us to incur significant expense
and may result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business. We cannot assure you that we or Toshiba will be able to secure sufficient funding to support this manufacturing line. In addition, we have no experience in operating
a wafer ma
nufacturing line and we intend to rely on the existing manufacturing organization at the Dominion facility. This organization will be trained in NAND flash manufacturing by Toshiba, but we cannot assure you that they will be successful in manufacturing
these advanced NAND flash products on a cost-effective basis or at all. We are committed to purchase 50% of the output from the Dominion facility, and therefore, should the customer demand for NAND flash products be below our available supply, our results
of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, in order for us to sell NAND based CompactFlash, MultiMediaCards and Secure Digital Memory Cards, we will have to develop new controllers, printed circuit boards and test algorithms because the
architecture of NAND flash is significantly different from our current NOR flash designs. Any delays in the development of these elements could prevent us from taking advantage of the available NAND output and could adversely affect our results of
operations.

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have historically agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement. The scope of such indemnity varies, but
may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorney&#146;s fees. We may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations. We are not currently engaged in any such indemnification
proceedings. Our insurance policies exclude coverage for third party claims for patent infringement. Any future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.</font></p>

<ul><p align=left><font size=2><i>Litigation risks associated with our intellectual property</i></font></p></ul>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, it may be necessary to initiate litigation against third parties to preserve our intellectual property rights. These parties could
in turn bring suit against us. In March 1998, we sued Lexar in the Northern District of California alleging that Lexar&#146;s CompactFlash and PC Cards infringe our U.S. Patent No. 5,602,987 (&#147;&#145;987 Patent&#148;). Lexar disputed this claim and
asserted various counter claims, including unfair competition, violation of the Lanham Act, patent misuse, interference with prospective economic advantage, trade defamation, unenforceability and fraud. On November 14, 2000, in resolution of these
actions, Lexar stipulated that SanDisk&#146;s &#145;987 Patent is valid and infringed by Lexar&#146;s current CompactFlash and PC Cards. Lexar will make a lump sum payment of $8.0 million for royalties due on the &#145;987 Patent, through March 31, 2001.
Subject to L
exar&#146;s representations and warranties relating to Lexar&#146;s newly designed CompactFlash and PC Cards, SanDisk has stipulated that these designs do not infringe SanDisk&#146;s &#145;987 Patent. Lexar entered into a 4% royalty-bearing license
agreement for certain Lexar products that may use the &#145;987 Patent beyond March 31, 2001. SanDisk and Lexar have </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>27</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>agreed to dismiss with prejudice all pending claims of patent infringement and counterclaims involving claims of false advertising, unfair competition and patent misuse.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2000, Lexar sued SanDisk in the District of Delaware alleging that our SmartMedia products infringe Lexar&#146;s United States Patent
No. 5,479,638 (&#147;&#145;638 Patent&#148;). In resolution of this action, we will pay Lexar a lump sum payment of $2.0 million for a fully-paid up license for use of the &#145;638 Patent in SmartMedia products.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the settlement, Lexar has provided us with an option for a royalty bearing license to its patents for use in certain future products.</font></p>


<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SanDisk and Lexar have agreed to resolve any future disputes relating to the use by Lexar of the &#145;987 Patent through binding arbitration. We
have also agreed that for a period of seven years, neither SanDisk nor Lexar shall seek injunctive relief against the other in any patent lawsuit. However, at all times, we retain the right to seek injunctive relief to enforce the payment of royalties
pursuant to an arbitrator&#146;s ruling.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;21, 2000, Mitsubishi Denki Co. Ltd. (Mitsubishi Electric) filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court against SanDisk K.K., SanDisk&#146;
s wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan. The complaint alleges that SanDisk K.K., based in Yokohama, Japan, infringes on three Mitsubishi Japanese patents. The Mitsubishi patents in question are #JP2099342, #JP2129071 and # JP2138047. Based on preliminary
information, we believe that these patents are related primarily to the mechanical construction of memory cards built with a separate connector. In the complaint, Mitsubishi asked the court for a preliminary injunction halting the sale of our CompactFlash
and flash ATA memory cards in Japan. SanDisk and SanDisk K.K. will vigorously defend itself against Mitsubishi&#146;s claims. From time to time, we have been contacted by various parties who have alleged that certain of our products infringe on patents
that such
 parties claim to hold. To date no legal actions have been filed in connection with any such infringement, other than as discussed above.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of
infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology, or discontinue the use of certain processes.  Litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require
significant management attention, even if we ultimately prevail. In addition, the results of any litigation matters are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing matters, or any future litigation, will not have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our rapid growth may strain our operations.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently experiencing rapid growth which has placed and continues to place, a significant strain on our personnel and other resources. To
accommodate this growth, we must continue to hire, train, motivate and manage our employees. We are having difficulty hiring the necessary engineering, sales, marketing and finance personnel to support our growth. In addition, we must make a significant
investment in our existing internal information management systems to support increased manufacturing, as well as accounting and other management related functions. Our systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our rapid growth,
which could in turn harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our success depends on key personnel, including our executive officers, the loss of whom could disrupt our business.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development, sales, marketing and
operations personnel, including Dr.&nbsp;Eli Harari, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our success will also depend on our ability to recruit additional highly skilled personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring
or retaining such key personnel, or that any of our key personnel will remain employed with us. </font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2><b>Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, stockholder rights plan and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control and, as a result, negatively impact our stockholders.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt. For example, we have adopted a stockholder rights
plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors. In addition, our certificate of incorporation </font></p>

<CENTER><font size=2>28</font></CENTER><br><HR noshade align=center width=100% size=2>

<p align=left><font size=2>grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of and issue up to 4,000,000&nbsp;shares of preferred stock without stockholder action. Although we have no present intention to issue
shares of preferred stock, such an issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Preferred stock may also have other rights, including economic
rights senior to the common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock. In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This section
provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. This provision could have the effect of
delaying or preventi
ng a change of control of SanDisk.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2><b>Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile.</b></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. For example, in the
twelve month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2000, our stock price has fluctuated from a low of $18.875 to a high of $169.625. We believe that such fluctuations may continue as a result of future announcements concerning us, our competitors or principal
customers regarding technological innovations, new product introductions, governmental regulations, litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile, often for reasons outside the control of the particular companies. These fluctuations as well as general economic, political and market
conditions may have an
 adverse affect on the market price of our common stock.</font></p>

Environmental Study&#148;) are attached hereto as Schedule 3.5. The Company has conducted reasonable research and surveys in preparing the Business Plan and the Environmental Study and consulted with reputable experts in the field as is reasonably
appropriate in these circumstances. The Company believes that the opinions, assumptions and timetables contained in the Business Plan (including both the alternate case assumptions and the base assumptions, as defined therein, and without giving effect to
any risk factors included therein) and in the Environmental Study are reasonable. The financial, business and other projections set out in the Business Plan (including both the alternate case assumptions and the base assumptions, as defined therein, and
without giving effect t

o any risk factors included therein) have been reasonably prepared with due diligence, care and consideration. To the Company&#146;s knowledge, each of the Business Plan and the Environmental Study is complete and correct in all material respects and
does not contain any untrue statement of material fact. To the best of the Company&#146;s knowledge, after conducting reasonable research and surveys as is reasonably appropriate in these circumstances and after consulting with reputable experts in the
field, the financings contemplated in Section 7.6 hereto (the &#147;Additional Financings&#148;) together with the Purchase Price and the proceeds to be paid to the Company upon exercise of the Addtional Purchase Obligations, will be sufficient to
complete the construction, deployment and operation of Fab 2 in accordance with the Business Plan according to the base scenario under which management of the Company currently contemplates implementing the Business Plan. There are no other facts or
matters of which the

Company is aware which could render any such opinions, assumptions, timetables or projections materially misleading; provided, however, that no assurance can be or is given that any of the forecast projections will be attained or that the assumptions
contained therein will not change.</font></p>

against it, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the indemnifying party&#146;s failure to give such notice.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.6.1 is brought against an indemnified party and it gives notice to the
indemnifying party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to
such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such
Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assum

e the defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims  may be effected by the indemnifying party without the
indemnified party&#146;s consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party, and (B) the
sole r

elief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an
indemnifying party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does not, within ten days after the indemnified party&#146;s notice is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party.</font></p>

a Proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive
right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent.</font></p>

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Major Holders&#146; Option</u>. Each Major Holder shall have an option for a period of thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Transfer Notice to elect to purchase its respective pro rata share of the Offered Shares, and in the event that any other Major Holder does not exercise its right hereunder, its pro rata share of such Offered Shares not purchased by the other Major
Holders (the &#147;Excess Offered Shares&#148;), at the same price and subject to the same terms and conditions as described in the Transfer Notice. Each Major Holder may exercise such purchase option and, thereby, purchase all or any portion of its pro
rata share of the Offered Shares, and in the event that any Major Holder does not exercise its right hereunder, its pro rata share of the Excess Offered Shares, by notifying the Selling Shareholder and the Company in writing, before expiration of the
thirty (30)
 day period as to the number of Offered Shares and Excess Offered Shares, if any, which it wishes to purchase (the &#147;Purchase Notice&#148;). Failure to respond to the Transfer Notice: (a) within the applicable period will be considered a waiver of
the right to exercise the right set forth in this Section 4.2; and (b) within forty-five days after receipt of the Transfer Notice will be considered a waiver of the right of co-sale set forth in Section 5.1, provided that the Transfer Notice clearly
references such right of co-sale. Each Major Holder&#146;s pro rata share of the Offered Shares, or of the Excess Offered Shares, as the case may be, shall be a fraction of the Offered Shares, or of the Excess Offered Shares, as the case may be, of which
the number of Shares owned by such Major Holder on the date of the Transfer Notice shall be the numerator and the total number of Shares held by all such Major Holders (excluding the Selling Shareholder) on the date of the Transfer Notice shall be the
denominator.

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Major Holder(s) give the Selling Shareholder(s) Purchase Notice(s) pursuant to Section 4.2 above with respect to all and not
part of the Offered Shares, then the Selling  Shareholder shall not effect the Disposition to the third party transferee rather to the Major Holder(s) exercising their right of first refusal and then payment for the Offered Shares shall be by check or
wire transfer to a bank account to be designated by the Selling Shareholder, against delivery of the Offered Shares to be purchased at a place agreed upon between the parties and at the time of the scheduled closing therefor, which shall be no later than
forty five (45) days after the Selling Shareholders&#146; receipt of the Purchase Notice, unless the Transfer Notice contemplated a later closing with the prospective third party transferee(s) in which case the closing of the purchase by the Major Holding
may b
e held until such later date.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Major Holder shall be entitled to apportion Offered Shares to be purchased among its Permitted Transferees, provided that
such Purchaser notifies the Selling Shareholder of such allocation.</font></p>

to Section&nbsp;4 above, then S and I, each,  (a &#147;Co-Sale Holder&#148; for purposes of this Section&nbsp;5) shall be entitled to notify the Selling Shareholder in writing in the Purchase Notice referred to in Section&nbsp;4.2 and subject to the terms
thereof and shall have the right to participate in the Disposition on the same terms and conditions as specified in the Transfer Notice. Such selling Co-Sale Holder&#146;s notice to the Selling Shareholder shall indicate the number of shares of Equity
Securities the Co-Sale Holder wishes to sell under its right to participate.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Co-Sale Holder may sell all or any part of that number of Offered Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i)&nbsp;the aggregate number of Offered Shares by (ii)&nbsp;a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares owned by the Co-Sale Holder on the date of the Transfer Notice and the denominator of which is the total number of Shares owned by all
of the Co-Sale Holders and the  Selling Shareholder on the date of the Transfer Notice (the &#147;Co-Sale Shares&#148;). </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Co-Sale Holder shall effect its participation in the sale by promptly delivering to the Selling Shareholder for Transfer
to the prospective purchaser one or more transfer deeds, properly executed for Transfer, which represent the number of Offered Shares which such Co-Sale Holder elects to sell. The transfer deeds that the Co-Sale Holder delivers to the Selling Shareholder
as provided above shall be transferred to the prospective purchaser in consummation of the sale of the Offered Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Transfer Notice, and the Selling Shareholder shall concurrently therewith remit to
such Co-Sale Holder that portion of the net sale proceeds to which such Selling Holder is entitled by reason of its participation in such sale. To the extent that any prospective purchaser or purchasers prohibits such assignment or otherwise refuses to

<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Non-Exercise of Rights</u>. To the extent that the Major Holders have not exercised in full their rights to purchase all the
Offered Shares within the time periods specified in Section&nbsp;4.2, the Selling Shareholder shall have a period of ninety (90) days from the expiration of the 45 day period set forth in Section 4.2 (the &#147;Ninety Day Period&#148;) to sell the Offered
Shares and the Co-Sale Shares, if any, upon terms and conditions (including the purchase price) no more favorable than those specified in the Transfer Notice to the third-party transferee(s) identified in the Transfer Notice. The third-party transferee(s)

Ninety Day Period or the Second Ninety Day Period, as the case may be, the Major Holders&#146; first refusal rights and the Co-Sale Holders&#146; co-sale rights shall continue to be applicable to any subsequent disposition of the Offered Shares by such
Sellin

effected after the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Selling Shareholder shall be permitted to effect the Public Sale subject to and in accordance with Rule 144 (including, without limitation, the volume limitations included therein), and such
Public Sale shall not be subject to the rights of first refusal and co-sale set forth in Sections 4 and 5.</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Limitations to Rights of Refusal and Co-Sale</u>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections&nbsp;3, 4 and 5 of this
