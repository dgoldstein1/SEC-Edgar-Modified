              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


1.     These interim condensed  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited
       but  reflect,  in  the  opinion  of  management,   all  normal  recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 1999, the
       results of operations  for the three and six month periods ended June 30,
       1999 and 1998 and cash  flows for the six month  periods  ended  June 30,
       1999 and 1998. Because all the disclosures required by generally accepted
       accounting   principles  are  not  included,   these  interim   condensed
       consolidated  financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
       audited  financial  statements and notes thereto in the Company's  annual
       report on Form 10-K/A as of, and for the year ended  December  31,  1998.
       The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 1998 was
       derived from the audited financial statements.

       The results of operations  for the three and six month periods ended June
       30, 1999 and cash flows for the six month periods ended June 30, 1999 are
       not  necessarily  indicative of results of operations  and cash flows for
       any future period.

2.     The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31, and
       each fiscal  quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, and
       September  30. The second  fiscal  quarter of 1999 and 1998 ended on June
       27, 1999 and June 28, 1998,  respectively.  Fiscal year 1998 was 52 weeks
       long and ended on December  27,  1998.  Fiscal year 1999 is 53 weeks long
       and ends on January 2, 2000. For ease of  presentation,  the accompanying
       financial  statements  have  been  shown as ending on the last day of the
       calendar month.

3.     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4. The components of inventory consist of the following:

       For the three and six month  periods  ending  June 30,  1999,  options to
       purchase  100,465 and 55,609  shares of common stock,  respectively  have
       been excluded from the earnings per share calculation, as their effect is
       antidilutive.  For the three and six month  period  ended June 30,  1998,
       options  to  purchase   885,839  and  254,634  shares  of  common  stock,
       respectively, have been excluded from the earnings per share calculation,
       as their effect is antidilutive.

6.     To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be  necessary  to  initiate  litigation  with one or more third  parties,
       including  but not limited to those the Company has  notified of possible
       patent  infringement.  In  addition,  one or more of  these  parties,  or
       others, may bring suit against the Company.

       In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal  court  against
       Lexar Media, Inc.  ("Lexar") for infringement of a fundamental  flashdisk
       patent.  Lexar has disputed the Company's  claim of patent  infringement,
       claimed SanDisk's patent is invalid or unenforceable and asserted various
       counterclaims including unfair competition,  violation of the Lanham Act,
       patent misuse,  interference with prospective  economic advantage,  trade
       defamation and fraud. SanDisk has denied each of Lexar's counterclaims.

        In July 1998, the federal  district court denied Lexar's request to have
       the case  dismissed  on the  grounds  the  Company  failed to  perform an
       adequate prefiling  investigation.  Discovery in the Lexar suit commenced
       in August  1998.  On  February  22,  1999,  the  Federal  District  Court
       considered  arguments and papers  submitted by the parties  regarding the
       scope and  proper  interpretation  of the  asserted  claims in  SanDisk's
       patent at issue in the Lexar suit. On March 4, 1999, the Federal District
       Court issued its ruling on the proper  construction of the claim terms in
       SanDisk's  patent.  On July 30,  1999,  the  Company  filed a motion  for
       partial   summary   judgment  that  Lexar   CompactFlash   and  PC  Cards
       contributorily infringe SanDisk's patent. This motion is scheduled to

                                     Page 7
<PAGE>


       be heard in September 1999. In August 1999, we had a mandatory settlement
       meeting with Lexar.  No settlement  was reached  through this meeting.  A
       trial  date has not yet been  set.  The  Company  intends  to  vigorously
       enforce its  patents,  but there can be no assurance  that these  efforts
       will be successful.

       In May 1999,  Lexar filed a  complaint  against the Company for claims of
       unfair  competition,  false advertising,  trade libel and intentional and
       negligent  interference with prospective  business advantage.  On July 1,
       1999, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Lexar complaint. Also, in
       July 1999,  Lexar filed a motion for  preliminary  injunction  seeking to
       stop certain  advertising  practices that Lexar alleges were  misleading.
       The Company  intends to vigorously  oppose this motion.  Both motions are
       scheduled to be heard in September 1999.  There can be no assurances that
       these motions will be decided in favor of the Company.

       From  time to  time  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  certain  of its
       suppliers  and customers for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances  include  indemnification
       for damages and expenses, including attorneys' fees. The Company may from
       time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of such indemnification
       obligations. Third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from
       coverage  under  the  Company's  insurance  policies.  There  can  be  no
       assurance that any future obligation to indemnify the Company's customers
       or suppliers,  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
       business, financial condition and results of operations.

       Any  litigation,  whether as a plaintiff or as a  defendant,  will likely
       result in  significant  expense to the  Company and divert the efforts of
       the Company's  technical and  management  personnel,  whether or not such
       litigation is ultimately determined in favor of the Company. In the event
       of an  adverse  result  in any  such  litigation,  the  Company  could be
       required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture,  use and sale
       of  infringing   products,   expend  significant   resources  to  develop
       non-infringing   technology   or  obtain   licenses  to  the   infringing
       technology,  or discontinue  the use of certain  processes.  Accordingly,
       there  can be no  assurance  that any of the  foregoing  matters,  or any
       future  litigation,  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
       Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

7.     The Company had a credit  agreement (the  Agreement)  with a bank,  which
       expired in July 1999. At June 30, 1999, there were no amounts outstanding
       under the line of credit. The Agreement contained covenants that required
       the Company to maintain certain  financial ratios and levels of net worth
       and prohibited the payment of cash dividends to stockholders. The Company
       was in compliance with these covenants at June 30, 1999.

8.     Certain of the Company's balance sheet accounts and purchase  commitments
       are denominated in Japanese Yen. The Company enters into foreign exchange
       contracts to hedge against  changes in foreign  currency  exchange rates.
       The effects of movements in currency  exchange rates on these instruments
       are  recognized  when the related  operating  revenues  and  expenses are
       recognized. The impact of movements in currency exchange rates on foreign
       exchange  contracts  substantially  mitigates  the related  impact on the
       underlying  items  hedged.  At June 30, 1999,  forward  contracts  with a
       notional amount of $11.9 million were outstanding.

9.     Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  presented in the  accompanying
       balance sheet consists of the accumulated  unrealized  gains and loses on
       available-for-sale marketable securities, net of the related tax effects,
       for all periods presented.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

    Certain  statements  in this  discussion  and analysis  are forward  looking
statements  based  on  current  expectations,   and  entail  various  risks  and
uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from those
expressed in such forward looking  statements.  Such risks and uncertainties are
discussed below and in the Company's Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31,
1998 under the heading  "Factors  That May Affect Future  Results."  Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which
speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to update
these forward looking  statements to reflect events or  circumstances  occurring
after the date hereof.  The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction
with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

    The Company was  founded in 1988 to develop  and market  flash data  storage
systems.  The  Company  sells  its  products  to the  consumer  electronics  and
industrial/communications  markets. During 1998, the percentage of the Company's
product sales  attributable  to the consumer  electronics  market,  particularly
sales  of  CompactFlash  for  use  in  digital  camera  applications,  increased
substantially. This increase in sales to the consumer market resulted in a shift
to lower capacity  products,  which  typically have lower average selling prices
and gross margins than higher capacity products. In addition, these products are
frequently  sold into the retail  channel,  which  usually has shorter  customer
order lead-times than the other channels used by the Company, thereby decreasing
the Company's  ability to  accurately  forecast  future  production  needs.  The
Company believes its CompactFlash products will continue to represent a majority
of the Company's  sales as the  popularity of consumer  applications,  including
digital  cameras,  increases.  The  percentage of sales  attributable  to orders
received  and  fulfilled  in the same  quarter  continues to be more than 50% of
quarterly  product revenues,  in response,  the Company is continuing to work to
shorten its manufacturing cycle times.

    The  Company's  operating  results  are  affected  by a  number  of  factors
including  the  volume of  product  sales,  the  timing of  significant  orders,
competitive  pricing pressures,  the ability of the Company to match supply with
demand,  changes  in product  and  customer  mix,  market  acceptance  of new or
enhanced  versions of the Company's  products,  changes in the channels  through
which  the   Company's   products  are   distributed,   timing  of  new  product
announcements and  introductions by the Company and its competitors,  the timing
of license and royalty revenues,  fluctuations in product costs, availability of
foundry  capacity,  variations in  manufacturing  cycle times,  fluctuations  in
manufacturing  yields and  manufacturing  utilization,  increased  research  and
development  expenses,  and exchange  rate  fluctuations.  In  addition,  as the
proportion  of the  Company's  products  sold  for use in  consumer  electronics
applications continues to increase, the Company's revenues may become subject to
seasonal  declines  in the first  quarter of each year.  See  "Factors  That May
Affect Future Results - Our Operating Results May Fluctuate  Significantly"  and
"There is Seasonality in Our Business."

    Beginning  in late 1995,  the Company  adopted a strategy of  licensing  its
flash  technology,  including  its patent  portfolio,  to  selected  third party
manufacturers  of flash  products.  To date, the Company has entered into patent
cross-license  agreements  with a number of companies,  and it intends to pursue
opportunities to enter into additional  licenses.  The Company's current license
agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties,  or a combination
thereof,  to the  Company.  The  timing and  amount of these  payments  can vary
substantially from quarter to quarter,  depending on the terms of each agreement
and, in some cases,  the timing of sales of products by the other parties.  As a
result,  license and royalty revenues have fluctuated  significantly in the past
and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high
gross margins  associated with license and royalty  revenues,  gross margins and
net income are likely to  fluctuate  more with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues than with changes in product revenues.

    SanDisk  markets  its  products  using a  combination  of its  direct  sales
organization,   distributors,   manufacturers'  representatives,  private  label
partners, OEMs and retailers.  The Company expects that sales through the retail
channel will continue to comprise an increasing  share of total  revenues in the
future, and

                                    Page 10
<PAGE>


that a substantial  portion of its sales into the retail channel will be made to
participants  that will have the right to return  unsold  products.  The Company
does not recognize  revenues from these sales until the products are sold to the
end customers.

    Historically,  a  majority  of the  Company's  sales  have been to a limited
number of customers. The Company expects that sales of its products to a limited
number of customers  will continue to account for a  substantial  portion of its
product  revenues for the foreseeable  future.  The Company has also experienced
significant  changes in the  composition  of its customer base from year to year
and  expects  this  pattern to  continue  as market  demand for such  customers'
products fluctuates. The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by major
customers,  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations.  See "Factors  That May Affect
Future  Results - Sales to a Small Number of Customers  Represent a  Significant
Portion of Our Revenues."

    Due to the  emerging  nature of the  Company's  target  markets  and certain
planned product transitions,  the Company has had difficulty  forecasting future
inventory  levels  required  to  meet  customer  demand.  As a  result  of  both
contractual  obligations  and  manufacturing  cycle times,  the Company has been
required to order  wafers from its  foundries  several  months in advance of the
ultimate shipment of its products.  Under the Company's wafer supply agreements,
there are limits on the number of wafers the Company can order and the Company's
ability to change  that  quantity  is  restricted.  Accordingly,  the  Company's
ability  to react to  significant  fluctuations  in demand for its  products  is
limited.  As a result,  the Company has not been able to match its  purchases of
wafers to specific  customer  orders and  therefore the Company has from time to
time taken write downs for potential  excess  inventory  purchased  prior to the
receipt of customer  orders.  For example,  in the second  quarter of 1998,  the
Company's product gross margins declined to 12% from 30% in the previous quarter
due in part  to a write  down of this  inventory  to  reflect  inventory  at net
realizable  value.  These  adjustments  decrease  gross  margins in the  quarter
reported and have resulted,  and could in the future result,  in fluctuations in
gross margins on a quarter to quarter basis. See "Factors That May Affect Future
Results - Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly."

    Export  sales are an  important  part of the  Company's  business.  In 1998,
product  sales to Japan  declined  19% from the prior  year,  due in part to the
Asian economic crisis.  While a majority of the Company's revenues from sales to
Japan and other Asian  countries  are  derived  from OEM  customers  who plan to
export a portion of their  products  to  countries  outside  of Asia,  the Asian
economic crisis may continue to adversely  effect the Company's  revenues to the
extent that demand for the Company's products in Asia declines. Given the recent
economic  conditions in Asia and the weakness of many Asian currencies  relative
to the United  States  dollar,  the Company's  products may be  relatively  more
expensive in Asia,  which could result in a decrease in the  Company's  sales in
that region. The Company may also experience  pressure on its gross margins as a
result of increased price competition from Asian competitors.  While most of the
Company's sales are denominated in U.S.  Dollars,  the Company  invoices certain
Japanese  customers in Japanese Yen.  Exchange rate  fluctuations  can therefore
affect the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
See "Factors  That May Affect  Future  Results - We Face Risks  Associated  with
International Operations."

    For the  foreseeable  future,  the Company  expects to realize a significant
portion of its revenues from recently introduced and new products. Typically new
products  initially have lower gross margins than more mature  products  because
the manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive
product generation. In addition, manufacturing yields are generally lower at the
start of manufacturing any new product.  To remain  competitive,  the Company is
focusing  on a number of programs to lower its  manufacturing  costs,  including
development  of future  generations  of double density ("D2") flash and advanced
technology  wafers.  There can be no assurance  that such  products or processes
will be  successfully  developed  by the  Company  or that  development  of such
processes will lower manufacturing  costs. In addition,  the Company anticipates
that price  competition  will  continue  in the future,  which  could  result in
decreased average selling prices and lower gross margins.  See "Factors That May
Affect Future Results -We Must Achieve Acceptable Wafer Manufacturing Yields."

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

    The Company is aware of problems  associated  with  computer  systems as the
Year 2000  approaches.  Year 2000  problems  are the  result of common  computer
programming techniques that result in systems that do not function properly when
manipulating  dates later than December 31, 1999.  The issue is complex and wide
ranging.  The problem may affect transaction  processing  computer  applications
used by the Company for accounting,  distribution,  manufacturing,  planning and
communications.  The problem may also affect  embedded  systems such as building
security systems,  machine controllers and production test equipment.  Year 2000
problems with these systems may affect the ability or efficiency  with which the
Company can perform many  significant  functions,  including  but not limited to
order processing and fulfillment,  material planning,  product assembly, product
test,  invoicing  and  financial  reporting.  While there can be no guarantee of
unaffected  operation,   the  completed  implementation  of  the  Company's  new
Management  Information  System,  and the  completed  assessment of its embedded
systems  indicates  limited  exposure in these areas.  The Year 2000 problem may
also affect the  computer  systems of the  Company's  suppliers  and  customers,
potentially  disrupting their operations.  Year 2000 problems with the Company's
business partners may impact the Company's sources of supply and demand.

    YEAR 2000 READINESS.  The Company has a Year 2000 Risk Management program to
assess  the  impact of the Year 2000  issue on the  Company,  and to  coordinate
remediation activities. The Company completed the evaluation of its products for
Year 2000  compliance  in the third quarter of 1998.  The  Company's  FlashDisk,
FlashDrive, Flash ChipSet, CompactFlash,  MultiMediaCard,  and ImageMate product
lines do not perform date related  processing and do not contain real time clock
circuitry  and,  therefore,  are Year 2000  ready.  The  Company's  storage  and
connectivity  products are used as components in a variety of host systems.  The
firmware,  operating  system and application  software of these host systems are
designed and  manufactured by others.  The Company makes no claim with regard to
the Year  2000  readiness  of host  systems  designed  by  others  in which  the
Company's products are used.  Independent system designers make derivative works
from the SanDisk  Host  Developer's  Toolkit  ("Toolkit")  source code  product.
Sample date related  subroutines and data structures are included in the Toolkit
for use by system  designers.  Designers  modify the sample routines in order to
fit the specific  requirements of their host operating  system.  The designer is
responsible  for the formatting and processing  logic  associated  with the date
values that pass through the Toolkit  subsystem and for the Year 2000  readiness
of the  systems in which the Toolkit is used.  The Company  makes no claims with
regard  to the Year  2000  readiness  of host  firmware  and  operating  systems
designed by others that contain derivative works of the Toolkit.

    The Year 2000 remediation of the Company's  transaction  processing  systems
was completed with the  installation and testing of the Company's new management
information  system  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1998.  The  new  system  is a
commercially available,  fully integrated MRP II (Materials Requirement Planning
and Accounting system) software application. This system is used for accounting,
order  processing,   planning,   inventory  control,   shop  floor  control  and
distribution.

    In the second  quarter of 1999,  the  Company  completed  all of the primary
elements  of its Year  2000  assessment  and  remediation  program  for  mission
critical hardware and software. Tests of software applications,  which have been
identified by their vendors as Year 2000  Compliant,  and several minor software
upgrades  will be completed in the third  quarter of 1999.  Well over 90% of the
Company's  investment in desktop PC hardware is known to be Year 2000 compliant,
and proven  remediation  solutions have been  implemented for the remaining 10%.
The  majority of the  software  used on these  systems  and network  servers are
recent versions of vendor supported,  commercially available products. Upgrading
these applications as Year 2000 compliant patches are released by the respective
vendors has not been a  significant  burden on the Company and is expected to be
completed before the end of 1999.

    The Company's  assessment and  remediation of Year 2000 problems in computer
systems used for facilities control,  machine control and manufacturing  testing
is complete. The most significant Year 2000 issue in this area has been found to
be related to older wafer test  equipment.  This equipment is not expected to be
in use in the year 2000. The Company is phasing in new Year 2000 compliant wafer
test equipment in conjunction  with the introduction of new generations of flash
memory.

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>



    The Company's  assessment of Year 2000 risks related to material  suppliers,
customers and other third parties is substantially complete. Inquiries were made
of all critical suppliers and an assessment of their Year 2000 readiness was the
basis for strategic  decisions  regarding  alternate  material  sourcing  and/or
increasing  inventory  safety  stocks.  The  survey  of  the  Company's  service
suppliers is on-going,  as many of these  suppliers have third or fourth quarter
1999  target  compliance  dates for their  Year 2000  programs.  SanDisk is also
contacting  its  significant  customers  regarding  their Year 2000 readiness in
order  to  understand  the  potential  for any  disruptions  in  their  ordering
patterns.  Completion of these reviews will depend on the  responsiveness of the
Company's vendors and customers, over which the Company has no control.

    YEAR 2000 RISK MANAGEMENT  PROGRAM COSTS.  The cost of the Year 2000 project
related to  upgrading  the  Company's  core  management  information  system was
approximately  $1.0  million,  $400,000 of which was related to the  purchase of
software and hardware which was capitalized by the Company. In the first half of
1999, the Company spent approximately $175,000 for application software upgrades
and computer  hardware.  The Company  estimates that costs to upgrade or replace
any remaining software applications and non-compliant computer hardware will not
be material to the Company's operating results.  The Company would have incurred
the  majority of these costs,  in spite of Year 2000 issues,  due to the need to
upgrade its management  information  system,  application  software and personal
computers to support the Company's  growth.  The Company's Year 2000 remediation
projects  were  funded from  operating  cash flows.  No material  projects  were
deferred in order to complete the Company's Year 2000 assessment and remediation
project.  The  additional  expenses  related to the  management of the Year 2000
compliance  program and  completing  the  remaining  assessment of the Company's
internal  and external  risks are not  expected to be material to the  Company's
quarterly operating results.

    The costs and time schedule for the Year 2000 problem abatement are based on
management's best estimates for the remediation of Year 2000 problems  uncovered
to date. These estimates were derived utilizing numerous assumptions,  including
that the most  significant  Year 2000 risks have already been  identified,  that
certain resources will continue to be available,  that third party plans will be
fulfilled  and other  factors.  However,  there can be no  guarantee  that these
estimates will be achieved or that the anticipated time schedule will be met and
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.

    CONTINGENCY  PLANS.   Specific  contingency  plans  for  systems  that  pose
significant  risk to on-going  operations are being developed under the auspices
of the Company's Year 2000 Risk Management program. Should previously undetected
Year 2000  problems  be found in other  systems,  these  systems  will either be
upgraded,  replaced,  turned off, or operated in place with manual procedures to
compensate  for  their  deficiencies.  While the  Company  believes  that  these
alternative  plans  would  be  adequate  to meet  the  Company's  needs  without
materially  impacting  its  operations,  there  can be no  assurance  that  such
alternatives  would be successful  or that the  Company's  results of operations
would not be  materially  adversely  affected  by the delays and  inefficiencies
inherent in conducting operations in this manner.

    RISKS RELATED TO YEAR 2000  READINESS.  Success of the  Company's  Year 2000
compliance  effort  depends,  in part,  on the success of its key  suppliers and
customers in dealing with their Year 2000 issues.  The Company does not have any
control over the  remediation  efforts of its key  suppliers  and  customers and
cannot fully  determine the extent to which they have  resolved  their Year 2000
compliance issues. The Company currently  purchases several critical  components
from single or sole source vendors. While this issue is being carefully managed,
disruptions in the supply of components from any of these sole source  suppliers
due to Year 2000 issues,  could cause  delays in the  Company's  fulfillment  of
customer orders which could result in reduced or lost revenues. Furthermore, the
Company's  sales have  historically  been to a limited number of customers.  Any
disruption in the purchasing  patterns of these customers or potential customers
due to Year 2000 issues could cause a decline in the Company's  revenues.  There
can be no assurance  that the Company and its key suppliers  and customers  will
identify and  remediate  all  significant  Year 2000 problems on a timely basis.
Furthermore,  there can be no assurance that the Company's  insurance will cover
losses  from  business  interruptions  arising  from Year 2000  problems  of the
Company or

                                    Page 13
<PAGE>


its suppliers.  Year 2000 compliance problems of the Company's key suppliers and
customers could adversely affect the Company's,  business,  financial  condition
and results of operations.

    The foregoing  statements  regarding the Company's  Year 2000  readiness are
based upon  management's  best estimates at the present time, which were derived
utilizing   assumptions   regarding  future  events,   including  the  continued
availability  of certain  resources,  third party  modification  plans and other
factors.  There can be no guarantee  that these  estimates  will be achieved and
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.  Specific factors
that might cause such material  differences include, but are not limited to, the
availability  and cost of personnel  trained in this area, the ability to locate
and correct all relevant  computer  codes,  the nature and amount of programming
required  to upgrade  or replace  each of the  affected  programs,  the rate and
magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the Company's
external  customers  and  suppliers  in  addressing  the Year  2000  issue.  The
Company's  evaluation  is  on-going  and  it  expects  that  new  and  different
information   will  become   available  to  it  as  the  evaluation   continues.
Consequently, there is no guarantee that all material elements will be Year 2000
ready in time.


Results of Operations


    PRODUCT  REVENUES.  SanDisk's  product  revenues  were $42.3  million in the
second quarter of 1999, up $18.8 million or 80% from the second quarter of 1998.
Product  revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1999 were $78.2 million,  up
$29.3  million  or 60% from the same  period in 1998.  During  the three and six
month  periods  ended June 30,  1999,  units  shipped  increased  168% and 156%,
respectively from the same periods in 1998. The largest increase in both periods
came  from  sales  of  CompactFlash  which  represented  56% and 58% of  product
revenues, respectively, for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 1999.
Average  selling  prices  declined 32% in the second quarter of 1999 and 38% for
the first six months of 1999 compared to the same periods of the prior year. The
mix of products  sold varies from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future,
affecting the Company's overall average selling prices and gross margins.

    The Company continues to experience limited bookings visibility as customers
continue  to  expect  short  lead-times,  particularly  in  the  growing  retail
component of the Company's  business.  A majority of the  Company's  anticipated
third quarter  revenues are expected to be turns  business with orders  received
and fulfilled in the same quarter.  Due to a number of factors  described herein
and in "Factors That May Affect Future Results," the Company's ability to adjust
its  operating  expenses is limited in the short term.  As a result,  if product
revenues are lower than anticipated, the Company's results of operations will be
adversely affected.

    Export sales represented 43% and 42%,  respectively,  of product revenue for
the three and six month periods ended June 30, 1999 compared to 46% for the same
periods  of the  previous  year.  The  Company  expects  international  sales to
continue to  represent a  significant  portion of its product  revenues.  In the
second   quarter  of  1999,   the  Company's   top  ten  customers   represented
approximately  57% of product revenue with the top two customers  representing a
combined  27% of product  revenues.  Sales to the top 10  customers  represented
approximately 64% of product revenues in the second quarter of 1998. The Company
expects that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to represent a
substantial portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future.

    LICENSE AND ROYALTY  REVENUES.  The Company  currently  earns patent license
fees and royalties under several cross-license  agreements.  License and royalty
revenues from patent  cross-license  agreements were $10.2 million in the second
quarter of 1999,  up from $7.9 million in the same period of the  previous  year
due primarily to the timing of royalties earned under the various agreements. In
the first six months of 1999,  revenue  from patent  license and  royalties  was
$18.5  million,  up from  $16.6  million in the same  period of the prior  year.
Revenues from licenses and royalties  decreased to 20% of total  revenues in the
second quarter of 1999 from 25% in the second quarter of 1998.


                                    Page 14
<PAGE>


    GROSS  PROFITS.  In the second  quarter of 1999,  gross  profits  were $21.7
million,  or 41% of total revenues  compared to $10.8  million,  or 34% of total
revenues in the same period of 1998.  Product gross margins  increased to 27% of
product revenues in the second quarter of 1999 from 12% in the second quarter of
1998. In the second  quarter of 1998,  product gross margins were  unusually low
due to a steep decline in average  selling  prices and a lower of cost or market
inventory  write  down.  Gross  profits  for the first  half of 1999 were  $39.3
million  compared to $27.1  million for the same  period of the  previous  year.
Gross margin was 41% of total  revenues for the six month periods ended June 30,
1999 and 1998.

    Competition  remains strong and product gross margins are expected to remain
under pressure due to declining average selling prices. The Company is currently
working on a number of cost  reduction  programs  to  strengthen  product  gross
margins in 1999,  including the transition of manufacturing  operations for high
volume products offshore which began in the second quarter.  However,  there can
be no assurance  that the Company will be  successful  in these  efforts.  Also,
increased  competition may negatively affect gross margins in the second half of
1999.

    During the second quarter of 1999,  the Company began shipping  CompactFlash
and FlashDisk  products  utilizing its new 128Mbit flash chip. The 128Mbit flash
chip has a lower  manufacturing  cost per megabyte and is expected to contribute
to  improved  product  gross  margins in the second  half of 1999.  The  initial
production  period of each new generation of flash technology is subject to many
risks and  uncertainties as described in "Factors That May Affect Future Results
- - We Face Risk in  Transitioning to New Processes and Products." There can be no
assurance   that  the  Company   will   successfully   complete   the   customer
qualifications  of the 128Mbit flash chips in a timely  manner,  or that it will
realize the expected cost reductions in the second half of 1999.

    In  addition,  in the second  quarter of 1999,  the  Company  moved the high
volume production of its CompactFlash  cards to Celestica in South China and the
production of its MultiMediaCard  products to Siliconware  Precision  Industries
Co.  Ltd.  and  Siliconware  Corporation  in Taiwan.  These  subcontractors  now
assemble and test a majority of the Company's  CompactFlash  and  MultiMediaCard
products.  There are many risk and  uncertainties  involved with the transfer of
production  to these  subcontractors  as discussed  in "Factors  That May Affect
Future Results - We Face Risks Associated with Our International  Operations and
- -- We Depend on Our Suppliers and Third Party Subcontractors."

    RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT.   Research  and  development   expenses  consist
principally of salaries and payroll related  expenses for design and development
engineers,  prototype supplies and contract  services.  Research and development
expenses were $6.0 million in the second quarter of 1999, up $1.5 million or 34%
from  $4.5  million  in the same  period  of 1998.  In the  first  half of 1999,
research and development  expenses increased to $11.2 million up $2.4 million or
27% from $8.8 million in the same period of 1998.  The increases  were primarily
due to increased salary and related expenses and higher nonrecurring engineering
and project related expenses.  Research and development expenses represented 11%
of total  revenues in the second  quarter of 1999  compared to 14% in the second
quarter of 1998.  The  Company  expects  research  and  development  expenses to
continue  to  increase  in  absolute  dollars to  support  the  development  and
introduction of new generations of flash data storage products.

    SALES AND MARKETING.  Sales and marketing  expenses include salaries,  sales
commissions,  benefits and travel expenses for the Company's  sales,  marketing,
customer service and  applications  engineering  personnel.  These expenses also
include other selling and marketing expenses, such as independent manufacturer's
representative  commissions,  advertising  and  tradeshow  expenses.  Sales  and
marketing  expenses  were $5.8  million  in the  second  quarter of 1999 up $1.5
million or 35% from $4.2  million in the  second  quarter of 1998.  In the first
half of 1999, sales and marketing  expenses were $10.9 million,  up $2.7 million
or 33%  from the same  period  of 1998.  The  increases  were  primarily  due to
increased  salary and related  expenses  and higher  commission  expenses due to
increased   product   revenues.   Sales  and  marketing   expenses   represented
approximately  11% of total  revenues in the second  quarter of 1999 compared to
14% in the second  quarter of 1998.  The  Company  expects  sales and  marketing
expenses  to  increase  as sales of its  products  grow and as it  continues  to
develop the retail channel for its products.


                                    Page 15
<PAGE>


    GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative expenses include the
cost of the Company's finance, information systems, human resources, shareholder
relations,  legal  and  administrative  functions.  General  and  administrative
expenses were $2.9 million in the second quarter of 1999, up $1.2 million or 69%
from $1.7  million  in the second  quarter  of 1998.  In the first half of 1999,
general and  administrative  expenses were $5.3 million,  up $1.5 million or 41%
from the same period in 1998.  The  increases  were  primarily  due to increased
salary and related expenses,  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts
and higher consulting expenses.  General and administrative expenses represented
6% of total revenues in the second quarter of 1999 compared to 5% for the second
quarter of 1998.  The Company  expects  general and  administrative  expenses to
increase as the general and administrative functions grow to support the overall
growth of the Company.  General and administrative  expenses could also increase
substantially  in the future if the Company  continues to pursue  litigation  to
defend its patent portfolio. See "Factors That May Affect Future Results - Risks
Associated with Patents, Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation."

    INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME,  NET.  Interest and other  income,  net, was $1.5
million in the second  quarter of 1999  compared  to $1.3  million in the second
quarter of 1998.  In 1998,  other income was lower due to the  recognition  of a
loss on fixed asset disposal and foreign exchange losses.

    PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Company  recorded a provision  for income
taxes at a 33% effective tax rate for the first six months of 1999 compared to a
36% effective tax rate for the same period of 1998. The lower effective tax rate
in 1999 reflects greater benefits from federal and state tax credits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    As of June 30,  1999,  the Company had  working  capital of $145.5  million,
which included $12.8 million in cash and cash  equivalents and $132.2 million in
short-term  investments.  Operating activities provided $17.1 million of cash in
the first six  months of 1999  primarily  from net  income  and an  increase  in
current  liabilities of $17.7 million,  which were partially offset by increases
in accounts receivable of $8.8 million and inventory of $8.4 million.

    Net cash used in  investing  activities  of $22.5  million  in the first six
months of 1999  consisted of net purchases of  investments  of $13.9 million and
capital equipment  purchases and leasehold  improvements of $8.6 million. In the
first six months of 1999, cash provided by financing  activities of $2.8 million
came primarily from the sale of common stock through the Company's  stock option
and employee stock purchase plans.

    Depending on the future demand for the Company's  products,  the Company may
decide to make additional investments,  which could be substantial,  in assembly
and test manufacturing  equipment or foundry capacity to support its business in
the future.

Impact of Currency Exchange Rates

    A portion of the  Company's  revenues are  denominated  in Japanese Yen. The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward  contracts to hedge against changes
in foreign currency  exchange rates. At June 30, 1999,  forward contracts with a
notional  amount  of  $11.9  million  were  outstanding.  Future  exchange  rate
fluctuations  could have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Factors That May Affect Future Results
- --------------------------------------

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
STOCK PRICE.

         Our   quarterly   and  annual   operating   results   have   fluctuated
significantly  in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in
the future. This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors,  including the
following:

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>


     o    unpredictable demand for our products;

     o    decline  in  the  average  selling  prices  of  our  products  due  to
          competitive pricing pressures;

     o    seasonality in sales of our products;

     o    adverse changes in product and customer mix;

     o    slower than anticipated  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions
          of our products;

     o    competing  flash memory card  standards  which  displace the standards
          used in our products;

     o    changes in our distribution channels;

     o    timing of license and royalty revenue recognition;

     o    fluctuations  in product costs,  particularly  due to  fluctuations in
          manufacturing yields and utilization;

     o    availability  of sufficient  silicon  wafer  foundry  capacity to meet
          customer demand;

     o    significant  yield  losses  which could  affect our ability to fulfill
          customer orders and could increase our costs;

     o    lengthening  in  manufacturing   cycle  times  due  to  our  suppliers
          operating at peak capacity;

     o    increased research and development expenses;

     o    exchange rate  fluctuations,  particularly the U.S. dollar to Japanese
          yen exchange rate;

     o    changes in general  economic  conditions,  in particular  the economic
          recession in Japan;

     o    difficulty of forecasting and management of inventory levels; and

     o    expenses related to obsolescence of unsold inventory.

         DIFFICULTY OF ESTIMATING SILICON WAFER NEEDS

         When we order silicon  wafers from our  foundries,  we have to estimate
the number of silicon  wafers needed to fill product  orders several months into
the future.  If we overestimate  this number,  we will build excess  inventories
which would harm our gross margins and operating  results.  For example,  in the
second  quarter of 1998,  our product gross margins  declined to 12% from 30% in
the  previous  quarter due in part to a write down of  inventory  to reflect net
realizable  value.  If we  underestimate  the number of silicon wafers needed to
fill  product  orders,  we may be unable to obtain an adequate  supply of wafers
which could harm our product  revenues.  Because  our  largest  volume  product,
Compact Flash, is sold into an emerging consumer market, it is very difficult to
accurately forecast future sales. A substantial  majority of our quarterly sales
are from orders  received and  fulfilled in the same quarter.  In addition,  our
product order backlog may fluctuate  substantially from quarter to quarter.

         ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN EXPENSE LEVELS

         Due to anticipated growth, we increased our expense levels in the first
half of 1999. We expect  operating  expenses to continue to increase as a result
of the need to hire  additional  personnel to support  expected  growth in sales
unit  volumes,   sales  and  marketing  efforts  and  research  and  development
activities.

                                    Page 17

In addition,  we have  significant  fixed costs.  We cannot readily reduce these
expenses  over the short term.  If revenues do not increase  proportionately  to
operating  expenses,  or if revenues  decrease or do not meet expectations for a
particular period, our business,  financial  condition and results of operations
will be harmed.

         VARIABILITY OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND GROSS MARGIN

         Our product mix varies  quarterly,  which  affects our overall  average
selling prices and gross margins.  Our  CompactFlash  products,  which currently
represent  the  majority of our product  revenues,  have lower  average  selling
prices and gross  margins  than our higher  capacity  FlashDisk  and  FlashDrive
products. We believe that sales of CompactFlash products may become an even more
significant percentage of our product revenues as consumer applications, such as
digital cameras, become more popular. Dependence on CompactFlash sales, together
with lower pricing caused by increased competition,  caused average unit selling
prices to decline  28%  during  fiscal  1998,  and 38% in the first half of 1999
compared to the same period in 1998. We expect this trend to continue.

         VARIABILITY OF LICENSE FEES AND ROYALTIES

         Our intellectual  property  strategy is to cross-license our patents to
other manufacturers of flash products. Under these arrangements, we earn license
fees and  royalties  on  individually  negotiated  terms.  The timing of revenue
recognition  from these  payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and
on the timing of product shipments by the third parties.  This may cause license
and royalty revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Because
these  revenues have higher gross margins than product  revenues,  gross margins
and net income  fluctuate  significantly  with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues.

IN  TRANSITIONING  TO NEW PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS WE FACE  PRODUCTION  AND MARKET
ACCEPTANCE RISKS.

         GENERAL

         Successive generations of our products have incorporated  semiconductor
devices with greater memory capacity per chip. Two important factors that enable
us to decrease the costs per megabyte of our flash data storage products are the
development of higher capacity  semiconductor  devices and the implementation of
smaller  geometry  manufacturing  processes.  A number  of  challenges  exist in
achieving a lower cost per megabyte, including:

     o    overcoming  lower yields often  experienced in the early production of
          new semiconductor devices;

     o    problems  with  design  and   manufacturing   of  products  that  will
          incorporate these devices; and

     o    production delays.

         Because  our   products  are  complex,   we   periodically   experience
significant  delays in the  development  and  volume  production  ramp up of our
products.  Similar delays could occur in the future and could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

         128 MEGABIT TECHNOLOGY

         We began  shipments  of 128 megabit  products in the second  quarter of
1999. In the third  quarter of 1999,  we plan to increase  production of our 128
megabit flash memory technology, which has a lower cost per megabyte than our 64
megabit  technology  currently in production and will allow us to begin shipping
products with increased capacities including the 32 megabyte MultiMediaCard.  If
we are unable to bring our 128  megabit  flash  memory into full  production  as
quickly as planned  or if we  experience  unplanned

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>


yield problems, we may be unable to meet our customers' demand for high capacity
MultiMediaCard  and  CompactFlash  products which could result in lost sales and
reduced revenues.  In addition,  our gross margins may be harmed by any problems
we encounter in the production of our 128 megabit flash memory.

          D2 FLASH TECHNOLOGY

         We have  developed  new products  based on D2 flash  technology,  a new
flash  architecture  designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell.  High
density flash memory,  such as D2 flash,  is a complex  technology that requires
strict  manufacturing  controls and effective  test  screens.  Problems from the
shift to volume  production for new flash products could impact both reliability
and yields and result in increased manufacturing costs and reduced availability.
We may not be able to manufacture  reliable and cost effective D2 flash products
in  commercial  volumes and with yields  sufficient to result in lower costs per
megabyte.  Furthermore,  D2 flash technology needs significantly  improved write
speed so that it can be usefully applied to market  applications such as digital
cameras.  It is possible  that we may not be able to achieve the targeted  write
speed for our 256 megabit product.

         In the fourth quarter of 1999, we expect to increase  production of our
256 megabit  flash memory  technology,  which has a lower cost per megabyte than
the 128  megabit  technology.  If we are unable to bring our 256  megabit  flash
memory into full production as quickly as planned or if we experience  unplanned
yield problems,  we will not be able to meet our customers' forecasted demand in
the fourth quarter of 1999 and beyond, which would result in lost sales, reduced
revenues and reduced margins.

         In the second half of 1999,  we will be  dependent  for the majority of
megabytes shipped on the successful volume shipments of cards built with our 128
megabit and 256 megabit new designs.  If we are unable to  successfully  achieve
the planned yields for these  designs,  we will be unable to meet our forecasted
customer needs, and consequently our revenues and profits may fall significantly
below our expectations.

         MULTIMEDIACARD PRODUCTS

         We expect to increase  the  MultiMediaCard  product  family  production
volumes during the second half of 1999. This product  presents new challenges in
assembly and testing. During the startup phase, we have experienced fluctuations
in yields  which have reduced  MultiMediaCard  product  availability,  increased
manufacturing  costs and reduced product margins for this product family. We are
currently unable to meet customer demand for  MultiMediaCard  products.  This is
primarily  due to  demand  exceeding  previous  forecasts  from  our  customers.
Although we are steadily  resolving the assembly  manufacturing  issues, we have
not yet  achieved  the  production  assembly  yields  necessary  for high volume
production.

WE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES FOR SILICON WAFERS.

         All of our products  require silicon wafers.  We rely on United Silicon
Corporation, or USC, and United Semiconductor  Incorporated,  or USIC, in Taiwan
to supply all of our silicon wafers.  We depend on these foundries to allocate a
portion of their capacity to our needs,  produce  acceptable quality wafers with
acceptable  manufacturing  yields and deliver our wafers on a timely  basis at a
competitive price. If these foundries are unable to satisfy these  requirements,
our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.

         Currently, demand for semiconductor wafers has increased significantly,
due to increased demand in the consumer  electronics and cellular phone markets.
Increased demand for advanced  technology silicon wafers is increasing the price
of these wafers as supply becomes constrained.  We expect this trend to continue
throughout 1999 and 2000 which could adversely  impact the rate of growth of our
business, either through reduced supply, higher wafer prices or a combination of
the two.

         USC and USIC are subsidiaries of United  Microelectronics  Corporation,
or UMC.  We  currently  own 10% of USIC,  have the right to  appoint  one of its
directors and are entitled to 12.5% of its total wafer production. In the second
quarter of 1999,  UMC announced  plans to merge the USC and USIC  foundries

                                    Page 19
<PAGE>


into the UMC parent  company.  When the merger is  complete,  which is currently
expected  to occur in late 1999 or early  2000,  we will  receive  UMC shares in
exchange for the USIC shares we currently own. However,  we will not have a seat
on the board of directors of the combined company.  We have received  assurances
from the senior  management  of UMC that it intends to continue to supply us the
same wafer  capacity at the prices we currently  enjoy under our agreement  with
USIC.  However,  there can be no assurance  that we will be able to maintain our
current wafer capacity and competitive  pricing arrangement in our future supply
negotiations with UMC.

         Under the wafer supply agreements with our foundries,  we are obligated
to provide  monthly  rolling  forecasts  for our  anticipated  wafer  purchases.
Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each forecast are binding
commitments.  The estimates  for the  remaining  months may only be changed by a
certain  percentage from the previous month's forecast.  This limits our ability
to react to  fluctuations in demand for our products.  For example,  if customer
demand falls below our forecast  and we are unable to  reschedule  or cancel our
wafer orders, we may end up with excess wafer inventories, which could result in
higher  operating  expenses and reduced gross margins.  Conversely,  if customer
demand exceeds our forecasts,  we may be unable to obtain an adequate  supply of
wafers to fill  customer  orders,  which  could  result in lost  sales and lower
revenues. In addition, if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers
with  acceptable  price and yields from any  foundry,  our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations  could be harmed.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON EMERGING MARKETS AND NEW PRODUCTS.

         In order for demand  for our  products  to grow,  the  markets  for new
products  that use  CompactFlash  and the  MultiMediaCard,  such as MP3 portable
music  players  and smart  phones,  must  develop  and  grow.  If sales of these
products  do not grow,  our  revenues  and  profit  margins  could  level off or
decline.

         Because we sell our  products for use in many new  applications,  it is
difficult to forecast demand. For example, in the second quarter of 1999, demand
for our 32 megabyte  capacity  MultiMediaCard  for use in MP3  portable  digital
music  players  grew  faster  than  anticipated  and we were  unable to fill all
customer orders during the quarter. Although we are increasing production of the
MultiMediaCard,  if we are unable to fulfill  customer demand for these products
in the future, we may lose sales to our competitors. In addition, the market for
MP3 portable  digital  music players is very new and it is uncertain how quickly
consumer  demand for these  players  will grow.  If this market does not grow as
quickly as  anticipated or our customers are not successful in selling their MP3
portable music players to consumers,  our revenues could be adversely  affected.
In  addition,  it is often  the case with new  consumer  markets  that  after an
initial period of new market formation and initial acceptance by early adopters,
the market enters a period of slow growth as standards emerge and infrastructure
develops.  In the  event  that  this  occurs  in the MP3  music  market or other
emerging markets, sales of our products would be harmed.

         The success of this new product  strategy will depend upon, among other
things, the following:

     o    our ability to  successfully  develop new products  with higher memory
          capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte;

     o    the  development  of new  applications  or markets  for our flash data
          storage products;

     o    the extent to which  prospective  customers  design our products  into
          their products and successfully introduce their products; and

     o    the extent to which our products or  technologies  become  obsolete or
          noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others.

         If we fail to do any of the above,  our business,  financial  condition
and results of operations could suffer.

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>


WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE

         We may be unable to increase our  production  volumes at a sufficiently
rapid  rate so as to  maintain  our market  share.  Ultimately  our growth  rate
depends on our ability to obtain  sufficient flash memory wafers to meet demand.
If we are unable to do so, in a timely  manner,  we may lose market share to our
competitors.

OUR  INTERNATIONAL  OPERATIONS  MAKE US  VULNERABLE TO CHANGING  CONDITIONS  AND
CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.

         POLITICAL RISKS

         Currently, all of our flash memory wafers are produced by two foundries
in Taiwan.  We also use a third-party  subcontractor  in Taiwan for the assembly
and testing of our MultiMediaCard  products. We may therefore be affected by the
political,  economic  and  military  conditions  in Taiwan.  Taiwan is currently
engaged  in  various  political  disputes  with  China and both  countries  have
recently conducted military exercises in or near the other's  territorial waters
and airspace.  The Taiwanese  and Chinese  governments  may continue to escalate
these  disputes,  resulting in an economic  embargo,  a  disruption  in shipping
routes  or  even  military   hostilities.   This  could  harm  our  business  by
interrupting  or delaying the  production  or shipment of flash memory wafers or
MultiMediaCard  products by our Taiwanese foundries and subcontractor.  See also
"--We depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors."

         In  addition,  in  the  second  quarter  of  1999,  we  began  using  a
third-party  subcontractor  in  China  for  the  assembly  and  testing  of  our
CompactFlash  products.  As a result, our business could be harmed by the effect
of  political,  economic,  legal and  other  uncertainties  in China.  Under its
current  leadership,  the Chinese  government has been pursuing  economic reform
policies,  including  the  encouragement  of foreign  trade and  investment  and
greater economic  decentralization.  The Chinese  government may not continue to
pursue these policies and, even if it does  continue,  these policies may not be
successful.  The Chinese government may also significantly  alter these policies
from time to time. In addition,  China does not currently  have a  comprehensive
and highly developed legal system,  particularly  with respect to the protection
of intellectual property rights. As a result, enforcement of existing and future
laws and contracts is uncertain,  and the  implementation  and interpretation of
such laws may be  inconsistent.  Such  inconsistency  could  lead to piracy  and
degradation of our intellectual property protection.

         ECONOMIC RISKS

         We price our products  primarily in U.S.  dollars.  As a result, if the
value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to foreign currencies,  our products
could  become less  competitive  in  international  markets.  For  example,  our
products are  relatively  more expensive in Asia because of the weakness of many
Asian currencies  relative to the US dollar.  In addition,  we currently invoice
some of our customers in Japanese yen.  Therefore,  fluctuations in the Japanese
yen against the U.S.  dollar could harm our  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         Our sales are also highly dependent upon global economic conditions. In
fiscal 1998,  sales to Japan declined to 31.6% of total product sales from 38.1%
in 1997. In the first half of 1999, sales to Japan  represented 25.6% of product
revenue compared to 32.7% for the same period of 1998. We believe these declines
were primarily due to the Japanese economic crisis and market recession.  If the
current market  conditions in Japan do not improve,  or if they decline further,
our results of operations may suffer.

         GENERAL RISKS

         Our  international   business  activities  could  also  be  limited  or
disrupted by any of the following factors:

     o    the need to comply with foreign government regulation;


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>


     o    general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability,
          potential   hostilities   and   changes   in   diplomatic   and  trade
          relationships;

     o    imposition  of  regulatory  requirements,  tariffs,  import and export
          restrictions and other barriers and restrictions;

     o    longer  payment cycles and greater  difficulty in accounts  receivable
          collection;

     o    potentially adverse tax consequences;

     o    less protection of our intellectual property rights; and

     o    delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions.

WE DEPEND ON OUR SUPPLIERS AND THIRD PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS.

         We rely on our vendors,  some of which are sole source  suppliers,  for
several of our critical  components.  We do not have long-term supply agreements
with some of these  vendors.  Our  business,  financial  condition and operating
results could be harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to
develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components.
For  example,  we rely on USIC and USC for all of our flash  memory  wafers  and
Motorola,  Inc. and NEC to supply certain  designs of  microcontrollers.  Due to
industry-wide increasing demand for semiconductors, we have recently experienced
resistance to price reductions from some of our important suppliers.

         We also rely on  third-party  subcontractors  to assemble  and test the
memory  components for our products.  We have no long-term  contracts with these
subcontractors  and cannot directly  control product  delivery  schedules.  This
could lead to  product  shortages  or quality  assurance  problems  which  could
increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our
operating results.

         During the second quarter of 1999, we transferred a substantial portion
of wafer testing,  packaged memory final testing, card assembly and card testing
to Silicon  Precision  Industries  Co.,  Ltd. in Taiwan and  Celestica,  Inc. in
China. In the third quarter of 1999, we will transfer  additional  production to
these  subcontractors,  and by the end of the year we  expect  that they will be
assembling  and  testing a majority of our mature,  high-volume  products.  This
increased reliance on subcontractors is expected to reduce  manufacturing  costs
and give us access to  increased  production  capacity.  During  the  transition
period,  we will continue full operations at our Sunnyvale  production  facility
while  simultaneously  transferring  testing equipment and training personnel of
our subcontractors.  However, we do not have sufficient  duplicative  production
testing  equipment  at  Sunnyvale  and at  our  subcontractors.  Therefore,  any
significant  problems in this  complex  transfer of  operations  may result in a
disruption  of production  and a shortage of product to meet customer  demand in
the second half of 1999 and beyond.

CONTINUING  DECLINES IN OUR AVERAGE  SALES  PRICES MAY RESULT IN DECLINES IN OUR
GROSS MARGINS.

         In 1998, the average unit selling  prices of our products  declined 28%
compared to 1997. In the first half of 1999,  the average unit selling prices of
our products  declined 38%  compared to the same period of 1998.  Because  flash
data  storage  markets  are  characterized  by  intense  competition  and  price
reductions  for our products are  necessary to meet consumer  price  points,  we
expect that  market-driven  pricing  pressures will  continue.  This will likely
result in a further decline in average sales prices for our products. We believe
that we can offset  declining  average  sales prices by achieving  manufacturing
cost  reductions  and  developing  new products that  incorporate  more advanced
technology and include more advanced  features and can be sold at stable average
gross margins despite continued  declines in average selling price per megabyte.
However,  if we are unable to achieve  such cost  reductions  and  technological
advances,  this could result in lost sales and declining gross margins, and as a
result,  our  business,  financial  condition

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>


and results of operations could suffer.

         The  semiconductor  industry is cyclical and we believe it is currently
in a recovery  from one of its most severe down cycles.  During most of 1997 and
1998,  the  semiconductor  industry  experienced   significant  production  over
capacity, which reduced margins for substantially all flash memory suppliers.

OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

         FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURERS AND MEMORY CARD ASSEMBLERS

         We compete in an industry  characterized by intense competition,  rapid
technological  changes,  evolving industry standards,  declining average selling
prices  and rapid  product  obsolescence.  Our  competitors  include  many large
domestic and international  companies that have greater access to advanced wafer
foundry capacity,  substantially  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing and
other resources,  broader product lines and longer standing  relationships  with
customers. Our primary competitors include:

     o    storage  flash  chip   producers,   such  as  Hitachi  Ltd.,   Samsung
          Electronics Company Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation;

     o    socket  flash,  linear  flash  and  component  manufacturers,  such as
          Advanced Micro Devices,  Inc., Atmel  Corporation,  Intel Corporation,
          Macronix International Co., Ltd., Micron Technology,  Inc., Mitsubishi
          Electronic    Corporation,    Sharp   Electronics    Corporation   and
          STMicroelectronics NV; and

     o    module or card assemblers, such as Lexar Media, Inc., M-Systems, Inc.,
          Pretec  Electronics  Corp.,  Simple  Technology  Inc.,  SMART  Modular
          Technologies,  Inc., Sony Corporation,  Kingston  Technology  Company,
          Panasonic Consumer  Electronic  Company,  Silicon Storage  Technology,
          Inc., TDK Corporation, Matsushita Battery, Inc. and Viking Components,
          Inc.,  who combine  controllers  and flash memory  chips  developed by
          others into flash storage cards.

         In addition,  over 25 companies have been certified by the CompactFlash
Association to manufacture and sell their own brand of CompactFlash.  We believe
additional manufacturers will enter the CompactFlash market in the future.

         We have entered into patent  cross-license  agreements  with several of
our leading competitors including,  Hitachi,  Samsung, Toshiba, Intel and Sharp.
Under  these  agreements,  each party may  manufacture  and sell  products  that
incorporate  technology  covered by the other party's  patents  related to flash
memory  devices.  As we continue to license our patents to certain  competitors,
competition  will  increase and may harm our business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         ALTERNATIVE STORAGE MEDIA

         Competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards
that are different from our CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard products,  including
Toshiba's  SmartMedia,  Sony Corporation's  Memory Stick, Sony's standard floppy
disk used for digital storage in its Mavica digital  cameras,  Panasonic's  Mega
Storage cards, Iomega's Clik drive, a miniaturized,  mechanical,  removable disk
drive  and  M-Systems'  Diskonchip  for  embedded  storage  applications.   Each
competing  standard  is  mechanically  and   electronically   incompatible  with
CompactFlash and  MultiMediaCard.  If a manufacturer of digital cameras or other
consumer  electronic  devices  designs  in one of  these  alternative  competing
standards,  CompactFlash or  MultiMediaCard  will be eliminated from use in that
product.

         In September 1998, IBM introduced the microdrive, a rotating disk drive
in a Type II CompactFlash format.  Initially, this product will compete directly
with our Type II  CompactFlash  memory cards,  which we introduced in the second
quarter of 1999, for use in high-end  professional  digital cameras.

                                    Page 23
<PAGE>


In October 1998,  M-Systems  introduced their Diskonchip 2000 Millennium product
which  competes   against  our  Flash  ChipSet   products  in  embedded  storage
applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances.

         According to  independent  industry  analysts,  Sony's  Mavica  digital
camera  captured a considerable  portion of the United States market for digital
cameras in 1998. The Mavica uses a standard  floppy disk to store digital images
and  therefore  uses no  CompactFlash,  or any  other  flash  cards.  Our  sales
prospects for CompactFlash  cards have been adversely impacted by the success of
the Mavica.

         Our  MultiMediaCard  products also have faced  significant  competition
from  Toshiba's   SmartMedia  flash  cards  and  we  expect  to  face  similarly
significant  competition from Sony's Memory Stick.  Although the Memory Stick is
proprietary  to Sony,  if it is adopted and  achieves  widespread  use in future
products, sales of our MultiMediaCard and CompactFlash products may decline.

         ALTERNATIVE FLASH TECHNOLOGIES

         We also face  competition  from products based on multilevel cell flash
technology  such as Intel's 64 megabit  and 128  megabit  StrataFlash  chips and
Hitachi's 256 megabit  multilevel cell flash chip.  These products  compete with
our  D2  multilevel   cell  flash   technology.   Multilevel  cell  flash  is  a
technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of
information  instead  of the  traditional  single  bit  stored  by the  industry
standard flash technology.  In the second quarter of 1999, Intel announced their
new 128Mbit  multilevel cell chip and Hitachi began shipping customer samples of
CompactFlash  cards employing their new multilevel cell flash chip. In addition,
Toshiba has begun customer  shipments of 32 megabyte  SmartMedia cards employing
their new 256Mbit flash chip.  Although Toshiba has not incorporated  multilevel
cell flash  technology in their  256Mbit flash chip,  their use of more advanced
lithographic  design rules has resulted in a comparably-sized  die and may allow
them to achieve a more  competitive  cost  structure than that of our 256Mbit D2
flash chip.

         Furthermore,  we expect to face competition  from existing  competitors
and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets that have
similar  or  alternative  data  storage  solutions  which may be less  costly or
provide  additional  features.  Price is an important  competitive factor in the
market for consumer  products.  Increased  price  competition  could lower gross
margins if our average  selling prices  decrease faster than our costs and could
also result in lost sales.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

         In 1998 and the first half of 1999,  we received  more product  revenue
and  shipped  more  units  of  products   destined   for  consumer   electronics
applications,  principally digital cameras,  than for any other application.  We
believe that these products will encounter intense competition and be more price
sensitive than products sold into our other target markets. In addition, we must
spend more on marketing  and  promotion in consumer  markets to establish  brand
name recognition and preference.

         A significant  portion of sales to the consumer  electronics  market is
made  through  distributors  and to  retailers.  Sales  through  these  channels
typically  include  rights to return unsold  inventory.  As a result,  we do not
recognize  revenue until after the product has been sold to the end user. If our
distributors  and  retailers are not  successful in this market,  there could be
substantial product returns, which would harm our business,  financial condition
and results of operations.

SALES TO A SMALL  NUMBER OF  CUSTOMERS  REPRESENT A  SIGNIFICANT  PORTION OF OUR
REVENUES.

         More than half of our revenues  come from a small number of  customers.
For example, sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 59%, 67%,
and 71%, respectively,  of our product revenues for 1998, 1997, and 1996. In the
first six months of 1999, our top 10 customers represented  approximately 57% of
product  revenues.  In the first six  months of fiscal  1999 and in fiscal  year
1998, two customers  each accounted for 10% or more of our product sales.  If we
were to lose any of these  customers or  experience

                                    Page 24
<PAGE>


any  material  reduction  in orders  from  these  customers,  our  revenues  and
operating  results  would  suffer.  Our sales  are  generally  made by  standard
purchase orders rather than long-term contracts. In addition, the composition of
our major  customer  base changes from year to year as the market demand for our
customers' products change.

OUR MULTIPLE SALES CHANNELS MAY COMPETE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SALES.

         Web based  sales of our  products  today  represent a small but growing
portion  of our  overall  sales.  Sales on the  Internet  tend to  undercut  the
traditional  distribution  channels  and  may  dramatically  change  the way our
consumer  products are purchased in future  years.  We cannot assure you that we
will  successfully  manage the  inherent  channel  conflicts  between our retail
channel customers and customers that wish to purchase directly on the Internet.

THERE IS SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS.

         Sales of our products, in particular the sale of CompactFlash products,
in the consumer electronics applications market are subject to seasonality. As a
result,  product sales are impacted by seasonal  purchasing patterns with higher
sales generally  occurring in the second half of each year. In addition,  in the
past we have  experienced  a decrease  in orders in the first  quarter  from our
Japanese OEM customers  primarily  because most  customers in Japan operate on a
fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of
their next fiscal year. For example,  our product revenues were 24% lower in the
first  quarter of 1998 than in the fourth  quarter of 1997,  mostly due to these
seasonal factors and the Asian economic  crisis.  Although we did not experience
this seasonality in the first quarter of 1999, we cannot assure you that we will
not experience seasonality in the future.

WE MUST ACHIEVE ACCEPTABLE WAFER MANUFACTURING YIELDS.

         The  fabrication  of our products  requires  wafers to be produced in a
highly  controlled  and ultra clean  environment.  Semiconductor  companies that
supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer
manufacturing yields.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both
our design technology and the foundry's  manufacturing  process technology.  Low
yields may result from design errors or manufacturing  failures.  Yield problems
may not be  determined  or improved  until an actual  product is made and can be
tested.  As a result,  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are
well into the  production  process.  The risks  associated  with yields are even
greater because we rely on independent  offshore  foundries for our wafers which
increases  the effort and time  required to  identify,  communicate  and resolve
manufacturing  yield  problems.  If the  foundries  cannot  achieve  the planned
yields, this will result in higher costs and reduced product  availability,  and
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENTS, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND RELATED LITIGATION.

         GENERAL

         We rely on a combination  of patents,  trademarks,  copyright and trade
secret laws,  confidentiality  procedures and licensing  arrangements to protect
our  intellectual  property  rights.  In the  past,  we have  been  involved  in
significant disputes regarding our intellectual  property rights and claims that
we may be infringing third parties' intellectual property rights. We expect that
we may be involved in similar disputes in the future. We cannot assure you that:

     o    any of our existing patents will not be invalidated;

     o    patents will be issued for any of our pending applications;

     o    any  claims  allowed  from  existing  or  pending  patents  will  have
          sufficient scope or strength; or


                                    Page 25
<PAGE>



     o    our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products
          are sold in order to  protect  our  rights  and  potential  commercial
          advantage.

In addition,  our  competitors  may be able to design their products  around our
patents.

         We intend to vigorously  enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that
our  efforts  will be  successful.  If we were to have an adverse  result in any
litigation,  we  could  be  required  to  pay  substantial  damages,  cease  the
manufacture,  use and sale of infringing products,  expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing  technology,  discontinue the use of certain processes
or obtain  licenses to the  infringing  technology.  Any litigation is likely to
result  in  significant  expense  to us, as well as divert  the  efforts  of our
technical and management  personnel.  For example the Lexar litigation described
below has resulted in cumulative litigation expenses approaching $1 million.

         CROSS LICENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS

         If we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or
if we are  found to  infringe  on  others'  intellectual  property,  we could be
required to license  intellectual  property from a third party. We may also need
to license some of our intellectual  property to others in order to enable us to
obtain  cross-licenses  to  third  party  patents.  Currently,  we  have  patent
cross-license  agreements  with several  companies,  including  Hitachi,  Intel,
Samsung,  Sharp and  Toshiba  and we are in  discussions  with  other  companies
regarding potential cross-license agreements. We cannot be certain that licenses
will be offered when we need them, or that the terms offered will be acceptable.
If we do obtain  licenses from third parties,  we may be required to pay license
fees or royalty payments. In addition, if we are unable to obtain a license that
is necessary to the manufacture of our products, we could be required to suspend
the  manufacture of products or stop our wafer  suppliers  from using  processes
that may  infringe  the rights of third  parties.  We cannot  assure you that we
would be successful in redesigning  our products or that the necessary  licenses
will be available under reasonable terms.

         We  have  historically   agreed  to  indemnify  various  suppliers  and
customers for alleged patent  infringement.  The scope of such indemnity varies,
but may, in some instances,  include  indemnification  for damages and expenses,
including  attorney's fees. We may periodically engage in litigation as a result
of these indemnification  obligations.  We are not currently engaged in any such
indemnification  proceedings.  Our insurance policies exclude coverage for third
party claims for patent  infringement.  Any future  obligation  to indemnify our
customers or suppliers could harm our business,  financial  condition or results
of operations.

         LITIGATION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

         From time to time, it may be necessary to initiate  litigation  against
third parties to preserve our intellectual  property rights. These parties could
in turn bring suit against us. For  example,  in March 1998 we filed a complaint
in Federal  District Court against Lexar Media,  Inc. for infringement of one of
our flash card patents.  Lexar  disputed this claim and asserted that our patent
was  invalid  or  unenforceable,  as well  as  asserting  various  counterclaims
including  unfair  competition,  violation  of the Lanham  Act,  patent  misuse,
interference with prospective economic advantage, trade defamation and fraud. We
have denied all of these counterclaims. In July 1998, the federal district court
denied Lexar's request to have the case dismissed.  Discovery in this suit began
in August 1998.  On February 22, 1999,  the Federal  District  Court  considered
arguments  and papers  submitted by the parties  regarding  the scope and proper
interpretation  of the asserted claims in our patent at issue in the Lexar suit.
On March 4, 1999,  the Federal  District  Court  issued its ruling on the proper
construction  of the claim terms in our  patent.  On July 30,  1999,  we filed a
motion  for  partial  summary  judgment  that  Lexar  CompactFlash  and PC Cards
contributorily  infringe  our patent.  This motion is  scheduled  to be heard in
September  1999.  In August  1999,  we had a mandatory  settlement  meeting with
Lexar. No settlement was reached through this meeting.  A trial date has not yet
been set.

OUR RAPID GROWTH MAY STRAIN OUR OPERATIONS.

         We are  currently  experiencing  rapid  growth,  which has placed,  and
continues to place, a significant  strain on our personnel and other  resources.
To accommodate this growth, we must continue to hire, train, motivate and manage
our employees. We are having difficulty hiring the necessary engineering,  sales
and  marketing  personnel  to support our growth.  In  addition,  we must make a
significant  investment in our existing internal information  management systems
to support increased  manufacturing,  as well as accounting and other management
related functions.  Our systems,  procedures and controls may not be adequate to
support  our rapid  growth,  which  could in turn harm our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE LOSS
OF WHOM COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

         Our  success  greatly  depends on the  continued  contributions  of our
senior management and other key research and development,  sales,  marketing and
operations personnel, including Dr. Eli Harari, our founder, President and Chief
Executive  Officer.  Our  success  will also  depend on our  ability  to recruit
additional  highly  skilled  personnel.  We  cannot  assure  you that we will be
successful  in hiring or retaining  such key  personnel,  or that any of our key
personnel will remain employed with us.

OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE.

         The market price of our stock has fluctuated  significantly in the past
and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. For example for the twelve
month period ending June 30, 1999, our stock price has fluctuated  from a low of
$5.125 to a high of $44.6875. We believe that such fluctuations will continue as
a result of future  announcements  concerning  us, our  competitors or principal
customers  regarding  technological  innovations,   new  product  introductions,
governmental  regulations,  litigation  or  changes  in  earnings  estimates  by
analysts.  In  addition,  in  recent  years  the stock  market  has  experienced
significant  price  and  volume  fluctuations  and  the  market  prices  of  the
securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile, often for
reasons outside the control of the particular  companies.  These fluctuations as
well as general  economic,  political and market  conditions may have an adverse
affect on the market price of our common stock.

YEAR 2000 ISSUES MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

         Many  existing  computer  systems  and  applications  may not  function
properly when using dates beyond  December 31, 1999. We have  established a Year
2000 Risk  Management  program to assess the impact that the Year 2000 issue may
have on our business.  Based on our  assessment to date, all of our flash memory
and connectivity  products are Year 2000 compliant.  Other Year 2000 issues that
we face include  assessment  and  remediation  of the computer  systems used for
facilities  control,  machine  control and  manufacturing  testing and Year 2000
compliance of our key suppliers and customers.

         Our  estimated  total  costs for Year 2000  compliance  issues  are not
expected to have a material adverse affect on our business. However, the failure
of our key suppliers and  customers to take proper  remedial  efforts could harm
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ANTI-TAKEOVER  PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS,  STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN AND
IN  DELAWARE  LAW COULD  PREVENT OR DELAY A CHANGE IN CONTROL  AND, AS A RESULT,
NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR STOCKHOLDERS.

         We have  taken a number  of  actions  that  could  have the  effect  of
discouraging  a takeover  attempt.  For example,  we have adopted a  stockholder
rights plan that would cause substantial  dilution to a stockholder who attempts
to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors.  In addition, our
certificate of incorporation  grants the board of directors the authority to fix
the rights,  preferences  and privileges of and issue up to 4,000,000  shares of
preferred  stock  without  stockholder  action.  Although  we  have  no  present
intention to issue shares of preferred  stock,  such an issuance  could have the
effect of

                                    Page 27
<PAGE>


making it more  difficult  and less  attractive  for a third  party to acquire a
majority of our  outstanding  voting stock.  Preferred stock may also have other
rights,  including  economic rights senior to the common stock that could have a
material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock. In addition, we
are  subject to the  anti-takeover  provisions  of Section  203 of the  Delaware
General  Corporation  Law. This section  provides  that a corporation  shall not
engage in any business  combination with any interested  stockholder  during the
three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested
stockholder.  This  provision  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a
change of control of SanDisk.
