              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


1.     These interim condensed  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited
       but  reflect,  in  the  opinion  of  management,   all  normal  recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of March 31, 1999,
       and the results of operations  and cash flows for the three month periods
       ended March 31, 1999 and 1998.  Because all the  disclosures  required by
       generally accepted accounting principles are not included,  these interim
       condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
       with the audited financial  statements and notes thereto in the Company's
       annual  report on Form 10-K/A as of, and for the year ended  December 31,
       1998.  The condensed  consolidated  balance sheet data as of December 31,
       1998 was derived from the audited financial statements.

       The results of operations and cash flows for the three month period ended
       March 31, 1999 are not  necessarily  indicative  of results of operations
       and cash flows for any future period.

2.     The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31, and
       each fiscal  quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, and
       September  30. The first  fiscal  quarter of 1999 and 1998 ended on March
       28,  1999 and March 29,  1998,  respectively.  Fiscal  year 1998 ended on
       December 27, 1998. For ease of presentation,  the accompanying  financial
       statements  have been  shown as  ending  on the last day of the  calendar
       month.

3.     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4. The components of inventory consist of the following:

       For the three month  periods  ending March 31, 1999 and 1998,  options to
       purchase  10,753 and 150,706 shares of common stock,  respectively,  have
       been excluded from the earnings per share calculation, as their effect is
       antidilutive.

6.     To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be  necessary  to  initiate  litigation  with one or more third  parties,
       including  but not limited to those the Company has  notified of possible
       patent  infringement.  In  addition,  one or more of  these  parties,  or
       others, may bring suit against the Company.

       In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal  court  against
       Lexar Media, Inc.  ("Lexar") for infringement of a fundamental  flashdisk
       patent.  Lexar has disputed the Company's  claim of patent  infringement,
       claimed SanDisk's patent is invalid or unenforceable and asserted various
       counterclaims including unfair competition,  violation of the Lanham Act,
       patent misuse,  interference with prospective  economic advantage,  trade
       defamation and fraud. SanDisk has denied each of Lexar's counterclaims.

        In July 1998, the federal  district court denied Lexar's request to have
       the case  dismissed  on the  grounds  the  Company  failed to  perform an
       adequate prefiling  investigation.  Discovery in the Lexar suit commenced
       in August  1998.  On  February  22,  1999,  the  Federal  District  Court
       considered  arguments and papers  submitted by the parties  regarding the
       scope and  proper  interpretation  of the  asserted  claims in  SanDisk's
       patent at issue in the Lexar suit. On March 4, 1999, the Federal District
       Court issued its ruling on the proper  construction of the claim terms in
       SanDisk's  patent. A trial date has not yet been set. The Company intends
       to  vigorously  enforce its patents,  but there can be no assurance  that
       these efforts will be successful.

       From  time to  time  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  certain  of its
       suppliers  and customers for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances  include  indemnification
       for damages and expenses,  including attorneys fees. The Company may from
       time

                                     Page 7
<PAGE>


       to time be  engaged  in  litigation  as a result of such  indemnification
       obligations. Third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from
       coverage  under  the  Company's  insurance  policies.  There  can  be  no
       assurance that any future obligation to indemnify the Company's customers
       or suppliers,  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
       business, financial condition and results of operations.

       Any  litigation,  whether as a plaintiff or as a  defendant,  will likely
       result in  significant  expense to the  Company and divert the efforts of
       the Company's  technical and  management  personnel,  whether or not such
       litigation is ultimately determined in favor of the Company. In the event
       of an  adverse  result  in any  such  litigation,  the  Company  could be
       required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture,  use and sale
       of  infringing   products,   expend  significant   resources  to  develop
       non-infringing   technology   or  obtain   licenses  to  the   infringing
       technology,  or discontinue  the use of certain  processes.  Accordingly,
       there  can be no  assurance  that any of the  foregoing  matters,  or any
       future  litigation,  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
       Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

7.     The Company has a credit agreement (the Agreement) with a bank, which was
       renewed  in July  1998.  Under the  provisions  of the  Agreement,  which
       expires in July 1999,  the  Company  may borrow up to $10.0  million on a
       revolving line of credit at the bank's prime interest rate. Amounts under
       the revolving line of credit can be applied to the issuance of letters of
       credit up to the full amount of the credit line. At March 31, 1999,  $1.0
       million of letters of credit were  outstanding.  In  addition,  under the
       Agreement, the Company also has a $15.0 million foreign exchange contract
       line under which the Company may enter into foreign  exchange  contracts.
       As of March 31,  1999,  $4.5  million was  outstanding  under the foreign
       exchange contract portion of the line. The Agreement  contains  covenants
       that require the Company to maintain certain  financial ratios and levels
       of net worth.  The Agreement  prohibits the payment of cash  dividends to
       stockholders.

8.     Certain of the Company's purchase  commitments and balance sheet accounts
       are denominated in Japanese Yen. The Company enters into foreign exchange
       contracts to hedge against  changes in foreign  currency  exchange rates.
       The effects of movements in currency  exchange rates on these instruments
       are  recognized  when the related  operating  revenues  and  expenses are
       recognized. The impact of movements in currency exchange rates on foreign
       exchange  contracts  substantially  mitigates  the related  impact on the
       underlying items hedged.

9.     Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  presented in the  accompanying
       balance sheet consists of the accumulated  unrealized  gains and loses on
       available-for-sale marketable securities, net of the related tax effects,

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

    Certain  statements  in this  discussion  and analysis  are forward  looking
statements  based  on  current  expectations,   and  entail  various  risks  and
uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from those
expressed in such forward looking  statements.  Such risks and uncertainties are
discussed below and in the Company's Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31,
1998 under the heading  "Factors  That May Affect Future  Results."  Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which
speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to update
these forward looking  statements to reflect events or  circumstances  occurring
after the date hereof.  The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction
with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

    The Company was  founded in 1988 to develop  and market  flash data  storage
systems.  The  Company  sells  its  products  to the  consumer  electronics  and
industrial/communications  markets. During 1998, the percentage of the Company's
product sales  attributable  to the consumer  electronics  market,  particularly
sales  of  CompactFlash  for  use  in  digital  camera  applications,  increased
substantially. This increase in sales to the consumer market resulted in a shift
to lower capacity  products,  which  typically have lower average selling prices
and gross margins than higher capacity products. In addition, these products are
frequently  sold into the retail  channel,  which  usually has shorter  customer
order lead-times than the other channels used by the Company, thereby decreasing
the Company's ability to accurately forecast future production needs. Subject to
market  acceptance of its  CompactFlash  products,  the Company  believes  these
products  will  continue to represent a majority of the  Company's  sales as the
popularity of consumer applications,  including digital cameras,  increases. The
percentage of sales  attributable  to orders  received and fulfilled in the same
quarter has increased  over time and, in response,  the Company is continuing to
work to shorten its manufacturing cycle times.

    The  Company's  operating  results  are  affected  by a  number  of  factors
including  the  volume of  product  sales,  the  timing of  significant  orders,
competitive  pricing pressures,  the ability of the Company to match supply with
demand,  changes  in product  and  customer  mix,  market  acceptance  of new or
enhanced  versions of the Company's  products,  changes in the channels  through
which  the   Company's   products  are   distributed,   timing  of  new  product
announcements and  introductions by the Company and its competitors,  the timing
of license and royalty revenues,  fluctuations in product costs, availability of
foundry  capacity,  variations in  manufacturing  cycle times,  fluctuations  in
manufacturing  yields and  manufacturing  utilization,  increased  research  and
development  expenses,  and exchange  rate  fluctuations.  In  addition,  as the
proportion  of the  Company's  products  sold  for use in  consumer  electronics
applications continues to increase, the Company's revenues may become subject to
seasonal  declines  in the first  quarter of each year.  See  "Factors  That May
Affect Future Results - Our Operating Results May Fluctuate  Significantly"  and
"There is Seasonality in Our Business."

    Beginning  in late 1995,  the Company  adopted a strategy of  licensing  its
flash  technology,  including  its patent  portfolio,  to  selected  third party
manufacturers  of flash  products.  To date, the Company has entered into patent
cross-license   agreements  with  six  companies,   and  it  intends  to  pursue
opportunities to enter into additional  licenses.  The Company's current license
agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties,  or a combination
thereof,  to the  Company.  The  timing and  amount of these  payments  can vary
substantially from quarter to quarter,  depending on the terms of each agreement
and, in some cases,  the timing of sales of products by the other parties.  As a
result,  license and royalty revenues have fluctuated  significantly in the past
and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high
gross margins  associated with license and royalty  revenues,  gross margins and
net income are likely to  fluctuate  more with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues than with changes in product revenues.

    SanDisk  markets  its  products  using a  combination  of its  direct  sales
organization,   distributors,   manufacturers'  representatives,  private  label
partners, OEMs and retailers.  The Company expects that sales


                                     Page 9
<PAGE>

through the retail  channel  will  continue to comprise an  increasing  share of
total revenues in the future,  and that a substantial  portion of its sales into
the  retail  channel  will be made to  participants  that will have the right to
return unsold products. The Company does not recognize revenues from these sales
until the products are sold to the end customers.

    Historically,  a  majority  of the  Company's  sales  have been to a limited
number of customers. The Company expects that sales of its products to a limited
number of customers  will continue to account for a  substantial  portion of its
product  revenues for the foreseeable  future.  The Company has also experienced
significant  changes in the  composition  of its customer base from year to year
and  expects  this  pattern to  continue  as market  demand for such  customers'
products fluctuates. The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by major
customers,  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations.  See "Factors  That May Affect
Future  Results - Sales to a Small Number of Customers  Represent a  Significant
Portion of Our Revenues."

    Due to the  emerging  nature of the  Company's  target  markets  and certain
planned product transitions,  the Company has had difficulty  forecasting future
inventory  levels  required  to  meet  customer  demand.  As a  result  of  both
contractual  obligations  and  manufacturing  cycle times,  the Company has been
required to order  wafers from its  foundries  several  months in advance of the
ultimate shipment of its products.  Under the Company's wafer supply agreements,
there are limits on the number of wafers the Company can order and the Company's
ability to change  that  quantity  is  restricted.  Accordingly,  the  Company's
ability  to react to  significant  fluctuations  in demand for its  products  is
limited.  As a result,  the Company has not been able to match its  purchases of
wafers to specific  customer  orders and  therefore the Company has from time to
time taken write downs for potential  excess  inventory  purchased  prior to the
receipt of customer  orders.  For example,  in the second  quarter of 1998,  the
Company's product gross margins declined to 12% from 30% in the previous quarter
due in part  to a write  down of this  inventory  to  reflect  inventory  at net
realizable  value.  These  adjustments  decrease  gross  margins in the  quarter
reported and have resulted,  and could in the future result,  in fluctuations in
gross margins on a quarter to quarter basis. See "Factors That May Affect Future
Results - Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly."

    Export  sales are an  important  part of the  Company's  business.  In 1998,
product  sales to Japan  declined  19% from the prior  year,  due in part to the
Asian economic crisis.  While a majority of the Company's revenues from sales to
Japan and other Asian  countries  are  derived  from OEM  customers  who plan to
export a portion of their  products  to  countries  outside  of Asia,  the Asian
economic crisis may continue to adversely  effect the Company's  revenues to the
extent that demand for the Company's products in Asia declines. Given the recent
economic  conditions in Asia and the weakness of many Asian currencies  relative
to the United  States  dollar,  the Company's  products may be  relatively  more
expensive in Asia,  which could result in a decrease in the  Company's  sales in
that region. The Company may also experience  pressure on its gross margins as a
result of increased price competition from Asian competitors.  While most of the
Company's sales are denominated in U.S.  Dollars,  the Company  invoices certain
Japanese  customers in Japanese Yen.  Exchange rate  fluctuations  can therefore
affect the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
See "Factors  That May Affect  Future  Results - We Face Risks  Associated  with
International Operations."

    For the  foreseeable  future,  the Company  expects to realize a significant
portion of its revenues from recently introduced and new products. Typically new
products  initially have lower gross margins than more mature  products  because
the manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive
product generation. In addition, manufacturing yields are generally lower at the
start of manufacturing any new product.  To remain  competitive,  the Company is
focusing  on a number of programs to lower its  manufacturing  costs,  including
development  of future  generations  of double density ("D2") flash and advanced
technology  wafers.  There can be no assurance  that such  products or processes
will be  successfully  developed  by the  Company  or that  development  of such
processes will lower manufacturing  costs. In addition,  the Company anticipates
that price  competition  will  increase  in the future,  which  could  result in
decreased average selling prices and lower gross margins.  See "Factors That May
Affect Future Results -We Must Achieve Acceptable Wafer Manufacturing Yields."

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

         The Company is aware of problems  associated  with computer  systems as
the Year 2000  approaches.  Year 2000 problems are the result of common computer
programming techniques that result in systems that do not function properly when
manipulating  dates later than December 31, 1999.  The issue is complex and wide
ranging.  The problem may affect transaction  processing  computer  applications
used by the Company for accounting,  distribution,  manufacturing,  planning and
communications.  The problem may also affect  embedded  systems such as building
security systems,  machine controllers and production test equipment.  Year 2000
problems with these systems may affect the ability or efficiency  with which the
Company can perform many  significant  functions,  including but not limited to:
order processing and fulfillment,  material planning,  product assembly, product
test,  invoicing  and  financial  reporting.  While there can be no guarantee of
unaffected  operation,   the  completed  implementation  of  the  Company's  new
Management  Information  System,  and the  completed  assessment of its embedded
systems  indicates  limited  exposure in these areas.  The Year 2000 problem may
also affect the  computer  systems of the  Company's  suppliers  and  customers,
potentially  disrupting their operations.  Year 2000 problems with the Company's
business partners may impact the Company's sources of supply and demand.

         Year 2000  Readiness.  The  Company  has a Year  2000  Risk  Management
program  to assess  the  impact of the Year 2000  issue on the  Company,  and to
coordinate remediation  activities.  The Company completed the evaluation of its
products for Year 2000  compliance in the third  quarter of 1998.  The Company's
FlashDisk,   FlashDrive,  Flash  ChipSet,  CompactFlash,   MultiMediaCard,   and
ImageMate  product  lines do not  perform  date  related  processing  and do not
contain  real time clock  circuitry  and  therefore,  are Year 2000  ready.  The
Company's storage and connectivity  products are used as components in a variety
of host systems.  The firmware,  operating  system and  application  software of
these host systems are designed and manufactured by others. The Company makes no
claim with regard to the Year 2000 readiness of host systems  designed by others
in which the Company's  products are used.  Independent  system  designers  make
derivative works from the SanDisk Host Developer's  Toolkit  ("Toolkit")  source
code product.  Sample date related  subroutines and data structures are included
in the Toolkit for use by system designers. Designers modify the sample routines
in order to fit the specific  requirements of their host operating  system.  The
designer is responsible for the formatting and processing  logic associated with
the date values that pass  through the Toolkit  subsystem  and for the Year 2000
readiness  of the  systems in which the Toolkit is used.  The  Company  makes no
claims with regard to the Year 2000  readiness of host  firmware  and  operating
systems designed by others that contain derivative works of the Toolkit.

         The Year  2000  remediation  of the  Company's  transaction  processing
systems was  completed  with the  installation  and testing of the Company's new
management information system in the fourth quarter of 1998. The new system is a
commercially available,  fully integrated MRP II (Materials Requirement Planning
and Accounting system) software application. This system is used for Accounting,
Order  Processing,   Planning,   Inventory  Control,   Shop  Floor  Control  and
Distribution.

         The  Company's  assessment  and  remediation  of Year 2000  problems in
tertiary  business  information  systems  is  on-going.  Well  over  90%  of the
Company's  investment in desktop PC hardware is known to be Year 2000 compliant,
and proven remediation solutions have been identified for the remaining 10%. The
majority of the software  used on these  systems and network  servers are recent
versions of vendor supported,  commercially available products.  Upgrading these
applications  as Year 2000  compliant  patches are  released  by the  respective
vendors has not been a  significant  burden on the Company and is expected to be
completed before the end of 1999.

         The Company's assessment of Year 2000 problems in computer systems used
for facilities control,  machine control and manufacturing  testing is complete,
and remediation is on-going.  The most  significant Year 2000 issue in this area
has been found to be related to older wafer test equipment. This

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>


equipment is not expected to be in use in the year 2000.  The Company is phasing
in new  Year  2000  compliant  wafer  test  equipment  in  conjunction  with the
introduction of new generations of flash memory.

         The  Company's  assessment  of Year 2000 risks  related  to  suppliers,
customers  and other third parties is ongoing.  Inquiries  have been made of all
critical  suppliers  and an  assessment  of  their  Year  2000  readiness  is in
progress.  The Company expects to utilize the completed  assessment as the basis
for strategic  decisions regarding alternate material sourcing and/or increasing
inventory  safety stocks by the end of the second quarter of 1999.  SanDisk will
also contact its  significant  customers  regarding their Year 2000 readiness in
order  to  understand  the  potential  for any  disruptions  in  their  ordering
patterns.  Completion  of this review will depend on the  responsiveness  of the
Company's vendors and customers, over which the Company has no control.

         Year  2000 Risk  Management  Program  Costs.  The cost of the Year 2000
project  related to upgrading the Company's core management  information  system
was approximately $1.0 million, $400,000 of which was related to the purchase of
software and hardware which was capitalized by the Company. In the first quarter
of 1999,  the Company  spent  approximately  $100,000 for  application  software
upgrades.  The Company estimates it will cost an additional  $150,000 to upgrade
remaining  non-compliant  application  software  and  to  replace  non-compliant
personal computer systems. The Company would have incurred the majority of these
costs,  in spite of Year 2000 issues,  due to the need to upgrade its management
information system,  application  software and personal computers to support the
Company's  growth.  The Company's Year 2000 remediation  projects will be funded
from operating cash flows.  No material  projects have been deferred in order to
complete  the  Company's  Year 2000  assessment  and  remediation  project.  The
additional  expenses  related  to the  management  of the Year  2000  compliance
program and  completing  the  assessment of the Company's  internal and external
risks are not  expected  to be  material to the  Company's  quarterly  operating
results.

         The costs and time  schedule  for the Year 2000 problem  abatement  are
based on  management's  best estimates for the remediation of Year 2000 problems
uncovered to date. These estimates were derived utilizing numerous  assumptions,
including  that  the  most   significant  Year  2000  risks  have  already  been
identified,  that certain  resources  will continue to be available,  that third
party  plans  will be  fulfilled  and other  factors.  However,  there can be no
guarantee  that these  estimates will be achieved or that the  anticipated  time
schedule  will be met and actual  results  could  differ  materially  from those
anticipated.

         Contingency  Plans.  Specific  contingency  plans for systems that pose
significant  risk to on-going  operations are being developed under the auspices
of the Company's Year 2000 Risk Management program. Should previously undetected
Year 2000  problems  be found in other  systems,  these  systems  will either be
upgraded,  replaced,  turned off, or operated in place with manual procedures to
compensate  for  their  deficiencies.  While the  Company  believes  that  these
alternative  plans  would  be  adequate  to meet  the  Company's  needs  without
materially  impacting  its  operations,  there  can be no  assurance  that  such
alternatives  would be successful  or that the  Company's  results of operations
would not be  materially  adversely  affected  by the delays and  inefficiencies
inherent in conducting operations in this manner.

         Risks Related to Year 2000  Readiness.  Success of the  Company's  Year
2000 compliance effort depends, in part, on the success of its key suppliers and
customers in dealing with their Year 2000 issues.  The Company does not have any
control over the  remediation  efforts of its key  suppliers  and  customers and
cannot fully  determine the extent to which they have  resolved  their Year 2000
compliance issues. The Company currently  purchases several critical  components
from single or sole source vendors. While this issue is being carefully managed,
disruptions in the supply of components from any of these sole source  suppliers
due to Year 2000 issues,  could cause  delays in the  Company's  fulfillment  of
customer orders which could result in reduced or lost revenues. Furthermore, the
Company's  sales have  historically  been to a limited number of customers.  Any
disruption in the purchasing  patterns of these customers or potential customers
due to Year 2000 issues could cause a decline in the Company's  revenues.  There
can be no assurance  that the Company and its key suppliers  and customers  will
identify and  remediate  all  significant  Year 2000 problems on a timely basis.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company's

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>


insurance will cover losses from business  interruptions  arising from Year 2000
problems of the Company or its suppliers.  Year 2000 compliance  problems of the
Company's  key suppliers and customers  could  adversely  affect the  Company's,
business, financial condition and results of operations.

         The foregoing  statements  regarding the Company's  Year 2000 readiness
are based upon  management's  best  estimates  at the present  time,  which were
derived utilizing assumptions  regarding future events,  including the continued
availability  of certain  resources,  third party  modification  plans and other
factors.  There can be no guarantee  that these  estimates  will be achieved and
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.  Specific factors
that might cause such material  differences include, but are not limited to, the
availability  and cost of personnel  trained in this area, the ability to locate
and correct all relevant  computer  codes,  the nature and amount of programming
required  to upgrade  or replace  each of the  affected  programs,  the rate and
magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the Company's
external  customers  and  suppliers  in  addressing  the Year  2000  issue.  The
Company's  evaluation  is  on-going  and  it  expects  that  new  and  different
information   will  become   available  to  it  as  the  evaluation   continues.
Consequently, there is no guarantee that all material elements will be Year 2000
ready in time.


Results of Operations


    Product Revenues. SanDisk's product revenues were $35.9 million in the first
quarter of 1999, up $10.5 million or 41% from the first quarter of 1998.  During
the three months ended March 31, 1999, units shipped increased 144%. The largest
increase  in unit  volumes  came  from  sales of  CompactFlash  products,  which
represented  approximately  76% of units  shipped  and 60% of  product  revenues
compared  to 68% of units  shipped  and 45% of  product  revenues  for the first
quarter of 1998.  Average  selling  prices  declined 44% in the first quarter of
1999 compared to the same period of the prior year,  partially due to a shift in
product mix to  CompactFlash,  Flash ChipSet and  MultiMediaCard  products which
have lower  capacities and average  selling prices than the Company's  FlashDisk
products.  The Company anticipates that lower capacity products will continue to
represent a significant  portion of its sales as consumer  applications  such as
digital  cameras  become more popular.  Sales of these lower  capacity  products
generally  have lower  average  selling  prices and gross  margins  than  higher
capacity  products.  The mix of products sold varies from quarter to quarter and
may vary in the future,  affecting the Company's  overall average selling prices
and gross margins.

    The Company continues to experience limited bookings visibility as customers
continue  to  expect  short  lead-times,  particularly  in  the  growing  retail
component of the Company's  business.  A majority of the  Company's  anticipated
second  quarter  revenues,  which are  projected  to  slightly  exceed the level
achieved  in the  first  quarter,  continue  to be turns  business  with  orders
received and fulfilled in the same quarter. Due to a number of factors described
herein and in "Factors That May Affect Future Results," the Company's ability to
adjust its  operating  expenses  is limited in the short term.  As a result,  if
product revenues are lower than anticipated, the Company's results of operations
will be adversely affected.

    Export sales  represented  42% of product  revenue for the first  quarter of
1999  compared  with 46% for the same period of the previous  year.  The Company
expects  international  sales to continue to represent a significant  portion of
its  product  revenues.  In the first  quarter of 1999,  the  Company's  top ten
customers  represented  approximately  61% of product  revenue  with the top two
customers  representing a combined 31% of product revenues.  Sales to the top 10
customers represented approximately 72% of product revenues in the first quarter
of 1998.  The Company  expects that sales to a limited  number of customers will
continue to represent a substantial  portion of its revenues for the foreseeable
future.

    License and Royalty  Revenues.  The Company  currently  earns patent license
fees  and  royalties  under  six  cross-license  agreements  with  Hitachi  Ltd.
("Hitachi"),  Intel  Corporation  ("Intel"),  Samsung  Electronics  Company Ltd.
("Samsung"),   Sharp   Electronics   Corporation   ("Sharp"),   Silicon  Storage
Technology, Inc.

                                    Page 13
<PAGE>


("SST") and Toshiba Corporation  ("Toshiba").  License and royalty revenues from
patent cross-license  agreements were $8.2 million in the first quarter of 1999,
down from $8.7 million in the same period of the previous  year due primarily to
the timing of  royalties  earned  under the various  agreements.  Revenues  from
licenses and royalties  decreased to 19% of total  revenues in the first quarter
of 1999 from 25% in the first quarter of 1998.

    Gross  Profits.  In the first  quarter  of 1999,  gross  profits  were $17.6
million,  or 40% of total revenues  compared to $16.3  million,  or 48% of total
revenues in the same period of 1998.  Product gross margins  decreased to 26% of
product  revenues  from 30% in the  first  quarter  of 1998 due  primarily  to a
decline in average selling prices.

    Competition  remains strong and product gross margins are expected to remain
under pressure due to declining average selling prices. The Company is currently
working on a number of cost  reduction  programs  to  strengthen  product  gross
margins in 1999,  including the transition of manufacturing  operations for high
volume products  offshore.  However,  there can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful in these efforts.  Also, increased competition may negatively
affect gross margins in 1999.

    During the first  quarter  of 1999,  the  Company  began  shipping  customer
samples of its  CompactFlash  and FlashDisk  products  utilizing its new 128Mbit
flash chip. This design is currently  undergoing  final internal  qualification,
with full volume production expected to begin in the second quarter of 1999. The
128Mbit flash chip has a lower  manufacturing  cost per megabyte and is expected
to contribute to improved  product gross margins in the second half of 1999. The
initial  production period of each new generation of flash technology is subject
to many risks and  uncertainties as described in "Factors That May Affect Future
Results - We Face Risk in  Transitioning  to New Processes and Products."  There
can be no assurance that the Company will successfully complete the internal and
customer  qualifications  of the 128Mbit flash chips in a timely manner, or that
it will realize the expected cost reductions in the second half of 1999.

    In addition,  in the second  quarter of 1999, the Company will be moving the
high volume production of its CompactFlash cards to Celestica in South China and
the  production  of  its  MultiMediaCard   products  to  Siliconware   Precision
Industries Co. Ltd. and Siliconware  Corporation in Taiwan.  The Company expects
to incur some start up costs related to these  ventures in the second quarter of
1999,  but expects these  investments to reduce future product costs and greatly
expand  production  capacity in the second half of the year. There are many risk
and   uncertainties   involved   with  the  transfer  of   production  to  these
subcontractors as discussed in "Factors That May Affect Future Results - We Face
Risks  Associated  with Our  International  Operations  and -- We  Depend on Our
Suppliers and Third Party  Subcontractors."  Failure to successfully  manage the
transition could result in excess and/or obsolete  inventory or lower of cost or
market valuation  adjustments due to potential  duplication of certain inventory
build  plans.  There can be no  assurance  that the  Company  will  realize  the
expected  product cost reductions or that these  reductions will be large enough
to offset future average selling price declines due to increased competition.

    Research  and  Development.   Research  and  development   expenses  consist
principally of salaries and payroll related  expenses for design and development
engineers,  prototype supplies and contract  services.  Research and development
expenses  were $5.2 million in the first quarter of 1999, up $0.9 million or 20%
from $4.3 million in the same period of 1998.  The increase was primarily due to
increased  salary and related expenses and higher  nonrecurring  engineering and
project related expenses.  Research and development  expenses represented 12% of
total revenues in the first quarter of 1999 compared to 13% in the first quarter
of 1998. The Company expects  research and  development  expenses to continue to
increase in absolute  dollars to support the development and introduction of new
generations of flash data storage products.

    Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing  expenses include salaries,  sales
commissions,  benefits and travel expenses for the Company's  sales,  marketing,
customer service and  applications  engineering  personnel.  These expenses also
include other selling and marketing expenses, such as independent manufacturer's
representative  commissions,  advertising  and  tradeshow  expenses.  Sales  and
marketing

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>


expenses  were $5.2 million in the first  quarter of 1999 up $1.2 million or 31%
from $4.0 million in the first  quarter of 1998.  The increase was primarily due
to increased  salary and related  expenses,  higher  commissions  and  increased
marketing expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses represented  approximately 12%
of total  revenues  in the first  quarters  of both 1999 and 1998.  The  Company
expects sales and  marketing  expenses to increase as sales of its products grow
and as it continues to develop the retail channel for its products.

    General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses include the
cost of the Company's finance, information systems, human resources, shareholder
relations,  legal  and  administrative  functions.  General  and  administrative
expenses  were $2.4 million in the first quarter of 1999, up $0.4 million or 17%
from $2.0 million in the first  quarter of 1998.  The increase was primarily due
to  increased  salary and related  expenses and higher legal fees as a result of
patent litigation related to the Lexar suit. General and administrative expenses
represented 5% of total revenues in the first quarter of 1999 compared to 6% for
the first  quarter of 1998.  The  Company  expects  general  and  administrative
expenses to increase as the general and administrative functions grow to support
the overall  growth of the Company.  General and  administrative  expenses could
also  increase  substantially  in the future if the Company  continues to pursue
litigation to defend its patent  portfolio.  See "Factors That May Affect Future
Results  -  Risks  Associated  with  Patents,  Proprietary  Rights  and  Related
Litigation."

    Interest and Other Income,  Net.  Interest and other  income,  net, was $1.6
million  in the first  quarter  of 1999  compared  to $1.3  million in the first
quarter of 1999.  The  increase in 1998 was  primarily  due to foreign  currency
transaction gains.

    Provision  for Income  Taxes.  The Company  recorded a provision  for income
taxes at a 33% effective tax rate for the first three months of 1999 compared to
a 36%  effective tax rate for the same period of 1998.  The lower  effective tax
rate in 1999 reflects greater benefits from federal and state tax credits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    As of March 31,  1999,  the Company had working  capital of $142.6  million,
which included $15.4 million in cash and cash  equivalents and $129.6 million in
short-term  investments.  The  Company  has a line  of  credit  facility  with a
commercial  bank  under  which it can  borrow up to $10.0  million at the bank's
prime rate. This line of credit  facility  expires in July 1999. As of March 31,
1999, the Company had $1.0 million  committed  under the line of credit facility
for standby letters of credit.  The facility contains covenants that require the
Company to  maintain  certain  financial  ratios  and  levels of net worth,  and
prohibits  the  payment  of cash  dividends  to  stockholders.  The  Company  is
currently in compliance with all covenants in the line of credit agreement.  The
Company  intends to either  renew its line of credit or  negotiate a new line of
credit upon the expiration of its current line.

    Operating  activities provided $12.3 million of cash in the first quarter of
1999 primarily from net income,  an increase in accounts payable of $8.6 million
and a  reduction  in  prepaids  and other  assets of $3.3  million.  These  were
partially  offset by a  decrease  in  deferred  revenue of $6.4  million  and an
increase in accounts receivable of $3.1 million.

    Net cash used in investing  activities of $13.8 million in the first quarter
of 1999  consisted of net purchases of  investments of $10.7 million and capital
equipment  purchases and leasehold  improvements  of $3.0 million.  In the first
quarter of 1999,  cash  provided by  financing  activities  of $1.5 million came
primarily  from the sale of common stock through the Company's  stock option and
employee stock purchase plans.

    Depending on the future demand for the Company's  products,  the Company may
decide to make additional investments,  which could be substantial,  in assembly
and test manufacturing  equipment or foundry capacity to support its business in
the future. Management believes the existing cash and cash

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>


equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  available  line  of  credit  will be
sufficient  to meet the  Company's  currently  anticipated  working  capital and
capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.

Impact of Currency Exchange Rates

    A portion of the  Company's  revenues are  denominated  in Japanese Yen. The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward  contracts to hedge against changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. At March 31, 1999, one forward contract with
a  notional  amount  of $4.5  million  was  outstanding.  Future  exchange  rate
fluctuations  could have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

         Our business,  financial  condition and results of operations  could be
impacted by a number of factors including the risk factors listed below.

Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly

         Our   quarterly   and  annual   operating   results   have   fluctuated
significantly  in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in
the future. This fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors,  including the
following:

o  Unpredictable demand for our products
o  Decline in our average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures
o  Seasonality in sales of our products for consumer electronics applications
o  Changes in product and customer mix
o  Market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products
o  Changes in our distribution channels
o  Timing of license and royalty revenue recognition
o  Fluctuations in product costs, particularly due to fluctuations in 
   manufacturing yields and utilization
o  Availability of foundry capacity
o  Variations in manufacturing cycle times
o  Increased research and development expenses
o  Exchange rate fluctuations
o  Changes in general economic conditions, in particular the economic
   recession in Japan
o  Obsolescence of unsold inventory

         When we order silicon  wafers from our  foundries,  we have to estimate
the number of silicon  wafers needed to fill product  orders several months into
the future. If we overestimate  this number,  we build excess  inventories which
adversely affects our gross margins and operating results.  For example,  in the
second  quarter of 1998,  our product gross margins  declined to 12% from 30% in
the  previous  quarter due in part to a write down of this  inventory to reflect
inventory  at  net  realizable  value.   Because  our  largest  volume  product,
CompactFlash,  is sold into an emerging consumer market, it is very difficult to
accurately  forecast  future  sales.  If sales  fall  below  our  forecast,  our
operating  results  could be  adversely  affected if we are unable to reduce our
operating  expenses.  More  than 50% of our  quarterly  sales  are  from  orders
received and fulfilled in the same quarter (turns  business).  In addition,  our
product order backlog may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter.

         Due to anticipated  growth, we increased our expense levels in 1998 and
in the first  quarter of 1999.  Operating  expenses  are expected to continue to
increase  as a  result  of the  need to hire  additional  personnel  to  support
expected growth in sales unit volumes,  marketing and sales efforts and research
and  development  activities.  These expenses cannot be readily scaled back over
the short term. If revenue does

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>


not increase  proportionately to operating expenses,  or if revenues decrease or
do not meet  expectations  for a  particular  period,  our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.

         Product mix varies quarterly, which affects our overall average selling
prices and gross margins. Our CompactFlash  products,  which currently represent
the majority of our product  revenues,  have lower  average  selling  prices and
gross margins than our higher  capacity  FlashDisk and FlashDrive  products.  We
believe that sales of CompactFlash  products may become an even more significant
percentage  of our product  revenues as consumer  applications,  such as digital
cameras,  become more popular.  Dependence on CompactFlash sales,  together with
lower pricing caused by increased competition,  caused average selling prices to
decline  28% during  1998.  Average  selling  prices  declined  24% in the first
quarter of 1999 compared to the fourth quarter of 1998, partially due to a shift
in product mix to CompactFlash,  Flash ChipSet and MultiMediaCard products which
have lower  capacities and average  selling prices than the Company's  FlashDisk
products. This trend is expected to continue.

         Our intellectual  property  strategy is to cross-license our patents to
other manufacturers of flash products. Under such arrangements,  we earn license
fees and  royalties  on  individually  negotiated  terms.  The timing of revenue
recognition  from these  payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and
on the timing of product shipments by the third parties.  This may cause license
and royalty revenue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.  Because
this revenue has higher gross  margins than product  revenue,  gross margins and
net income  fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenue than with
changes in product revenue.

Our Business Depends Upon Consumer Products

         In 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, we received more product revenue
and  shipped  more  units  of  products   destined   for  consumer   electronics
applications,  principally digital cameras, than for any other applications.  We
believe that these products will encounter intense competition and be more price
sensitive than products sold into our other target markets. In addition, we must
spend more on marketing  and  promotion in consumer  markets to establish  brand
name recognition and preference.

         A significant  portion of sales to the consumer  electronics  market is
made  through  distributors  and to  retailers.  Sales  through  these  channels
typically include rights to return unsold inventory. As a result, revenue is not
recognized  until after the product has been sold to the end user. If our retail
customers are not successful in this market,  there could be substantial product
returns,  which may cause harm to our business,  financial condition and results
of operations.

Our Business Depends on Emerging Markets and New Products

          In order for demand for our  products  to grow,  the  markets  for new
products that use CompactFlash and the MultiMediaCard,  such as smart phones and
MP3 portable music players, must develop and grow. If sales of these products do
not grow, our product revenues and profit margins could level off or decline. To
remain  competitive,  we intend to develop new products  with  increased  memory
capacity at a lower cost per megabyte.  The success of this new product strategy
will depend upon, among other things, the following:

o   Our  ability  to  successfully  develop  new  products  with  higher  memory
    capacities at a lower cost per megabyte;
o   The  development of new  applications  or markets for our flash data storage
    products;  o The extent to which  prospective  customers design our products
    into their products and successfully introduce their products;
o   The  extent  to which  our  products  or  technologies  become  obsolete  or
    noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others.


                                    Page 17

         If our new  applications  or target markets fail to develop,  or if our
products are not accepted by the market, our business,  financial  condition and
results of operations could suffer.

There Is Seasonality In Our Business

         Sales of our products, in particular the sale of CompactFlash Products,
in the consumer electronics applications market are subject to seasonality. As a
result,  product sales are impacted by seasonal  purchasing patterns with higher
sales  generally  occurring  in the second  half of each year as compared to the
first half of each such year.  In addition,  in the past we have  experienced  a
decrease  in  orders  in the  first  quarter  from our  Japanese  OEM  customers
primarily due to the fact that most  customers in Japan operate on a fiscal year
ending in March and prefer to delay  purchases until the beginning of their next
fiscal  year.  For  example,  our product  revenues  were 24% lower in the first
quarter of 1998 than in the fourth quarter of 1997, mostly due to these seasonal
factors and the Asian  economic  crisis.  However,  we did not  experience  such
seasonality in the first quarter of 1999.

Our Markets Are Highly Competitive

         We compete in an industry  characterized by intense competition,  rapid
technological  changes,  evolving industry standards,  declining average selling
prices  and rapid  product  obsolescence.  Our  competitors  include  many large
domestic  and  international  companies  that have  greater  access  to  foundry
capacity,  substantially  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing  and  other
resources,   broader  product  lines  and  longer  standing  relationships  with
customers. Our primary competitors include flash chip producers such as Advanced
Micro Devices, Inc., Atmel Corporation,  Hitachi Ltd., Intel Corporation, Micron
Technology, Inc., Mitsubishi Electronic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Company
Ltd., Sharp Electronics  Corporation and Toshiba Corporation.  Other competitors
include  companies using data storage  techniques  such as socket flash,  linear
flash and system flash components, as well as package or card assemblers such as
Lexar Media,  Inc.,  M-Systems,  Inc.,  Simple  Technology  Inc.,  SMART Modular
Technologies,   Inc.,  Sony  Corporation,   Kingston  Technology  Company,   TDK
Corporation, Matsushita Battery, Inc. and Viking Components, Inc., which combine
controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards.
Approximately 25 companies have been certified by the  CompactFlash  Association
to manufacture and sell their own brand of  CompactFlash.  We believe that other
manufacturers will enter the CompactFlash market in the future.

         In  addition,  competing  products  have been  introduced  that promote
industry standards that are different from our CompactFlash  product,  including
Toshiba's Smart Media (Solid-State Floppy Disk Card), Sony Corporation's  Memory
Stick,  Panasonic's  recently  introduced  Mega  Storage  cards  and  M-Systems'
Diskonchip(TM)  for embedded storage  applications.  Each competing  standard is
mechanically  and   electronically   incompatible   with   CompactFlash.   If  a
manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer  electronic devices designs-in
one of these alternative  competing  standards,  CompactFlash will be eliminated
from use in that product.

         In November  1997,  Iomega  Corporation  announced  its Clik  drive,  a
miniaturized,  mechanical, removable disk drive, and claims that it will compete
directly with our flash card  products.  In September  1998,  IBM introduced the
microdrive,  a rotating disk drive in a type II CompactFlash format.  Initially,
this product will compete  directly with our type II CompactFlash  memory cards,
when we  introduce  these  products  in 1999,  for use in high end  professional
digital  cameras.  In October 1998,  M-Systems  introduced their Diskonchip 2000
product  which is expected  to compete  against  our Flash  ChipSet  products in
embedded storage applications.

         According to  independent  industry  analysts,  Sony's  Mavica  digital
camera  captured a considerable  portion of the United States market for digital
cameras in 1998. The Mavica uses a standard  floppy disk to store digital images
and  therefore  uses no  CompactFlash  (or any  other  flash)  cards.  Our sales
prospects for CompactFlash cards will be adversely impacted if the Mavica market
share  continues  at a high  level into the  future.  Also,  our  MultiMediaCard
products are expected to face stiff competition from

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>


Toshiba's  SmartMedia  flash cards and Sony's flash Memory  Stick.  Although the
Memory Stick is  proprietary  to Sony, if it is adopted and achieves  widespread
use in future products,  sales of our MultiMediaCard  and CompactFlash  products
may decline.

         We also face  competition  from products based on multilevel cell flash
technology  such  as  Intel's  64Mbit  flash  chip  and  Hitachi's   anticipated
introduction  of their 256Mbit flash chip.  These  products  compete with our D2
multilevel  cell flash  technology.  Multilevel  cell  flash is a  technological
innovation  that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of  information
instead of the  traditional  single bit stored by the  industry  standard  flash
technology.

         Furthermore,  we expect to face competition from existing companies and
from other  companies  that may enter our  existing or future  markets that have
similar  or  alternative  data  storage  solutions  which may be less  costly or
provide  additional  features.  Price is an important  competitive factor in the
market for consumer  products.  Increased  price  competition  could lower gross
margins if our average  selling prices decrease faster than costs and could also
result in lost sales.

         We have  entered into patent  cross-license  agreements  with  Hitachi,
Intel, Samsung,  Sharp, SST and Toshiba. Under these agreements,  each party may
manufacture and sell products that incorporate  technology  covered by the other
party's patents  related to flash memory devices.  As we continue to license our
patents to certain competitors,  competition will increase and may cause harm to
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

         Other competitive factors include:

o  Product cost, availability and performance
o  Adequate foundry capacity
o  Efficiency of production
o  Timing of our new product announcements or introductions
o  Successful protection of our intellectual property rights
o  General market and economic conditions

Our Average Sales Prices Have Declined

         In 1998, the average unit selling  prices of our products  declined 28%
compared to 1997. In the first quarter of 1999,  the average unit selling prices
of our products  declined 24%  compared to the fourth  quarter of 1998.  Because
flash data storage markets are characterized by intense  competition,  we expect
that pricing  pressures from our customers and  competitors  may increase.  This
will  likely  result  in a further  decline  in  average  sales  prices  for our
products.  We  believe  that we can offset  declining  average  sales  prices by
achieving  manufacturing  cost  reductions  and  developing  new  products  that
incorporate  advanced  features and can be sold at higher average gross margins.
However,  if we are  unable to  achieve  such cost  reductions  or remain  price
competitive,  this could result in lost sales, declining gross margins, and as a
result,  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of  operations  could
suffer.

         From  time to  time,  the  semiconductor  industry  has  experienced  a
significant  downturn and is currently beginning to recover from one of its most
severe down cycles. During most of 1998, the semiconductor  industry experienced
significant production over capacity.  This "buyers market" put margin pressures
on all flash memory  suppliers.  We believe  product  gross  margins will remain
under pressure in the first half of 1999 until the more favorable cost structure
of our 128Mbit flash chip design  begins to have a favorable  impact on the cost
per megabyte of our products.

We Face Risks Associated with Our International Operations

         Our sales are  primarily  denominated  in United States  dollars.  As a
result, if the value of the US dollar increases relative to foreign  currencies,
our products could become less competitive in international

                                    Page 19
<PAGE>


markets. For example, our products are relatively more expensive in Asia because
of the  recent  economic  conditions  in Asia  and the  weakness  of many  Asian
currencies  relative to the US dollar.  This resulted in a decrease in our sales
in that  region in 1998.  In fiscal  1998,  sales to Japan  declined to 31.6% of
total product  sales from 38.1% in 1997.  This was primarily due to the Japanese
economic  crisis and market  recession.  In the first quarter of 1999,  sales to
Japan represented 27.6% of product revenue compared to 35.0% for the same period
of 1998. If the current  market  conditions in Japan do not improve,  or if they
decline further, our results of operations may suffer.

         Currently,  all of our wafers are produced by foundries located outside
the United  States and the majority  are  purchased  in United  States  dollars.
Because we currently invoice certain customers in Japanese Yen,  fluctuations in
currencies could adversely affect our business,  financial condition and results
of operations.  Our international  business  activities could also be limited or
disrupted by any of the following:

o  The need to comply with foreign government regulation;
o  General geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability, 
   potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;
o  Imposition   of   regulatory   requirements,   tariffs,   import  and  export
   restrictions,  and other barriers and restrictions;  
o  Longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable 
   collection;  
o  Potentially adverse tax consequences; 
o  Less protection of our intellectual property rights;
o  Delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions.

         In the  second  quarter  of  1999,  we  will  begin  using  third-party
subcontractors  in  China  and  Taiwan  for  the  assembly  and  testing  of our
components.  As a  result,  our  business  could  be  harmed  by the  effect  of
political,  economic,  legal and other uncertainties in China. Under its current
leadership,  the Chinese  government has been pursuing economic reform policies,
including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic
decentralization.  The  Chinese  government  may not  continue  to  pursue  such
policies  and, even if it continued,  such policies may not be  successful.  The
Chinese government may significantly  alter these policies from time to time. In
addition,  China does not currently have a  comprehensive  and highly  developed
system of laws,  particularly  with respect to the  protection  of  intellectual
property  rights.  As a result,  enforcement  of  existing  and future  laws and
contracts is uncertain,  and the  implementation and interpretation of such laws
may be inconsistent, which could lead to piracy and degradation of the Company's
intellectual property protection among other things.

Sales to a Small Number of Customers Represent a Significant Portion of 
Our Revenues

         More than half of our revenue  comes from a small number of  customers.
For example, sales to the Company's top 10 customers accounted for approximately
59%, 67%, and 71%,  respectively,  of the Company's  product  revenues for 1998,
1997,  and 1996.  In the first  quarter of 1999,  the Company's top 10 customers
represented  approximately  61% of  product  revenue.  If we were to lose any of
these  customers  or  experience  any  material  reduction  in orders from these
customers,  our revenues  and  operating  results  would  suffer.  Our sales are
generally made by standard purchase orders rather than long-term  contracts.  In
addition,  the  composition of our major customer base changes from year to year
as the market demand for our customers' products change.

We Depend on Third Party Foundries for Silicon Wafers

         All of our products  require silicon wafers.  We rely on United Silicon
Corporation ("USC") and United Semiconductor Incorporated ("USIC") in Taiwan for
supplying  our silicon  wafers.  We depend on our  foundries  to (1)  allocate a
portion of their foundry capacity to our needs, (2) produce  acceptable  quality
wafers  with  acceptable  manufacturing  yields and (3)  deliver our wafers on a
timely basis at a competitive

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>


price. If our foundries are unable to satisfy these requirements,  our business,
financial condition and operating results may suffer.

         Under the wafer supply agreements with our foundries,  we are obligated
to provide  monthly  rolling  forecasts  for our  anticipated  wafer  purchases.
Generally, the estimates for the first three months of each forecast are binding
commitments.  The estimates  for the  remaining  months may only be changed by a
certain  percentage from the previous month's forecast.  This limits our ability
to react to  fluctuations  in demand for our products and could cause us to have
excess inventory.  In addition,  if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities
of wafers with  acceptable  price and yields  from any  foundry,  our  business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We Depend on Our Suppliers and Third Party Subcontractors

         We rely on our vendors,  some of which are sole source  suppliers,  for
several of our critical  components.  We do not have long-term supply agreements
with any of these  vendors.  Our  business,  financial  condition  and operating
results could be harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to
develop  alternative  sources  or  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  of  these
components.  For example,  we rely on Motorola,  Inc. and NEC to supply  certain
designs of critical microcontrollers.

         We also rely on third-party  subcontractors to assemble,  and sometimes
test the memory components for our products. We have no long-term contracts with
these  subcontractors  and cannot directly control product  delivery  schedules.
This could lead to product shortages or quality  assurance  problems which could
increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our
operating results.

         During the second and third  quarters of 1999,  we plan to transfer the
majority of wafer test,  packaged memory final test, card assembly and card test
to subcontractors in Taiwan and China. This increased reliance on subcontractors
is  expected  to  reduce  the  cost of such  operations  and give us  access  to
increased  production  capacity.  During the transition period, we will continue
full  operations  at our  Sunnyvale  production  facility  while  simultaneously
transferring test equipment and training  personnel of our  subcontractors.  Any
significant  problems in this  complex  transfer of  operations  may result in a
disruption  of production  and a shortage of product to meet customer  demand in
the second and third quarters of 1999.

We Face Risk in Transitioning to New Processes and Products

         Successive  generations  of  our  products  incorporate   semiconductor
devices with greater memory  capacity per chip. We are  continually  involved in
joint development  efforts with our foundries to produce  semiconductor  devices
based upon smaller geometry manufacturing  processes. Two important factors that
enable us to decrease the costs per megabyte of our flash data storage  products
are  the   development  of  higher  capacity   semiconductor   devices  and  the
implementation  of  smaller  geometry  manufacturing   processes.  A  number  of
challenges  exist in achieving a lower cost per  megabyte,  including  (1) lower
yields often associated with the early production of new semiconductor  devices,
(2) problems with design and  manufacturing  of products  that will  incorporate
these devices and (3) production  delays.  Because our products are complex,  we
periodically  experience  significant  delays  in  the  development  and  volume
production ramp up of our products. Similar delays could occur in the future and
could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

         We have  developed  new products  based on D2 flash  technology,  a new
flash  architecture  designed to store two bits in each flash  memory  cell.  We
believe that the 256Mbit D2 flash design currently in advanced development, will
help us  increase  the  capacity  and  decrease  the costs of certain  products,
enabling  us to  maintain  our  competitive  advantage  and  broaden  our target
markets.  High density flash memory,  such as D2 flash, is a complex  technology
that requires tight manufacturing controls and effective test screens.  Problems
from the shift to volume production for new flash products could impact both

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>


reliability and yields and result in increased  manufacturing  costs. We may not
be able to  manufacture  reliable  and  cost  effective  D2  flash  products  in
commercial  volumes  and with  yields  sufficient  to result in lower  costs per
megabyte.  Furthermore,  D2 flash technology needs significantly  improved write
speed so that it can be usefully applied to market  applications such as digital
cameras.  Although  the 256Mbit  design is intended to meet the  improved  write
speed requirements, it is possible that we may not be able to achieve the target
write speed in our future D2 products.

         The  MultiMediaCard  product  family  is  expected  to  undergo a rapid
production ramp during the second and third quarters of 1999. During the startup
phase, it is expected that production yields may be lower than expected, thereby
adversely impacting  MultiMediaCard  product  availability as well as increasing
manufacturing costs and reducing product margins for this product family.

We Must Achieve Acceptable Wafer Manufacturing Yields

         The  fabrication  of our products  requires  wafers to be produced in a
highly controlled and clean environment. Semiconductor companies that supply our
wafers  sometimes  have   experienced   problems   achieving   acceptable  wafer
manufacturing yields.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both
our design technology and the foundry's  manufacturing  process technology.  Low
yields may result from design errors or manufacturing  failures.  Yield problems
may not be  determined  or improved  until an actual  product is made and can be
tested.  As a result,  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are
well into the  production  process.  The risks  associated  with yields are even
greater because we rely on independent  offshore  foundries for our wafers which
increases  the effort and time  required to  identify,  communicate  and resolve
manufacturing  yield  problems.  If the  foundries  cannot  achieve  the planned
yields, it could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Risks Associated with Patents, Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation

         We rely on a combination  of patents,  trademarks,  copyright and trade
secret laws,  confidentiality  procedures and licensing  arrangements to protect
our  intellectual  property  rights.  In the  past,  we have  been  involved  in
significant disputes regarding our intellectual  property rights and claims that
we may be infringing third parties' intellectual property rights. We expect that
we may be involved in similar  disputes in the future.  We cannot assure you (1)
that any of our patents will not be invalidated, (2) that patents will be issued
for any of our pending  applications,  (3) that any claims allowed from existing
or  pending  patents  will have  sufficient  scope or  strength  or (4) that our
patents will be issued in the primary  countries  where our products are sold in
order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage. In addition, our
competitors may be able to design around our patents.

         From time to time, it may be necessary to initiate  litigation  against
third parties to preserve our intellectual  property rights. These parties could
in turn bring suit  against us. Such a situation  occurred in March of 1998.  We
filed  a  complaint  in  federal  court  against  Lexar  for  infringement  of a
fundamental  flash disk patent.  Lexar disputed this claim and asserted that our
patent was invalid or unenforceable,  as well as asserting various counterclaims
including  unfair  competition,  violation  of the Lanham  Act,  patent  misuse,
interference with prospective economic advantage, trade defamation and fraud. We
have denied all of these counterclaims. In July 1998, the federal district court
denied Lexar's request to have the case dismissed.  Discovery in this suit began
in August 1998.  On February 22, 1999,  the Federal  District  Court  considered
arguments  and papers  submitted by the parties  regarding  the scope and proper
interpretation  of the asserted claims in SanDisk's patent at issue in the Lexar
suit.  On March 4, 1999,  the Federal  District  Court  issued its ruling on the
proper construction of the claim terms in SanDisk's patent. A trial date has not
yet been set.

         We intend to vigorously  enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that
our efforts will be successful. If we were to have an adverse result in any such
litigation,  we  could  be  required  to  pay  substantial  damages,  cease  the
manufacture,  use and sale of infringing products,  expend significant resources
to develop non-infringing  technology,  discontinue the use of certain processes
or obtain licenses

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>


to the infringing technology. Any litigation is likely to result in significant
expense to us, as well as divert the  efforts of our  technical  and  management
personnel.

         If we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or
if we are  found to  infringe  on  others'  intellectual  property,  we could be
required to license  intellectual  property from a third party. We may also need
to license some of our intellectual  property to others in order to enable us to
obtain  cross-licenses  to  third  party  patents.  Currently,  we  have  patent
cross-license  agreements with Hitachi,  Intel, Samsung,  Sharp, SST and Toshiba
and we are in discussions with other companies regarding potential cross-license
agreements.  We cannot be certain  that  licenses  will be offered  when we need
them, or that the terms  offered will be  acceptable.  If we do obtain  licenses
from third parties,  we may be required to pay license fees or royalty payments.
In  addition,  if we are  unable to obtain a license  that is  necessary  to the
manufacture of our products,  we could be required to suspend the manufacture of
products or stop our foundries from using processes that may infringe the rights
of  third  parties.  We  cannot  assure  you  that we  would  be  successful  in
redesigning our products or that the necessary  licenses will be available under
reasonable terms.

         We  have  historically   agreed  to  indemnify  various  suppliers  and
customers for alleged patent  infringement.  The scope of such indemnity varies,
but may, in some instances,  include  indemnification  for damages and expenses,
including  attorney's fees. We may periodically engage in litigation as a result
of these indemnification  obligations.  We are not currently engaged in any such
indemnification  proceedings.  Our insurance policies exclude coverage for third
party claims for patent  infringement.  Any future  obligation  to indemnify our
customers or suppliers could have a negative  affect on our business,  financial
condition or results of operations.

Our Rapid Growth May Strain Our Operations

         We have periodically  experienced rapid growth,  which has placed,  and
continues to place, a significant  strain on our personnel and other  resources.
To  accommodate  this  growth,  we must  continue to  implement  and improve our
operational,  financial and  management  information  systems,  as well as hire,
train,  motivate and manage our  employees.  We have had  difficulty in the past
hiring the necessary  engineering,  sales and marketing personnel to support our
growth.  In  addition,  we must make a  significant  investment  in our existing
internal information management systems to support increased  manufacturing,  as
well  as  accounting  and  other  management  related  functions.  Our  systems,
procedures  and controls may not be adequate to support our rapid growth,  which
could in turn negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We Depend Upon Certain Key Personnel

         Our  success  greatly  depends on the  continued  contributions  of our
senior management and other key research and development,  sales,  marketing and
operations personnel, including Dr. Eli Harari, the founder, President and Chief
Executive  Officer.  Our  success  will also  depend on our  ability  to recruit
additional  highly  skilled  personnel.  We  cannot  assure  you that we will be
successful  in hiring or retaining  such key  personnel,  or that any of our key
personnel will remain employed with us.

Our Stock Price May Be Volatile

         The market price of our stock has  fluctuated in the past and is likely
to fluctuate in the future. For example, in the twelve month period ending March
31, 1999, our stock price  fluctuated  from a low of $5.125 to a high of $37.00.
We  believe  that  such  fluctuations  could  continue  as a  result  of  future
announcements  concerning us, our competitors or principal  customers  regarding
technological innovations, new product introductions,  governmental regulations,
litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts.  In addition, in recent
years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations
and the market prices of the securities of high  technology  companies have been
especially  volatile,  often for reasons  outside the control of the  particular
companies. These fluctuations as well as

                                    Page 23
<PAGE>


general economic,  political and market conditions may have an adverse affect on
the market price of our Common Stock.

Year 2000 Issues May Harm Our Business

         Many  existing  computer  systems  and  applications  may not  function
properly when using dates beyond  December 31, 1999. We have  established a Year
2000 Risk  Management  program to assess the impact that the Year 2000 issue may
have on our business.  Based on our  assessment to date, all of our flash memory
and connectivity  products are Year 2000 compliant.  Other Year 2000 issues that
we face include:

o  Assessment and remediation of the tertiary business information systems
o  Assessment and remediation of the computer systems used for facilities 
   control, machine control and manufacturing testing
o  Year 2000 compliance of our key suppliers and customers

Our estimated  total costs for Year 2000  compliance  issues are not expected to
have a material adverse affect on our business.  However, the failure of our key
suppliers and customers to take proper remedial efforts could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.  See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations-Year  2000 Readiness
Disclosure."

We Have Anti-Takeover Provisions

         We have  taken a number  of  actions  that  could  have the  effect  of
discouraging  a takeover  attempt.  For example,  we have adopted a  Shareholder
Rights Plan that would cause substantial  dilution to a stockholder who attempts
to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.  In addition, our
Certificate of Incorporation  grants the Board of Directors the authority to fix
the rights,  preferences  and privileges of and issue up to 4,000,000  shares of
Preferred  Stock  without  stockholder  action.  Although  we  have  no  present
intention to issue shares of Preferred  Stock,  such an issuance  could have the
effect of making it more  difficult  and less  attractive  for a third  party to
acquire a majority of our  outstanding  voting stock.  Preferred  Stock may also
have other  rights,  including  economic  rights senior to the Common Stock that
could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock. In
addition,  we are subject to the anti-takeover  provisions of Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law. This section provides that a corporation shall
not engage in any business  combination with any interested  stockholder  during
the  three-year  period  following  the time that such  stockholder  becomes  an
interested  stockholder.  This  provision  could have the effect of  delaying or
preventing a change of control of SanDisk.

                               SANDISK CORPORATION
                             1995 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                  AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF DECEMBER 17, 1998

                                  ARTICLE One
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS


I.       PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

         This 1995 Stock  Option Plan is intended  to promote the  interests  of
SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation,  by providing eligible persons with
the opportunity to acquire a proprietary  interest,  or otherwise increase their
proprietary  interest,  in the Corporation as an incentive for them to remain in
the service of the Corporation.

         Capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the
attached Appendix.

II.      ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

         A. The Committee shall have sole and exclusive  authority to administer
the Plan with  respect to Section 16 Insiders.  Administration  of the Plan with
respect  to all other  persons  eligible  to  participate  may,  at the  Board's
discretion,  be vested in the  Committee,  or the Board may  retain the power to
administer the Plan with respect to all such persons.

         B. Members of the Committee  shall serve for such period of time as the
Board may determine and shall be subject to removal by the Board at any time.

         C. The Plan Administrator shall, within the scope of its administrative
functions  under  the Plan,  have  full  power  and  authority  (subject  to the
provisions of the Plan) to establish  such rules and  regulations as it may deem
appropriate   for   proper   administration   of  the  Plan  and  to  make  such
determinations  under, and issue such interpretations of, the provisions of such
program and any  outstanding  options  thereunder  as it may deem  necessary  or
advisable.  Decisions  of  the  Plan  Administrator  within  the  scope  of  its
administrative  functions  under  the Plan  shall be final  and  binding  on all
parties who have an interest in the Plan or any option thereunder.

         D. Service on the Committee shall constitute service as a Board member,
and  members  of  the   Committee   shall   accordingly   be  entitled  to  full
indemnification  and reimbursement as Board members for their service. No member
of the Committee shall be liable for any act or omission made in good faith with
respect to the Plan or any option grants made under the Plan.

III.     ELIGIBILITY

         A. The persons eligible to participate in the Plan are as follows:


<PAGE>


         (i)      Employees,

         (ii)     Non-employee Board members, and

         (iii)    consultants  and  other   independent   advisors  who  provide
                  services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary).

         B. The Plan Administrator shall, within the scope of its administrative
jurisdiction  under the Plan,  have full  authority to determine  which eligible
persons are to receive option grants,  the time or times when such option grants
are to be made,  the  number of shares to be  covered  by each such  grant,  the
status of the granted  option as either an Incentive  Option or a  Non-Statutory
Option,  the time or times at which each option is to become exercisable and the
vesting  schedule (if any)  applicable to the option shares and the maximum term
for which the option is to remain outstanding.

IV.      STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

         A. The stock  issuable under the Plan shall be shares of authorized but
unissued  or  reacquired  Common  Stock,  including  shares  repurchased  by the
Corporation  on the open  market.  The maximum  number of shares of Common Stock
which may be issued over the term of the Plan shall not exceed 9,498,711 shares.
Such share reserve  includes (i) the initial  reserve of 3,498,711  shares which
reflects  the 2:3 stock split  adopted by the Board on July 25,  1995,  (ii) the
additional  increase of 2,500,000 shares authorized by the Board on February 10,
1997, and approved by the  stockholders  at the 1997 Annual Meeting and (iii) an
additional  increase of 3,500,000 shares authorized by the Board on December 17,
1998,  subject to stockholder  approval at the 1999 Annual Meeting.  The initial
authorized  share reserve was  comprised of the number of shares which  remained
available for issuance,  as of the Effective Date, under the Predecessor Plan as
last approved by the Corporation's  stockholders  prior to such date,  including
the shares subject to the outstanding options incorporated into the Plan and any
other shares which would have been  available for future option grants under the
Predecessor Plan.

         B. The number of shares of Common Stock  available  for issuance  under
the Plan shall  automatically  increase on the first trading day of January each
calendar year during the term of the Plan, beginning with calendar year 2002, by
an amount equal to four and thirty-six hundreds percent (4.36%) of the shares of
Common Stock  outstanding on the last trading day in December of the immediately
preceding  calendar year, but in no event shall any such annual  increase exceed
2,000,000 shares.

         C. No one person  participating  in the Plan may  receive  options  and
separately  exercisable stock appreciation rights for more than 1,000,000 shares
of Common Stock in the aggregate over the term of the Plan.


                                       2
<PAGE>


         D.  Shares of Common  Stock  subject to  outstanding  options  shall be
available for  subsequent  issuance under the Plan to the extent (i) the options
(including  any  options  incorporated  from the  Predecessor  Plan)  expire  or
terminate  for any reason  prior to  exercise  in full or (ii) the  options  are
cancelled in accordance with the cancellation-regrant provisions of Article Two.
In addition,  unvested shares issued under the Plan and subsequently repurchased
by the Corporation,  at the original exercise price paid per share,  pursuant to
the  Corporation's  repurchase  rights under the Plan shall be added back to the
number of shares of Common Stock  reserved for issuance under the Plan and shall
accordingly be available for reissuance  through one or more  subsequent  option
grants under the Plan. However, should the exercise price of an option under the
Plan (including any option  incorporated from the Predecessor Plan) be paid with
shares of Common Stock or should shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable under
the Plan be withheld by the Corporation in satisfaction of the withholding taxes
incurred in connection  with the exercise of an option under the Plan,  then the
number of shares of Common Stock  available for issuance under the Plan shall be
reduced by the gross number of shares for which the option is exercised, and not
by the net number of shares of Common Stock issued to the holder of such option.

         E. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock
split,  stock  dividend,  recapitalization,  combination of shares,  exchange of
shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without
the  Corporation's  receipt of consideration,  appropriate  adjustments shall be
made to (i) the maximum  number  and/or class of securities  issuable  under the
Plan,  (ii) the maximum  number  and/or class of  securities  by which the share
reserve  is to  increase  automatically  each  calendar  year  pursuant  to  the
provisions of Section IV.B of this Article One, (iii) the number and/or class of
securities  for which any one  person  may be  granted  options  and  separately
exercisable  stock  appreciation  rights  over the term of the Plan and (iv) the
number  and/or class of  securities  and the exercise  price per share in effect
under  each  outstanding  option  (including  any option  incorporated  from the
Predecessor  Plan) in order to prevent the dilution or  enlargement  of benefits
thereunder. The adjustments determined by the Plan Administrator shall be final,
binding and conclusive.

                                  ARTICLE TWO
                              OPTION GRANT PROGRAM


I.       OPTION TERMS

         Each option  shall be  evidenced  by one or more  documents in the form
approved by the Plan Administrator;  provided,  however, that each such document
shall  comply  with the terms  specified  below.  Each  document  evidencing  an
Incentive  Option shall,  in addition,  be subject to the provisions of the Plan
applicable to such options.

         A. Exercise Price.

                  1. The  exercise  price per  share  shall be fixed by the Plan
Administrator  but shall not be less than eighty-five  percent (85%) of the Fair
Market Value per share of Common Stock on the option grant date.


                  2.  The  exercise  price  shall  become  immediately  due upon
exercise  of the  option and shall,  subject to the  provisions  of Section I of
Article Three and the documents evidencing the option, be payable in one or more
of the forms specified below:

                  (i)      cash or check made payable to the Corporation,

                  (ii)     shares of Common Stock held for the requisite  period
                           necessary  to  avoid a  charge  to the  Corporation's
                           earnings for financial  reporting purposes and valued
                           at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date, or

                  (iii)    to the  extent  the  option is  exercised  for vested
                           shares,   through  a  special  sale  and   remittance
                           procedure   pursuant  to  which  the  Optionee  shall
                           concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions
                           to (a) a  Corporation-designated  brokerage  firm  to
                           effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and
                           remit to the  Corporation,  out of the sale  proceeds
                           available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to
                           cover the  aggregate  exercise  price payable for the
                           purchased shares plus all applicable  Federal,  state
                           and local income and employment  taxes required to be
                           withheld  by  the   Corporation  by  reason  of  such
                           exercise  and  (b) the  Corporation  to  deliver  the
                           certificates  for the  purchased  shares  directly to
                           such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale.

         Except to the extent such sale and  remittance  procedure  is utilized,
payment  of the  exercise  price for the  purchased  shares  must be made on the
Exercise Date.

         B. Exercise and Term of Options.  Each option shall be  exercisable  at
such time or times, during such period and for such number of shares as shall be
determined by the Plan  Administrator and set forth in the documents  evidencing
the  option.  However,  no option  shall have a term in excess of ten (10) years
measured from the option grant date.


                                       4

         C. Effect of Termination of Service.

                  1. The following  provisions  shall govern the exercise of any
options held by the Optionee at the time of cessation of Service or death:

                  (i)      Any option  outstanding at the time of the Optionee's
                           cessation  of  Service  for any reason  shall  remain
                           exercisable  for such  period of time  thereafter  as
                           shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and set
                           forth in the documents  evidencing the option, but no
                           such option shall be exercisable after the expiration
                           of the option term.

                  (ii)     Any  option  exercisable  in  whole or in part by the
                           Optionee  at the  time of death  may be  subsequently
                           exercised  by  the  personal  representative  of  the
                           Optionee's estate or by the person or persons to whom
                           the option is transferred  pursuant to the Optionee's
                           will or in  accordance  with the laws of descent  and
                           distribution.

                  (iii)    During the applicable  post-Service  exercise period,
                           the option may not be exercised in the  aggregate for
                           more than the  number of vested  shares for which the
                           option is  exercisable  on the date of the Optionee's
                           cessation  of  Service.  Upon the  expiration  of the
                           applicable  exercise  period or (if earlier) upon the
                           expiration  of the  option  term,  the  option  shall
                           terminate and cease to be outstanding  for any vested
                           shares for which the  option has not been  exercised.
                           However,  the  option  shall,  immediately  upon  the
                           Optionee's cessation of Service,  terminate and cease
                           to be outstanding to the extent it is not exercisable
                           for vested  shares on the date of such  cessation  of
                           Service.

                  (iv)     Should  the  Optionee's  Service  be  terminated  for
                           Misconduct,  then all outstanding options held by the
                           Optionee shall terminate  immediately and cease to be
                           outstanding.

                  2.  The  Plan   Administrator   shall  have  the   discretion,
exercisable  either at the time an option is  granted  or at any time  while the
option remains outstanding, to:

                  (i)      extend  the period of time for which the option is to
                           remain exercisable following the Optionee's cessation
                           of Service  from the period  otherwise  in effect for
                           that  option  to such  greater  period of time as the
                           Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate,  but in no
                           event  beyond  the  expiration  of the  option  term,
                           and/or

                  (ii)     permit  the  option  to  be  exercised,   during  the
                           applicable  post-Service  exercise  period,  not only
                           with respect to the number of vested shares of Common
                           Stock for which  such  option is  exercisable  at the
                           time of the Optionee's  cessation of Service but also
                           with respect to one or more  additional  installments
                           in which the  Optionee  would have  vested  under the
                           option had the Optionee continued in Service.

         D.  Stockholder   Rights.  The  holder  of  an  option  shall  have  no
stockholder  rights with respect to the shares  subject to the option until such
person shall have  exercised  the option,  paid the exercise  price and become a
holder of record of the purchased shares.


                                       5

         E. Repurchase Rights. The Plan Administrator  shall have the discretion
to grant  options  which are  exercisable  for unvested  shares of Common Stock.
Should the Optionee  cease  Service  while  holding such  unvested  shares,  the
Corporation  shall have the right to repurchase,  at the exercise price paid per
share, any or all of those unvested shares. The terms upon which such repurchase
right shall be exercisable  (including the period and procedure for exercise and
the appropriate  vesting schedule for the purchased shares) shall be established
by the  Plan  Administrator  and  set  forth  in the  document  evidencing  such
repurchase right.

         F.  Limited  Transferability  of  Options.  During the  lifetime of the
Optionee,  Incentive Options shall be exercisable only by the Optionee and shall
not be assignable or  transferable  other than by will or by the laws of descent
and distribution following the Optionee's death. However, a Non-Statutory Option
may, in connection  with the Optionee's  estate plan, be assigned in whole or in
part during the  Optionee's  lifetime to one or more  members of the  Optionee's
immediate  family  or to a trust  established  exclusively  for one or more such
family  members.  The  assigned  portion may only be  exercised by the person or
persons  who  acquire a  proprietary  interest  in the  option  pursuant  to the
assignment.  The terms  applicable to the assigned  portion shall be the same as
those in effect for the option immediately prior to such assignment and shall be
set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Plan Administrator may
deem appropriate.

II.      INCENTIVE OPTIONS

         The terms specified below shall be applicable to all Incentive Options.
Except as modified by the  provisions of this Section II, all the  provisions of
the  Plan  shall  be  applicable  to  Incentive   Options.   Options  which  are
specifically  designated  as  Non-Statutory  Options  when issued under the Plan
shall not be subject to the terms of this Section II.

         A. Eligibility. Incentive Options may only be granted to Employees.

         B. Exercise Price.  The exercise price per share shall not be less than
one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on
the option grant date.

         C. Dollar Limitation.  The aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of
Common Stock  (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) for which
one or more options  granted to any Employee under the Plan (or any other option
plan of the  Corporation  or any  Parent or  Subsidiary)  may for the first time
become  exercisable as Incentive  Options during any one (1) calendar year shall
not exceed the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). To the extent the
Employee  holds two (2) or more such options  which become  exercisable  for the
first  time  in  the  same  calendar  year,  the  foregoing  limitation  on  the
exercisability  of such  options as  Incentive  Options  shall be applied on the
basis of the order in which such options are granted.

         D. 10%  Stockholder.  If any  Employee to whom an  Incentive  Option is
granted is a 10%  Stockholder,  then the  exercise  price per share shall not be
less than one hundred ten percent  (110%) of the Fair Market  Value per share of
Common Stock on the option grant date, and the option term shall not exceed five
(5) years measured from the option grant date.

III.     CORPORATE TRANSACTION/CHANGE IN CONTROL

         A. In the event of any Corporate  Transaction,  each outstanding option
shall automatically accelerate so that each such option shall, immediately prior
to the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, become fully exercisable for
all of the shares of Common  Stock at the time subject to such option and may be
exercised for any or all of those shares as fully-vested shares of Common Stock.
However, an outstanding option shall not so accelerate if and to the extent: (i)
such  option is, in  connection  with the  Corporate  Transaction,  either to be
assumed by the successor  corporation (or parent thereof) or to be replaced with
a comparable  option to purchase  shares of the capital  stock of the  successor
corporation (or parent thereof),  (ii) such option is to be replaced with a cash
incentive  program  of the  successor  corporation  which  preserves  the spread
existing on the unvested option shares at the time of the Corporate  Transaction
and provides for subsequent  payout in accordance with the same vesting schedule
applicable to such option or (iii) the acceleration of such option is subject to
other  limitations  imposed by the Plan  Administrator at the time of the option
grant. The determination of option comparability under clause (i) above shall be
made by the Plan Administrator,  and its determination  shall be final,  binding
and conclusive.

         B.   All   outstanding   repurchase   rights   shall   also   terminate
automatically, and the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights
shall  immediately  vest in full,  in the  event of any  Corporate  Transaction,
except to the  extent:  (i) those  repurchase  rights are to be  assigned to the
successor  corporation  (or parent  thereof) in connection  with such  Corporate
Transaction or (ii) such accelerated  vesting is precluded by other  limitations
imposed by the Plan Administrator at the time the repurchase right is issued.

         C. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion, exercisable either
at the time the  option  is  granted  or at any time  while the  option  remains
outstanding,   to  provide  for  the  automatic  acceleration  of  one  or  more
outstanding  options (and the automatic  termination of one or more  outstanding
repurchase  rights  with the  immediate  vesting of the  shares of Common  Stock
subject to those rights) upon the occurrence of a Corporate Transaction, whether
or not those options are to be assumed or replaced (or those  repurchase  rights
are to be assigned) in the
Corporate Transaction.

         D. Immediately following the consummation of the Corporate Transaction,
all outstanding  options shall terminate and cease to be outstanding,  except to
the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof).

         E.  Each  option  which  is  assumed  in  connection  with a  Corporate
Transaction  shall be appropriately  adjusted,  immediately after such Corporate
Transaction,  to apply to the number and class of  securities  which  would have
been issuable to the Optionee in consummation of such Corporate  Transaction had
the option  been  exercised  immediately  prior to such  Corporate  Transaction.
Appropriate  adjustments  shall  also be made to (i) the  number  and  class  of
securities  available  for issuance  under the Plan on both an aggregate and per
Optionee basis following the consummation of such Corporate Transaction and (ii)
the exercise price payable per share under each outstanding option, provided the
aggregate exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same.


                                       7
<PAGE>


         F.  Any  options  which  are  assumed  or  replaced  in  the  Corporate
Transaction and do not otherwise  accelerate at that time,  shall  automatically
accelerate (and any of the Corporation's  outstanding repurchase rights which do
not  otherwise  terminate  at  the  time  of  the  Corporate  Transaction  shall
automatically  terminate  and the  shares  of  Common  Stock  subject  to  those
terminated  rights shall  immediately  vest in full) in the event the Optionee's
Service should  subsequently  terminate by reason of an Involuntary  Termination
within  twelve  (12)  months  following  the  effective  date of such  Corporate
Transaction.   Any  options  so  accelerated   shall  remain   exercisable   for
fully-vested  shares until the earlier of (i) the  expiration of the option term
or (ii) the  expiration of the one (1)-year  period  measured from the effective
date of the Involuntary Termination.

         G. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion, exercisable either
at the time the  option  is  granted  or at any time  while the  option  remains
outstanding,  to (i)  provide  for  the  automatic  acceleration  of one or more
outstanding  options (and the automatic  termination of one or more  outstanding
repurchase  rights  with the  immediate  vesting of the  shares of Common  Stock
subject  to those  rights)  upon the  occurrence  of a Change in Control or (ii)
condition any such option  acceleration  (and the termination of any outstanding
repurchase rights) upon the subsequent Involuntary Termination of the Optionee's
Service within a specified period following the effective date of such Change in
Control.  Any options  accelerated in connection  with a Change in Control shall
remain fully  exercisable  until the  expiration  or sooner  termination  of the
option term.

         H. The portion of any Incentive Option accelerated in connection with a
Corporate  Transaction  or Change in  Control  shall  remain  exercisable  as an
Incentive  Option only to the extent the applicable One Hundred  Thousand Dollar
limitation  is not exceeded.  To the extent such dollar  limitation is exceeded,
the  accelerated  portion of such option shall be exercisable as a Non-Statutory
Option under the Federal tax laws.

         I. The grant of options  under the Option Grant Program shall in no way
affect  the  right of the  Corporation  to  adjust,  reclassify,  reorganize  or
otherwise  change its capital or business  structure  or to merge,  consolidate,
dissolve,  liquidate  or sell or  transfer  all or any part of its  business  or
assets.

IV.      CANCELLATION AND REGRANT OF OPTIONS

         The Plan Administrator  shall have the authority to effect, at any time
and from time to time,  with the consent of the  affected  option  holders,  the
cancellation  of any or all  outstanding  options under the Option Grant Program
(including  outstanding  options  incorporated from the Predecessor Plan) and to
grant in  substitution  new options  covering  the same or  different  number of
shares of Common  Stock but with an  exercise  price per share based on the Fair
Market Value per share of Common Stock on the new option grant date.

V.       STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

         A. The Plan Administrator  shall have full power and authority to grant
to selected  Optionees  tandem stock  appreciation  rights and/or  limited stock
appreciation rights.

         B. The  following  terms shall  govern the grant and exercise of tandem
stock appreciation rights:

         (i)      One or more  Optionees  may be granted the right,  exercisable
                  upon such terms as the Plan  Administrator  may establish,  to
                  elect between the exercise of the underlying option for shares
                  of Common  Stock and the  surrender of that option in exchange
                  for a distribution  from the Corporation in an amount equal to
                  the  excess  of (A) the  Fair  Market  Value  (on  the  option
                  surrender  date) of the number of shares in which the Optionee
                  is at  the  time  vested  under  the  surrendered  option  (or
                  surrendered  portion thereof) over (B) the aggregate  exercise
                  price payable for such shares.

         (ii)     No such  option  surrender  shall be  effective  unless  it is
                  approved by the Plan  Administrator.  If the  surrender  is so
                  approved, then the distribution to which the Optionee shall be
                  entitled  may be made in shares of Common Stock valued at Fair
                  Market Value on the option  surrender date, in cash, or partly
                  in shares and partly in cash, as the Plan Administrator  shall
                  in its sole discretion deem appropriate.

         (iii)    If  the  surrender  of an  option  is  rejected  by  the  Plan
                  Administrator,  then the Optionee shall retain whatever rights
                  the Optionee had under the surrendered  option (or surrendered
                  portion thereof) on the option surrender date and may exercise
                  such  rights  at any time  prior to the  later of (A) five (5)
                  business days after the receipt of the rejection notice or (B)
                  the last day on which the option is otherwise  exercisable  in
                  accordance  with the terms of the  documents  evidencing  such
                  option, but in no event may such rights be exercised more than
                  ten (10) years after the option grant date.

         C. The  following  terms shall govern the grant and exercise of limited
stock appreciation rights:

         (i)      One or more Section 16 Insiders may be granted  limited  stock
                  appreciation rights with respect to their outstanding options.

         (ii)     Upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Hostile  Take-Over,   each  such
                  individual  holding  one or more  options  with such a limited
                  stock  appreciation  right shall have the unconditional  right
                  (exercisable  for a  thirty  (30)-day  period  following  such
                  Hostile  Take-Over)  to  surrender  each  such  option  to the
                  Corporation,   to  the  extent  the  option  is  at  the  time
                  exercisable  for vested shares of Common Stock.  In return for
                  the  surrendered  option,  the Optionee  shall  receive a cash
                  distribution  from the  Corporation  in an amount equal to the
                  excess  of (A) the  Take-Over  Price of the  shares  of Common
                  Stock  which are at the time  vested  under  each  surrendered
                  option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (B) the aggregate
                  exercise price payable for such shares. Such cash distribution
                  shall  be paid  within  five  (5) days  following  the  option
                  surrender date.


                                       9
<PAGE>


         (iii)    The  Plan  Administrator  shall  pre-approve,  at the time the
                  limited  right is  granted,  the  subsequent  exercise of that
                  right in  accordance  with  the  terms  of the  grant  and the
                  provisions of this Section V.C. No additional  approval of the
                  Plan  Administrator or the Board shall be required at the time
                  of the actual option surrender and cash distribution.

         (iv)     The  balance of the option  (if any)  shall  continue  in full
                  force and effect in accordance  with the documents  evidencing
                  such option.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS


I.       FINANCING

         A. The Plan  Administrator  may permit any  Optionee  to pay the option
exercise  price  by  delivering  a  promissory  note  payable  in  one  or  more
installments. The terms of any such promissory note (including the interest rate
and the terms of repayment)  shall be established by the Plan  Administrator  in
its sole discretion. Promissory notes may be authorized with or without security
or collateral.  In all events,  the maximum credit available to the Optionee may
not exceed the sum of (i) the aggregate  option  exercise  price payable for the
purchased  shares plus (ii) any Federal,  state and local income and  employment
tax liability incurred by the Optionee in connection with the option exercise.

         B. The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, determine that one or
more such promissory notes shall be subject to forgiveness by the Corporation in
whole or in part upon such terms as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate.

II.      TAX WITHHOLDING

         A. The Corporation's  obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock upon
the  exercise of options or stock  appreciation  rights  under the Plan shall be
subject to the  satisfaction of all applicable  Federal,  state and local income
and employment tax withholding requirements.

         B. The Plan  Administrator  may, in its discretion,  provide any or all
holders of Non-Statutory Options with the right to use shares of Common Stock in
satisfaction of all or part of the  Withholding  Taxes to which such holders may
be subject in connection  with the exercise of their options.  Such right may be
provided to any such holder in either or both of the following formats:

         (i)      Stock  Withholding:  The  election  to  have  the  Corporation
                  withhold,  from the shares of Common Stock otherwise  issuable
                  upon the exercise of such  Non-Statutory  Option, a portion of
                  those shares with an aggregate  Fair Market Value equal to the
                  percentage of the Withholding Taxes (not to exceed one hundred
                  percent (100%)) designated by the holder.

         (ii)     Stock Delivery: The election to deliver to the Corporation, at
                  the time the  Non-Statutory  Option is exercised,  one or more
                  shares of Common  Stock  previously  acquired  by such  holder
                  (other than in connection with the option exercise  triggering
                  the  Withholding  Taxes) with an  aggregate  Fair Market Value
                  equal  to the  percentage  of the  Withholding  Taxes  (not to
                  exceed one hundred percent (100%)) designated by the holder.

III.     EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF THE PLAN

         A. The Plan became  effective  on the November 7, 1995  Effective  Date
after adoption by the Board on July 25, 1995, and approval by the  Corporation's
stockholders in August 1995.

         B. The Plan was  amended  on  February  10,  1997 (the  "February  1997
Amendment") to effect the following  changes:  (i) increase the number of shares
of  Common  Stock  authorized  for  issuance  over  the  term of the  Plan by an
additional 2,500,000 shares, (ii) render the non-employee Board members eligible
to receive  option  grants under the Plan,  (iii) allow  unvested  shares issued
under the Plan and  subsequently  repurchased  by the  Corporation at the option
exercise  price paid per share to be  reissued  under the Plan and (iv) effect a
series  of  technical  changes  to the  provisions  of the Plan  (including  the
stockholder  approval  requirements)  in order to take  advantage  of the recent
amendments  to Rule 16b-3 of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 which exempts
certain  officer and director  transactions  under the Plan from the short-swing
liability provisions of the Federal securities laws. The February 1997 Amendment
was  approved at the 1997 Annual  Meeting.  All option  grants made prior to the
February 1997 Amendment  shall remain  outstanding in accordance  with the terms
and  conditions  of the  respective  instruments  evidencing  those  options  or
issuances,  and nothing in the February 1997 Amendment shall be deemed to modify
or in any way  affect  those  outstanding  options  or  issuances.  The Plan was
amended on  December  17, 1998 (the  "December  1998  Amendment")  to effect the
following changes:  (i) increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized
for issuance  over the term of the Plan by an  additional  3,500,000  shares and
(ii)  implement  the  automatic  share  increase  provisions  of Section IV.B of
Article One. The December 1998 Amendment is subject to  stockholder  approval at
the  1999  Annual  Meeting  and  no  option  grants  made  on the  basis  of the
3,500,000-share  increase  authorized by that amendment shall become exercisable
in whole or in part unless and until the December 1998  Amendment is approved by
the stockholders.  Should such stockholder  approval not be obtained at the 1999
Annual  Meeting,  then each option  grant made  pursuant to the  3,500,000-share
increase  authorized by the December 1998 Amendment shall terminate and cease to
remain  outstanding,  and no further option grants shall be made on the basis of
that share increase, and the automatic share increase provisions of Section IV.B
of Article One shall not be implemented.  Subject to the foregoing  limitations,
options may be granted  under the Plan at any time before the date fixed  herein
for the termination of the Plan.

         C. The Plan shall serve as the successor to the  Predecessor  Plan, and
no further  option  grants  shall be made under the  Predecessor  Plan after the
Effective Date. All options  outstanding  under the Predecessor  Plan as of such
date  shall,  immediately  upon  approval  of  the  Plan  by  the  Corporation's
stockholders,  be incorporated into the Plan and treated as outstanding  options
under the Plan. However,  each outstanding option so incorporated shall continue
to be governed solely by the terms of the documents  evidencing such option, and
no  provision  of the Plan  shall be deemed to affect or  otherwise  modify  the
rights or obligations of the holders of such  incorporated  options with respect
to their acquisition of shares of Common Stock.

                                       12
<PAGE>


         D. The  provisions  of the Plan  (including,  without  limitation,  the
option/vesting  acceleration  provisions  of Article Two  relating to  Corporate
Transactions   and  Changes  in  Control)  may,  in  the  Plan   Administrator's
discretion, be extended to one or more options incorporated from the Predecessor
Plan which do not otherwise provide for such acceleration.

         E. The Plan shall  terminate  upon the  earliest of (i) July 24,  2005,
(ii) the date on which all shares  available  for  issuance  under the Plan have
been issued  pursuant to the exercise of the options under the Plan or (iii) the
termination  of  all   outstanding   options  in  connection  with  a  Corporate
Transaction.  Upon such Plan termination,  all options  outstanding on such date
shall  thereafter  continue  to have  force and  effect in  accordance  with the
provisions of the documents evidencing such options.

IV.      AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN

         A. The Board shall have complete and  exclusive  power and authority to
amend or modify the Plan in any or all respects.  However,  no such amendment or
modification  shall adversely  affect the rights and obligations with respect to
options  or stock  appreciation  rights at the time  outstanding  under the Plan
unless the Optionee  consents to such  amendment or  modification.  In addition,
certain  amendments  may  require   stockholder   approval  in  accordance  with
applicable laws and regulations.

         B.  Options to purchase  shares of Common Stock may be granted that are
in excess of the number of shares then  available  for issuance  under the Plan,
provided any excess shares actually issued are held in escrow until  stockholder
approval of an amendment sufficiently  increasing the number of shares of Common
Stock  available for issuance  under the Plan is obtained.  If such  stockholder
approval is not obtained within twelve (12) months after the date the first such
excess issuances are made, then (i) any unexercised options granted on the basis
of such excess shares shall  terminate and cease to be outstanding  and (ii) the
Corporation  shall promptly  refund to the Optionees the exercise price paid for
any  excess  shares  issued  under the Plan and held in  escrow,  together  with
interest (at the  applicable  Short Term Federal Rate) for the period the shares
were held in escrow, and such shares shall thereupon be automatically  cancelled
and cease to be outstanding.

V.       USE OF PROCEEDS

         Any cash proceeds  received by the Corporation  from the sale of shares
of Common Stock under the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.

VI.      REGULATORY APPROVALS

         A. The  implementation of the Plan, the granting of any option or stock
appreciation right under the Plan and the issuance of any shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise of any option or stock  appreciation right shall be subject to
the  Corporation's   procurement  of  all  approvals  and  permits  required  by
regulatory  authorities having jurisdiction over the Plan, the options and stock

                               SANDISK CORPORATION

                  1995 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK OPTION PLAN

                  AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF DECEMBER 17, 1998


                                  ARTICLE One
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

I.       PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

         This 1995  Non-Employee  Directors  Stock  Option  Plan is  intended to
promote  the  interests  of  SanDisk  Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation,  by
providing the non-employee  members of the Board with the opportunity to acquire
a proprietary interest, or otherwise increase their proprietary interest, in the
Corporation  as  an  incentive  for  them  to  remain  in  the  service  of  the
Corporation.

         Capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such
terms in the attached Appendix.

II.      ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

         The terms of each option grant (including the timing and pricing of the
option grant) shall be determined by the express terms of the Plan,  and neither
the Board  nor any  committee  of the Board  shall  exercise  any  discretionary
functions with respect to option grants made pursuant to the Plan.

III.     ELIGIBILITY

         The individuals  eligible to receive option grants under the Plan shall
be (i) those  individuals who are serving as  non-employee  Board members on the
Effective  Date or who are first  elected or  appointed  as  non-employee  Board
members on or after  such  date,  whether  through  appointment  by the Board or
election  by the  Corporation's  stockholders,  and (ii) those  individuals  who
continue  to  serve as  non-employee  Board  members  after  one or more  Annual
Stockholders  Meetings  beginning with the 1996 Annual  Meeting.  A non-employee
Board member who has previously  been in the employ of the  Corporation  (or any
Parent or Subsidiary) shall not be eligible to receive an option grant under the
Plan on the Effective Date or at the time he or she first becomes a non-employee
Board member,  but shall be eligible to receive periodic option grants under the
Plan upon his or her continued service as a non-employee  Board member following
one or more Annual Stockholders Meetings.



<PAGE>


IV.      STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

         A. The stock  issuable under the Plan shall be shares of authorized but
unissued  or  reacquired  Common  Stock,  including  shares  repurchased  by the
Corporation  on the open  market.  The maximum  number of shares of Common Stock
which may be issued over the term of the Plan shall not exceed 400,000  shares.1
Such share  reserve  includes (i) the initial  share  reserve of 150,000  shares
approved by the  stockholders  in August 1995,  (ii) an additional  50,000 share
increase  authorized  by  the  Board  on  February  10,  1997  and  approved  by
stockholders  at the 1997 Annual  Stockholders  Meeting and (iii) an  additional
200,000 share increase  authorized by the Board on December 17, 1998, subject to
stockholder approval at the 1999 Annual Meeting. No shares of Common Stock shall
become  exercisable  under the Plan on the basis of the 200,000-  share increase
unless that increase is approved by the stockholders at the 1999 Annual Meeting.

         B. The number of shares of Common Stock  available  for issuance  under
the Plan shall  automatically  increase on the first trading day of January each
calendar year during the term of the Plan, beginning with calendar year 2002, by
an amount  equal to two  tenths of one  percent  (0.2%) of the  shares of Common
Stock  outstanding  on the  last  trading  day in  December  of the  immediately
preceding  calendar year, but in no event shall any such annual  increase exceed
75,000 shares.

         C.  Shares of Common  Stock  subject to  outstanding  options  shall be
available  for  subsequent  issuance  under the Plan to the extent  the  options
expire or  terminate  for any reason  prior to  exercise in full.  In  addition,
unvested  shares  issued  under  the Plan and  subsequently  repurchased  by the
Corporation,  at the  original  exercise  price paid per share,  pursuant to the
Corporation's repurchase rights under the Plan shall be added back to the number
of  shares  of  Common  Stock  reserved  for  issuance  under the Plan and shall
accordingly be available for reissuance  through one or more  subsequent  option
grants under the Plan. However,  shares subject to any option or portion thereof
surrendered  in  accordance  with Article Two shall reduce on a  share-for-share
basis the number of shares of Common Stock  available  for  subsequent  issuance
under the Plan.  Should the  exercise  price of an option under the Plan be paid
with shares of Common Stock, then the number of shares of Common Stock available
for  issuance  under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for
which the  option is  exercised,  and not by the net  number of shares of Common
Stock issued to the holder of such option.

         D. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock
split,  stock  dividend,  recapitalization,  combination of shares,  exchange of
shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without
the  Corporation's  receipt of consideration,  appropriate  adjustments shall be
made to (i) the maximum  number  and/or class of securities  issuable  under the
Plan,  (ii) the maximum  number  and/or class of  securities  by which the share
reserve is to increase each calendar year pursuant to the  provisions of Section
IV.B of this Article One,  (iii) the number and/or class of securities for which
option grants are to be

- -------------------------

  July 25, 1995.

subsequently  made per  Eligible  Director  and (iv) the number  and/or class of
securities  and the exercise  price per share in effect  under each  outstanding
option in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement  of benefits  thereunder.
The adjustments to the outstanding  options shall be made by the Board and shall
be final, binding and conclusive.

the Board on December  17,  1998,  subject to  stockholder  approval at the 1999
Annual  Meeting.   Stockholder  approval  of  such  amendment  shall  constitute

this Article Two and the subsequent  exercise of that option in accordance  with
such provisions.

standing  for  re-election  as  a  Board  member  at  that  Annual  Meeting,   a
Non-Statutory  Option to purchase an  additional  8,000 shares of Common  Stock,
provided such individual has served as a non-employee  Board member for at least
six (6) months prior to the date of such Annual Meeting. There shall be no limit

option and shall be payable in one or more of the forms specified below:

         (i)      cash or check made payable to the Corporation,

         (ii)     shares of Common Stock held for the requisite period necessary

                  Exercise Date, or

         (iii)    to the  extent  the option is  exercised  for  vested  shares,
                  through a special sale and  remittance  procedure  pursuant to
                  which the  Optionee  shall  concurrently  provide  irrevocable
                  written instructions to (A) a Corporation-designated brokerage
                  firm to effect the immediate sale of the purchased  shares and
                  remit to the Corporation,  out of the sale proceeds  available
                  on  the  settlement  date,   sufficient  funds  to  cover  the
                  aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased shares plus

                  brokerage firm in order to complete the sale.

                  Except to the extent  such sale and  remittance  procedure  is
utilized, payment of the exercise price for the purchased shares must be made on

         C.  Option  Term.  Each  option  shall  have a term of ten  (10)  years
measured from the option grant date. 

         D.  Exercise and Vesting of Options.  Each option shall be  immediately
exercisable for any or all of the option shares.  However,  any shares purchased
under the option  shall be  subject to  repurchase  by the  Corporation,  at the
exercise price paid per share,  upon the  Optionee's  cessation of Board service
prior to vesting  in those  shares.  Each  initial  grant  shall  vest,  and the
Corporation's  repurchase  right shall lapse,  in a series of four (4) equal and
successive  annual  installments over the Optionee's period of continued service
as a Board member,  with the first such  installment to vest upon the Optionee's
completion of one (1) year of Board service measured from the option grant date.
Each annual  grant  shall vest,  and the  Corporation's  repurchase  right shall
lapse, upon the Optionee's  completion of one (1) year of Board service measured
from the option grant date.

         E. Effect of  Termination of Board  Service.  The following  provisions
shall  govern the  exercise of any options  held by the Optionee at the time the
Optionee ceases to serve as a Board member:

         (i)      The  Optionee  (or,  in the  event of  Optionee's  death,  the
                  personal representative of the Optionee's estate or the person
                  or persons to whom the option is  transferred  pursuant to the
                  Optionee's  will or in accordance with the laws of descent and
                  distribution)  shall have a twelve (12)-month period following
                  the  date of such  cessation  of  Board  service  in  which to
                  exercise each such option.

         (ii)     During the twelve (12)-month  exercise period,  the option may
                  not be exercised in the  aggregate for more than the number of
                  vested shares for which the option is  exercisable at the time
                  of the Optionee's cessation of Board service.

         (iii)    Should the Optionee cease to serve as a Board member by reason
                  of death or Permanent Disability,  then all shares at the time
                  subject  to the  option  shall  immediately  vest so that such
                  option  may,  during the  twelve  (12)-month  exercise  period
                  following such  cessation of Board  service,  be exercised for
                  all or any portion of such shares as fully-vested shares.


                                       5
<PAGE>


         (iv)     In no event  shall the  option  remain  exercisable  after the
                  expiration  of the option  term.  Upon the  expiration  of the
                  twelve  (12)-month  exercise  period or (if earlier)  upon the
                  expiration of the option term, the option shall  terminate and
                  cease to be  outstanding  for any vested  shares for which the
                  option has not been  exercised.  However,  the  option  shall,
                  immediately  upon the  Optionee's  cessation of Board service,
                  terminate and cease to be  outstanding to the extent it is not
                  exercisable for vested shares on the date of such cessation of
                  Board service.

         F.  Stockholder   Rights.  The  holder  of  an  option  shall  have  no
stockholder  rights with respect to the shares  subject to the option until such
person shall have  exercised  the option,  paid the exercise  price and become a
holder of record of the purchased shares.

         G. Limited  Transferability  of Options.  An automatic  option  granted
under the Plan may, in connection  with the Optionee's  estate plan, be assigned
in whole or in part during the Optionee's lifetime to one or more members of the
Optionee's  immediate  family or to a trust  established  exclusively for one or
more such family  members.  The  assigned  portion may only be  exercised by the
person or persons who acquire a proprietary  interest in the option  pursuant to
the assignment.  The terms  applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same
as those in effect for the option immediately prior to such assignment and shall
be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Plan  Administrator
may deem appropriate.

II.      CORPORATE TRANSACTION/CHANGE IN CONTROL/HOSTILE TAKE-OVER

         A. In the  event of any  Corporate  Transaction,  the  shares of Common
Stock at the time subject to each  outstanding  option but not otherwise  vested
shall  automatically  vest in full so that each such option  shall,  immediately
prior to the specified effective date of the Corporate Transaction, become fully
exercisable  for all of the shares of Common  Stock at the time  subject to such
option  and  may  be  exercised  for  all or  any  portion  of  such  shares  as
fully-vested shares of Common Stock.  Immediately  following the consummation of
the  Corporate  Transaction,  each option grant shall  terminate and cease to be
outstanding,  except to the extent  assumed  by the  successor  corporation  (or
parent thereof).

         B. In connection with any Change in Control, the shares of Common Stock
at the time subject to each  outstanding  option but not otherwise  vested shall
automatically vest in full so that each such option shall,  immediately prior to
the effective date of the Change in Control, become fully exercisable for all of
the  shares  of  Common  Stock at the time  subject  to such  option  and may be
exercised for all or any portion of such shares as fully-vested shares of Common
Stock. Each such option shall remain  exercisable for such  fully-vested  option
shares until the expiration of the option term or the surrender of the option in
connection with a Hostile Take-Over.

         C. Upon the occurrence of a Hostile Take-Over,  the Optionee shall have
a thirty (30)-day  period in which to surrender to the  Corporation  each option
held  by him or  her.  The  Optionee  shall  in  return  be  entitled  to a cash
distribution  from the  Corporation  in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the
Take-Over Price of the shares of Common Stock at the time subject

<PAGE>


to the surrendered  option (whether or not the Optionee is otherwise at the time
vested in those shares) over (ii) the aggregate  exercise price payable for such
shares.  Such cash distribution shall be paid within five (5) days following the
surrender of the option to the Corporation. Stockholder approval of the December
17, 1998 amendment and restatement of the Plan shall constitute  pre-approval of
each  option  surrender  right  subsequently  granted  under  the  Plan  and the
subsequent exercise of that right in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Section II.C.  No additional  approval of the Board or any committee of the
Board  shall be  required at the time of the actual  option  surrender  and cash
distribution.

         D. The grant of options under the Plan shall in no way affect the right
of the  Corporation to adjust,  reclassify,  reorganize or otherwise  change its
capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate,  dissolve,  liquidate or
sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

I.       EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF THE PLAN

         A. The Plan became  effective  on the November 7, 1995  Effective  Date
after  adoption by the Board on July 25, 1995 and approval by the  Corporation's
stockholders in August 1995.

         B. The Plan was  amended  on  February  10,  1997 (the  "February  1997
Amendment") to effect the following  changes:  (i) increase the number of shares
of  Common  Stock  authorized  for  issuance  over  the  term of the  Plan by an
additional  50,000 shares,  (ii) allow unvested shares issued under the Plan and
subsequently  repurchased by the  Corporation at the option  exercise price paid
per share to be reissued  under the Plan and (iii)  effect a series of technical
changes  to  the  provisions  of  the  Plan  (including   stockholder   approval
requirements) in order to take advantage of the recent  amendments to Rule 16b-3
of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934  which  exempts  certain  officer  and
director  transactions under the Plan from the short-swing  liability provisions
of the Federal  securities laws. The February 1997 Amendment was approved by the
stockholders  at the 1997 Annual  Meeting.  The Plan was amended on December 17,
1998 (the  "December  1998  Amendment")  to effect the  following  changes:  (i)
increase the number of shares of Common Stock  authorized  for issuance over the
term of the Plan by an additional  200,000 shares,  (ii) implement the automatic
share  increase  provisions of Section IV.B of Article One,  (iii)  increase the
size of the initial grants to  non-employee  Board members from 16,000 to 32,000
shares  of Common  Stock  and (iv)  increase  the size of the  annual  grants to
non-employee Board members from 4,000 to 8,000 shares of Common Stock. No option
grants  made  on the  basis  of the  200,000-share  increase  authorized  by the
December 1998 Amendment shall become  exercisable in whole or in part unless and
until that amendment is approved by the  stockholders.  Should such  stockholder
approval not be obtained at the 1999 Annual Meeting, then each option grant made
pursuant to the 200,000-share increase authorized by the December 1998 Amendment
shall terminate and cease to remain outstanding,  no further option grants shall
be made on the basis of that share  increase,  and the automatic  share increase
provisions of Section IV.B of Article One shall not be implemented. However, the
provisions  of the Plan as in  effect  immediately  prior to the  December  1998
Amendment shall  automatically  be reinstated,  and option grants may thereafter
continue  to be made  pursuant to the  reinstated  provisions  of the Plan.  All
option grants made prior to the December 1998 Amendment shall remain outstanding
in  accordance  with the  terms and  conditions  of the  respective  instruments
evidencing  those  options  or  issuances,  and  nothing  in the  December  1998
Amendment  shall be  deemed to modify  or in any way  affect  those  outstanding
options or  issuances.  Subject to the  foregoing  limitations,  options  may be
granted  under  the  Plan at any  time  before  the date  fixed  herein  for the
termination of the Plan.

         C. The Plan shall  terminate  upon the  earliest of (i) July 24,  2005,
(ii) the date on which all shares  available  for issuance  under the Plan shall
have been  issued or  cancelled  pursuant  to the  exercise  or  cash-out of the
options under the Plan or (iii) the  termination of all  outstanding  options in
connection with a Corporate Transaction. Upon such Plan termination, all

                                       8
<PAGE>


option  grants  and  unvested  stock  issuances  outstanding  on such date shall
thereafter  continue to have force and effect in accordance  with the provisions
of the documents evidencing such grants or issuances.

II.      AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN

         The Board shall have  complete  and  exclusive  power and  authority to
amend or modify the Plan in any or all respects.  However,  no such amendment or
modification  shall adversely  affect the rights and obligations with respect to
options or  unvested  stock  issuances  at the time  outstanding  under the Plan
unless the Optionee  consents to such  amendment or  modification.  In addition,
certain amendments may require stockholder  approval pursuant to applicable laws
or regulations.

III.     USE OF PROCEEDS

         Any cash proceeds  received by the Corporation  from the sale of shares
of Common Stock under the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.

IV.      REGULATORY APPROVALS

         A. The implementation of the Plan, the granting of any option under the
Plan and the  issuance  of any shares of Common  Stock upon the  exercise of any
option shall be subject to the  Corporation's  procurement  of all approvals and
permits required by regulatory  authorities  having  jurisdiction over the Plan,
the options  granted under it and the shares of Common Stock issued  pursuant to
it.

         B. No  shares  of  Common  Stock or other  assets  shall be  issued  or
delivered  under the Plan unless and until there shall have been compliance with
all applicable  requirements of Federal and state securities laws, including the
filing and  effectiveness of the Form S-8 registration  statement for the shares
of Common Stock issuable under the Plan, and all applicable listing requirements
of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq  National  Market,  if applicable) on which
Common Stock is then listed for trading.

V.       NO EMPLOYMENT/SERVICE RIGHTS

         Nothing  in the Plan  shall  confer  upon  the  Optionee  any  right to
continue  in Service for any period of specific  duration or  interfere  with or
otherwise  restrict in any way the rights of the  Corporation  (or any Parent or
Subsidiary   employing   or  retaining   such  person)  and  the   Corporation's
stockholders or of the Optionee,  which rights are hereby expressly  reserved by
each,  to terminate  such person's  Service at any time for any reason,  with or
without cause.

                               SANDISK CORPORATION
                          EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

                  AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF DECEMBER 17, 1998


I.       PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

         This Employee  Stock Purchase Plan is intended to promote the interests
of SanDisk  Corporation by providing  eligible employees with the opportunity to
acquire a proprietary  interest in the Corporation  through  participation  in a
payroll-deduction  based  employee stock purchase plan designed to qualify under
Section 423 of the Code.

         Capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms
in the attached Appendix.

II.      ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

         The Plan  Administrator  shall have full  authority  to  interpret  and
construe any provision of the Plan and to adopt such rules and  regulations  for
administering  the Plan as it may deem  necessary  in order to  comply  with the
requirements of Code Section 423. Decisions of the Plan  Administrator  shall be
final and binding on all parties having an interest in the Plan.

III.     STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN

         A. The stock  purchasable  under the Plan shall be shares of authorized
but  unissued or  reacquired  Common  Stock,  including  shares of Common  Stock
purchased on the open market. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which
may be issued in the aggregate over the term of this Plan and the  Corporation's
International  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan shall not exceed One  Million One
Hundred  Eighty-Three  Thousand Three Hundred  Thirty-Three  (1,183,333) shares.
Such share reserve  includes (i) the initial share reserve of 433,333 shares (as
adjusted to reflect the 2:3 split of the Common Stock authorized by the Board on
July 25, 1995) approved by the  stockholders  in August 1996, (ii) an additional
450,000 share increase authorized by the Board on February 10, 1997 and approved
by the  stockholders at the 1997 Annual Meeting and (iii) an additional  300,000
share  increase  authorized  by the  Board on  December  17,  1998,  subject  to
stockholder approval at the 1999 Annual Meeting. No shares of Common Stock shall
be issued under the Plan on the basis of such 300,000-share increase unless that
increase is approved by the stockholders at the 1999 Annual Meeting. In no event
shall more than 741,455 shares of Common Stock be issued in the aggregate  under
this Plan and the  International  Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan after March 15,
1999.

         B. The number of shares of Common Stock  available  for issuance  under
the combined reserve of this Plan and the International Plan shall automatically
increase on the first  trading day of January each calendar year during the term
of  the  Plan,  beginning  with  calendar  year  2002,  by an  amount  equal  to
forty-three  one hundredths of one percent (0.43%) of the shares of Common Stock
outstanding  on the last  trading day in December of the  immediately  preceding
calendar  year,  but in no event shall any such annual  increase  exceed 150,000
shares.


<PAGE>


         C. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock
split,  stock  dividend,  recapitalization,  combination of shares,  exchange of
shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without
the  Corporation's  receipt of consideration,  appropriate  adjustments shall be
made to (i) the maximum number and class of securities issuable in the aggregate
under this Plan and the International Plan, (ii) the maximum number and/or class
of  securities  by which the  combined  share  reserve  under  this Plan and the
International  Plan is to increase each calendar year pursuant to the provisions
of Section III.B,  (iii) the maximum number and class of securities  purchasable
per  Participant  on any one  Purchase  Date and (iv) the  number  and  class of
securities  and the price per share in effect  under each  outstanding  purchase
right in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of benefits thereunder.

IV.      OFFERING PERIODS

         A. Shares of Common Stock shall be offered for purchase  under the Plan
through a series  of  successive  Offering  Periods  until  such time as (i) the
maximum  number of shares of Common Stock  available for issuance under the Plan
shall have been purchased or (ii) the Plan shall have been sooner terminated.

         B. Each Offering Period (other than the Initial  Offering Period) shall
have a duration of six (6)  months.  Offering  Periods  shall run from the first
business day in February to the last business day in July each year and from the
first  business  day of August each year to the last  business day in January in
the following year.  However,  the Initial Offering Period shall commence at the
Effective Time and terminate on the last business day in January,  1997.  During
the  Initial  Offering  Period,  there  shall be three (3)  successive  Purchase
Intervals:  the first shall run from the Effective Time to the last business day
in January  1996;  the second shall run from the first  business day in February
1996 to the last  business  day in July  1996;  and the last  shall run from the
first  business  day in August  to the last  business  day in  January  1997.  A
Purchase  Date  shall  occur at the end of each  Purchase  Interval  within  the
Initial Offering Period.  However,  for each subsequent  Offering Period,  there
shall  only be a  single  Purchase  Date  coincident  with  the last day of that
Offering Period.

V.       ELIGIBILITY

         A. Only individuals who are Eligible  Employees on the start date of an
Offering  Period shall be eligible to  participate in the Plan for that Offering
Period.  For the Initial  Offering  Period,  the following  special  eligibility
provisions shall be in effect:

- -        Each  individual who is an Eligible  Employee at the Effective Time may
         enter the Initial  Offering Period at that time or on the start date of
         any subsequent Purchase Interval within that Offering Period,  provided
         he or she remains an Eligible Employee on that date.

- -        Each  individual  who first  becomes  an  Eligible  Employee  after the
         Effective Time may enter the Initial  Offering Period on the start date
         of any  subsequent  Purchase  Interval  within  that  Offering  Period,
         provided he or she is an Eligible Employee on that date.


                                       2
<PAGE>


         B. The date an Eligible  Employee  enters the Offering  Period shall be
designated his or her Entry Date.

         C. To participate  in the Plan for a particular  Offering  Period,  the
Eligible  Employee must  complete the  enrollment  forms  prescribed by the Plan
Administrator  (including a stock  purchase  agreement  and a payroll  deduction
authorization  form) and file such  forms  with the Plan  Administrator  (or its
designate) on or before his or her scheduled Entry Date.

VI.      PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS

         A. The payroll deduction  authorized by the Participant for purposes of
acquiring  shares of Common  Stock  under  the Plan may be any  multiple  of one
percent  (1%) of the  Cash  Compensation  paid to the  Participant  during  each
Offering  Period,  up to a maximum of ten percent  (10%).  The deduction rate so
authorized  shall  continue in effect from Offering  Period to Offering  Period,
except to the  extent  such rate is  changed in  accordance  with the  following
guidelines:

         (i) The Participant may, at any time during an Offering Period,  reduce
         his or her rate of payroll  deduction  to become  effective  as soon as
         possible after filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator.
         The  Participant  may  not,  however,  effect  more  than  one (1) such
         reduction per Offering Period or Purchase Interval.

         (ii) The Participant may, prior to the start of any new Offering Period
         or the start of any new Purchase  Interval within the Initial  Offering
         Period, increase the rate of his or her payroll deduction by filing the
         appropriate form with the Plan  Administrator.  The new rate (which may
         not exceed the ten percent (10%) maximum) shall become  effective as of
         the  start  date of the first  Offering  Period  or  Purchase  Interval
         following the filing of such form.

         B. Payroll  deductions  shall begin on the first pay day  following the
Participant's  Entry  Date into the  Offering  Period and shall  (unless  sooner
terminated  by the  Participant)  continue  through  the pay day ending  with or
immediately  prior to the last  day of that  Offering  Period.  The  amounts  so
collected  shall be credited to the  Participant's  book account under the Plan,
but no interest  shall be paid on the balance from time to time  outstanding  in
such account.  The amounts  collected from the Participant  shall not be held in
any  segregated  account or trust fund and may be  commingled  with the  general
assets of the Corporation and used for general corporate purposes.

         C. Payroll deductions shall automatically cease upon the termination of
the Participant's purchase right in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

         D. The Participant's  acquisition of Common Stock under the Plan on any
Purchase Date shall neither limit nor require the  Participant's  acquisition of
Common Stock on any subsequent Purchase Date.

VII.     PURCHASE RIGHTS

         A. Grant of Purchase  Right. A Participant  shall be granted a separate
purchase  right for each Offering  Period in which he or she  participates.  The
purchase  right  shall be  granted  on the  Participant's  Entry  Date  into the
Offering  Period and shall  provide the  Participant  with the right to purchase
shares of Common Stock upon the terms set forth  below.  The  Participant  shall
execute  a  stock  purchase  agreement  embodying  such  terms  and  such  other
provisions (not inconsistent  with the Plan) as the Plan  Administrator may deem
advisable.

         Under no circumstances  shall purchase rights be granted under the Plan
to any Eligible Employee if such individual would,  immediately after the grant,
own (within the meaning of Code Section 424(d)) or hold  outstanding  options or
other  rights to  purchase,  stock  possessing  five percent (5%) or more of the
total combined  voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Corporation
or any Corporate Affiliate.

         B.  Exercise  of the  Purchase  Right.  The  purchase  right  shall  be
automatically  exercised on each Purchase Date within the Offering  Period,  and
shares  of  Common  Stock  shall  accordingly  be  purchased  on  behalf  of the
Participant (other than any Participant whose payroll deductions have previously
been refunded in accordance  with the  Termination of Purchase Right  provisions
below) on such  Purchase  Date.  The purchase  shall be effected by applying the
Participant's  payroll  deductions  for  the  Offering  Period  or the  Purchase
Interval to the purchase of whole  shares of Common Stock at the purchase  price
in effect for the Participant for the Purchase Date coincident with the last day
of  that  Offering  Period  or  Purchase  Interval.   All  shares  purchased  on
Participant's  behalf shall be directly deposited into an account maintained for
such Participant at a Corporation-designated brokerage firm.

         C. Purchase  Price.  The purchase price per share at which Common Stock
shall be purchased on the Participant's  behalf on each Purchase Date within the
Offering Period shall be equal to eighty-five  percent (85%) of the lower of (i)
the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Participant's  Entry Date
into  that  Offering  Period or (ii) the Fair  Market  Value per share of Common
Stock on that Purchase Date. However, for each Participant who joins the Initial
Offering Period after the start date, the clause (i) amount shall in no event be
less than the Fair Market  Value per share of Common  Stock on the start date of
the Initial Offering Period.

         D. Number of Purchasable  Shares.  The number of shares of Common Stock
purchasable  by a Participant on each Purchase Date shall be the number of whole
shares  obtained  by  dividing  the  Participant's  payroll  deductions  for the
Offering  Period or Purchase  Interval ending on such date by the purchase price
in effect for the  Participant  for that  Purchase  Date.  However,  the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock purchasable per Participant on any one Purchase
Date shall not exceed  Seven  Hundred  Fifty (750)  shares,  subject to periodic
adjustments in the event of certain changes in the Corporation's capitalization.
However,  the  Plan  Administrator  shall  have  the  discretionary   authority,
exercisable  prior to the start of any Offering Period,  to increase or decrease
the  limitation  to be in  effect  for the  number  of  shares  purchasable  per
Participant on the Purchase Date for that Offering Period.


                                       4
<PAGE>


         E. Excess Payroll Deductions. Any payroll deductions not applied to the
purchase of shares of Common  Stock on any  Purchase  Date  because they are not
sufficient  to  purchase  a whole  share of Common  Stock  shall be held for the
purchase  of  Common  Stock on the next  Purchase  Date.  However,  any  payroll
deductions  not  applied  to the  purchase  of  Common  Stock by  reason  of the
limitation on the maximum number of shares purchasable by the Participant on the
Purchase Date shall be promptly refunded.

         F. Termination of Purchase Right. The following provisions shall govern
the termination of outstanding purchase rights:

         (i)      A  Participant  may,  at any time prior to the next  scheduled
                  Purchase Date, terminate his or her outstanding purchase right
                  by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator (or
                  its  designate),  and no further payroll  deductions  shall be
                  collected from the Participant  with respect to the terminated
                  purchase right.  Any payroll  deductions  collected during the
                  Offering Period or Purchase Interval in which such termination
                  occurs shall, at the  Participant's  election,  be immediately
                  refunded  or held  for the  purchase  of  shares  on the  next
                  scheduled  Purchase  Date.  If no such election is made at the
                  time  such  purchase  right is  terminated,  then the  payroll
                  deductions  collected  with  respect to the  terminated  right
                  shall be refunded as soon as possible.

         (ii)     The  termination of such purchase right shall be  irrevocable,
                  and the Participant may not  subsequently  rejoin the Offering
                  Period for which the terminated purchase right was granted. In
                  order  to  resume  participation  in any  subsequent  Offering
                  Period,  such individual must re-enroll in the Plan (by making
                  a timely  filing  of the  prescribed  enrollment  forms) on or
                  before the start date of that Offering Period.

         (iii)    Should the  Participant  cease to remain an Eligible  Employee
                  for any  reason  (including  death,  disability  or  change in
                  status) while his or her purchase  right remains  outstanding,
                  then that purchase right shall immediately terminate,  and all
                  of the  Participant's  payroll  deductions  for  the  Offering
                  Period or  Purchase  Interval in which the  purchase  right so
                  terminates shall be immediately refunded.  However, should the
                  Participant  cease to remain in active service by reason of an
                  approved unpaid leave of absence,  then the Participant  shall
                  have the  election,  exercisable  up until the last day of the
                  Offering  Period or  Purchase  Interval  in which  such  leave
                  commences,   to  (a)  withdraw  all  the  payroll   deductions
                  collected  to  date on his or her  behalf  for  such  Offering
                  Period or  Purchase  Interval  or (b) have such funds held for
                  the purchase of shares on the next scheduled Purchase Date. In
                  no event,  however,  shall any further  payroll  deductions be
                  collected on the Participant's  behalf during such leave. Upon
                  the  Participant's  return to active service (x) within ninety
                  (90) days  following  the  commencement  of such  leave or (y)
                  prior to the  expiration  of any longer  period for which such
                  Participant's  right to  reemployment  with the Corporation is
                  guaranteed by either  statute or contract,  his or her payroll
                  deductions  under the Plan shall  automatically  resume at the
                  rate in  effect  at the  time  the  leave  began,  unless  the
                  Participant  withdraws  from  the  Plan  prior  to  his or her
                  return.   An  individual  who  returns  to  active  employment
                  following a leave of absence  which  exceeds in  duration  the
                  applicable (x) or (y) time period will be treated as a new

                                       5
<PAGE>


                  Employee for purposes of subsequent  participation in the Plan
                  and must accordingly re-enroll in the Plan (by making a timely
                  filing of the  prescribed  enrollment  forms) on or before the
                  start date of any new Offering Period or Purchase Interval.

         G.  Corporate  Transaction.   Each  outstanding  purchase  right  shall
automatically  be  exercised,  immediately  prior to the  effective  date of any
Corporate Transaction, by applying the payroll deductions of each Participant to
the purchase of whole shares of Common Stock at a purchase price per share equal
to eighty-five percent (85%) of the lower of (i) the Fair Market Value per share
of Common  Stock on the  Participant's  Entry Date into the  Offering  Period in
which such Corporate  Transaction occurs or (ii) the Fair Market Value per share
of  Common  Stock  immediately  prior to the  effective  date of such  Corporate
Transaction.  However,  the  applicable  limitation  on the  number of shares of
Common  Stock  purchasable  per  Participant  shall  continue  to  apply to each
purchase.

         The  Corporation  shall use its best  efforts  to  provide at least ten
(10)-days  prior written notice of the occurrence of any Corporate  Transaction,
and Participants shall,  following the receipt of such notice, have the right to
terminate their  outstanding  purchase rights prior to the effective date of the
Corporate Transaction.

         H. Proration of Purchase  Rights.  Should the total number of shares of
Common  Stock to be purchased  pursuant to  outstanding  purchase  rights on any
particular  date exceed the number of shares then  available for issuance  under
the  Plan,  the Plan  Administrator  shall  make a  pro-rata  allocation  of the
available  shares on a uniform  and  nondiscriminatory  basis,  and the  payroll
deductions  of each  Participant,  to the  extent  in  excess  of the  aggregate
purchase price payable for the Common Stock pro-rated to such individual,  shall
be refunded.

         I. Assignability. During the Participant's lifetime, the purchase right
shall be  exercisable  only by the  Participant  and shall not be  assignable or
transferable.

         J. Stockholder  Rights. A Participant shall have no stockholder  rights
with  respect to the shares  subject to his or her  outstanding  purchase  right
until the shares are purchased on the  Participant's  behalf in accordance  with
the provisions of the Plan and the  Participant has become a holder of record of
the purchased shares.

VIII.    ACCRUAL LIMITATIONS

         A. No Participant  shall be entitled to accrue rights to acquire Common
Stock pursuant to any purchase right  outstanding  under this Plan if and to the
extent such accrual,  when  aggregated  with (i) rights to purchase Common Stock
accrued under any other  purchase right granted under this Plan and (ii) similar
rights  accrued under other employee stock purchase plans (within the meaning of
Code Section 423) of the Corporation or any Corporate Affiliate, would otherwise
permit such  Participant  to purchase  more than  Twenty-Five  Thousand  Dollars
($25,000)  worth  of  stock  of  the  Corporation  or  any  Corporate  Affiliate
(determined  on the basis of the Fair Market  Value of such stock on the date or
dates such rights are  granted)  for each  calendar  year such rights are at any
time outstanding.


                                       6
<PAGE>


         B. For purposes of applying  such accrual  limitations  to the purchase
rights granted under this Plan, the following provisions shall be in effect:

         (i)      The right to  acquire  Common  Stock  under  each  outstanding
                  purchase  right shall  accrue in one or more  installments  on
                  each Purchase  Date within the Offering  Period for which such
                  right is granted.

         (ii)     No  right  to  acquire  Common  Stock  under  any  outstanding
                  purchase right shall accrue to the extent the  Participant has
                  already accrued in the same calendar year the right to acquire
                  Common Stock under one (1) or more other purchase  rights at a
                  rate equal to Twenty-Five  Thousand Dollars ($25,000) worth of
                  Common Stock (determined on the basis of the Fair Market Value
                  of such stock on the date or dates of grant) for each calendar
                  year such rights were at any time outstanding.

         C. If by reason of such accrual  limitations,  the purchase  right of a
Participant  does not accrue for a particular  Offering  Period (or a particular
Purchase  Interval  within  the  Initial  Offering  Period),  then  the  payroll
deductions  which the Participant  made during that Offering Period (or Purchase
Interval)  with  respect to such  unaccrued  purchase  right  shall be  promptly
refunded.

         D. In the event there is any conflict  between the  provisions  of this
Article  and  one or  more  provisions  of the  Plan  or any  instrument  issued
thereunder, the provisions of this Article shall be controlling.

IX.      EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF THE PLAN

         A. The Plan was adopted by the Board on July 25, 1995 and shall  become
effective at the Effective  Time,  provided no purchase rights granted under the
Plan  shall be  exercised,  and no  shares  of  Common  Stock  shall  be  issued
hereunder,  until (i) the Plan shall have been approved by the  stockholders  of
the Corporation and (ii) the Corporation shall have complied with all applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act (including the registration of the shares of Common
Stock issuable under the Plan on a Form S-8  registration  statement  filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission),  all applicable listing requirements of
any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National  Market,  if applicable) on which the
Common  Stock is  listed  for  trading  and all  other  applicable  requirements
established by law or regulation.  In the event such stockholder approval is not
obtained,  or such  compliance is not effected,  within twelve (12) months after
the date on which the Plan is adopted by the Board, the Plan shall terminate and
have no further force or effect and all sums collected from Participants  during
the Initial Offering Period shall be refunded.

         B. Unless sooner terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate upon
the earliest of (i) the last  business day in July 2005,  (ii) the date on which
all shares  available for issuance  under the Plan shall have been sold pursuant
to  purchase  rights  exercised  under  the Plan or (iii)  the date on which all
purchase  rights are exercised in connection  with a Corporate  Transaction.  No
further  purchase  rights shall be granted or exercised,  and no further payroll
deductions shall be collected, under the Plan following such termination.


                                       7
<PAGE>


X.       AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN

         A. The Board may alter,  amend,  suspend or discontinue the Plan at any
time to become effective  immediately following the close of any Offering Period
or Purchase  Interval.  However,  the Board may not, without the approval of the
Corporation's  stockholders,  (i)  materially  increase  the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable under the Plan, except for permissible  adjustments in the
event of certain  changes in the  Corporation's  capitalization,  (ii) alter the
purchase price formula so as to reduce the purchase price payable for the shares
of Common Stock  purchasable under the Plan or (iii) modify the requirements for
eligibility to participate in the Plan.

         B. On February 10, 1997,  the Board adopted an amendment to the Plan to
increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under this
Plan and the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan by an additional 450,000
shares in the aggregate.  This amendment was approved by the stockholders at the
1997 Annual Meeting.  On December 17, 1998, the Board adopted  amendments to the
plan to (i)  increase  the  number  of shares of  Common  Stock  authorized  for
issuance in the aggregate under this Plan and the  International  Employee Stock
Purchase  Plan  by an  additional  300,000  shares  and  (ii) to  implement  the
automatic  share  increase  provisions of Section  III.B.  These  amendments are
subject to stockholder approval at the 1999 Annual Meeting, and no shares may be
issued on the basis of the  300,000  share  increase  unless and until the share
increase is approved by the stockholders.  Should such stockholder  approval not
be  obtained  at the 1999  Annual  Meeting,  then the  maximum  number of shares
available  for  subsequent  issuance  in the  aggregate  under this Plan and the
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall not exceed the number of shares
which remained  available for issuance  immediately  prior to the  300,000-share
increase  authorized by the Board on December 17, 1998, and the automatic  share
increase provisions of Section III.B shall not be implemented.

XI.      GENERAL PROVISIONS

         A. All costs and expenses  incurred in the  administration  of the Plan
shall be paid by the Corporation.

         B. Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon the  Participant  any right to
continue in the employ of the  Corporation  or any  Corporate  Affiliate for any
period of specific  duration or interfere with or otherwise  restrict in any way
the rights of the Corporation (or any Corporate Affiliate employing such person)
or of the Participant,  which rights are hereby  expressly  reserved by each, to
terminate such person's  employment at any time for any reason,  with or without
cause.

         C. The  provisions  of the Plan  shall be  governed  by the laws of the
State of California without resort to that State's conflict-of-laws rules.
