              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


1.     These interim condensed  consolidated  financial statements are unaudited
       but  reflect,  in  the  opinion  of  management,   all  normal  recurring
       adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of SanDisk
       Corporation  and  Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of March 31, 1998, and
       the  results of  operations  and cash flows for the three  month  periods
       ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.  Because all the  disclosures  required by
       generally accepted accounting principles are not included,  these interim
       condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
       with the audited financial  statements and notes thereto in the Company's
       annual  report on Form 10-K as of,  and for the year ended  December  31,
       1997.  The condensed  consolidated  balance sheet data as of December 31,
       1997 was derived from the audited financial statements.

       The results of operations and cash flows for the three month period ended
       March 31, 1998 are not  necessarily  indicative  of results of operations
       and cash flows for any future period.

2.     The Company's  fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31, and
       each fiscal  quarter ends on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, and
       September  30. The first  fiscal  quarter of 1998 and 1997 ended on March
       29,  1998 and March 30,  1997,  respectively.  Fiscal  year 1997 ended on
       December 28, 1997. For ease of presentation,  the accompanying  financial
       statements  have been  shown as  ending  on the last day of the  calendar
       month.

3.     The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with  generally
       accepted accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
       assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements
       and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4. The components of inventory consist of the following:

5.     In 1997, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued  Statement No.
       128,  Earnings  per Share.  Statement  128 replaced  the  calculation  of
       primary and fully  diluted  earnings per share with the basic and diluted
       earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share, basic earnings per
       share excludes any dilutive effects of options,  warrants and convertible
       securities.  Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the previously
       reported  fully  diluted  earnings per share.  Earnings per share amounts
       presented   have  been   restated  to  conform  to  the   Statement   128
       requirements.

       The  following  table sets  forth the  computation  of basic and  diluted
       earnings per share:

6.     To preserve its intellectual property rights, the Company believes it may
       be  necessary  to  initiate  litigation  with one or more third  parties,
       including  but not limited to those the Company has  notified of possible
       patent infringement.  In addition, one or more of these parties may bring
       suit against the Company.

       In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal  court  against
       Lexar Media, Inc.  ("Lexar") for infringement of a fundamental  flashdisk
       patent.  Lexar has disputed the Company's  claim of patent  infringement.
       The Company intends to vigorously  enforce its patents,  but there can be
       no assurance that these efforts will be successful.

       From  time to  time  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  certain  of its
       suppliers  and customers for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
       such indemnity varies but may in some instances  include  indemnification
       for damages and expenses,  including attorneys fees. The Company may from
       time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of such indemnification
       obligations. Third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from
       coverage  under  the  Company's  insurance  policies.  There  can  be  no
       assurance that any future obligation to indemnify the Company's customers
       or suppliers,  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
       business, financial condition and results of operations.

       Any  litigation,  whether as a plaintiff or as a  defendant,  will likely
       result in  significant  expense to the  Company and divert the efforts of
       the Company's  technical and  management  personnel,  whether or not such
       litigation is ultimately determined in favor of the Company. In the event
       of an  adverse  result  in any  such  litigation,  the  Company  could be
       required to pay substantial damages, cease the

                                     Page 7
<PAGE>


       manufacture,  use and sale of  infringing  products,  expend  significant
       resources to develop non-infringing  technology or obtain licenses to the
       infringing  technology,  or  discontinue  the use of  certain  processes.
       Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing matters,
       or any future litigation,  will not have a material adverse effect on the
       Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

7.     The Company  recorded a provision for income taxes at a 36% effective tax
       rate for the first three months of 1998  compared to a 15%  effective tax
       rate for the same period of 1997.  The  effective  tax rate for the first
       three months of 1997 was  substantially  below the federal statutory rate
       due to the  utilization  of federal  and state tax credit  carryforwards,
       Foreign  Sales  Corporation  tax benefits and a reduction in the deferred
       tax asset valuation allowance.

8.     The Company has a credit agreement (the Agreement) with a bank, which was
       renewed  in July  1997.  Under the  provisions  of the  Agreement,  which
       expires in July 1998,  the  Company  may  borrow up to  $10,000,000  on a
       revolving line of credit at the bank's prime interest rate. Amounts under
       the revolving line of credit can be applied to the issuance of letters of
       credit of up to the full amount of the credit  line.  At March 31,  1998,
       $7,200,000 in letters of credit were outstanding.  In addition, under the
       Agreement,  the Company also has a $15,000,000  foreign exchange contract
       line under which the Company may enter into foreign  exchange  contracts.
       No amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit portion of
       the Agreement and the foreign  exchange  contract  portion of the line at
       March 31, 1998. The Agreement contains covenants that require the Company
       to  maintain  certain  financial  ratios  and  levels of net  worth.  The
       Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends to stockholders.

9.     As of  January  1, 1998,  the  Company  adopted  statement  of  Financial
       Accounting  Standards  No.  130  (SFAS  130),  "Reporting   Comprehensive
       Income." SFAS 130  establishes new rules for the reporting and display of
       comprehensive  income and its components;  however,  the adoption of this
       Statement  had no impact on the  Company's  net  income or  stockholders'
       equity.  SFAS 130 requires  unrealized  gains or losses on the  Company's
       available-for-sale  securities,  which  prior to adoption  were  reported
       separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in other comprehensive
       income.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

         Certain  statements  in this  discussion  and  analysis,  including  in
particular,  the second  paragraph under the discussion of product  revenues and
the  paragraph  discussing  patent  license  and royalty  revenues,  are forward
looking  statements  based on current  expectations and entail various risks and
uncertainties  that could cause actual results to differ  materially  from those
expressed in such forward looking  statements.  Such risks and uncertainties are
discussed  below and in the Company's  Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
1997 under the heading "Risk Factors".  Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward  looking  statements,  which speak only as of the date
hereof.  The Company  undertakes no  obligation to update these forward  looking
statements to reflect events or  circumstances  occurring after the date hereof.
The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with the  Company's
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

Overview

         The  Company  was  founded  in 1988 to develop  and  market  flash data
storage systems.  The Company sells its products to the consumer electronics and
industrial/communications  markets. During the course of 1997, the percentage of
the Company's  product sales  attributable to the consumer  electronics  market,
particularly  sales of  CompactFlash  for use in  digital  camera  applications,
increased substantially.  This increase in sales to the consumer market resulted
in a shift to lower  capacity  products,  which  typically  have  lower  average
selling  prices and gross margins than higher  capacity  products.  In addition,
these products are frequently  sold into the retail  channel,  which usually has
shorter  customer order  lead-times than the other channels used by the Company,
thereby   decreasing  the  Company's  ability  to  accurately   forecast  future
production  needs.  Subject to continued  market  acceptance of its CompactFlash
products,  the Company  believes  these  products  will  continue to represent a
majority of the  Company's  sales as the  popularity  of consumer  applications,
including digital cameras,  increases.  The percentage of sales  attributable to
orders  received and fulfilled in the same quarter has increased  over time and,
in  response,  the Company is  continuing  to work to shorten its  manufacturing
cycle times.

         The  Company's  operating  results are  affected by a number of factors
including  the  volume of  product  sales,  the  timing of  significant  orders,
competitive  pricing pressures,  the ability of the Company to match supply with
demand,  changes  in product  and  customer  mix,  market  acceptance  of new or
enhanced  versions of the Company's  products,  changes in the channels  through
which  the   Company's   products  are   distributed,   timing  of  new  product
announcements and  introductions by the Company and its competitors,  the timing
of license and royalty revenues,  fluctuations in product costs, availability of
foundry  capacity,  variations in  manufacturing  cycle times,  fluctuations  in
manufacturing  yields and  manufacturing  utilization,  increased  research  and
development  expenses  and  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  In  addition,  as the
proportion  of the  Company's  products  sold  for use in  consumer  electronics
applications  increases,  the Company's  revenues may become subject to seasonal
declines in the first quarter of each year. See "Risk Factors - Fluctuations  in
Operating Results" and "- Seasonality."

         Beginning in late 1995, the Company adopted a strategy of licensing its
flash  technology,  including  its patent  portfolio,  to  selected  third party
manufacturers  of flash  products.  To date, the Company has entered into patent
cross-license  agreements  with five major  companies,  and it intends to pursue
opportunities to enter into additional  licenses.  The Company's current license
agreements provide for the payment of license fees, royalties,  or a combination
thereof,  to the  Company.  The  timing and  amount of these  payments  can vary
substantially from quarter to quarter,  depending on the terms of each agreement
and, in some cases,  the timing of sales of products by the other parties.  As a
result,  license and royalty revenues have fluctuated  significantly in the past
and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. Given the relatively high
gross margins  associated with license and royalty  revenues,  gross margins and
net income are likely to  fluctuate  more with  changes in license  and  royalty
revenues than with changes in product revenues.


                                     Page 9

         SanDisk  markets  its  products  using  a  direct  sales  organization,
distributors,  manufacturers' representatives,  private label partners, OEMs and
retailers.  The  Company  expects  that sales  through the retail  channel  will
comprise  an  increasing  share  of total  revenues  in the  future,  and that a
substantial  portion  of its  sales  into  the  retail  channel  will be made to
participants  that will have the right to return  unsold  products.  The Company
recognizes  revenues  from  these  sales when the  products  are sold to the end
customers.

         Historically,  a majority of the Company's sales have been to a limited
number of customers. The Company expects that sales of its products to a limited
number of customers  will continue to account for a  substantial  portion of its
product  revenues for the foreseeable  future.  The Company has also experienced
significant  changes in the  composition  of its customer base from year to year
and  expects  this  pattern to  continue  as market  demand for such  customers'
products fluctuates. The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by major
customers,  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations.  See "Risk  Factors - Customer
Concentration."

         Due to the emerging nature of the Company's markets and certain planned
product transitions, the Company has had difficulty forecasting future inventory
levels  required  to meet  customer  demand.  As a  result  of both  contractual
obligations and manufacturing cycle time, the Company has been required to order
wafers from its foundries  several months in advance of the ultimate shipment of
its products.  Under the Company's wafer supply agreements,  there are limits on
the number of wafers the Company can order and the  Company's  ability to change
that quantity is  restricted.  Accordingly,  the  Company's  ability to react to
significant fluctuations in demand for its products is limited. As a result, the
Company has not been able to match its purchases of wafers to specific  customer
orders and  therefore  the  Company  has from time to time taken write downs for
potential  excess  inventory  purchased prior to the receipt of customer orders.
These  adjustments  decrease  gross  margins in the  quarter  reported  and have
resulted,  and could in the future result, in fluctuations in gross margins on a
quarter  to  quarter  basis.  See "Risk  Factors  -  Fluctuations  in  Operating
Results."

         Export sales are an important part of the Company's  business.  While a
majority of the  Company's  revenues  from sales to Asian  countries are derived
from OEM  customers  who plan to export their  products to countries  outside of
Asia, the Asian economic crisis may adversely  effect the Company's  revenues to
the extent that demand for the Company's  products in Asia  declines.  Given the
recent  economic  conditions  in Asia and the weakness of many Asian  currencies
relative to the United States dollar,  the Company's  products may be relatively
more expensive in Asia,  which could result in a decrease in the Company's sales
in that region. The Company may also experience pressure on its gross margins as
a result of increased price  competition from Asian  competitors.  While most of
the  Company's  sales are  denominated  in U.S.  Dollars,  the Company  invoices
certain  Japanese  customers  in Japanese  Yen and is subject to  exchange  rate
fluctuations  on  these  transactions.  To  date,  a  portion  of the  Company's
purchases of wafers,  which  constitute a significant  part of its cost of goods
sold,  have been  denominated  in Japanese Yen.  While this  percentage has been
decreasing,  exchange  rate  fluctuations  can  affect the  Company's  business,
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.   See  "Risk  Factors  Risks
Associated with International Operations."

         For  the  foreseeable   future,   the  Company  expects  to  realize  a
significant  portion of its revenues from recently  introduced and new products.
Typically  new  products  initially  have lower gross  margins  than more mature
products   because  the   manufacturing   yields  are  lower  at  the  start  of
manufacturing each successive  product  generation.  In addition,  manufacturing
yields are generally  lower at the start of  manufacturing  any product at a new
foundry, such as USIC and NEC. As a result of these factors, the Company expects
that  product  gross  margins  may  decline  in the near  term  from the  levels
experienced  in 1997,  and product  gross  margins are expected to be subject to
fluctuation for the foreseeable future. Moreover, there can be no assurance that
such products or processes will be successfully developed by the Company or that
development of such processes will lower manufacturing  costs. In addition,  the
Company  anticipates that price  competition will increase in the future,  which
will likely result in decreased average

                                    Page 10

selling prices and lower gross margins. See "Risk Factors -Manufacturing Yields"
and "- Declining Average Sales Prices."

         The Company is aware of problems  associated  with computer  systems as
the year 2000  approaches.  Year 2000 problems are the result of common computer
programming techniques that result in systems that do not function properly when
manipulating  dates later than December 31, 1999.  The issue is complex and wide
ranging.  The problem may affect transaction  processing  computer  applications
used by the Company for accounting,  distribution,  manufacturing, and planning.
The problem may also affect embedded systems such as building  security systems,
machine controllers and production test equipment. Year 2000 problems with these
systems may affect the ability or efficiency  with which the company can perform
many  significant  functions,  including  but not limited to: order  processing,
material  planning,  product assembly,  product test,  invoicing,  and financial
reporting.  In addition,  the problem may affect the computer systems of vendors
and  customers,  disrupting  their  operations.  Year  2000  problems  with  the
Company's  business  partners  may  impact the  Company's  sources of supply and
demand.

         The  Company  is  currently  in  the  process  of  upgrading  its  core
management information systems that are known to not be Year 2000 compliant. The
Company  believes that these upgrades will be completed  before the end of 1998.
These  upgrades are intended to address the Year 2000 issues with respect to the
internal  budgeting,   financial  planning,   material  planning,   sales  order
processing,  accounting,  inventory control,  shop floor control, and purchasing
business  processes.  The  Company  has also  initiated  a formal Year 2000 Risk
Management  program to identify,  and  mitigate to the best of its ability,  any
remaining internal and external risks associated with the Year 2000 problem. The
cost of the Year 2000 project related to upgrading the Company's core management
information  system  is  estimated  to be $1.2  million.  Of this,  the  Company
estimates that  approximately  $400,000 is  attributable  to the purchase of new
software,  which will be capitalized.  The costs  associated with the other Year
2000 risks have not been quantified.

         The costs and time  schedule  for the Year 2000 problem  abatement  are
based  on  management's  best  estimates  for  the  implementation  of  its  new
management   information   system.   These  were  derived   utilizing   numerous
assumptions,  including that the most  significant  Year 2000 risks have already
been  identified,  that certain  resources  will continue to be available,  that
third party plans will be fulfilled, and other factors. However, there can be no
guarantee  that these  estimates will be achieved or that the  anticipated  time
schedule  will be met and actual  results  could  differ  materially  from those
anticipated.  Any year 2000  compliance  problem of either the  Company,  or its
suppliers or customers could materially adversely affect the Company's business,
results of operations,  financial  condition,  and prospects.  See "Risk Factors
Year 2000 Compliance."


Results of Operations

         PRODUCT REVENUES.  SanDisk's product revenues were $25.4 million in the
first  quarter of 1998,  up $7.2  million  or 40% from the same  period of 1997.
During the three month period ended March 31, 1998, units shipped  increased 86%
from  the  same  period  of  1997.  The  largest  increase  came  from  sales of
CompactFlash  products  primarily for use in digital  cameras and other consumer
electronics  applications.  Average  selling  prices  declined  21% in the first
quarter of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997 primarily due to competitive
pricing in the market. The Company anticipates that CompactFlash and other small
form factor  products  will continue to represent the major portion of its sales
as consumer  applications such as digital cameras become more popular.  Sales of
these  products  generally  have lower average  selling prices and gross margins
than the Company's higher capacity products  FlashDisk and FlashDrive  products.
The mix of  products  sold  varies  from  quarter to quarter and may vary in the
future,  affecting  the  Company's  overall  average  selling  prices  and gross
margins.

         The Company entered 1998 with limited bookings visibility, particularly
in Japan. However, bookings strengthened late in the first quarter. Although the
Company has limited visibility as to customer

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>


orders,  the Company expects product  revenues to increase in the second quarter
of 1998 relative to the first quarter,  if this recent bookings trend continues.
Due to a number of factors described herein and in "Risk Factors," the Company's
ability to adjust its  operating  expenses  is limited in the short  term.  As a
result, if product revenues are lower than anticipated, the Company's results of
operations  will  be  adversely  affected.  See  "Risk  Factors-Fluctuations  in
Operating Results" and "Seasonality."

         While  SanDisk  has been  successful  winning  design-ins  for many new
applications,  it  generally  takes  several  quarters  for these  new  customer
products to reach the market.  It is  difficult to predict the timing of related
new product  introductions and future sales volumes from these design-ins as the
success of the customers'  products is uncertain.  There can be no assurance the
applications  will be  developed  and  marketed  successfully  or at all. As new
markets  develop,  competition is expected to increase,  which will likely cause
average selling prices and gross margins to decline.

         Export sales  represented 43% of product  revenues in the first quarter
of 1998 compared with 40% for the same period of the previous  year. The Company
expects  international  sales to continue to represent a significant  portion of
revenues.  The Company's top ten customers represented 72% of product revenue in
the first  quarter  of 1998  compared  to 66% for the same  period in 1997.  The
Company  expects that sales to a limited  number of customers  will  continue to
represent a substantial portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future.

         LICENSE  AND  ROYALTY  REVENUES.  The Company  currently  earns  patent
licenses and royalty revenues under five cross license agreements, with Hitachi,
Intel, Samsung, Sharp and Toshiba. License and royalty revenue from patent cross
license  agreements  was $8.7  million  in the first  quarter  of 1998,  up $5.4
million  from $3.3 million in the same period of 1997  primarily  due to license
and royalty  revenues earned under  agreements  with Hitachi,  Toshiba and Sharp
which  were  entered  into in the  second  half of 1997.  Revenues  from  patent
licenses and royalties  increased to 25% of total  revenues in the first quarter
of 1998 from 15% in the same period of the previous year. The Company  currently
expects that revenues from patent licenses and royalties will be in the range of
$7.0 to $7.5 million in the second  quarter of 1998 due to the timing of revenue
recognition under the various agreements.

         GROSS PROFITS. In the first quarter of 1998, gross profits increased to
$16.3  million  or 48% of  total  revenues  from  $8.5  million  or 40% of total
revenues for the same period in the previous  year.  The growth in overall gross
profits for the first three months of 1998 was  primarily  due to an increase in
license and royalty revenue.  Product gross margins increased slightly to 30% in
the first  quarter  of 1998  compared  to 29% for the same  period of 1997.  The
increase was due to a mix shift to higher capacity  CompactFlash cards and lower
per unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter of 1998. While the Company has
ongoing efforts to reduce  manufacturing  costs,  there can be no assurance that
these cost  reductions will be adequate to offset average selling price declines
due to anticipated increased competition.

         RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT.  Research and development  expenses  consist
principally of salaries and payroll related  expenses for design and development
engineers,  prototype supplies and contract  services.  Research and development
expenses  increased $1.3 million or 44% in the first quarter of 1998 compared to
the same period in 1997. The increase in research and  development  expenses was
primarily due to an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses associated
with additional  personnel,  increased  project  related  expenses and increased
depreciation  due to  capital  equipment  additions.  Research  and  development
expenses  represented  13% of  total  revenues  for the  first  quarter  of 1998
compared to 14% for the same periods in 1997. The Company  expects  research and
development  expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars to support the
development of new  generations of flash data storage  products and the addition
of new foundries to manufacture the Company's products.

         SALES AND MARKETING.  Sales and marketing expenses include salaries and
payroll  related  expenses,  sales  commissions  and  travel  expenses  for  the
Company's  sales,  marketing,  customer  service  and  applications  engineering
personnel. These expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses such

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>


as  independent  manufacturer's  representative  commissions,   advertising  and
tradeshow  expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 million or 54%
in the first quarter of 1998  compared to the same period in 1997.  The increase
in sales and marketing  expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 1998
was  primarily  due to increased  marketing  and sales  expenses  related to the
development of the retail channel for the Company's  products and an increase in
salaries and payroll related  expenses  associated  with  additional  personnel.
Sales and  marketing  expenses  represented  12% of total  revenues in the first
quarter of 1998 and 1997.  The Company  expects sales and marketing  expenses to
increase in absolute  dollars as sales of its  products  grow and it attempts to
develop   the  retail   channel  for  its   products   both   domestically   and
internationally.

         GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses include
the  cost  of the  Company's  finance,  information  systems,  human  resources,
shareholder  relations,   legal  and  administrative   functions.   General  and
administrative  expenses  increased  $0.7 million or 48% in the first quarter of
1998  compared to the same period of 1997.  The  increase was  primarily  due to
increased  salaries and payroll  related  expenses  associated  with  additional
personnel and higher consulting  expenses related to the planned  implementation
of the Company's new management  information system.  General and administrative
expenses represented 6% of total revenues in the three month periods ended March
31, 1998 and 1997. The Company  expects general and  administrative  expenses to
increase  in  absolute  dollars as these  functions  grow to support the overall
growth of the Company.  General and administrative  expenses could also increase
substantially  in the future in connection with the Company's  efforts to defend
its patent portfolio.  See "Risk Factors-Patents  Proprietary Rights and Related
Litigation."

         INTEREST  AND  OTHER  INCOME,  NET.  Interest  and other  income,  net,
increased  $384,000 in the first  quarter of 1998 compared to the same period of
1997. This increase was primarily due to higher investment  balances as a result
of the  investment  of proceeds  from the sale of common stock in the  Company's
November 1997 follow on public offering.

         PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Company recorded a provision for income
taxes at a 36% effective tax rate for the first three months of 1998 compared to
a 15% effective tax rate for the same period of 1997. The effective tax rate for
the first three  months of 1997 was  substantially  below the federal  statutory
rate due to the  utilization  of  federal  and state tax  credit  carryforwards,
foreign sales corporation tax benefits and a reduction in the deferred tax asset
valuation  allowance.  The Company's  1998  effective tax rate is  substantially
higher than its 1997 rate due to the  utilization  of all remaining  federal and
state tax credit carryforwards in 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         As of March  31,  1998,  the  Company  had  working  capital  of $139.6
million,  which included $10.6 million in cash and cash  equivalents  and $116.9
million in short term  investments.  The Company  has a line of credit  facility
with a commercial bank under which it can borrow up to $10 million at the bank's
prime rate. This line of credit  facility  expires in July 1998. As of March 31,
1998, the Company had $7.2 million  committed  under the line of credit facility
for standby letters of credit. The Agreement contains covenants that require the
Company to  maintain  certain  financial  ratios  and  levels of net worth,  and
prohibits the payment of cash dividends to stockholders.

         Operating  activities  used $6.8 million of cash during the first three
months of 1998 primarily due to a decline in current liabilities and an increase
in  inventories.  Investing  activities  used $4.5  million of cash in the first
three months of 1998 and included net purchases of  investments  of $2.7 million
and $1.8 million of capital equipment  purchases.  During the first three months
of 1998,  financing  activities provided $1.1 million of cash primarily from the
sale of common stock under the SanDisk  employee stock purchase and stock option
plans.

         Depending  on the demand for the  Company's  products,  the Company may
decide to make  investments,  which could be  substantial,  in assembly and test
manufacturing equipment or foundry

                                    Page 13
<PAGE>


capacity to support its business in the future. Management believes the existing
cash and cash equivalents,  short term investments and available line of credit,
together  with  cash  flow  from  operations,  will be  sufficient  to meet  the
Company's   currently   anticipated  working  capital  and  capital  expenditure
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Impact of Currency Exchange Rates

         The Company  currently  purchases wafers from Matsushita under purchase
contracts  denominated  in yen. A portion  of the  Company's  revenues  are also
denominated in yen.  Foreign exchange  exposures  arising from the Company's yen
denominated  commitments and related  accounts  payable are offset to the extent
the Company has yen denominated  accounts  receivable and cash balances.  To the
extent such foreign exchange  exposures are not offset,  the Company enters into
foreign exchange forward  contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. At March 31, 1998, there were no forward contracts  outstanding.
Future exchange rate  fluctuations  could have a material  adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.


Risk Factors

         FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING  RESULTS.  SanDisk's  operating  results have
been and are  expected  to  continue  to be,  subject  to  quarterly  and annual
fluctuations due to a variety of factors. The principal factors that have caused
the Company's  operating  results to fluctuate in the past several  quarters and
may cause the  Company's  operating  results to  fluctuate in the future are the
seasonality  in sales of products  for  consumer  electronics  applications  and
unpredictable  demand for the  Company's  products.  For example,  the Company's
product revenues  declined in the first quarter of 1998 and 1997 from the fourth
quarter of the previous years, due to seasonal  factors.  The Company must order
silicon  wafers from its foundries  several months prior to the date such wafers
are needed.  If the Company  overestimates the number of silicon wafers it needs
to fill product orders and as a result builds excess inventories,  gross margins
and operating  results will be  materially  adversely  affected.  If the Company
underestimates the number of silicon wafers required in a particular quarter and
is unable to fulfill  customer  orders  promptly after receipt of an order,  the
Company will risk losing  potential  sales and  customers.  Since the Company is
selling  CompactFlash,  its largest volume  product,  into an emerging  consumer
market  and is unable to  accurately  forecast  future  sales,  there  will be a
material adverse effect on the Company's  operating  results if sales fall below
the Company's  expectations in a particular quarter and the Company is unable to
reduce its  operating  expenses.  The portion of the Company's  quarterly  sales
attributable  to orders  received and fulfilled in the same quarter remains high
and product order backlog fluctuates  substantially from quarter to quarter. See
"Seasonality" and "Dependence on Third Party Foundries."

         Other  factors  affecting  the  Company's  operating  results and gross
margins include the volume of product sales,  competitive pricing pressures, the
ability of the  Company to match  supply  with  demand,  changes in product  and
customer mix,  market  acceptance  of new or enhanced  versions of the Company's
products,  changes in the  channels  through  which the  Company's  products are
distributed,  timing  of new  product  announcements  and  introductions  by the
Company  and its  competitors,  the  timing  of  license  and  royalty  revenue,
fluctuations in product costs,  availability of foundry capacity,  variations in
manufacturing cycle time, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing
utilization,  the ability of the Company to achieve  manufacturing  efficiencies
with its new and existing products, increased research and development expenses,
exchange rate fluctuations and changes in general economic conditions, including
economic  conditions in Asia. All of these factors are difficult to forecast and
these or other factors can materially  affect the Company's  quarterly or annual
operating results or gross margins.

         The Company  has  increased  its  expense  levels to support its recent
growth,  including  expenses  associated  with the  expansion  of the  Company's
in-house  assembly  and test  operations.  The  Company  expects to  continue to
increase  its  operating  expenses  by hiring  additional  personnel  to support
expected  growth,  increased  marketing  efforts  and  additional  research  and
development activities. If the Company

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>


does not achieve increased levels of revenues  commensurate with these increased
levels of operating  expenses,  or if the Company's  revenues decrease or do not
meet the Company's expectations for a particular period, the Company's business,
financial  condition  and results of  operations  will be  materially  adversely
affected.

         The mix of the  Company's  products sold varies from quarter to quarter
and will vary in the future,  affecting the Company's  overall  average  selling
prices and gross margins. The Company's CompactFlash products, which represent a
significant  portion of the  Company's  product  revenues,  have  lower  average
selling prices and gross margins than the Company's  higher  capacity  FlashDisk
and FlashDrive products. The Company expects sales of CompactFlash products will
represent an increasing  percentage of product revenues as consumer applications
such as digital cameras become more popular.  This shift in product mix, coupled
with lower  pricing due to  competition,  is expected to cause  average  selling
prices to decline.

         The Company has  adopted a strategy of  cross-licensing  its patents to
other  manufacturers  of flash products.  Under such  arrangements,  the Company
earns license fees and royalties on terms that are individually negotiated.  The
timing of recognition  of revenues from these  payments  depends on the terms of
each  contract,  and, in some cases,  on the timing of product  shipments by the
third  parties.  As  a  result,  license  and  royalty  revenue  has  fluctuated
significantly  in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future.
Given the  relatively  high gross  margins  associated  with license and royalty
revenue,  gross margins and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes
in license and royalty revenue than with changes in product revenue.

         DEPENDENCE ON EMERGING MARKETS AND NEW PRODUCTS.  The Company's success
depends to a significant extent upon the development of emerging markets and new
applications  for flash  data  storage  systems,  as well as on its  ability  to
introduce commercially  attractive and competitively priced products on a timely
basis. The Company believes that continued significant expenditures for research
and  development  will be  required in the future.  In  particular,  the Company
intends to develop new products with increased  memory  capacity at a lower cost
per  megabyte,  which the Company  believes  will be essential to its ability to
remain  competitive.  In November 1997,  the Company  introduced a new removable
storage card product family, the MultiMediaCard ("MMC"). MMC is targeted for the
emerging  markets  for  mobile  smart  phones,   advanced  pagers  and  consumer
multimedia devices.  MMC will initially be offered in storage capacities of 2MB,
4MB and 8MB. The Company does not expect to generate  material revenues from MMC
sales in 1998.  There can be no  assurance  that the Company  will  successfully
develop any of these new products,  that new  applications  or markets for flash
data storage will develop as expected by the Company, that prospective customers
developing products for any such markets will design the Company's products into
their products and  successfully  introduce  such products,  or that products or
technologies  developed  by others  will not render the  Company's  products  or
technologies  obsolete or  noncompetitive.  The failure of new  applications  or
markets to develop or the  failure of the  Company's  products to be accepted by
the market  would  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

         INCREASING  DEPENDENCE ON CONSUMER  PRODUCTS.  Product revenues derived
from  sales of  products  for  consumer  electronics  applications,  principally
digital  cameras,  have  increased  significantly  and in 1997  represented  the
largest portion of product revenues and units shipped. The Company expects sales
of products for consumer applications to continue to represent the major portion
of  product  revenues  in 1998.  There can be no  assurance,  however,  that the
Company  will  achieve  large scale  market  acceptance  for its products in the
consumer  electronics  market.  The Company  anticipates  that products sold for
consumer  applications will generally  encounter intense competition and will be
more price  sensitive  than  products  sold into its other  target  markets.  In
addition,  consumer markets are more likely to experience  seasonality of sales,
with potential  declines in sales activity during the first quarter of any year.
Because of the large number of OEMs entering the digital  camera  market,  it is
likely  that not all of these  manufacturers  will be  successful  in  achieving
market  acceptance  of  their  products.  If  SanDisk's  OEM  customers  are not
successful in this market,  such OEM customers  may have excess  inventories  of
CompactFlash products, which may preclude follow-on orders or result in sales of
their CompactFlash inventories in the open

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>


market.  In addition,  if market  acceptance  of digital  cameras is slower than
expected,  or if the market for CompactFlash becomes saturated,  the Company may
encounter  reduced demand for CompactFlash  products,  declining average selling
prices or product  returns,  any of which  would  have an adverse  effect on the
Company's results of operations.

         The Company  anticipates that a greater  proportion of its sales to the
consumer  electronics market will be made through  distributors and to retailers
than  is the  case  with  the  industrial/communications  market.  This  will be
particularly  true if the level of  after-market  sales of flash memory products
increases. The Company is currently expending significant resources developing a
retail sales channel.  The  expenditures  associated  with this  development are
likely to precede the  realization  of  significant  sales through this channel.
Moreover,  the Company has no prior  experience in the development or management
of the retail channel or sales through such channel. In addition,  a significant
portion of retail sales for consumer  applications  will be made to distributors
and retail chains,  which typically  maintain rights to return unsold inventory.
As a result,  the Company does not  recognize  revenues on sales to this channel
until after the products have been sold to end users.  If the  Company's  retail
customers are not successful in this market,  there could be substantial product
returns to the Company.  The inability to  successfully  develop and effectively
manage the retail  sales  channel  could have a material  adverse  effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         SEASONALITY.  The  Company has  experienced  and expects to continue to
experience  seasonality  in its  product  sales.  A  significant  portion of the
Company's  product revenues are derived from the sale of CompactFlash  products,
which are sold principally for consumer electronics  applications.  As a result,
the  Company's  product  sales  have been and are  expected  to be  impacted  by
seasonal purchasing patterns,  with higher sales in the second half of each year
as  compared to the first half of each such year.  In the past,  the Company has
experienced  a reduction in order  quantities in the first quarter from Japanese
OEM  customers,  reflecting  the fact that most  customers in Japan operate on a
fiscal year ending in March and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of
their next fiscal year. As a result of these  factors,  product  revenues in the
first quarter of 1998 declined 24% from the level in the fourth quarter of 1997.

         COMPETITION.  The flash  data  storage  markets  in which  the  Company
competes are characterized by intense competition,  rapid technological  change,
evolving industry standards,  declining average selling prices and rapid product
obsolescence.   The  Company's  competitors  include  many  large  domestic  and
international   companies  that  have  greater   access  to  foundry   capacity,
substantially  greater  financial,  technical,  marketing  and other  resources,
broader product lines and longer standing  relationships with customers than the
Company.  The Company's primary competitors include flash chip producers such as
Advanced  Micro  Devices,  Inc.  ("AMD"),   Hitachi  Ltd.   ("Hitachi"),   Intel
Corporation ("Intel"), Micron Technology, Inc. ("Micron"), Mitsubishi Electronic
Corporation ("Mitsubishi"),  Samsung Electronics Company Ltd. ("Samsung"), Sharp
Electronics  Corporation  ("Sharp") and Toshiba Corporation  ("Toshiba"),  other
companies using data storage  techniques such as socket flash,  linear flash and
system flash  components,  as well as package or card  assemblers  such as Lexar
Media, Inc. ("Lexar"),  M-Systems,  Inc.  ("M-Systems"),  Simple Technology Inc.
("Simple"), SMART Modular Technologies,  Inc. ("Smart Modular"),  Kingston, TDK,
Matsushita Battery, Inc. ("Matsushita Battery") and Viking Components, Inc. that
combine  controllers  and flash  memory  chips  developed  by others  into flash
storage  cards.  Approximately  twenty  companies,   including  Hitachi,  Lexar,
Mitsubishi  and Micron have been  certified by the  CompactFlash  Association to
manufacture and sell their own brand of  CompactFlash,  and the Company believes
that other  manufacturers will also seek to enter the CompactFlash market in the
future.  Competing products promoting industry standards that are different from
SanDisk's CompactFlash product have been announced,  including Intel's Miniature
Card,  Toshiba's Smart Media (Solid-State  Floppy Disk Card), Sony Corporation's
Memory Stick, and Matsushita Battery's recently introduced Mega Storage cards. A
manufacturer  of digital  cameras that  designs-in any one of these  alternative
competing standards will eliminate CompactFlash from use in its product, as each
competing  standard  is  mechanically  and   electronically   incompatible  with
CompactFlash.  In  addition,  in the third  quarter of 1997,  Intel  announced a
64Mbit  flash chip based on its  multilevel  cell flash.  The  Company's  double
density  flash ("D2  flash") and  Intel's  multilevel  cell flash are  competing
technological innovations that allow each flash memory cell to

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>


store two bits of information  instead of the  traditional  single bit stored by
the industry  standard flash technology.  In November 1997,  Iomega  Corporation
("Iomega") announced its Clik drive, a miniaturized,  mechanical, removable disk
drive that  Iomega  claims  will  compete  directly  with  SanDisk's  flash card
products.

         The Company expects competition to increase in the future from existing
competitors  and from other  companies that may enter the Company's  existing or
future  markets with similar or alternative  data storage  solutions that may be
less costly or provide additional features. Due to the high price sensitivity in
the  market  for  consumer  products,  aggressive  price  competition  has  been
experienced for these  applications.  Such  competition is expected to result in
lower gross  margins in the future,  if the  Company's  average  selling  prices
decrease faster than its costs and could result in lost sales.

         The Company  has entered  into  patent  cross-license  agreements  with
Hitachi,  Intel,  Samsung,  Sharp and Toshiba,  pursuant to which each party may
manufacture and sell products that incorporate  technology  covered by the other
party's  patents related to flash memory  devices.  As the Company  continues to
license its patents to certain of its competitors, competition will increase. As
a result of the above factors,  the Company expects to face  substantially  more
competition in the future than it has to date. Increased  competition could have
a material  adverse effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results  of  operations.  The  Company  believes  that its  ability  to  compete
successfully  depends on a number of factors,  which  include price and quality,
product performance and availability, success in developing new applications for
system flash technology,  adequate foundry  capacity,  efficiency of production,
and timing of new product  announcements or  introductions  by the Company,  the
number and nature of the Company's  competitors  in a given  market,  successful
protection  of  intellectual  property  rights and general  market and  economic
conditions.  There can be no assurance  that the Company will be able to compete
successfully   against  current  and  future  competitors  or  that  competitive
pressures  faced  by the  Company  will  not  materially  adversely  affect  its
business, financial condition or results of operations.

         DECLINING  AVERAGE  SALES  PRICES.  The  Company has  experienced,  and
expects to  continue  to  experience,  declining  average  sales  prices for its
products.  The flash data  storage  markets in which the  Company  competes  are
characterized by intense  competition.  Therefore,  the Company expects to incur
increasing  pricing pressures from its customers in future periods,  which could
result in declining average sales prices for the Company's  products.  To offset
declining  average sales prices,  the Company  believes that it must continue to
achieve  manufacturing  cost  reductions  as well as develop new  products  that
incorporate  advanced  features and can be sold at higher average gross margins.
If, however,  the Company is unable to achieve such cost reductions,  it may not
be able to remain price competitive,  resulting in lost sales, and the Company's
gross margins could decline,  each of which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION. A limited number of customers have historically
accounted  for a substantial  portion of the Company's  revenues and the Company
expects this trend to continue.  Sales to the Company's  customers are generally
made pursuant to standard purchase orders rather than long-term  contracts.  The
Company has also experienced significant changes in the composition of its major
customer  base from year to year and  expects  this  variability  to continue as
certain customers increase or decrease their purchases of the Company's products
as a result of fluctuations in market demand for such customers' products. Under
a joint cooperation  agreement signed in January 1993, Seagate has the option to
market the Company's products  beginning in 1999 and, if exercised,  the Company
will be required to coordinate sales with Seagate so that up to one-third of the
Company's  worldwide net revenues could be generated from sales of the Company's
flash products through Seagate.

         DEPENDENCE  ON THIRD PARTY  FOUNDRIES.  All of the  Company's  products
require silicon wafers,  which are currently supplied by Matsushita in Japan and
United  Microelectronics  Corporation  ("UMC")  in  Taiwan.  The  Company  has a
development  agreement with NEC in Japan,  pursuant to which the Company expects
to receive initial wafer shipments once the products under development  complete
internal  qualification.  In the third  quarter  of 1997,  the  Company  made an
investment in USIC, a semiconductor

                                    Page 17
<PAGE>


manufacturing  venture headed by UMC in Taiwan, which has a fabrication facility
currently under construction. The Company has arranged to receive foundry wafers
from a separate UMC  fabrication  facility  during the  construction of the USIC
plant. The Company completed  qualification of these wafers in the first quarter
of 1998.  The Company is dependent on its foundries to allocate to the Company a
portion of their foundry  capacity  sufficient to meet the Company's  needs,  to
produce wafers of acceptable  quality and with acceptable  manufacturing  yields
and to deliver those wafers to the Company on a timely basis.  On occasion,  the
Company  has  experienced  difficulties  in each of  these  areas.  The  loss or
reduction  of capacity  from any of its foundry  suppliers  or the  inability to
qualify  or  receive  the  anticipated   level  of  capacity  from  any  of  its
manufacturing  partners  could have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  There  can be no
assurance that the NEC fabrication  facility will commence shipments on schedule
or that  the  USIC  facility  will be  completed  or will  begin  production  as
scheduled, or that the processes needed to fabricate wafers for the Company will
be qualified at either facility. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of
the Company's  suppliers will be able to maintain  acceptable  yields or deliver
sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis.

         Under each of the  Company's  wafer supply  agreements,  the Company is
obligated to provide a monthly rolling forecast of anticipated  purchase orders.
Except in limited circumstances and subject to acceptance by the foundries,  the
estimates  for the first  three  months of each  forecast  constitute  a binding
commitment  and the  estimates  for the  remaining  months may not  increase  or
decrease by more than a certain  percentage from the previous month's  forecast.
These   restrictions  limit  the  Company's  ability  to  react  to  significant
fluctuations in demand for its products.  As a result,  the Company has not been
able to match its purchases of wafers to specific  customer orders and therefore
the Company has taken write downs for potential excess inventory purchased prior
to the  receipt of  customer  orders and may be required to do so in the future.
These  adjustments  decrease  gross  margins in the  quarter  reported  and have
resulted,  and could in the future result in  fluctuations in gross margins on a
quarter to quarter basis. To the extent the Company  inaccurately  forecasts the
number of wafers required,  it may have either a shortage or an excess supply of
wafers,  either of which could have a material  adverse  effect on the Company's
business,  financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally,  if the
Company is unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers from any foundry with
acceptable yields, the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations  could  be  negatively  impacted.   See  "Fluctuations  in  Operating
Results."

         DEPENDENCE ON SOLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS AND THIRD PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS. The
Company purchases several critical components from single or sole source vendors
for  which  alternative  sources  are  not  currently   available.   Even  where
alternative  suppliers  are  available,  a  significant  amount of time would be
required to qualify an additional vendor in the case of certain of the Company's
components.  The Company does not maintain  long-term supply agreements with any
of these vendors.  The inability to develop alternative sources for these single
or sole source components or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components
could result in delays or reductions in product  shipments which could adversely
affect the Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of operations.
For example,  the Company  relies on  Motorola,  Inc.  ("Motorola")  as the sole
source of  microcontrollers,  which are  critical  components  in the  Company's
products. The sole source risk associated with microcontrollers from Motorola is
heightened  during  transitions from one generation of  microcontrollers  to the
next, given the limited safety stock available during these transitions.  In the
event Motorola were to discontinue  shipment of microcontrollers for any reason,
the time to design and qualify an alternative source would be approximately nine
to twelve  months.  The  Company's  reliance  on  Motorola as its sole source of
microcontrollers  exposes the Company to interruptions of supply that could have
a material  adverse effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         The Company  uses  third-party  subcontractors  to assemble  the memory
components for its products and from time to time uses other  subcontractors  to
perform certain other assembly and test functions.  The Company has no long term
agreements  with these  subcontractors.  As a result of this  reliance  on third
party  subcontractors  for  assembly of a portion of its  products,  the Company
cannot directly  control product delivery  schedules,  which can lead to product
shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase  manufacturing costs
of the Company's products. Any problems associated with the delivery,

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>


quality or cost of the Company's  products could have a material  adverse effect
on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

         RISKS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  TRANSITIONING  TO NEW  PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS.
Successive  generations  of the  Company's  products  incorporate  semiconductor
devices  with greater  memory  capacity  per chip.  In addition,  the Company is
continually  involved  in  joint  development  with  its  foundries  to  produce
semiconductor devices based upon smaller geometry manufacturing processes.  Both
the development of higher capacity  semiconductor devices and the implementation
of smaller geometry  manufacturing  processes are important  determinants of the
Company's  ability to decrease  the cost per  megabyte of its flash data storage
products.  The utilization of semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity
and the design and implementation of new semiconductor  manufacturing  processes
can  entail a  number  of  problems,  including  lower  yields  associated  with
semiconductor device production, problems associated with design and manufacture
of products to incorporate such devices,  and production delays.  Because of the
complexity of its products, the Company has periodically experienced significant
delays in the development and volume  production ramp up of its products.  There
can be no  assurance  that  similar  delays  will not occur in the  future.  Any
problems  experienced  by the  Company in its current or future  transitions  to
higher capacity memory devices or to new semiconductor  manufacturing  processes
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.

         The Company has developed new products based on D2 flash technology,  a
new flash  system  designed  to store two bits in each flash  memory  cell.  The
Company began low-volume  shipments of its 64Mbit D2 flash products in the third
quarter of 1997. The Company introduced its new 80Mbit D2 flash chip in November
1997 and expects to begin customer  shipments of products utilizing this chip in
the second half of 1998. The Company  experienced  delays in the production ramp
up of the 64Mbit D2 technology and has subsequently shifted its resources to the
qualification and production  startup of the second generation 80Mbit D2 design.
Consequently, product revenues from the 64Mbit D2 were not material in 1997. The
Company  believes  that D2 flash will be important to the  Company's  ability to
increase the capacity and decrease the cost of certain of its products, maintain
its  competitive  advantage,  broaden its target  markets and attract  strategic
partners.  High density flash memory,  such as D2 flash, is a complex technology
requiring tight manufacturing  controls and effective test screens. The shift to
volume production for new flash products is particularly prone to problems which
can impact both reliability and yields, thereby increasing  manufacturing costs.
There can be no assurance that reliable and cost effective D2 flash products can
be manufactured in commercial  volumes and with yields sufficient to result in a
lower cost per megabyte.  Furthermore, flash data storage products designed with
80Mbit D2 flash are expected to initially exhibit  approximately  one-quarter of
the write performance of the Company's  existing products when writing data into
memory, potentially limiting their use in certain applications,  such as digital
cameras.

         MANUFACTURING  YIELDS.  The fabrication of the Company's  products is a
complex  and precise  process  requiring  wafers  that are  produced in a highly
controlled and clean environment.  Semiconductor companies supplying the Company
with wafers  periodically have experienced  problems achieving  acceptable wafer
manufacturing yields.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of
design technology,  which is developed by the Company,  and process  technology,
which is typically  proprietary  to the  foundry.  Because low yields may result
from errors in either design or process technology failures,  yield problems may
not be  effectively  determined or improved  until an actual product exists that
can be analyzed and tested to recognize process sensitivities in relation to the
design rules that were used. As a result,  yield  problems may not be identified
until the wafers are well into the  production  process.  This risk is increased
due to the fact that the Company receives its wafers from  independent  offshore
foundries,  increasing the effort and time required to identify, communicate and
resolve  manufacturing  yield  problems.  There  can be no  assurance  that  the
Company's foundries will achieve or maintain acceptable  manufacturing yields in
the future.  The  inability  of the Company to achieve  planned  yields from its
foundries  could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,
financial condition and results of operations.

         PATENTS,  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND RELATED LITIGATION. The Company relies
on a  combination  of patents,  trademarks,  copyright  and trade  secret  laws,
confidentiality   procedures   and   licensing   arrangements   to  protect  its
intellectual  property rights. The Company has been notified in the past and the
Company and its  foundries may be notified in the future of claims that they may
be  infringing  patents or other  intellectual  property  rights  owned by third
parties.  In the past the Company  has been  involved  in  significant  disputes
regarding its  intellectual  property  rights and believes it may be involved in
similar disputes in the future. There can be no assurance that in the future any
patents held by the Company will not be invalidated, that patents will be issued
for any of the Company's  pending  applications  or that any claims allowed from
existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued
in the primary  countries  where the  Company's  products can be sold to provide
meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the Company.  Additionally,
competitors of the Company may be able to design around the Company's patents.

         To preserve its intellectual  property rights,  the Company believes it
may be  necessary  to initiate  litigation  against  one or more third  parties,
including but not limited to those the Company has already  notified of possible
patent  infringement.  In addition,  one or more of these parties may bring suit
against the  Company.  In March 1998,  the Company  filed a complaint in federal
court against Lexar for infringement of a fundamental  flashdisk  patent.  Lexar
has  disputed the  Company's  claim of patent  infringement.  In the event of an
adverse  result in any such  litigation,  the  Company  could be required to pay
substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products,
expend significant resources to develop non-infringing  technology,  discontinue
the use of certain  processes or obtain  licenses to the infringing  technology.
Any litigation, whether as a plaintiff or as a defendant, would likely result in
significant  expense to the  Company  and divert  the  efforts of the  Company's
technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is ultimately
determined in favor of the Company.  In addition,  the results of any litigation
are inherently  uncertain.  For example,  in 1995, the Company  informed Samsung
that the Company believed Samsung infringed certain of its patents. In response,
Samsung filed a complaint accusing the Company of infringing two of its patents.
The  Company  then filed a  complaint  against  Samsung  with the United  States
International  Trade  Commission  (the "ITC") alleging that Samsung and its U.S.
sales  arm  were  importing  and  selling  products  that  infringed  two of the
Company's patents.  After a hearing on this matter, the ITC issued an order that
both SanDisk patents were valid and that Samsung had infringed such patents, and
prohibited the import, sale, marketing, distribution or advertising of Samsung's
infringing  flash memory  circuits in the United  States.  In August  1997,  the
Company and Samsung entered into a settlement agreement resolving all aspects of
this  dispute,  pursuant to which the parties  agreed to  cross-license  certain
patents and Samsung agreed to make license and royalty  payments to the Company.
While the Company  believes it achieved a favorable  result in this matter,  the
expense and diversion of management  attention in connection with its resolution
were  substantial.  In addition,  the Company has notified  several  large flash
suppliers  that the Company  believes  certain of their  existing  or  announced
products infringe certain of the Company's patents.

         In the event the Company desires to incorporate  third party technology
into its  products or is found to infringe  on others'  patents or  intellectual
property  rights,  the  Company  may be  required  to  license  such  patents or
intellectual  property rights.  The Company may also need to license some or all
of its patent  portfolio to be able to obtain  cross-licenses  to the patents of
others. The Company currently has patent cross-license  agreements with Hitachi,
Intel,  Samsung,  Sharp and  Toshiba.  From time to time,  the  Company has also
entered into discussions with other companies regarding potential  cross-license
agreements for the Company's  patents.  However,  there can be no assurance that
licenses  will be  offered  or that the terms of any  offered  licenses  will be
acceptable to the Company.  If the Company obtains  licenses from third parties,
it may be required to pay license  fees or make  royalty  payments,  which could
have a material  adverse effect on the Company's  gross margins.  The failure to
obtain a license  from a third party for  technology  used by the Company  could
cause  the  Company  to  incur  substantial   liabilities  and  to  suspend  the
manufacture  of  products or the use by the  Company's  foundries  of  processes
requiring the technology,  or to expend  substantial  resources  redesigning its
products to  eliminate  the  infringement.  There can be no  assurance  that the
Company would be successful in redesigning its products or that such licenses

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>


would be available under reasonable terms. Furthermore,  any such development or
license  negotiations could require  substantial  expenditures of time and other
resources by the Company.

         As is common in the industry,  the Company agrees to indemnify  certain
of its suppliers and customers  for alleged  patent  infringement.  The scope of
such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances,  include  indemnification for
damages and expenses,  including  attorneys'  fees. The Company may from time to
time be engaged in litigation as a result of such  indemnification  obligations.
Third party claims for patent  infringement are excluded from coverage under the
Company's  insurance  policies.  There  can  be no  assurance  that  any  future
obligation to indemnify the  Company's  customers or suppliers,  will not have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial  condition and
results of operations.

         RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH  INTERNATIONAL  OPERATIONS.  All of the Company's
wafers  are,  and for the  foreseeable  future will be,  produced  by  foundries
located  outside the United States.  Because the Company  currently  purchases a
significant portion of its flash wafers in Japanese Yen at set prices, and bills
certain  customers in Japanese Yen,  fluctuations in currencies could materially
adversely  affect the  Company's  business,  financial  condition and results of
operations.  In addition,  gains and losses on the  conversion  to United States
dollars of accounts  receivable,  accounts payable and other monetary assets and
liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations
in the Company's results of operations.  Because sales of the Company's products
have been  denominated to date primarily in United States dollars,  increases in
the value of the United States dollar could  increase the price of the Company's
products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local
currency  of  a  particular  country,  leading  to  a  reduction  in  sales  and
profitability in that country.  Given the recent economic conditions in Asia and
the weakness of many Asian currencies  relative to the United States dollar, the
Company's  products may be relatively more expensive in Asia, which could result
in a decrease in the  Company's  sales in that  region.  Due to its  reliance on
export sales and its  dependence  on foundries  outside the United  States,  the
Company  is  subject  to  the  risks  of  conducting  business  internationally,
including foreign government  regulation and general  geopolitical risks such as
political  and  economic  instability,  potential  hostilities  and  changes  in
diplomatic  and trade  relationships.  Manufacturing  and sales of the Company's
products may also be materially adversely affected by factors such as unexpected
changes in, or  imposition  of,  regulatory  requirements,  tariffs,  import and
export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions,  longer payment cycles,
greater difficulty in accounts  receivable  collection,  potentially adverse tax
consequences,  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other
factors beyond the Company's control.  In addition,  the laws of certain foreign
countries in which the Company's products are or may be developed,  manufactured
or sold,  including  various  countries in Asia,  may not protect the  Company's
intellectual  property  rights to the same  extent as do the laws of the  United
States and thus make piracy of the Company's products a more likely possibility.
There can be no assurance  that these  factors will not have a material  adverse
effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.

         MANAGEMENT  OF GROWTH.  The Company has  recently  experienced  and may
continue to experience  rapid growth,  which has placed,  and could  continue to
place,  a  significant  strain  on the  Company's  limited  personnel  and other
resources. To manage such growth effectively,  the Company will need to continue
to implement and improve its operational,  financial and management  information
systems and to hire,  train,  motivate and manage its employees.  In particular,
the Company has recently experienced difficulty in hiring the engineering, sales
and  marketing  personnel  necessary  to  support  the  growth of the  Company's
business.  Competition  for such  personnel  is  intense,  and  there  can be no
assurance  that the Company will be successful in attracting  and retaining such
personnel  or that the Company  will be able to manage such growth  effectively.
The Company's ability to manage its growth will require a significant investment
in and  expansion of its existing  internal  information  management  systems to
support  increased  manufacturing,   accounting  and  other  management  related
functions.  The Company is in the process of  replacing  its  existing  in-house
information  system. The implementation of the new system will impact almost all
phases of the Company's operations (i.e., planning,  manufacturing,  finance and
accounting).  The new system is currently scheduled to become operational in the
second  half of  1998.  There  can be no  assurance  that the  Company  will not
experience  problems,  delays or unanticipated  additional costs in implementing
the new

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>


management  information  system or in the use of its existing  system that could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's  business,  financial  condition
and results of operations, particularly in the period in which the new system is
brought online.  The failure of the Company to successfully  manage any of these
issues would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

         DEPENDENCE  ON  KEY  PERSONNEL.  The  Company's  success  depends  to a
significant  degree upon the  continued  contributions  of members of its senior
management  and  other  key  research  and  development,  sales,  marketing  and
operations personnel,  including,  in particular,  Dr. Eli Harari, the Company's
founder,  President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of any of such persons
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition  and results of  operations.  The Company does not have an  employment
agreement or non-competition agreement with any of its employees.

         VOLATILITY  OF STOCK  PRICE.  There has been a history  of  significant
volatility  in the market  prices of the  Company's  Common  Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market,  and it is likely that the market price of the Company's Common
Stock will continue to be subject to significant  fluctuations.  For example, in
1997,  the Company's  stock price  fluctuated  from a low of $8 7/8 to a high of
$40. The Company believes that future announcements  concerning the Company, its
competitors or its principal customers, including technological innovations, new
product  introductions,  governmental  regulations,  litigation  or  changes  in
earnings  estimated by analysts,  may cause the market price of the Common Stock
to fluctuate  substantially in the future.  Sales of substantial  amounts of the
Company's  outstanding  Common  Stock  in the  public  market  could  materially
adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock.  Further, in recent years
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
particularly  affected  the  market  prices  of equity  securities  of many high
technology  companies  and that  often  have  been  unrelated  to the  operating
performance of such companies.  These  fluctuations as well as general economic,
political and market  conditions  such as recessions or  international  currency
fluctuations,  may  materially  adversely  affect the market price of the Common
Stock.

         YEAR 2000  COMPLIANCE.  Many currently  installed  computer systems and
software  products  are coded to accept only two digit  entries in the date code
field.  These  date code  fields  will  need to accept  four  digit  entries  to
distinguish  21st  century  dates from 20th  century  dates.  As a result,  many
companies'  software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in
order to comply with such "Year  2000"  requirements.  Certain of the  Company's
internal computer systems are not Year 2000 compliant,  and the Company utilizes
third-party  equipment  and software  that may not be Year 2000  compliant.  The
Company has  commenced  actions to correct such  internal  systems and is in the
early stages of conducting an audit of its third-party suppliers as to Year 2000
compliance of their systems.  Failure of the Company's internal computer systems
or of such third-party  equipment or software,  or of systems  maintained by the
Company's  suppliers,  to  operate  properly  with  regard  to the Year 2000 and
thereafter could require the Company to incur  unanticipated  expenses to remedy
any  problems,  which  could have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's
business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the purchasing
patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues
as companies expend  significant  resources to correct their current systems for
Year 2000 compliance.  These  expenditures may result in reduced funds available
to purchase the Company's  products,  which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

         EFFECT OF ANTI-TAKEOVER  PROVISIONS.  The Company has taken a number of
actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt that might
be  beneficial  to  stockholders  who wish to receive a premium for their shares
from a potential bidder.  The Company has adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan that
would cause substantial dilution to a person who attempts to acquire the Company
on terms not  approved by the  Company's  Board of  Directors.  The  Shareholder
Rights Plan may therefore  have the effect of delaying or preventing  any change
in  control  and  deterring  any  prospective  acquisition  of the  Company.  In
addition,  the  Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  grants  the  Board of
Directors the authority to issue up to 4,000,000  shares of Preferred  Stock and
to determine  the price,  rights,  preferences  and  privileges  of those shares
without any further vote or action by the Company's stockholders.  The rights of
the holders of

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>


Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of
the holders of any shares of  Preferred  Stock that may be issued in the future.
While the Company has no present  intention to issue shares of Preferred  Stock,
such issuance, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible
acquisitions  and other corporate  purposes,  could have the effect of making it
more difficult or less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of the
outstanding  voting stock of the  Company.  Such  Preferred  Stock may also have
other rights,  including  economic rights senior to the Common Stock,  and, as a
result,  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market
value  of  the  Common  Stock.  Furthermore,  the  Company  is  subject  to  the
anti-takeover  provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
("Section  203"),  which  prohibits  the  Company  from  engaging in a "business
combination" with an "interested  stockholder" for a period of three years after
the date of the  transaction  in which the person first  becomes an  "interested
stockholder,"  unless the  business  combination  is  approved  in a  prescribed
manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change of control of the Company.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION
