                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Network24 Communications, Inc.:

     In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements
of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Network24 Communications, Inc.
at December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

     On February 10, 2000, Network24 Communications, Inc. was acquired by Akamai
Technologies, Inc. (Note 10).

                         NETWORK24 COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS

     Network24 Communications, Inc. ("Network24") was founded in October 1997,
and is engaged in the business of hosting, on its own servers and its
proprietary EventCast broadcast management server platform, customized EventCast
websites for broadcasting live interactive and on-demand, online events.
Network24 manages its business as a single segment and has no organizational
structure dictated by product lines, geography, or customer type.  All revenue
earned to date is from U.S. based customers.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Network24 considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Network24
invests primarily in money market funds, commercial paper and United States
government agency notes.

  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

     Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets
ranging from three to five years. Assets held under capital leases are amortized
over the remaining lease term.

  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     At December 31, 1999 and 1998, Network24's financial instruments consist of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans payable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses. The carrying amount of these instruments approximate their
fair values.

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

     Network24 derives revenue from four principal activities: broadcast and
hosting; production; maintenance and service; and consulting, design and
development.

     Broadcast, hosting and production revenue is derived from the process of
delivering live programming with streaming audio and/or video to the end-users
desktop. Revenue is recognized when the event has been broadcast, all
significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the
related receivable is probable. Maintenance and service revenue consists of
amounts generated from server maintenance contracts and data backup service
contracts. Maintenance revenue is billed and recognized monthly over the
contractual periods services are provided. Consulting, design and development
revenue is derived primarily from the development of web sites used in
production and broadcast events. Revenue is recognized when the corresponding
production and broadcast revenue is recognized.

     Deferred revenue consists of billings in excess of revenue recognized.

  ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

     Cost incurred for engineering and development of Network24's products are
expensed as incurred, except for certain software development costs. Network24
has adopted Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1, which requires computer software
costs associated with internal use software to be charged to operations as
incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. Costs eligible for
capitalization under SOP 98-1 have been insignificant to date.

<PAGE>   11
                         NETWORK24 COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     Network24 accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic
value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations.
Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees
in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair
market value of Network24's common stock at the date of grant. Network24 has
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," through disclosure only
(Note 7). All stock-based awards to nonemployees are accounted for at their fair
value in accordance with SFAS No. 123.

  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS

     Financial instruments which potentially expose Network24 to concentration
of credit risk include trade accounts receivable. At December 31, 1999, three
customers accounted for 54%, 30% and 11% of Network24's accounts receivable. At
December 31, 1998, one customer accounted for 100% of Network24's accounts
receivable.

     For the year ended December 31, 1999, sales to two customers accounted for
77% and 13% of Network24's total revenue, while for the year ended December 31,
1998 sales to one customer accounted for 100% of Network24's total revenue.

  INCOME TAXES

     Network24 operated as an S Corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal
Revenue Code from inception to July 15, 1999 after which time Network24 has
operated as a C Corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.
During the S Corporation period, Network24 recognized no provision for income
taxes. All income, losses and credits flowed through to Network24's shareholders
and are, therefore, not available to offset future taxable income of Network24.
Had Network24 recognized a provision for income taxes during the S Corporation
period, the provision would have been nominal due to the net operating losses
incurred since inception.

     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
temporary differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred tax
assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized.

  USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles generally requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

</TABLE>

     Depreciation expense relating to fixed assets was $53,369 and $22,713 for
the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of which $13,369 and
$0, respectively, related to amortization of equipment held under capital
leases.

4.  LOAN PAYABLE -- SHAREHOLDER

     At December 31, 1998, Network24 issued a loan payable to an officer and
director of Network24. This loan was issued to meet short-term cash needs of
Network24. The note was noninterest bearing and was fully repaid in 1999.

5.  BRIDGE LOAN

     In July 1999, Network24 entered into a convertible subordinated promissory
note with a third party for $250,000. In August 1999, the note was converted
into 263,360 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock.

6.  CAPITAL STOCK

     In August 1999, Network24 issued 5,793,925 shares of Series A convertible
preferred stock at $0.95 per share to investors for total consideration of
$5,418,887, net of issuance costs of $81,113.

     The holders of the Series A preferred stock are entitled to vote, together
with the holders of common stock, as a single class on all matters. Each
preferred stockholder is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of
whole shares of common stock into which such shares convert. Each Series A
preferred share is convertible into common stock at the option of the
stockholder or automatically upon the closing of a public offering of
Network24's common stock, if a majority of Series A preferred stockholders elect
conversion, or if at any time there remains outstanding less than 10% of the
number of shares of Series A preferred stock issued on the original issue date.
The number of shares of common stock into which holders of the preferred stock
shall be entitled upon conversion shall be the product obtained by multiplying
the invested amount per share of Series A preferred stock by the number of
shares of Series A preferred stock being converted. The holders of the preferred
stock are entitled to receive dividends, when and if declared by the Board of
Directors, at a noncumulative rate of 4% per annum. No dividends may be paid on
the common stock until all dividends on the preferred stock have been fully
paid. Through December 31, 1999, no dividends have been declared or paid by
Network24. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
Network24, the holders of the Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive
an amount per share equal to the invested amount per share of Series A preferred
stock, plus all declared but unpaid dividends. Any assets remaining after the
initial distribution to the preferred stockholders shall be available for
distribution ratably among the common stockholders.

                         NETWORK24 COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  AUTHORIZED SHARES

     The authorized capital stock of Network24 consists of (i) 100,000,000
shares of voting common stock authorized for issuance with a par value of $0.01
and (ii) 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.01.

  STOCK SPLIT

     On August 3, 1998, Network24 authorized and effected a two-for-one stock
split on the common stock. On June 7, 1999, Network24 authorized and effected a
second two-for-one stock split on the common stock. All references to common
stock amounts, including options and warrants to purchase common stock, have
been retroactively restated to reflect the stock splits.

  WARRANTS

     In December 1999, Network24 entered into a strategic agreement with a
customer, whereby the parties have selected each other as their preferred
service providers. Additionally, the two parties will engage in a joint
promotional plan and co-branding arrangement. In connection with this agreement,
Network24 issued a warrant to purchase 1,136,605 shares of Network24's common
stock at an exercise price of $3.47 per share. Network24 estimated the value of
the warrants to be $7.1 million using the Black-Scholes valuation model. This
value was recorded as a deferred charge in shareholders' equity and is being
recognized as an expense over the contract period. For the year ended December
31, 1999, Network24 recorded $296,322 of the expense related to these warrants.
In January 2000, Network24 issued an additional warrant to purchase 436,272
shares of outstanding common stock to this customer at an exercise price of
$3.47 per share. Network24 has estimated the value of these warrants to be
$2,997,625 using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

  RESERVED SHARES

     At December 31, 1999, Network24 had reserved 10,870,530 shares of common
stock for future issuance upon conversion of the Series A convertible preferred
stock, the exercise of stock options under the 1997 Stock Option Plan and the
exercise of outstanding warrants.

7.  1997 OPTION PLAN

     In October 1997, Network24 adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "1997
Option Plan") which provides for the granting of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options to employees, including Board members, and
consultants of Network24. The Board of Directors is responsible for
administration of the plan. The Board determines the term of each option, the
option exercise price, the number of shares for which each option is exercisable
and the vesting period, generally ratably over one to four years. The exercise
price of incentive stock options shall not be less than 100% of the fair value
of the common stock at the date of grant (not less than 110% of fair value in
the case of holders of more than 10% of the Company's stock). Options granted
under the 1997 Option Plan generally expire ten years from the date of the
grant. The 1997 Option Plan allows for the issuance of options to purchase up to
3,940,000 shares of common stock. In the event of a "Corporate Transaction," as
defined by the Internal Revenue Code Section 424(a), whereby a successor
corporation, other than Network24, refuses to assume or substitute options
granted under the 1997 stock option plan, the plan allows for all options to

</TABLE>

     In 1998, 1,340,000 options were granted with an exercise price less than
fair market value of the common stock. The weighted average exercise price and
weighted average fair value of options granted in 1998 were $0.04 and $0.31 per
share, respectively. In 1999, 2,011,081 and 20,000 options were granted with an
exercise price less than the fair market value and with an exercise price equal
to the fair market value, respectively. The weighted average exercise price and
weighted average fair value of options granted at an exercise price less than
fair market value were $0.65 and $3.06 per share, respectively. The weighted
average exercise price and weighted average fair value of options granted at an
exercise price equal to fair market value were $0.65 and $0.09 per share,
respectively.

     As discussed in Note 2, Network24 has adopted the disclosure-only provision
of SFAS No. 123. Had compensation costs been determined based on the fair value
of the options granted to employees at the grant date consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Network24's net loss would have been as follows:

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the minimum value method with the following assumptions for grants in 1999 and
1998: no dividend yield for both years; zero volatility for both years;
risk-free interest rates of 5.2% for 1999 and 4.7% to 5.5% for 1998; and
expected lives of three years for both years. Since options vest over several
years and additional option grants are expected to be made in future years, the
above pro forma results are not representative of pro forma results for future
years.

     For the year ended December 31, 1999, Network24 recorded $6,022,017 in
deferred compensation for options to purchase common stock granted at exercise
prices determined to be below the fair market value of common stock. For the
year ended December 31, 1998, Network24 recorded $413,074 in deferred
compensation for options to purchase common stock granted at exercise prices
determined to be below the fair market value of the common stock. Deferred
compensation is amortized over the contractual vesting period. Amortization of
deferred compensation of $268,071 and $82,222 was recognized for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

8.  INCOME TAXES

     The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1999
consists of the following:

     The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of deferred tax assets at December 31, 1999 are as follows:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

     A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all
or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Accordingly, a
valuation allowance has been recorded for the full amount of the deferred tax
asset.

     As of December 31, 1999, Network24 has a net operating loss carryforward
for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $1,700,000, which
will begin to expire in 2019. Ownership changes resulting from issuance of
capital stock may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can
be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. The amount of the annual
limitation is determined based upon Network24's value immediately prior to the
ownership change.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Prior to July 15, 1999, Network24 operated as an S Corporation under
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and consequently, all income, loss,
and credits flowed directly to Network24's shareholders. Accordingly, only 1999
amounts are presented.

 9.  COMMITMENTS

     Network24 leases its office facilities and certain equipment under various
operating and capital leases. Total rent expense under operating leases was
approximately $123,787 and $25,482 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Future minimum lease commitments under capital leases and
operating leases are as follows:

                             FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
gives effect to the acquisition by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai") of
Network24 Communications, Inc. ("Network24") in a transaction to be accounted
for as a purchase. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet is
based on the individual balance sheets of Akamai and Network24 and has been
prepared to reflect the acquisition by Akamai of Network24 at December 31, 1999.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of continuing operations is
based on the individual statements of continuing operations of Akamai and
Network24, and combines the results of continuing operations of Akamai and
Network24 for the year ended December 31, 1999 as if the acquisition occurred on
January 1, 1999.

     The pro forma combined condensed financial information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial
position or operating results that would have been achieved if the acquisition
had been consummated as of the beginning of the period presented, nor are they
necessarily indicative of the future financial position or operating results of
Akamai. The pro forma combined condensed financial information does not give
effect to any cost savings or restructuring and integration costs which may
result from the integration of Akamai's and Network24's operations. Such costs
related to restructuring and integration have not yet been determined and Akamai
expects to charge such costs to operations during the quarter incurred.

     Pursant to Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X, the unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial information is based on continuing operations only and
excludes the results of extraordinary items.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be
read in conjunction with Akamai's audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1999 on file with Securities and Exchange Commission and
Network24's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1999
included elsewhere in this Form 8-K/A.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                             FINANCIAL INFORMATION

A.  PRO FORMA BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
gives effect to the acquisition by Akamai of Network24 in a transaction
accounted for as a purchase. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance
sheet is based on the individual balance sheets of Akamai and Network24 and has
been prepared to reflect the acquisition by Akamai of Network24 at December 31,
1999. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of continuing
operations is based on the individual statements of continuing operations of
Akamai and Network24, and combines the results of continuing operations of
Akamai and Network24 for the year ended December 31, 1999 as if the acquisition
occurred on January 1, 1999.

     Akamai issued 599,152 shares of Akamai common stock and $12.5 million in
cash in exchange for all outstanding shares of common and preferred stock of
Network24. Akamai also issued options exercisable for 136,877 shares of common
stock and warrants exercisable for 58,985 shares of common stock in replacement
of options and warrants for common stock of Network24.

B.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
    FINANCIAL INFORMATION

1.  The unaudited pro forma combined per share amounts are based on the pro
    forma combined weighted average number of common shares which equals
    Akamai's weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period
    plus the total number of Akamai common shares that were issued in the
    acquisition of Network24. On February 10, 2000, Akamai issued 599,152 shares
    of common stock in exchange for all outstanding common and Series A
    preferred shares of Network24. All potential common stock equivalents of
    Akamai and Network24 have been excluded from the calculation of pro forma
    loss from continuing operations per common share as their inclusion would be
    anti-dilutive.

2.  Akamai estimates the purchase price to be approximately $198.2 million based
    on the consideration paid to Network24 shareholders including common stock,
    options, warrants and $12.5 million in cash, plus acquisition related
    expenses. For purposes of measuring the value of the transaction, the value
    of the common stock issued was based on the average closing price of
    Akamai's common stock three days before and after the parties agreed to the
    terms and the terms were announced. The value of options and warrants issued
    were estimated using the Black Scholes valuation model. Akamai is currently
    in the process of performing a full assessment of the fair value of the net
    assets acquired. For the purposes of the preparation of the pro forma
    combined condensed financial information, Akamai has allocated $3.7 million
    of the purchase price to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    based on the book value as of December 31, 1999. The remainder has been
    allocated to intangible assets which are expected to include: completed
    technology, workforce, trademarks and goodwill. Based on an estimated useful
    life of three years for such intangible assets, the unaudited pro forma
    combined condensed financial information includes an adjustment of $64.8
    million for amortization expense. The allocation of the purchase price to
    tangible and intangible assets, as well as the related amortization expense
    may change materially as a result of the completion of Akamai's evaluation
    of the fair value of the net assets acquired.

3.  Increase in accrued expenses for estimated acquisition related expenses of
    $1,600,000.

4.  Increase in stockholders' equity for the issuance of 599,152 shares of
    Akamai common stock.

5.  Elimination of Network24 equity accounts.

6.  Certain reclassification, none of which affects income from continuing
    operations, have been made to the Network24 statement of operations in the
    unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of continuing operations
    to classify equity related compensation on a consistent basis.
