                     UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
                             FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
gives effect to the acquisition by Akamai of INTERVU as well as the acquisition
of Network24. These transactions are being accounted for as purchases. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet is based on the individual
historical balance sheets of Akamai, INTERVU and Network24 and has been prepared
to reflect the acquisition by Akamai of INTERVU and Network24 at December 31,
1999. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of continuing
operations is based on the individual historical statements of continuing
operations of Akamai, INTERVU and Network24, and combines the results of
continuing operations of Akamai, INTERVU and Network24 for the year ended
December 31, 1999 as if the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 1999.

     The pro forma combined condensed financial information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial
position or operating results that would have been achieved if the acquisitions
had been completed as of the beginning of the period presented, nor are they
necessarily indicative of the future financial position or operating results of
Akamai. The pro forma combined condensed financial information does not give
effect to any cost savings or restructuring and integration costs that may
result from the integration of Akamai's, INTERVU's and Network24's operations.
The costs related to restructuring and integration have not yet been determined
and Akamai expects to charge these costs to operations during the quarter
incurred.

     Pursuant to Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X, the unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial information is based on continuing operations only and
excludes the results of extraordinary items.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes
of Akamai, INTERVU and Network24 included in Akamai's Registration Statement on
Form S-4 (File No. 333-31712), as amended, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on March 3, 2000.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

A. PRO FORMA BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
assumes the acquisition by Akamai of INTERVU as well as the acquisition of
Network24 in transactions to be accounted for as purchases. The unaudited pro
forma combined condensed balance sheet is based on the individual balance sheets
of Akamai, INTERVU and Network24 and has been prepared to reflect the
acquisition by Akamai of INTERVU and Network24 at December 31, 1999. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of continuing operations is
based on the individual statements of continuing operations of Akamai, INTERVU
and Network24, and combines the results of continuing operations of Akamai,
INTERVU and Network24 for the year ended December 31, 1999 as if the
acquisitions occurred on January 1, 1999.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, upon completion of the merger, Akamai
expects to issue 9.9 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all
outstanding shares of INTERVU common stock and INTERVU preferred stock based on
an exchange ratio of 0.5957. In addition, Akamai will exchange options and
warrants exercisable for INTERVU common stock for options and warrants
exercisable for 2.1 million shares of Akamai common stock.

     On February 10, 2000, Akamai issued 599,152 shares of Akamai common stock
in exchange for all outstanding shares of common and preferred stock of
Network24. Akamai also issued options exercisable for 136,877 shares of common
stock and warrants exercisable for 58,985 shares of common stock in replacement
of outstanding options and warrants for common stock of Network24.

B. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     1. The unaudited pro forma combined per share amounts are based on the pro
        forma combined weighted average number of shares of Akamai common stock
        which equals Akamai's weighted average number of shares of Akamai common
        stock outstanding for the period plus 9.9 million shares of Akamai
        common stock that are expected to be issued at the completion of the
        acquisition of INTERVU and the 599,152 shares of Akamai common stock
        issued in the acquisition of Network24. All potential common stock
        equivalents of Akamai, INTERVU and Network24 have been excluded from the
        calculation of pro forma loss from continuing operations per common
        share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

     2. Akamai estimates the purchase price for Network24 to be approximately
        $198.2 million based on the consideration paid to Network24 stockholders
        including common stock, options, warrants and cash, plus acquisition
        related expenses. For purposes of measuring the value of the
        transaction, the value of the Akamai common stock issued was based on
        the average closing price of Akamai's common stock three days before and
        after the parties agreed to the terms of the acquisition and the terms
        were announced. The value of options and warrants issued were estimated
        using the Black Scholes valuation model. Akamai is currently in the
        process of performing a full assessment of the fair value of the net
        assets acquired. For the purposes of the preparation of the pro forma
        combined condensed financial information, Akamai has allocated $3.7
        million of the purchase price to tangible assets acquired and
        liabilities assumed based on the book value as of December 31, 1999. The
        remainder has been allocated to intangible assets which are expected to
        include: completed technology, workforce, trademarks and goodwill. Based
        on an estimated useful life of three years for such intangible assets,
        the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
        includes an adjustment of $64.8 million for amortization expense. The
        allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets, as
        well as the related amortization expense may change materially as a
        result of the completion of Akamai's evaluation of the fair value of the
        net assets acquired.

     3. Akamai estimates the purchase price for INTERVU to be approximately
        $2.837 billion based on the consideration to be paid to INTERVU
        stockholders including common stock, options and

                                      F-4

        warrants, plus acquisition related expenses. For purposes of measuring
        the value of the transaction, the value of the Akamai common stock
        issued was based on the average closing price of Akamai's common stock
        three days before and after the parties agreed to the terms of the
        acquisition and the terms were announced. The value of options and
        warrants to be issued were estimated using the Black Scholes valuation
        model. Akamai is currently in the process of performing a full
        assessment of the fair value of the net assets acquired. For the
        purposes of the preparation of the pro forma combined condensed
        financial information, Akamai has allocated $156.2 million of the
        purchase price to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
        on the book value as of December 31, 1999, including $20.0 million of
        CNN prepaid advertising recorded as a component of stockholders' equity.
        The remainder has been allocated to intangible assets which are expected
        to include: completed technology, workforce, patents, trademarks and
        goodwill. Based on an estimated useful life of three to five years for
        such intangible assets, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
        financial information includes an adjustment of $536.1 million for
        amortization expense. The allocation of the purchase price to tangible
        and intangible assets, as well as the related amortization expense may
        change materially as a result of the completion of Akamai's evaluation
        of the fair value of the net assets acquired.

     4. Increase in accrued expenses for estimated acquisition related expenses
        of $27.9 million for INTERVU and $1.6 million for Network24.

     5. Increase in stockholders' equity for the issuance of 599,152 shares of
        Akamai common stock for the acquisition of Network24 and 9.9 million
        shares of Akamai common stock expected to be issued at the completion of
        the acquisition of INTERVU. As a result, the recorded value of Akamai
        common stock and additional paid-in capital increased $6,000 and $184.1
        million, respectively, for the acquisition of Network24 and $100,000 and
        $2.809 billion, respectively, for the acquisition of INTERVU.

     6. Elimination of Network24 and INTERVU equity accounts.

     7. Certain reclassification, none of which affects loss from continuing
        operations, have been made to the Network24 and INTERVU statements of
        operations in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
        continuing operations to classify equity related compensation on a
        consistent basis.
