                    IBM ANNOUNCES THIRD-QUARTER 1999 RESULTS

      ARMONK, N.Y., October 20, 1999 . . .IBM today announced third-quarter 1999
diluted earnings per common share of $.93 compared with diluted earnings per
common share of $.78 in the third quarter of 1998. Third-quarter 1999 revenues
increased 5 percent as reported and in constant currency to $21.1 billion.
Third-quarter 1999 net income totaled $1.8 billion compared with $1.5 billion in
the third quarter of last year.

      IBM's third-quarter 1999 results include an after-tax benefit of $63
million, or $.03 per diluted common share, resulting from several actions that
occurred in the quarter. Specifically, IBM closed the sale of its Global Network
in a number of additional geographic areas. The company completed three
acquisitions, resulting in charges for in-process research and development. IBM
also took additional actions in the quarter to improve the competitiveness of
the company's Technology Group.

      Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., IBM chairman and chief executive officer, said:
"It was a decidedly mixed quarter. On the negative side, we saw a Y2K slowdown
toward the end of the quarter, particularly in our large servers, and to a
lesser extent in services and operating systems software. Additionally, we were
hurt by shortages of flat-panel displays, margin pressure in our hard disk drive
business, and sales disruptions related to our sale of certain networking
hardware assets. On the positive side, our growth businesses -- services,
software other than operating systems, and OEM -- all performed very well.
Combined with strong expense management, they enabled us to grow our pre-tax
earnings and earnings per share significantly, once again underscoring the
strength of our broad business portfolio.

      "Looking forward, we believe we will continue to feel the effects of the
Y2K slowdown in the fourth quarter and into early next year," Mr. Gerstner said.
"However, even though it is difficult to make predictions, next year has the
potential to be a very good year for IBM, once we get past any lingering Y2K
effects. As our third-quarter results demonstrate, our business portfolio has
great breadth and resiliency. We remain confident about our fundamental business
strategies, the value of our products and services, and our overall momentum."

      Third-quarter revenues from the Americas totaled $9.6 billion, a decrease
of 1 percent (up 1 percent at constant currency) compared with the third quarter
of 1998. Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were $5.8 billion, down 2
percent (up 4 percent at constant currency). Asia-Pacific revenues grew 28
percent (10 percent at constant currency) to $3.7 billion. OEM revenues totaled
$2.0 billion, an increase of 24 percent (22 percent at constant currency).

      Hardware revenues were $8.8 billion in the third quarter, a decrease of 1
percent (2 percent at constant currency) compared with the same period of last
year. Personal computer revenues increased, with particularly strong growth in
the Netfinity server line. Microelectronics revenues also increased, while
RS/6000 revenues declined slightly. The Y2K issue adversely affected AS/400
revenues to a significant degree and System/390 revenues -- which faced a
difficult year-over-year comparison -- also fell due to the Y2K slowdown and
ongoing price reductions. Storage revenues were flat and networking hardware
revenues declined significantly from the same period of last year.

      Revenues from IBM Global Services, after normalizing for the Global
Network sale, increased 19 percent in the quarter (excluding maintenance).
Including maintenance, and without normalizing for the Global Network sale,
Global Services revenues grew 12 percent (11 percent at constant currency) to
$7.9 billion. IBM signed $9.2 billion in services contracts in the quarter and
concluded the period with a total services contract backlog of approximately
$57.5 billion. The Global Services gross margin improved 1.7 points year over
year.

      Software revenues increased 7 percent (8 percent at constant currency) in
the third quarter to $3.0 billion. Revenues from the "middleware" category --
software that is critical for e-business -- increased 13 percent (14 percent at
constant currency), with particularly strong results in Tivoli systems
management, transaction processing and database products. IBM also posted record
shipments of the company's Lotus Notes/Domino groupware products in the third
quarter. In addition, IBM acquired DASCOM, Inc., a leader in the Web-security
market.

      Revenues from Global Financing increased 14 percent (14 percent at
constant currency) in the third quarter to $774 million.

      Revenues from the Enterprise Investments/Other area, which comprises
custom applications and other products designed to meet specialized customer
requirements, declined 3 percent (3 percent at constant currency) year over year
to $622 million.

      IBM's overall gross profit margin was 35.8 percent in the third quarter
compared with 37.2 percent in the third quarter of 1998. The transition in the
networking hardware business negatively affected the company's overall gross
margin by .7 of a point and the hardware margin by 1.6 points.

      IBM's third-quarter expenses of $4.9 billion also include the effect of
the various actions mentioned earlier, totaling $345 million, that occurred
during the quarter. The company improved its expense-to-revenue ratio by 3.2
points, of which 1.6 points are attributable to the third-quarter actions.

      IBM's tax rate in the quarter, including the third-quarter actions, was
33.0 percent compared with 30.0 percent in the third quarter of 1998. IBM's tax
rate increased by approximately 3 points in the quarter, primarily as a result
of the third-quarter actions.

      IBM spent approximately $1.5 billion on share repurchases in the third
quarter. The average number of basic common shares outstanding in the quarter
was 1,805 million compared with 1,857 million in the year-earlier period. There
were 1,803 million basic common shares outstanding at September 30, 1999.

      Debt in support of operations, excluding global financing, decreased $1.1
billion from year-end 1998 to $568 million, resulting in a
debt-to-capitalization ratio of 4 percent. Global financing debt declined $418
million from the end of 1998 to a total of $27.3 billion, resulting in a
debt-to-equity ratio of 5.7 to 1.

      Despite spending $1.5 billion on share repurchases and reducing debt by
$1.1 billion, IBM completed the quarter with $6 billion in cash.

      Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1999, including the
effect of actions taken in the second and third quarters, was $5.6 billion, or
$2.99 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $4.0 billion, or
$2.05 per diluted common share, in the year-earlier period. Through the first
nine months of 1999, IBM's diluted earnings per share grew 46 percent, with 20
points of that growth attributable to actions taken in the second and third
quarters. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 1999 were $63.4
billion, an increase of 12 percent (12 percent at constant currency) compared
with $56.5 billion in the same period of 1998.

                              Third-Quarter Actions

      --    In December 1998, IBM announced that it would sell its Global
            Network business to AT&T for $5 billion. In the third quarter of
            1999, IBM completed the sales of the Global Network in 34 countries
            for approximately $730 million, bringing the year-to-date total to
            38 countries and $4.9 billion. In the third quarter, IBM recognized
            a pre-tax gain of $586 million ($366 million after tax, or $.19 per
            diluted common share) related to this transaction.

      --    In the third quarter of 1999, IBM completed the acquisitions of
            Sequent Computer Systems, Inc. and the Mylex Corporation in addition
            to DASCOM, Inc. These actions are intended to improve IBM's
            long-term competitiveness in the server, storage, and Web-security
            markets, respectively. As a result of these acquisitions, IBM
            recorded a pre-tax charge of $111 million ($111 million after tax,
            or $.06 per diluted common share) for in-process research and
            development.

      --    During the third quarter of 1999, IBM took a number of additional
            actions to improve the competitiveness of its Technology Group.
            These actions principally involved two divisions within the
            Technology Group, the Networking Hardware Division and the Storage
            Systems Division. In the networking area, IBM entered into a
            strategic agreement with Cisco Systems under which the two companies
            will offer a full spectrum of services and solutions for customers'
            e-business and networking needs. In the storage area, IBM continued
            to take steps in the third quarter to consolidate certain
            development operations. As a result of these third-quarter actions,
            IBM recognized pre-tax writedowns totaling $274 million ($192
            million after tax, or $.10 per diluted common share).
