                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
     IBM develops, manufactures and sells advanced information processing
products, including computers and microelectronic technology, software,
networking systems and information technology-related services. IBM offers value
worldwide through its United States, Canada, Europe/Middle East/Africa, Latin
America, and Asia/Pacific business units, by providing comprehensive and
competitive product choices.
 
     The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future
revenues due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume
of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product
delivery schedules. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is
not material to an understanding of its business.
 
     IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its products.
Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others.
IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any
particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.
 
     The following information is included in IBM's 1993 Annual Report to
Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:
 
        1. Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or
           services--Pages 59 and 60
 
        2. Financial information by geographic areas--Pages 61 and 62
 
        3. Amount spent during each of the last three years on research and
           development activities--Page 45
 
        4. The number of persons employed by the registrant--Page 31

        5. Management discussion overview --Pages 20 and 21

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES:
     At December 31, 1993, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the
United States had aggregate floor space of 57.4 million square feet, of which
46.6 million was owned and 10.8 million was leased. Of these amounts, 4.3
million square feet was vacant and .7 million square feet was being leased to
non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 21.8
million square feet, of which 18.3 million was owned and 3.5 million was leased.
Of these amounts, .6 million square feet was vacant and .3 million square feet
was being leased to non-IBM businesses.
 
     Although improved production techniques, productivity gains, and
restructuring actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space,
continuous upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological
leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand. For additional
information on expenditures for plant and other property, refer to page 27
(Investments) of IBM's 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders which is incorporated
herein by reference.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS:
     No material pending legal proceedings.
 
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS:
     Not applicable.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON
                         FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES
 
To the Board of Directors of
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our report
dated February 16, 1994 (which refers to the changes in the methods of
accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993, income taxes in 1992, and
nonpension postretirement benefits in 1991) appearing on page 19 of the 1993
Annual Report to Stockholders of International Business Machines Corporation
(which report and consolidated financial statements are incorporated by
reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included an audit of the
Financial Statement Schedules listed in Item 14(a)2 of this Form 10-K. In our
opinion, these Financial Statement Schedules present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements.

Note--
 
     The balance at end of period excludes the current portion of long-term debt
of $4,006 million, $3,256 million, and $4,363 million for the years 1993, 1992,
and 1991, respectively.
 
     Effective 1993, short-term loan amounts in subsidiaries where the economic
environment is highly inflationary, were primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.
In prior years, these loans were denominated in local currencies, and the high
interest rates in those operations were largely offset by the effects of
inflation on funds borrowed. If the inflationary effects of these loans were
excluded, the weighted average interest rate at year-end would have been 7.5%
and 8.7% for the years 1992 and 1991, respectively, and the weighted average
interest rate during the year would have been 7.8% and 9.0% for 1992 and 1991,
respectively.
 
     The average amount outstanding during the year and the weighted average
interest rate during the year were calculated by averaging the quarterly
balances and rates.

                                     of

                INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION


ONE:  The name of the corporation (hereinafter called "the Corporation") is

activity for which corporations may be organized and to exercise powers
granted under the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York,

requiring the consent or approval of any state official, department, board,
agency, or other body without such consent or approval first being
obtained.

THREE:     The aggregate number of shares that the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 900,000,000 shares, consisting of 750,000,000 shares
of the par value of $1.25 per share, which shall be designated "capital
stock" and 150,000,000 shares of the par value of $.01 per share, which
shall be designated "preferred stock."

FOUR:  (1) Subject to the provisions of the By-laws, as from time to time
amended, with respect to the closing of the transfer books and the fixing
of a record date, each share of the capital stock of the Corporation shall
be entitled to one vote on all matters requiring a vote of the stockholders
and, subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of
preferred stock issued under this Article FOUR, shall be entitled to
receive such dividends, in cash, securities, or property, as may from time
to time be declared by the Board of Directors.  In the event of any
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, either
voluntary or involuntary, after payment shall have been made to the holders
of preferred stock of the full amount to which they shall be entitled under
this Article FOUR, the holders of capital stock shall be entitled, to the
exclusion of the holders of the preferred stock of any series, to share
ratably, according to the number of shares held by them, in all remaining
assets of the Corporation available for distribution.

(2) The Board of Directors is authorized, at any time or from time to time,
to issue preferred stock and (i) to divide the shares of preferred stock
into series; (ii) to determine the designation for any such series by
number, letter, or title that shall distinguish such series from any other
series of preferred stock; (iii) to determine the number of shares in any
such series (including a determination that such series shall consist of a
single share); and (iv) to determine with respect to the shares of any
series of preferred stock:

(a) whether the holders thereof shall be entitled to cumulative,
noncumulative, or partially cumulative dividends and, with respect to
shares entitled to dividends, the dividend rate or rates, including without
limitation the methods and procedures for determining such rate or rates,
and any other terms and conditions relating to such dividends;

(b) whether, and if so to what extent and upon what terms and conditions,
the holders thereof shall be entitled to rights upon the liquidation of, or
upon any distribution of the assets of, the Corporation;

(c) whether, and if so upon what terms and conditions, such shares shall be
convertible into, or exchangeable for, other securities or property;

(d) whether, and if so upon what terms and conditions, such shares shall be
redeemable;

(e) whether the shares shall be subject to any sinking fund provided for
the purchase or redemption of such shares and, if so, the terms of such
fund;

(f) whether the holders thereof shall be entitled to voting rights and, if
so, the terms and conditions for the exercise thereof, provided that the
holders of shares of preferred stock (i) will not be entitled to more than
the lesser of (x) one vote per $100 of liquidation value or (y) one vote
per share, when voting as a class with the holders of shares of capital
stock, and (ii) will not be entitled to vote on any matter separately as a
class, except, to the extent specified with respect to each series, (x)
with respect to any amendment or alteration of the provisions of this
Certificate of Incorporation that would adversely affect the powers,
preferences, or special rights of the applicable series of preferred stock
or (y) in the event the Corporation fails to pay dividends on any series of
preferred stock in full for any six quarterly dividend payment periods,
whether or not consecutive, in which event the number of directors may be
increased by two and the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock
then similarly entitled shall be entitled to elect the two additional
directors until full accumulated dividends on all such shares of preferred
stock shall have been paid; and

(g) whether the holders thereof shall be entitled to other preferences or
rights and, if so, the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of such
preferences or rights.

(3)  Provisions relating to the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock.

(a)  Designation, Number, and Liquidation Preference.  A series of
     -----------------------------------------------
preferred stock is hereby designated "Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock".
The number of Shares constituting the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock is
12,000,000.  Shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall have a par
value of $.01 and a liquidation preference of $100 per share.  The number
of authorized shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock may be
increased or decreased, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, by
amending this paragraph.

(b)  Dividend Rate.
     -------------

(i)  Shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive dividends at a fixed annual rate of $7.50 per share.  Such








 2.

<PAGE>

dividends shall be cumulative from the date of original issue of such
shares and shall be payable, when and as declared by the Board of
Directors, quarterly for each of the quarters ending March, June, September
and December of each year, in arrears on the first business day of each
April, July, October and January, commencing July 1, 1993.  Each such
dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of the Series A
7-1/2% Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock register on the
applicable record date, which shall be the 15th day prior to the payment
date thereof.  Dividends on account of arrears for any past dividend
periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any
regular dividend payment date, to holders of record on such date as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors which shall not exceed 30 days preceding
such dividend payment date thereof.

(ii) No dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any
shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation or any series
thereof ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or junior to the Series
A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock for any period unless full cumulative dividends
have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum
sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment, on the
Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock for all dividend payment periods
terminating on or prior to the date of payment of such full cumulative
dividends.  When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the
shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock and any other shares of any
class or classes of stock or series thereof ranking on a parity as to
dividends with the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock, all dividends declared
upon shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock and any other shares of
such class or classes or series thereof ranking on a parity as to dividends
with the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that
the amount of dividends declared per share on the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred
Stock and such other shares shall in all cases bear to each other the same
ratio that accrued dividends per share on the shares of the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock and such other shares bear to each other.  Holders of
shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any
dividend, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full
cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred
Stock.  No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable
in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock which may be in arrears.

(iii)   So long as any shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock are
outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in capital stock or in any
other shares ranking junior to the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock as to
dividends and upon Liquidation (as defined in subsection (f)(i) and other
than as provided in paragraph (ii) of this subsection (b)) shall be
declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or
made upon the shares of capital stock or upon any other shares ranking
junior to or on a parity with the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon Liquidation, nor shall any of the shares of capital stock
or any other shares of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity
with the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon








 3.

<PAGE>

Liquidation be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any
consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking
fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Corporation (except by
conversion into or exchange for shares of the Corporation ranking junior to
the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon Liquidation)
unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding
shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall have been or
contemporaneously are declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient
for payment thereof is set apart for payment, for all past dividend payment
periods.

(iv) Dividends payable on the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock for any
period less than a full quarterly dividend period, and for the dividend
period beginning on the date of issuance of the shares of the Series A
7-1/2% Preferred Stock, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of 12 30-day months.  The amount of dividends payable on shares
of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock for each full quarterly dividend
period shall be computed by dividing by 4 the annual rate per share set
forth above in subsection (b)(i).

(c)  Redemption.
     ----------

(i)  The shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall not be
redeemable prior to July 1, 2001. On and after July 1, 2001, the
Corporation, at its option, may redeem shares of the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock, as a whole or in part, at any time or from time to time,
at a redemption price  per share of $100 plus, in each case, accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption.

(ii)  In the event that fewer than all the outstanding shares of the Series
A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be
redeemed shall be determined by the Board of Directors and the shares to be
redeemed shall be determined by lot or pro rata as may be determined by the
Board of Directors or by any other method as may be determined by the Board
of Directors in its sole discretion to be equitable.

(iii)  In the event the Corporation shall redeem shares of the Series A
7-1/2% Preferred Stock, notice of such redemption shall be given by first
class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 35 nor more than 60 days
prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be
redeemed, at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock
register of the Depositary (as provided in subsection (j)(iii) below).
Each such mailed notice shall state:  (v) the redemption date; (w) the
number of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock to be redeemed and,
if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the
number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (x) the redemption
price; (y) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (z) that dividends on
the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date.  No
defect in the notice of redemption or in the mailing thereof shall affect
the validity of the redemption proceedings, and the failure to give notice








 4.

<PAGE>

to any holder of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock to be so
redeemed shall not affect the validity of the notice given to the other
holders of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock to be so redeemed.

(iv) Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, then, notwithstanding that the
certificates evidencing the shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock
shall not have been surrendered, from and after the redemption date (unless
default shall be made by the Corporation in providing money for the payment
of the redemption price) dividends on the shares of the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and said
shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the
holders thereof as stockholders (including dividend and voting rights) of
the Corporation (except the right to receive from the Corporation the
redemption price) shall cease. Upon surrender in accordance with said
notice of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or
assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors shall so require and the
notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at
the redemption price aforesaid.  In case fewer than all the shares
represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall
be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder
thereof.

(v)  Any shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock which shall at any
time have been redeemed shall, after such redemption, have the status of
authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as
to series until such shares are once more designated as part of a
particular series by the Board of Directors.
(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection (c), if
any dividends on the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock are in arrears, no
shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all
outstanding shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock are
simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not purchase or
otherwise acquire any shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent the purchase or
acquisition of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all
outstanding shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock.

(d)  Conversion.  The holders of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred
     ----------
Stock shall not have any rights herein to convert such shares into or
exchange such shares for shares of any other class or classes or of any
other series of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation.

(e)  Voting.  The shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall not
     ------
have any voting powers either general or special, except as required by law
and except that:

(i)  So long as any of the shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock
are outstanding, the consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all
the shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock at the time outstanding,









 5.

<PAGE>

given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by a vote at a meeting
called for the purpose at which the holders of shares of the Series A
7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall vote together as a separate class, shall be
necessary for authorizing, effecting or validating the amendment,
alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation or of any certificate amendatory thereof or supplemental
thereto (including any certificate of amendment or any similar document
relating to any series of preferred stock) which would adversely affect the
powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred
Stock, including the creation or authorization of any class of stock that
ranks senior to the Preferred Stock with respect to dividends or upon
Liquidation.  Any amendment or any resolution or action of the Board of
Directors which would create or issue any series of preferred stock out of
the authorized shares of preferred stock, or which would authorize, create
or issue any shares or class of stock (whether or not already authorized),
ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock
with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and
distributions upon any Liquidation, shall not be considered to affect
adversely the powers, preferences or special rights of the outstanding
shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock;

(ii) In the event that the Corporation shall have failed to declare and pay
or set apart for payment in full the dividends accumulated on the
outstanding shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock for any six
quarterly dividend payment periods, whether or not consecutive, and all
such preferred dividends remain unpaid (a "Preferred Dividend Default"),
the number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two and
the holders of outstanding shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock,
voting together as a class with all other series of preferred stock then
entitled to vote on the election of such directors, shall be entitled to
elect such two additional directors until the full dividends accumulated on
all outstanding shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock have been
declared and paid in full.  Upon the occurrence of a Preferred Dividend
Default, the Board of Directors shall within 10 business days (any day
other than a day which is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday on which
banks are open for business in New York, New York) of such default call a
special meeting of the holders of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred
Stock and all other holders of a series of preferred stock who are then
entitled to participate in the election of such directors for the purpose
of electing the additional directors provided by the foregoing provisions;
provided that, in lieu of holding such meeting, the holders of record of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock
and all other series of preferred stock who are then entitled to
participate in the election of such directors may, by action taken by
written consent as permitted by law and this Certificate of Incorporation
and the By-laws of the Corporation, elect such additional directors. If and
when all accumulated dividends on the shares of the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or set aside for payment in
full, the holders of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall be
divested of the special voting rights provided by this paragraph, subject
to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent Preferred Dividend








 6.

<PAGE>

Default.  Upon termination of such special voting rights attributable to
all holders of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock and any other
series of preferred stock, the term of office of each director elected by
the holders of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock and such
parity stock (hereinafter referred to as a "Preferred Stock Director")
pursuant to such special voting rights shall forthwith terminate and the
number of directors of the Company shall, without further action, be
reduced by two, subject always to the increase in the number of directors
pursuant to the foregoing provisions in case of a future Preferred Dividend
Default.  Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or
without cause by, and shall not be removed otherwise than by, the vote of
the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series
A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock and all other series of preferred stock who were
entitled to participate in such Preferred Stock Director's election, voting
as a separate class, at a meeting called for such purpose or by written
consent as permitted by law and this Certificate of Incorporation and the
By-laws of the Corporation.  So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall
continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be
filled by written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in
office or, if none remains in office, by vote of the holders of record of a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock
and all other series of preferred stock who are then entitled to
participate in the election of such Preferred Stock Directors as provided
above.  As long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, holders of
shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall not, as such
stockholders, be entitled to vote on the election or removal of directors
other than Preferred Stock Directors, but shall not be divested of any
other voting rights provided to such stockholders by law with respect to
any other matter to be acted upon by the stockholders of the Corporation.
The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per
director on any matter.

(f)  Liquidation Rights.
     ------------------

(i)  Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary (collectively, a
"Liquidation"), after payment or provision for payment has been made of the
debts and other liabilities of the Corporation and payment or provision for
payment has been made on all amounts required to be paid in respect of all
outstanding shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation or
series thereof ranking senior to the shares of the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock, the holders of the shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred
Stock shall be entitled, subject to paragraph (iv) of this subsection (f),
to receive out of the assets of the Corporation, before any payment or
distribution shall be made on capital stock or on any other class of stock
ranking junior to preferred stock upon Liquidation, the amount of $100 per
share, plus a sum equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or
declared) on such shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final
distribution.










 7.

<PAGE>

(ii) Neither the sale, transfer or lease of all or any part of the property
or business of the Corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of the
Corporation into or with any other corporation or the merger or
consolidation of any other corporation into or with the Corporation, shall
be deemed to be a Liquidation for the purposes of this subsection (f).

(iii)  After the payment to the holders of the shares of the Series A
7-1/2% Preferred Stock of the full preferential amounts provided for in this
subsection (f), the holders of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock as such
shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the
Corporation and the shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock shall no
longer be deemed to be outstanding or be entitled to any other powers,
preferences, rights or privileges, including voting rights, and such shares
shall be surrendered for cancellation to the Corporation.

(iv) In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution
to the holders of shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock upon any
Liquidation shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph (i) of this subsection (f), no
such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any series of
preferred stock ranking on a parity with the shares of the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock upon such Liquidation unless proportionate distributive
amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of the Series A 7-1/2%
Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts
for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon
such Liquidation.

(g)  Priority.  Any shares of any class or classes of the Corporation or
     --------
series thereof shall be deemed to rank:

(i)  prior to the shares of the Series A 7-1/2% Preferred Stock, either as
to dividends or upon Liquidation, if the holders of such class or classes

three or more directors.  All such committees, in the intervals between
meetings of the Board of Directors and to the extent provided in the By-
laws or the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing such a
committee, shall have all the authority and may exercise all the powers of
the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation to the extent lawful under the Business Corporation Law of the
State of New York.

The Board of Directors shall from time to time decide whether and to what
extent and at what times and under what conditions and requirements the
accounts and books of the Corporation, or any of them, except the stock
book, shall be open to the inspection of the stockholders, and no
stockholder shall have any right to inspect any books or documents of the
Corporation except as conferred by statute of the State of New York or

stockholders; may determine the time or times for the declaration and

the Board of Directors may deem expedient.

Directors shall be stockholders, subject to the power of the Board of
Directors from time to time to prescribe a reasonable time after
qualification within which newly elected directors must become
stockholders.

Each director, in consideration of serving as such, shall be entitled to
receive from the Corporation such amount per annum or such fees for
attendance at meetings of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors or
of committees of the Board of Directors, or both, as the Board of Directors
shall from time to time determine, together with reimbursement for the
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the performance of duties.
Nothing herein contained shall preclude any director from serving the

otherwise interested, may be a party to, or may be pecuniarily or otherwise
interested in, any contract, transaction, or act of the Corporation, and

or otherwise affected by that fact,

(2) Any such director of the Corporation may be counted in determining the

committee thereof that shall authorize any such contract, transaction, or
act, but may not vote thereon, and

(3) No director of the Corporation shall be liable to account to the
Corporation for any profit realized by such director from or through any
such contract, transaction, or act;

provided, however, that if any such director of the Corporation is so
interested either individually or as a member of a firm or association, or
as the holder of a majority of the stock of any class of a corporation, the
contract, transaction, or act shall be duly authorized or ratified by a
majority of the Board of Directors who are not so interested and who know
of such director's interest therein.

To the extent permitted by law, any contract, transaction, or act of the
Corporation or of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof that
shall be ratified, whether before or after judgment rendered in a suit with
respect to such contract, transaction, or act, by the holders of a majority
of the stock of the Corporation having voting power at any annual meeting
or at any special meeting called for such purpose, shall be as valid and as
binding as though ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation and
shall constitute a complete bar to any such suit or to any claim of
execution in respect of any such judgment; provided, however, that any
failure of the stockholders to approve or ratify such contract,
transaction, or act, when and if submitted, shall not be deemed in any way
to invalidate the same or to deprive the Corporation, its directors,
officers, or employees of its or their right to proceed with such contract,
transaction, or act.

acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or
repeal.

 SECTION 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of the stockholders of the

  SECTION 2.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the stockholders of

constitute presence at a meeting of the Executive Committee. The members of
the Executive Committee shall act only as a committee and individual
members shall have no power as such.

  SECTION 5.  Other Committees.  The Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, designate members of the Board to constitute other
committees, which shall have, and may exercise, such powers as the Board

number of directors as the Board may determine; provided, however, that
each such committee shall have at least three directors as members thereof.

periodic reconstitution. A majority of all the members of any such
committee may determine its action and its quorum requirements and may fix
the time and place of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise
provide. Participating in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or
similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the
meeting to hear each other shall constitute presence at a meeting of such
other committees.

such notice or at any later time specified therein; and, unless otherwise
specified therein, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to
make it effective. Any vacancy in any committee, whether arising from

other cause, shall be filled by the Board in the manner prescribed in these
By-laws for the original appointment of the members of such committee.

domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise in any capacity, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in
settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees actually and
necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, or any
appeal therein. Such indemnification shall be a contract right and shall
include the right to be paid advances of any expenses incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, consistent with
the provisions of applicable law in effect at any time. Indemnification
shall be deemed to be 'permitted' within the meaning of the first sentence
hereof if it is not expressly prohibited by applicable law as in effect at

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                     SHARES

  SECTION 1.  Stock Certificates.  Each owner of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to have a certificate, in such form as shall be approved
by the Board, certifying the number of shares of stock of the Corporation
owned. The certificates representing shares of stock shall be signed in the
name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or a Vice Chairman of
the Board or the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary and sealed with the seal of the Corporation (which seal
may be a facsimile, engraved or printed); provided, however, that where any
such certificate is signed by a registrar, other than the Corporation or
its employee, the signatures of the Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman
of the Board, the President, the Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, and
transfer agent or a transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation upon
such certificates may be facsimiles, engraved or printed. In case any
officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk acting on behalf of the
Corporation ceases to be such officer, transfer agent, or transfer clerk
before such certificates shall be issued, they may nevertheless be issued
by the Corporation with the same effect as if they were still such officer,
transfer agent or transfer clerk at the date of their issue.

  SECTION 2.  Books of Account and Record of Stockholders.  There shall be
kept at the office of the Corporation correct books of account of all its
business and transactions, minutes of the proceedings of stockholders,
Board, and Executive Committee, and a book to be known as the record of
stockholders, containing the names and addresses of all persons who are
stockholders, the number of shares of stock held, and the date when the
stockholder became the owner of record thereof.

  SECTION 3.  Transfers of Stock.  Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made on the record of stockholders of the Corporation
only upon authorization by the registered holder thereof, or by an attorney
thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the
Secretary or with a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and on surrender of
the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed or
accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power and the payment of all







                                    -15-

<PAGE>

taxes thereon. The person in whose name shares of stock shall stand on the
record of stockholders of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof
for all purposes as regards the Corporation. Whenever any transfers of
shares shall be made for collateral security and not absolutely and written
notice thereof shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent or
transfer clerk, such fact shall be stated in the entry of the transfer.

  SECTION 4.  Regulations.  The Board may make such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-laws,
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for shares
of stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize any officer or
officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents or one or more transfer
clerks and one or more registrars and may require all certificates of stock
to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

  SECTION 5.  Fixing of Record Date.  The Board shall fix a time not
exceeding fifty nor less than ten days prior to the date then fixed for the
holding of any meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on
which the consent or dissent of the stockholders may be effectively
expressed for any purpose without a meeting, as the time as of which the
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or whose
consent or dissent is required or may be expressed for any purpose, as the
case may be, shall be determined, and all persons who were holders of
record of voting stock at such time, and no others, shall be entitled to
notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent, as the case may be. The Board may fix a time not exceeding fifty
days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making
of any distribution or the allotment of rights to subscribe for securities
of the Corporation, or for the delivery of evidences of rights or evidences
of interests arising out of any change, conversion or exchange of capital
stock or other securities, as the record date for the determination of the
stockholders entitled to receive any such dividend, distribution,
allotment, rights or interests, and in such case only the stockholders of
record at the time so fixed shall be entitled to receive such dividend,
distribution, allotment, rights or interests.

  SECTION 6.  Lost, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates.  The holder of any
certificate representing shares of stock of the Corporation shall
immediately notify the Corporation of any loss, destruction or mutilation
of such certificate, and the Corporation may issue a new certificate of
stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it which the
owner thereof shall allege to have been lost or destroyed or which shall
have been mutilated, and the Corporation may, in its discretion, require
such owner or the owner's legal representatives to give to the Corporation
a bond in such sum, limited or unlimited, and in such form and with such
surety or sureties as the Board in its absolute discretion shall determine,
to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it
on account of the alleged loss or destruction of any such certificate, or
the issuance of such new certificate. Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Corporation, in its absolute discretion, may refuse to









                                    -16-

<PAGE>

issue any such new certificate, except pursuant to legal proceedings under
the laws of the State of New York.

  SECTION 7.  Inspection of Records.  The record of stockholders and
minutes of the proceedings of stockholders shall be available for
inspection, within the limits and subject to the conditions and
restrictions prescribed by applicable law.

  SECTION 8.  Auditors.  The Board shall employ an independent public or
certified public accountant or firm of such accountants who shall act as
auditors in making examinations of the consolidated financial statements of
the Corporation and its subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. The auditors shall certify that the annual financial
statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and shall report on such financial statements to the
stockholders and directors of the Corporation. The Board's selection of
auditors shall be presented for ratification by the stockholders at the
annual meeting. Directors and officers, when acting in good faith, may rely
upon financial statements of the Corporation represented to them to be
correct by the officer of the Corporation having charge of its books of
account, or stated in a written report by the auditors fairly to reflect
the financial condition of the Corporation.



                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                    OFFICES

  SECTION 1.  Principal Office.  The principal office of the Corporation
shall be at such place in the Town of North Castle, County of Westchester
and State of New York as the Board shall from time to time determine.

  SECTION 2.  Other Offices.  The Corporation may also have an office or
offices other than said principal office at such place or places as the
Board shall from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation
may require.



                                     ARTICLE IX

                                  WAIVER OF NOTICE

  Whenever under the provisions of any law of the State of New York, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws or any resolution of the
Board or any committee thereof, the Corporation or the Board or any
committee thereof is authorized to take any action after notice to the
stockholders, directors or members of any such committee, or after the
lapse of a prescribed period of time, such action may be taken without
notice and without the lapse of any period of time, if, at any time before
or after such action shall be completed, such notice or lapse of time shall
be waived in writing by the person or persons entitled to said notice or






                                    -17-

<PAGE>

entitled to participate in the action to be taken, or, in the case of a
stockholder, by an attorney thereunto authorized. Attendance at a meeting
requiring notice by any person or, in the case of a stockholder, by the
stockholder's attorney, agent or proxy, shall constitute a waiver of such
notice on the part of the person so attending, or by such stockholder, as
the case may be.



                                  ARTICLE X

                                  FISCAL YEAR

  The fiscal year of the Corporation shall end on the thirty-first day of
December in each year.



                                   ARTICLE XI

  The Seal of the Corporation shall consist of two concentric circles with
the IBM logotype appearing in bold face type within the inner circle and
the words 'International Business Machines Corporation' appearing within
the outer circle.



                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   AMENDMENTS

  These By-laws may be amended or repealed or new By-laws may be adopted by
the stockholders at any annual or special meeting, if the notice thereof
mentions that amendment or repeal or the adoption of new By-laws is one of
the purposes of such meeting. These By-laws, subject to the laws of the
State of New York, may also be amended or repealed or new By-laws may be
adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board given at any
meeting, if the notice thereof mentions that amendment or repeal or the
adoption of new By-laws is one of the purposes of such meeting; provided,
however, that if any By-law regulating an impending election of directors
is adopted or amended or repealed by the Board, there shall be set forth in
the notice of the next meeting of the stockholders for the election of
directors the By-law so adopted or amended or repealed, together with a
concise statement of the changes made.

*  In 1993, 1992, and 1991, incremental shares under stock plans and the effect
   of the convertible debentures and bonds were not considered for the fully
   diluted earnings per share calculation due to their antidilutive effect. As
   such, the amounts reported for primary and fully diluted earnings per share
   are the same. The 7 7/8% convertible debentures were called and redeemed on
   November 21, 1992.

Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information
presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of
organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and
delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. We
believe this structure provides reasonable assurance that transactions are
executed in accordance with management authorization, and that they are
appropriately recorded, in order to permit preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to adequately
safeguard, verify, and maintain accountability of assets. An important element
of the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program.

To assure the effective administration of internal control, we carefully select
and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and
procedures, provide appropriate communication channels, and foster an
environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that
it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance
with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct
Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are
distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through
internal programs to assure that they are understood and followed.

Price Waterhouse, independent accountants, are retained to examine IBM's
financial statements. Their accompanying report is based on an examination
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including a
review of the internal control structure and tests of accounting procedures and
records.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of outside
directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent
accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder
approval. The Audit Committee meets periodically and privately with the
independent accountants, with our internal auditors, as well as with IBM
management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure, and
financial reporting matters.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of International Business Machines
Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, appearing
on pages 32 through 62, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits on these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

As discussed in the note on accounting changes on pages 37 and 38, the company
changed its methods of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993, income
taxes in 1992 and nonpension postretirement benefits in 1991. We concur with
these changes.

Overview

IBM has continued to aggressively restructure its worldwide business operations
to improve its competitive position within a rapidly changing market for
information technology products and services. Industry demand has slowed in
recent years, and the industry continues to suffer from excess capacity and
sluggish economic growth, particularly in Europe and Japan. The company's
recent business results reflect these realities, as well as an ongoing revenue
shift to offerings with lower gross profit margins, such as services and
personal computers.

During 1993, a number of actions were announced to "right-size" the company.
These actions, including reductions in the company's worldwide work force,
office space, capacity and related expenses, are intended to bring the
company's cost and expense structure in line with industry levels. They were
based on the company's assumptions of future industry demand and revenue
growth. If these assumptions prove correct, the company believes it will be
able to absorb, without resorting to additional special charges, the costs
associated with any future productivity improvements. If the company's current
view of future industry revenue and demand proves incorrect, the company will
have to take further actions. The company's management strategy also shifted in
1993 from the establishment of increasingly autonomous business units--an
emerging federation of companies--to remaining an integrated provider of
information technology.

Overall, the company's hardware offerings remain under price and gross profit
margin pressure. Mainframe processor revenue and margins declined significantly
in the last year, and this trend may continue. Revenue and volume trends were
positive for personal computers and RISC System/6000* over the last year.
However, personal computers compete in a relatively low margin,
price-competitive environment, and the company expects this trend to continue.
Other hardware areas are also expected to remain under competitive pressure
consistent with recent experience. The company's services offerings, while
growing rapidly, are at lower margins than the company's traditional hardware
offerings. Due to the changing mix of revenue and gross profit margins, it is
uncertain when pressure on the company's cost structure will be diminished.

Revenue in the United States was $25.7 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent
above 1992, following a .8 percent increase in 1992 over 1991. Non-U.S.
operations generated revenue of $37.0 billion, a 7.2 percent decrease from
1992, following a decline of 1.1 percent in 1992 from 1991.

Gross profit margins, driven by hardware pricing pressures and the company's
shift to services revenue, have declined each year from 1991 to 1993. Although
the gross profit margin declined 7.1 points in 1993 from 1992, the last five
quarters' aggregate gross profit margin has been relatively stable at
approximately 38 percent.

The company generated $148 million of earnings before taxes and restructuring
charges in 1993. After preferred stock dividends, the company had a loss,
before restructuring charges and accounting changes, of $.07 per common share.
Prior to restructuring charges and the cumulative effect of $114 million ($.20
decrease in earnings per common share) as a result of the company's adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits," after-tax results were essentially break-even.
Including restructuring but prior to the effect of accounting changes, the
company had a net, after-tax loss of $8.0 billion ($14.02 per common share)
compared with a net, after-tax loss of $6.9 billion in 1992 ($12.03 per common
share) and a net, after-tax loss of $.6 billion in 1991 ($1.05 per common
share). After restructuring and accounting changes, the company reported, for
1993, 1992, and 1991 respectively, losses of $8.1 billion ($14.22 per common
share), $5.0 billion ($8.70 per common share), and $2.9 billion ($5.01 per
common share).

Revenue and Gross Profit

The company continued to experience a change in the makeup of its revenue as
more of its revenue, 51.2 percent, came from non-hardware sales sources versus
47.7 percent in 1992 and 42.7 percent in 1991. Further, within hardware sales,
the mix of revenue from personal systems, which carry a lower margin, increased
to 31.7 percent in 1993, versus 23.3 percent in 1992 and 22.9 percent in 1991.
This changing mix, as well as continuing price pressures, have driven margins
down over the last three years.

Worldwide revenue from hardware sales decreased 9.4 percent from 1992,
following a decrease of 9.0 percent in 1992 from 1991. Hardware sales revenue
from U.S. operations declined 1.4 percent in 1993, compared to a 5.1 percent
decline in 1992 from 1991. Hardware sales revenue from non-U.S. operations
reflect a decrease of 14.2 percent in 1993, following an 11.2 percent decline
in 1992 from 1991.

Worldwide gross profit dollars from hardware sales decreased 29.6 percent from
1992, following a decrease of 24.1 percent in 1992 from 1991. Hardware sales
gross profit dollars from U.S. operations decreased 28.8 percent in 1993,
compared to a 20.7 percent decline in 1992 from 1991. Hardware sales gross
profit dollars from non-U.S. operations reflect a decrease of 30.0 percent in
1993, following a 25.9 percent decline in 1992 from 1991. Total cost of
hardware sales was higher, primarily due to increased volumes associated with
personal systems products.

Revenue from processors decreased 27.6 percent in 1993 compared with 1992 and
6.9 percent in 1992 from 1991. These decreases were primarily due to declines
in System/390 processor revenue, resulting from price pressures. Application
System/400 product revenue declined slightly over the past two years, primarily
in Europe, due to lower volumes.

Personal systems revenue increased 23.3 percent in 1993 compared with 1992,
following a decrease of 7.3 percent in 1992 from 1991. The increase resulted
from strong demand for the company's personal computers, offset by price
actions. In addition, RISC System/6000 revenue increased, but at a lower rate
than in the previous year, reflecting lower growth in demand, particularly in
Europe. The decline in 1992 from 1991 reflected the severe price competition
experienced by personal computers, partially offset by strong growth in RISC
System/6000. On a volume basis, 1993 personal computer shipments were
approximately 4.3 million units, a growth of more than 1.0 million units over
1992, and a growth of more than 1.4 million units over 1991.

Storage products revenue decreased 18.2 percent in 1993, following a decrease
of 12.9 percent in 1992 from 1991. These declines were a result of continuing
price competition across most storage products.

Other hardware sales revenue increased 68.1 percent in 1993 over the previous
year, following an increase of 10.3 percent in 1992 from 1991. These increases
were primarily a result of higher original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
revenue.

Information on industry segments and classes of similar products or services is
included on pages 59 and 60. The product revenue trends demonstrated in this
discussion and in that disclosure are indicative, in all material respects, of
hardware sales activity.

Hardware sales gross profit margin decreases reflect the continuing price
competition for high-end products and personal computers; in addition, personal
computer revenues, which carry a lower gross profit margin, were a
proportionally larger part of hardware sales.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Software revenue declined 1.4 percent in 1993 from 1992, following an increase
of 5.8 percent in 1992 over 1991. The decline was primarily a result of lower
one-time-charge revenue which followed decreased AS/400 computer placements.

Software gross profit dollars decreased 7.5 percent in 1993 from 1992,
following an increase of 8.2 percent in 1992 over 1991. The decrease in gross
profit margin in 1993 from 1992 was partially a result of lower one-time-charge
revenue as denoted above and a higher level of program product write-downs that
were recorded as a result of the continuing review of the company's portfolio
of software offerings. Increased amortization of program product costs
resulting from new offerings and shortened amortization periods instituted by
the company in 1992 also contributed to the decline in gross profit margin.

Services gross profit dollars, excluding maintenance, increased 10.1 percent
but the margin decreased 3.0 points from 1992. As a result of ongoing reviews
of contract profitability, it was determined that cost adjustments in the
current period were required on certain older contracts that were not expected
to be profitable. This was the primary cause of the margin decline. Without the
Federal Systems Company, which is expected to be sold during the first quarter
of 1994, the services gross profit margins, excluding maintenance, were 16.5
percent, 21.3 percent, and 22.7 percent, in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

Maintenance revenue decreased 4.4 percent from 1992, after increasing 3.0
percent in 1992 over 1991. The 1993 decline is primarily due to competitive
pressures and lower hardware placements. Maintenance gross profit dollars
decreased 10.8 percent year-over-year, following an increase of 4.2 percent in
1992 from 1991. The decreases in gross profit dollars and margin percent
reflect the increasingly competitive nature of the business. This trend is
expected to continue.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 6.4 percent from
1992, which follows a decrease of 8.7 percent in 1992 from 1991. These
decreases reflect the results of the company's focus on productivity,
restructuring programs, and expense controls. Work force related SG&A decreased
11.7 percent from 1992, which followed a decrease of 7.3 percent from 1991.
The other charges component of SG&A increased primarily as a result of exchange
losses from currency revaluations of cash in countries with highly inflationary
environments.  These exchange losses are largely offset by higher interest
income as a result of higher interest rates in those countries. Research,
development and engineering expense decreased 14.8 percent in 1993, following a
decrease of 1.8 percent in 1992 from 1991. The reduction in research,
development and engineering expense reflects the company's reprioritization of
development efforts to growth areas as well as a focus on productivity,
restructuring programs, and expense controls.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring charges were $8.9 billion in 1993, $11.6 billion in 1992, and
$3.7 billion in 1991. These charges include expenses associated with work force
reductions, facility consolidations, capacity reductions, and other related
actions to streamline the company. These charges are discussed further on pages
45 and 46.

Other Income

Other income, principally interest, was $1.1 billion in 1993, almost double
that of 1992. This increase reflects higher levels of available cash and higher
interest rates in countries whose economic environment is highly inflationary.
Although Other income increased, exchange losses from currency revaluations of
cash largely offset this increase. Exchange losses are reflected in SG&A
expense.

Provision For Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes resulted in a benefit of $810 million in 1993, a
benefit of $2,161 million in 1992, and a charge of $716 million in 1991. The
effective tax rates of (9) percent in 1993, (24) percent in 1992, and 607
percent in 1991 were principally due to limited tax benefits on restructuring
charges, along with a high effective tax rate on earnings in certain non-U.S.
operations. Excluding the effects of restructuring charges, the effective tax
rates were 94 percent in 1993, 46 percent in 1992, and 41 percent in 1991. The
high effective tax rate in 1993 resulted from earnings in non-U.S. operations
of $1.3 billion at an average tax rate of 50.2 percent, offset by a loss before
taxes in the U.S. of $1.1 billion at a tax rate of 44.5 percent.

The company accounts for income taxes under SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," which provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of
such assets is more likely than not. In assessing the likelihood of
realization, management considered estimates of future taxable income. The
total amount of U.S. federal taxable income needed to realize U.S. federal
deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, is approximately $15.0
billion. In estimating the amount of U.S. taxable income that may be available
to the company to utilize as many deferred tax assets as possible, the last
three years' taxable income was considered. This was approximately $(3.0)
billion (estimated loss) for 1993, $4.4 billion for 1992, and $6.4 billion for
1991. The company also considered the impact on past and future taxable income
of restructuring actions already announced. If, in the future, it should become
advantageous, the company can again capitalize and amortize research and
development expenditures for tax purposes, which would increase current taxable
income.

Changes in Accounting Principles

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company implemented SFAS 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," effective January 1, 1993. The
cumulative effect of adopting this statement, which is discussed further on
page 37, resulted in a one-time charge of $114 million (net of approximately
$61 million of income tax benefits). Most of this charge was included in U.S.
operations.

Effective January 1, 1992, the company implemented SFAS 109. The cumulative
effect of adopting this statement resulted in a one-time benefit to net
earnings of $1,900 million for recognition of previously unrecognized tax
benefits.

In the first quarter of 1991, the company implemented SFAS 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The transition
effect of adopting this statement resulted in a one-time charge of $2,263
million to net earnings (net of approximately $350 million of income tax
benefits).

Fourth Quarter

For the quarter ended December 31, 1993, the company announced earnings of $382
million ($.62 per common share) compared with a net loss of $45 million ($.08
per common share) before restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 1992.
After restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 1992, the company had
posted a loss of $5.5 billion ($9.57 per common share). Revenue for the fourth
quarter of 1993 totaled $19.4 billion, down one percent compared with the same
period of 1992.

U.S. revenue grew by 9.0 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same
period of 1992, continuing a quarterly improvement trend. Revenue from Europe
and Asia, after currency adjustments, declined in the fourth quarter by 1.0
percent and 4.0 percent, respectively, compared with 1992's fourth quarter.
The company's hardware sales revenue was $10.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a
decline of 5.4 percent compared with the same period of 1992. Services revenue
was $3.2 billion in fourth quarter 1993, up 31.9 percent from 1992. Software
revenue declined by 3.8 percent, largely due to a decline in one-time-charge
software, principally AS/400 software. Maintenance, rentals and financing
revenue also decreased year-over-year.

Within specific hardware product areas, personal computer revenue rose strongly
in the quarter, compared with 1992's fourth quarter, and RISC System/6000
revenue increased. AS/400 revenue fell primarily due to sluggish European
demand. Mainframe and high-end disk drive revenue also declined.

The company's overall gross margin was down about one point in the fourth
quarter compared to the same period of 1992. Hardware sales margins improved in
the fourth quarter, and software, maintenance and services margins declined.
Total expenses, including net interest expense and excluding restructuring
charges, declined 9.0 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same
period of 1992.

Financial Condition

The Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was significantly impacted by
actions taken by the company during 1993, including work force and capacity
reductions, and issuance of new debt and equity instruments.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current assets decreased $.5 billion because of declines in receivables of $2.2
billion and inventories of $.8 billion, offset by increases in cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of $1.5 billion and prepaid expenses and
other current assets of $1.0 billion. The decline in accounts receivable is
primarily attributable to the company's securitization of assets and lower
year-to-year volumes in financing activities. The increase in prepaid expenses
and other current assets is due to an increase in deferred tax assets ($2.8
billion from $2.5 billion), and the net assets of the Federal Systems Company
($.7 billion), which have been reclassified to current assets being held for
sale.

Current liabilities decreased $3.6 billion because of a reduction of $4.4
billion in short-term debt, reflecting the company's ongoing efforts to reduce
its overall outstanding debt obligations, offset by a net increase of $.8
billion in other current liabilities (increases in taxes, accounts payable,
deferred income, and other accrued expenses and liabilities and a decrease in
accrued compensation and benefits).

Investments

The company's capital expenditures for plant and other property were
approximately $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 1993, a decrease of
approximately $2.1 billion from 1992. The net book value of plant, rental
machines and other property decreased $4.1 billion from year-end 1992,
primarily due to capacity reduction reserves recorded in the second quarter,
and depreciation exceeding current levels of capital additions.

In addition to software development expense included in research, development
and engineering expense, the company capitalized $1.5 billion of software costs
during 1993, versus the $1.8 billion capitalized in 1992. Ongoing amortization
of capitalized software costs for the same period amounted to $2.0 billion, an
increase of $.5 billion compared to 1992. In 1992, the company incurred an
additional $.7 billion in accelerated amortization of capitalized software
costs, which were charged to restructuring in the third quarter.

Debt and Equity

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June 1993, the company issued $1,250 million of 6 3/8 percent notes due June
15, 2000, and $550 million of 7 1/2 percent debentures due June 15, 2013. The
net proceeds from the issuance of these debt instruments were used for general
corporate purposes, including restructuring actions.

Other non-current liabilities increased $3.5 billion from December 31, 1992,
due primarily to restructuring actions announced in the second quarter of 1993,
and increases in nonpension postretirement benefits.

The company accrued for environmental matters, including estimated costs of
cleanup of Superfund and other waste sites. Estimated environmental costs are
not expected to materially affect the company's financial position or results
of operations in future periods. Further discussion of these accruals appears
on pages 46 and  47.

Stockholders' equity decreased from $27.6 billion at December 31, 1992, to
$19.7 billion at December 31, 1993, resulting from the 1993 net loss
principally reflecting the restructuring charge, partially offset by an
increase of $1.1 billion from the issuance in June 1993 of depositary shares
representing ownership of Series A 7 1/2 percent preferred stock. Net proceeds
from the preferred stock issuance were used for general corporate purposes,
including restructuring actions.

Currency Rate Fluctuations

The majority of worldwide currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar in 1993
with the major exception being the Japanese yen. Approximately 85 percent of
the company's non-U.S. business is conducted in local currency environments.
Assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies translate into fewer
U.S. dollars as those local currencies weaken. Changes in net worth arising
from these currency fluctuations are accumulated in the equity translation
adjustments component of Stockholders' Equity. As of December 31, 1993, the
cumulative translation adjustment was $1.7 billion, which includes a decline in
this component of $.3 billion in 1993.

In the high inflation environments of Latin America, translation adjustments
are reflected in period income, as required by SFAS 52, "Foreign Currency
Translation." Wherever possible, the company minimizes currency risk in these
countries by linking prices and contracts to dollars and by financing
operations locally.

The company is, to a great degree, protected from currency risk in its business
operations by manufacturing and developing a significant portion of its product
line in non-U.S. countries, so that costs reflect local economic conditions.
Also, financial hedging instruments are used to minimize currency risks related
to the repatriation of dividends and royalties from non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Currency rate variations did not have a material effect on the company's
operating results in 1993, 1992, or 1991.

Liquidity

Management expects that the funds required to continue the level of investments
necessary to ensure the company's competitiveness, as well as funds used to pay
for restructuring actions and dividends, will be generated primarily from
operations.

The company continued to take actions during 1993 to further enhance its
liquidity. The company's Board of Directors approved management's plan to
issue, instead of purchase on the open market, stock to be sold to employees
under the IBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan. During 1993, approximately 3.3
million shares of IBM common stock were issued for this purpose. The company's
Board of Directors also authorized up to 15 million shares of IBM common stock
for contribution to the IBM U.S. Retirement Plan Trust Fund (the "Fund")
through 1994. On September 9, 1993, the company registered up to 6.5 million
shares of IBM common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
contribution to the fund. The company contributed approximately 5.8 million of
those shares to the fund. Approximately 9.2 million shares of IBM common stock
remain available for contribution to the fund through 1994.

During 1993, as part of the company's worldwide program of securitizing assets
and improving its liquidity, the company received net cash proceeds from the
sale and securitization of trade and financing receivables to investors of
approximately $2.5 billion. Sales and securitization of trade receivables
accelerate the collections of such receivables, which typically range between
30-60 days. Sales of financing receivables accelerates collection by up to five
years.

In December 1993, the company entered into a $10.0 billion committed global
credit facility as part of the company's ongoing efforts to ensure appropriate
levels of liquidity. This subject is discussed further on pages 56 and 57.

In July of 1993, Standard & Poor's changed its Senior Long-Term Debt Rating of
the company and its rated subsidiaries from AA- to A, and its Short-Term Debt
Rating from A-1+ to A-1. Standard & Poor's also changed its Preferred Stock
Rating of the company from A+ to A-. Standard & Poor's has a negative rating
outlook on the company. In August, Moody's changed its Senior Long-Term Debt
Rating of the company and its rated subsidiaries from A1 to A3, and its
Short-Term Debt Rating from Prime-1 to Prime-2. Moody's also changed its
Preferred Stock Rating of the company from A2 to Baa1.

In September, Duff & Phelps changed its Senior Long-Term Debt Rating of the
company and its rated subsidiaries from AA- to A and assigned initial ratings
of Duff 1 for the company and its rated subsidiaries' Short-Term Debt and A-
for the company's Preferred Stock. In addition, Fitch Investors Service
assigned initial ratings for the company and its rated subsidiaries of A for
Senior-Long-Term Debt and F-1 for Short-Term Debt and A- for the company's
Preferred Stock.

The following table summarizes the company's cash flows from operating,
investing, and financing activities as prescribed by Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP), as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows on page 34:

Net change in cash and cash equivalents  $  1,415       $    501       $     92
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the company had a net loss in 1993, principally as a result of
restructuring charges, the positive cash flow from operating activities was
primarily driven by the company's activities relative to securitization of
assets and restructuring charges taken, which had no current period cash
effect. There will, however, be cash outflows in future periods related to
these restructuring charges.

The period-to-period improvement in cash flow used in investing activities is
primarily attributable to the company's reduced, more focused investment in
plant, rental machines and other property.

In June 1993, the company issued $1.8 billion of new notes and debentures and
$1.1 billion of preferred stock. The net proceeds from these new debt and
equity financings, and the reduction in quarterly dividends as announced in
January and July of 1993, had a positive effect on financing cash flow from the
1992 period, which was more than offset by payments to settle short-term debt.

The company's "mainline" business involves the sales of information technology
products and services as distinct from its customer financing and certain other
activities. The company believes it is important to understand the different
dynamics of these two businesses. Therefore, the company has derived a model
for separately measuring cash flow of the "mainline" business. The model is
not, however, intended to replace the GAAP cash flow above, but is
supplementary in nature. Under this model, mainline cash flow from

operations was approximately $.8 billion in 1993. Operations includes operating
and investing activities, but excludes the impacts of changes in customer
financing assets and net cash proceeds from securitization of trade accounts
receivable, which are viewed as financing in nature.

Financing Risks

Customer financing is an integral part of the company's total worldwide
offerings. Financial results of customer financing can be found on pages 47
through 50. Inherent in customer financing are certain risks: credit, interest
rate, currency and residual value. The company manages credit risk through
comprehensive credit evaluations and pricing practices. Although the company's
position is slightly on the short-funded side to take advantage of lower
short-term interest rates, the company generally strives to match liability and
asset maturities, as well as currencies, and insures that the current cost of
funding is reflected in pricing of new transactions in order to minimize
interest and currency risk.

Residual value risk is managed by developing projections of future equipment
values at lease inception, reevaluating these projections periodically, and
effectively deploying remarketing capabilities to recover residual values, and
potentially earn a profit. In 1993 and 1992, the remarketing effort generated
profits. The following table depicts an approximation of the unguaranteed
residual value maturities for the company's sales-type leases, as well as a
projection of net book value of operating leases at the end of the lease terms
as of December 31, 1993. The following schedule excludes approximately $100
million of estimated residual value associated with non-IBM equipment.

Federal Systems Company

On December 13, 1993, IBM and Loral Corporation jointly announced the signing
of a definitive agreement for the purchase of the Federal Systems Company (FSC)
by Loral for $1.575 billion in cash. The transaction is effective January 1,
1994, and is expected to close during the first calendar quarter of 1994. The
amount of any gain, and ultimate cash proceeds, resulting from this sale may be
dependent on future performance of the Advanced Automation System (AAS)
contract for the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and certain other open
matters. The FAA is conducting a re-examination of the AAS contract, and
congressional hearings are scheduled with regard to air traffic control and the
future role of the FAA.

FSC markets specialized products and services to the defense, space, and other
agencies of the U.S. government and several non-U.S. governments. Federal
Systems Marketing, which sells the company's standard products to government
agencies, is not part of the transaction. In 1993, FSC had net earnings of $58
million on revenues of $2.3 billion. It had net assets of $751 million and
approximately 10,000 employees as of December 31, 1993.

As of December 31, 1993, "full-time" employees were down 45,335 from 1992,
88,189 from 1991, and more than 150,000 from the peak level reached in 1986.
The company continues to form business entities to enhance efficiencies and
some of these entities, while not wholly owned, are consolidated into the
company's financial statements. The increase in employees in the not wholly
owned subsidiaries category since 1991 results primarily from the formation of
the following IBM business ventures: Advantis (2,876), Information Systems
Management Corporation (1,931), and Advanced Management Services Unit (1,089).

The company's complementary work force comprises various other workers hired
under temporary, part-time, and limited-term-employment arrangements to meet
specific business needs in a flexible and cost-effective manner.

Looking Forward

Although the company returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of 1993,
it was a difficult year and significant challenges remain. In 1994, the company
will continue to reduce its expenses as restructuring and other productivity
programs progress. By 1996, it is expected those actions, begun in 1993, to
reduce expense structure will yield approximately $7.0 billion in annual
savings.

The company will continue to develop a comprehensive set of strategies to meet
its long-term-growth objectives and expects the results of this strategic work
to begin to emerge in 1994.

a    Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International
Business Machines Corporation and its majority owned subsidiary companies.
Investments in business entities in which IBM does not have control, but has
the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies (generally 20 percent ownership), are accounted for by the equity
method. Other investments are accounted for by the cost method.

Revenue

Revenue is recognized from hardware sales or sales-type leases when the product
is shipped; from software when the program is shipped, as monthly license fees
accrue, or over the term of the post-contract customer support arrangement;
from maintenance and services over the contractual period, or as the services
are performed; from rentals under operating leases in the month in which they
accrue; and from financing at level rates of return over the term of the lease
or receivable. Reserves are established to provide for instances where customer
acceptance does not take place and for other potential price adjustments.

Selling Expenses

Selling expenses are charged against income as incurred.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes. Deferred
income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of
assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such
amounts recognized for tax purposes. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109, these deferred taxes are measured by applying
currently enacted tax laws. In years prior to 1992, deferred taxes were
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 96.

Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts

For non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, assets
and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.
Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the year. Translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate
component of stockholders' equity. For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that
operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary,
inventories and plant, rental machines and other property are translated at
approximate rates prevailing when acquired. All other assets and liabilities
are translated at year-end exchange rates. Inventories charged to cost of sales
and depreciation are translated at historical rates. All other income and
expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
year. Gains and losses that result from translation are included in earnings.

Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date
of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

Raw materials, work in process, and finished goods are stated at the lower of
average cost or market.

Depreciation

Plant, rental machines and other property are carried at cost, and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.

Software

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed programs are
expensed as research and development. Costs incurred subsequent to
establishment of technological feasibility to produce the finished product are
generally capitalized. The annual amortization of the capitalized amounts is
the greater of the amount computed based on the estimated revenue distribution
over the products' revenue-producing lives, or the straight-line method, and
generally over periods from two to six years. Periodic reviews are performed to
ensure that the unamortized program costs remain recoverable over future
revenues. Costs to support or service licensed programs are charged against
income as incurred, or when related revenue is recognized, whichever occurs
first.

Retirement Plans and Nonpension Postretirement Benefits

Current service costs of retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and
life insurance benefits are accrued in the period. Prior service costs
resulting from amendments to the plans are amortized over the average remaining
service period of employees expected to receive benefits.

Goodwill

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the periods
estimated to be benefited, currently not exceeding five years.

Common Stock

Common stock refers to the $1.25 par value capital stock, as designated in the
company's Certificate of Incorporation. Earnings (loss) per common share
amounts are computed by dividing earnings (loss) after deduction of preferred
stock dividends by the average number of common shares outstanding.

b    Accounting Changes

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company implemented Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," effective as of January 1, 1993. While the company has generally
been in compliance with the standard, a charge was taken to recognize the cost
of certain benefits which are primarily healthcare for employees on disability.
The company's previous practice was to recognize these costs as incurred. The
company's practice is to accrue the cost of benefits when it becomes probable
that such benefits will be paid and the amounts can be estimated. The cost of
benefits provided to other former and inactive employees has been recognized on
an accrual basis and are not affected by this change. The cumulative effect of
adopting this statement resulted in a one-time charge of $114 million (net of
approximately $61 million of income tax benefits). The ongoing annual impact of
this change is not expected to have a material effect on future earnings. Prior
years' consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect this
change.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        38


In 1992, the company implemented SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This
statement superseded the previous accounting standard for income taxes, SFAS
96, which the company adopted in 1988. Under SFAS 109, the company recognizes
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a benefit will be
realized. The cumulative effect of this accounting change, which resulted in
recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits for years prior to January 1,
1992, increased net earnings for 1992 by $1,900 million, or $3.33 per common
share. Income taxes for 1991 have not been restated for this change. Further
discussion is included on pages 42 through 44.

The company implemented SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," on the immediate recognition basis effective as
of January 1, 1991. This statement requires that the cost of these benefits,
which are primarily healthcare benefits, be recognized in the financial
statements during the employee's active working career. The company's previous
practice was to accrue these costs principally at retirement. Further
discussion is included on pages 54 through 56.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan." Under SFAS 114, creditors
should evaluate the collectibility of both contractual interest and principal
of all receivables when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Additionally,
SFAS 114 requires creditors to measure all loans that are restructured in a
troubled debt restructuring involving a modification of terms to reflect the
time value of money. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1994. In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities," which prescribes the accounting for debt and equity securities
held as assets. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1993. It is expected that the implementation of these statements
will not result in a material charge to the results of operations in the year
of adoption.

I    Preferred Stock

On June 7, 1993, the company issued 11.25 million shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, represented by 45 million depositary shares. The preferred stock is not
convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of
stock of the company. The preferred stock will have priority as to dividends
over the company's common stock. Dividends on the preferred stock are
cumulative and accrue from the date of original issue at a rate of $7.50 per
share (equivalent to $1.875 per depositary share). The preferred stock is not
redeemable prior to July 1, 2001. Thereafter, the company, at its option, may
redeem the preferred stock, in

<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        42


whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price per share of $100 ($25 per
depositary share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon any dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the company, holders of the
preferred stock will be entitled to receive $100 per share ($25 per depositary
share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends before any distribution to holders of
the company's common stock.

The impact of tax law changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities in 1993
was a benefit of $170 million, of which $71 million related to the U.S. and $99
million related to the non-U.S.

In 1992, the company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This statement superseded the
previous accounting standard for income taxes, SFAS 96,

<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        43

which the company
adopted in 1988. Both SFAS 96 and SFAS 109 require the use of the liability
method for recording deferred income taxes.

However, under SFAS 96, deferred tax assets could not be recognized unless they
offset reversals of deferred tax liabilities or could be recovered as income
tax refunds through existing loss carryback provisions. Under SFAS 109, the
company recognizes deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a
benefit will be realized.

The cumulative effect of this accounting change, which resulted in recognizing
previously unrecognized tax benefits for years prior to January 1, 1992,
increased net earnings for 1992 by $1,900 million, or $3.33 per common share.
Income taxes for 1991 have not been restated for this change.

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the
amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes
and such amounts recognized for tax purposes.

The valuation allowance applies to U.S. federal tax credit and net operating
loss carryforwards, state and local net deferred tax assets and net operating
loss carryforwards, and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions
that may expire before the company can utilize them. The net change in the
total valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 1993, was an increase
of $3,059 million and for the year ended December 31, 1992, was an increase of
$1,647 million.

The estimated reversal periods for the largest deductible temporary differences
are: Restructuring   2 years; Retiree Medical   1-30 years.

The consolidated effective income tax rate was (9) percent in 1993, (24)
percent in 1992, and 607 percent in 1991.

A reconciliation of the company's effective tax rate to the statutory U.S.
federal tax rate is as follows:

Year ended December 31   1993 1992 1991

Statutory rate (35)%     (34)%     34%

U.S. valuation allowance related to restructuring 20   6    332

Foreign tax differential 7    5    325

State and local, net               (62)

Other     (1)  (1)  (22)

Effective rate (9)% (24)%     607%

For tax return purposes, the company has available tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $2,432 million, of which $48 million expire in 1995, $461 million
expire in 1996, $712 million expire in 1998, and the remainder thereafter. No
tax credit carryforwards expire in 1997. The company also has federal, state
and local, and foreign tax loss carryforwards, the tax effect of which is
$2,648 million. Most of these carryforwards are available for fifteen years.

Undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries included in consolidated
retained earnings amounted to $10,915 million at December 31, 1993, $12,182
million at December 31, 1992, and $13,991 million at December 31, 1991. These
earnings, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted
substantially free of additional tax. Accordingly, no material provision has
been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings nor
is it practicable to determine the amount of this liability.

K    Research, Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expenses amounted to $ 5,558 million in
1993, $6,522 million in 1992, and $6,644 million in 1991.

Included in these amounts were expenditures of $4,431 million in 1993, $5,083
million in 1992, and $5,001 million in 1991 for a broad program of research and
development activities covering basic scientific research in a variety of
fields and the application of scientific advances to the development of new and
improved products and their uses. Of these amounts, software-related activities
were $1,097 million, $1,161 million, and $994 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively. In addition, expenditures for product-related engineering
amounted to $1,127 million, $1,439 million, and $1,643 million for the same
three years.

L    Restructuring Actions

The company has taken a series of actions since 1985 to streamline and reduce
resources utilized in the business. During 1993 and 1992, the company recorded
restructuring charges of $8.9 billion before taxes ($8.0 billion after taxes or
$14.02 per common share) and $11.6 billion before taxes ($8.3 billion after
taxes or $14.51 per common share), respectively. These charges are summarized
in the table below:

(Dollars in billions)                             Reserve to be

* $5.1 billion included in Other accrued expenses and liabilities, $1.6 billion
included in Other liabilities, and $3.6 billion included in Plant, Rental
Machines and Other Property in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
at December 31, 1993.

During 1991, the company also recorded a restructuring charge of $3.7 billion
before taxes ($2.9 billion after taxes or $5.03 per common share). The actions
contemplated in the 1991 charge were associated with work force reductions and
relocations, facility consolidations, and other related items, which have been
essentially completed.

The company records restructuring charges against operations and provides a
reserve based upon the best information available at the time the decision is
made to undertake the restructuring action. The reserves are subsequently
utilized when specific restructuring criteria are met, indicating the planned
restructuring action has occurred. Work-force-related reserves are considered
utilized at payment for either termination or acceptance of other contractual
arrangements. Manufacturing capacity reserves are considered utilized based on
execution of planned actions at each affected location. The reserve for excess
space is utilized when the remaining lease obligations are settled, or the
space has been vacated and subleased.

<PAGE>
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        46


It is the company's policy to continue to charge normal depreciation, rent and
other operating costs relating to manufacturing capacity and excess space to
the ongoing cost of operations while they remain in business use.

The $11.4 billion of work-force-related reserves taken in 1992 and 1993
contemplated worldwide staff reductions of approximately 110,000 people.
Through 1993 approximately 75,000 people have left the company under these
programs. Although work-force-related restructuring actions through 1993 have
affected all parts of the company worldwide, the reductions have been more
heavily weighted toward positions in the United States. Remaining staff
reductions are expected to occur primarily during 1994 and be more heavily
weighted toward positions outside the United States. Included in the 1993
charge, and considered utilized, is $1.4 billion relating to the company's
pension and other postretirement plans, referred to as a "curtailment loss."
This loss is the recognition in the current period of actuarial charges that
otherwise might have been amortized over future periods.

Cash outlays associated with unutilized work-force-related reserves are
expected to be expended substantially in 1994 and 1995, except for the
curtailment portion of the charge which will be expended as required for
funding appropriate pension and other postretirement plans in future years. The
required manufacturing capacity charges will not involve substantial cash
outlays. Cash requirements related to excess space charges are expected to be
expended as follows: $575 million in 1994, $325 million in 1995, $240 million
in 1996, and $700 million in 1997 and beyond.

M    Interest on Debt

Interest on borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries amounted to $2,298
million in 1993, $2,698 million in 1992, and $2,667 million in 1991. Of these
amounts, $46 million in 1993, $101 million in 1992, and $143 million in 1991
were capitalized. The remainder was charged to cost of rentals and financing,
and interest expense.

N    Other Liabilities

Other liabilities consists principally of accruals for nonpension
postretirement benefits, indemnity and retirement plan reserves for non-U.S.
employees, and restructuring charges.

O    Environmental

The company continues to participate in environmental assessments and cleanups
at a number of locations, including operating facilities, previously owned
facilities, Superfund and other waste sites. The company accrues for all known
environmental liabilities for remediation cost when a cleanup program becomes
probable and costs can be reasonably estimated. The amounts accrued were $77
million and $36 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        47

The amounts accrued do not cover sites which are in the preliminary stages of
investigation where neither the company's percentage of responsibility nor the
extent of cleanup required have been identified. It also excludes the cost of
internal environmental protection programs which are primarily preventive and
abatement related. While the company has received and expects to receive
insurance recoveries which offset a portion of the company's cost, the accrual
reflects gross estimated liability. Estimated environmental costs are not
expected to materially impact the financial position or results of the
company's operations in future periods. However, environmental cleanup periods
are protracted in length and earnings in future periods are subject to changes
in business conditions.

P    Customer Financing

The primary focus of IBM's worldwide customer financing offerings is to support
customers in their acquisitions of IBM's products and services. This support is
provided in certain countries through financing subsidiaries, and from
operations in those countries where the company does not maintain a separate
financing subsidiary, such as Canada, Germany, Italy, and Japan. For purposes
of this note, the results of customer financing in all countries are presented
in a consistent manner.

Total assets for financing subsidiaries at December 31, 1993, were $14,661
million, compared to $16,205 million at year-end 1992. These assets were
financed by $9,728 million of debt at December 31, 1993, compared to $11,288
million at December 31, 1992. Total financing and other income from financing
subsidiaries was $2,875 million, $2,701 million, and $2,250 million for 1993,
1992, and 1991, respectively. Net earnings from financing subsidiaries for
1993, 1992, and 1991 were $322 million, $286 million, and $231 million,
respectively. These wholly owned subsidiaries are consolidated in the company's
financial statements, and are reflected in the following financial schedules in
addition to the financial results of those countries that do not have a
financing subsidiary.

For comparability purposes, the following schedules reflect the financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows for customer financing in
comparison to the company's consolidated results with customer financing
results reflected on the equity basis. This involves presenting the investment
and related return from customer financing as reflected in the company's
consolidated financial statements, within a single line item. For the statement
of financial position, customer financing's assets net of related liabilities,
and after elimination of applicable intracompany transactions, are shown
separately as a single line item, investment in customer financing.
Eliminations primarily pertain to internal mark-ups to fair value on equipment
held on operating leases, and the normal elimination of intracompany payables
and receivables. With respect to the statement of earnings, net earnings for
customer financing before applicable taxes and after elimination of related
intracompany transactions are included in the line description, Other income.

For the statement of cash flows, certain cash flow activities are reclassified
to be consistent with the classification of such activities reflected in the
company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Such reclassifications
primarily pertain to cash flow activity related to financing receivables.

<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        48

Because customer financing is different in nature from the company's
manufacturing and services businesses, management believes that the
aforementioned type of comparative disclosure enhances an understanding and
analysis of the consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        50

Customer financing debt at December 31, 1993, consisted of borrowings directly
with external financial institutions of $17,562 million and intracompany
borrowings of $3,569 million at market rates of interest. Intracompany
borrowings are made pursuant to loan agreements between the parties.

Other liabilities represents amounts due to affiliates, and primarily consists
of trade payables arising from purchases of equipment for term leases,
installment payment agreements, and software licenses, with payment terms
comparable to those offered to IBM's external customers.

The earnings yielded a return on average invested capital of 18.4 percent in
1993, compared to 17.1 percent  for the same 1992 period. Included within these
results are intracompany services and fees received for tax benefits provided
to the company resulting from tax deferrals generated by financing
transactions. Such fees are eliminated from the consolidated Statement of
Earnings.

The provision for income taxes for customer financing is based on the statutory
income tax rate of each country, calculated on a separate return basis.

Q    Rental Expense and Lease Commitments

Rental expense, including amounts charged to inventories and fixed assets,
excluding amounts charged to restructuring, were $1,686 million in 1993, $2,108
million in 1992, and $2,056 million in 1991. Gross minimum rental commitments,
in millions of dollars, under non-cancellable leases for 1994, and thereafter,
are as follows: 1994, $1,395; 1995, $1,158; 1996, $1,053; 1997, $858; 1998,
$864; and after 1998, $3,256. Included in these amounts are leases for vacant
space that the company had reserved for in restructuring charges. These lease
commitments, valued in millions of dollars, are: 1994, $288; 1995, $267; 1996,
$209; 1997, $183; 1998, $174; and after 1998, $432. The company has entered
into sublease commitments, but the amounts were insignificant at December 31,
1993. These leases are principally for the rental of office premises.

R    Long-Term Performance Plan

The IBM 1989 Long-Term Performance Plan provides for incentive awards to be
made to officers and other key employees. The plan is administered by the
Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of
Directors. The Committee determines the type of award to be granted, which may
include stock, a stock option, a Stock Appreciation Right (SAR), cash, or any
combination thereof. The number of shares made available for granting in the
year was .85 percent of IBM's projected outstanding common stock as of December
31, 1993. Prior to 1989, stock options were issued under the IBM 1986 and
predecessor Stock Option Plans.

<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        51

Options allow the purchase of IBM's common stock at 100 percent of the market
price on the date of grant and have a maximum duration of 10 years. Payment by
the optionee upon exercise of an option may be made using IBM stock as well as
cash.

SARs offer eligible optionees the alternative of electing not to exercise the
related stock option, but to receive payment in cash and/or stock, equivalent
to the difference between the option price and the average market price of IBM
stock on the date of exercising the right.

The following table summarizes option activity during 1993 and 1992:

Number of shares under option      1993 1992

Balance at January 1     35,621,963     27,382,266

Options granted     13,744,772     9,723,804

Exercisable at December 31    14,636,324     21,372,943

In April 1993, the committee of the Board of Directors then responsible for
administering the plan, the Nominating and Executive Compensation Committee,
approved management's plan to allow optionees, other than executive officers,
to voluntarily forfeit all of their existing IBM stock options, granted from
1984 through 1992, in exchange for a fewer number of new stock option grants.
Under this program, 18,054,615 options, at average prices ranging from $66.94
to $159.50, were terminated and 7,405,090 new options at a price of $47.88 were
granted.

There were no options exercised in 1993. The options exercised in 1992 were at
an average option price of $62.25 per share. The shares under option at
December 31, 1993, were at option prices ranging from $43.00 to $159.50 per
share. The shares under option at December 31, 1992, were at option prices
ranging from $50.37 to $159.50 per share.

There were 6,011,858 and 1,362,687 unused shares carried forward and made
available for granting in the subsequent year as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

S    Stock Purchase Plan

The IBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan") enables employees who are
not participants in IBM's stock option programs to purchase IBM common stock
through payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation. The
price an employee pays for a share of stock is 85 percent of the average market
price on the date the employee has accumulated enough money to buy a share.

<PAGE>
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        52


In July 1993, the Board of Directors approved management's plan to issue,
instead of purchase on the open market, stock to be sold to employees under the
Plan.

During 1993, employees purchased 9,796,460 shares, including 6,451,066 treasury
shares, for which $419 million was paid to IBM. There were 21,702,501 reserved
unissued shares available for purchase under the Plan at December 31, 1993.

T    Retirement Plans

The company and its subsidiaries have retirement plans covering substantially
all employees. The total cost of all plans for 1993, 1992, and 1991 was $1,525
million, $838 million, and $527 million, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost of the U.S. retirement plan and selected non-U.S.
plans for the years ended December 31 included the following components:

Annual cost is determined using the Projected Unit Credit actuarial method.
Prior service cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits. An
assumption is made for modified career average plans such that the average
earnings base period will be updated to the years prior to retirement.

Termination incentive expenses represent the cost of special retirement
benefits offered to employees for a short period of time in exchange for
voluntary termination of service. Curtailment losses reflect the significant
reductions in the expected years of future service caused by 1993 termination
programs and represent the immediate recognition of associated prior service
cost and a portion of previously unrecognized actuarial losses.

In the Consolidated Statement of Operations, the curtailment losses and
termination expenses, referred to above, are included in restructuring charges.

The table below provides information on the status of the U.S. retirement plan,
and selected non-U.S. plans that represent approximately 97 percent of the
total non-U.S. accumulated benefit obligations.

The U.S. plan's vested benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and
projected benefit obligation increased in 1993 primarily as a result of a
change in the discount rate and the curtailment. The projected benefit
obligation increased $3,938 million from the change in discount rate and $1,105
million as a result of the curtailment.

It is the company's practice to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet
the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit and tax laws,
and such additional amounts as the company may determine

to be appropriate from time to time. In July 1993, the Board of Directors
authorized the issuance of up to 15 million shares of IBM common stock to be
contributed to the U.S. Pension Plan Fund through 1994. There were 9,171,030
shares remaining of that authorization at December 31, 1993. The assets of the
various plans include corporate equities, government securities, corporate debt
securities, and income-producing real estate.

U.S. Plan: U.S. regular, full-time, and part-time employees are covered by a
noncontributory plan which is funded by company contributions to an irrevocable
trust fund, which is held for the sole benefit of employees. Monthly retirement
benefits generally represent the greater of a fixed amount per year of service,
or a percent of career compensation. For plan purposes, effective April 1,
1993, annual compensation before January 1, 1994, is defined as the average
annual compensation paid for the years 1989 through 1993. Benefits become
vested upon the completion of five years of service. The company introduced
plan amendments in 1991 including the elimination of all retirement age
reduction factors for employees who retire with 30 or more years of service,
and a new provision that provides additional income in a tax-deferred manner to
employees at retirement. The number of individuals receiving benefits at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, was 77,664 and 69,153, respectively.

Non-U.S. Plans: Most subsidiaries and branches outside the United States have
retirement plans covering substantially all employees, under which funds are
deposited under various fiduciary-type arrangements, annuities are purchased
under group contracts, or reserves are provided. Retirement benefits are based
on years of service and the employee's compensation, generally during a fixed
number of years immediately prior to retirement. The ranges of assumptions used
for the non-U.S. plans reflect the different economic environments within the
various countries.

U    Nonpension Postretirement Benefits

The company and its U.S. subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans
that provide medical, dental, and life insurance for retirees and eligible
dependents. In 1993, the company applied plan cost maximums to those who
retired prior to January 1, 1992. These maximums will take effect beginning
with the year 2001. Plan cost maximums were established in 1990 for those
employees retiring after December 31, 1991.

Effective January 1, 1991, the company and its subsidiaries implemented on the
immediate recognition basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."
This statement requires that the cost of these benefits, which are primarily
for healthcare, be recognized in the financial statements during the employee's
active working career. The company's previous practice was to accrue these
costs principally at retirement.

The transition effect of adopting SFAS 106 on the immediate recognition basis,
as of January 1, 1991, resulted in a charge of $2,263 million to 1991 earnings,
net of approximately $350 million of income tax benefits. This charge includes
a previously unrecognized accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of
approximately $4.8 billion, offset by $2.2 billion related to plan assets and
accruals under the company's previous accounting practice. This obligation was
determined by application of the terms of medical, dental, and life insurance

plans, including the effects of established maximums on covered costs, together
with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates projected
at annual rates ranging ratably from 14 percent in 1991 to 6 percent through
the year 2007.

The healthcare cost trend rate was 13 percent in 1993. The effect of a 1
percent annual increase in these assumed cost trend rates would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $70 million; the
annual costs would not be materially affected.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December 31
included the following components:

     1993 1992*     1991*

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  9.5% 9.5% 9.0%

The table below provides information on the status of the plans.

The funded status at December 31 was as follows:

          1993 1992

Assumed discount rate         7.25%     8.5%

(Dollars in millions)

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:

     Retirees  $    (5,761)   $    (5,194)
     Fully eligible active plan participants (673)     (739)

     Other active plan participants     (927)     (988)

     Total     (7,361)   (6,921)

Plan assets at fair value     1,366     1,453

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in

     excess of plan assets    (5,995)   (5,468)

Unrecognized net loss    1,431     1,098

Unrecognized prior service cost    (828)     241

Accrued postretirement benefit cost recognized

     in the statement of financial position  $    (5,392)   $    (4,129)

In 1993, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation increased $830
million as a result of the change in the assumed discount rate and $675 million
from the curtailment. The plan change allowing the company to limit the amount
it contributes for providing retiree healthcare benefits reduced the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $1,011 million.

It is the company's practice to fund amounts for postretirement benefits with
an independent trustee, as deemed appropriate from time to time. The plan
assets include corporate equities and government securities. The accounting for
the plan is based on the written plan.

Certain of the company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have similar plans for retirees.
However, most retirees outside the United States are covered by
government-sponsored and administered programs, and the obligations and cost of
these programs are not significant to the company.

V    Lines of Credit

As part of the company's ongoing efforts toward greater centralization of its
treasury activities and to ensure appropriate liquidity levels, in December
1993 the company entered into a $10.0 billion committed global credit facility
with 81 banks worldwide. This global credit facility will replace most of the
existing committed credit facilities and some of the uncommitted credit
facilities currently in place throughout the world. Unused lines of credit from
previously existing credit arrangements for those geographies which have not
been replaced as of December 31, 1993, by the worldwide credit facility, were
$5,707 million. Consequently,

<PAGE>
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies        57

total available committed and uncommitted lines of credit at December 31, 1993,
were $15,707 million, compared to $6,950 million at December 31, 1992. Interest
rates on borrowings vary from country to country depending on local market
conditions.

W    Sales and Securitization of Receivables

During 1993, total cash proceeds from the sale and securitization of trade and
financing receivables to investors were $6.8 billion, as part of the company's
worldwide program of securitizing assets and improving its liquidity. Of the
total proceeds of $6.8 billion, approximately $2.5 billion represents the net
year-over-year increase in securitized receivables. During 1993, no material
gain or loss resulted from these transactions. Recourse amounts associated with
the aforementioned sales and securitization activities are expected to be
minimal, and adequate reserves are in place to cover potential losses.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position include  $751 million of net assets that have been
reclassified pending the sale of FSC, as discussed on page 30.

X    Financial Instruments

In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, at December 31, 1993, the
company has used a variety of methods and assumptions, which were based on
estimates of market conditions and risks existing at that time. For certain
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, non-trade accounts payable
and accruals, and short-term debt, it was assumed that the carrying amount
approximated fair value for the majority of these instruments because of their
short maturity. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for the same or similar
instrument were used for the majority of marketable securities, long-term
investments and  long-term debt. Other techniques, such as option pricing
models, estimated discounted value of future cash flows, replacement cost, and
termination cost, have been used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. These values merely represent a general approximation of
possible value and may never actually be realized.

The estimated fair values of the company's financial instruments, both on and
off the balance sheet, are summarized on the following page.

Interest rate and currency swap agreements   (37) (147)

Financial guarantees     --   (749)

Some of the foregoing financial instruments have off-balance-sheet risk. In the
normal course of business, the company enters into a variety of forward
contracts, options, and swaps in order to limit its exposure to loss resulting
from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates.

The company receives significant dividends and intracompany royalties from its
non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due to the volatility of the currency markets, it is
prudent to employ the use of financial hedging instruments to minimize the
company's potential exposure on these cash flows.

In addition, in order to raise funds on a more cost-effective basis, the
company centrally borrows to meet the consolidated financing requirements of
its subsidiaries. The central financing facility in turn provides local
currency denominated debt to the individual subsidiaries via currency and
interest rate swap agreements.

These instruments are executed with credit-worthy financial institutions, and
virtually all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major
industrial countries. Gains and losses on these contracts serve as hedges in
that they offset fluctuations that would otherwise impact the company's
financial results. Costs associated with entering into such contracts are
generally amortized over the life of the instruments and are not material to
the company's financial results.

In assessing financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk, the following
summary of contract or notional (face) amounts outstanding at year-end provides
an indication of the extent of the company's involvement in such instruments.
The company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its financial
position resulting from its involvement in these instruments, nor does it
anticipate non-performance by any of its counterparties.

The company does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk.

IBM has guaranteed certain loans and commitments of various ventures to which
it is a party. Additionally, the company is contingently liable for certain
receivables sold with recourse. These commitments, which in the aggregate are
approximately $2 billion, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the company's financial results.

Y    Segment Information

IBM is in the business of helping customers solve problems through the use of
advanced information technologies. The company operates primarily in the single
industry segment that creates value by offering services, software, systems,
products, and technologies. This segment represents more than 90 percent of
consolidated revenue, operating profit, and identifiable assets. The following
schedule shows revenue by classes of similar products or services within the
information technology segment.

Financial information by geographic area is summarized on pages 61 and 62.

These hardware classes of products represent groupings that perform similar
functions, as opposed to the complete spectrum of products associated with
IBM's product divisions. Accordingly, they do not represent the full range of
any division's offerings, which could include related peripherals, software,
and maintenance.

Software includes both applications and systems software. Maintenance consists
of separately billed charges for maintenance. Services represent a wide range
of service offerings including consulting, education, systems development,
managed operations, and availability services. Financing and other is composed
primarily of financing revenue and products and supplies not otherwise
classified.

Some products logically fit in more than one class and are assigned to a
specific class based on a variety of factors. Over time, products tend to
overlap, merge into, or split from existing classes as a result of changing
technologies, market perceptions, and/or customer use. For example, market
demand may create requirements for technological enhancements to permit a
peripheral product to be functionally integrated with a display, a
telecommunication device, and a processor to form a workstation. Such
interchangeability and technological progress tend to make year-to-year
comparisons less valid than they would be in an industry less subject to rapid
change.

Marketing and services in the United States and Canada are managed as a single
enterprise. However, in compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise," the
United States is reported as a separate geographic area. Canadian operations
are included in the "Americas" area.

Non-U.S. subsidiaries operating in local currency environments account for
approximately 85 percent of the company's non-U.S. revenue. The remaining 15
percent is from subsidiaries and branches operating in U.S. dollars or in
highly inflationary environments.

In the Europe/Middle East/Africa area, European operations accounted for
approximately 95 percent of revenue in 1993, 1992, and 1991.

Interarea transfers consist principally of completed machines, subassemblies
and parts, and software. Machines, subassemblies and parts are generally
transferred at an intracompany selling price. Software transfers represent
 license fees paid by non-U.S. subsidiaries. The intracompany selling price that
relates to fixed asset transfers is capitalized and depreciated by the
importing area.

     In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company implemented Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits," effective as of January 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of adopting
this standard resulted in a one-time charge of $114 million (net of
approximately $61 million of income tax benefits), which was recorded against
first quarter results. The 1993 quarterly Consolidated Statement of Operations
are restated in Exhibit IVa. The accounting change is discussed on page 37 of
IBM's 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders.
