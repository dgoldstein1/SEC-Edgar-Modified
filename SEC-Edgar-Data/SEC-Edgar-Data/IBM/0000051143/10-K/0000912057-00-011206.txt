                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS:

    International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the
State of New York on June 15, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.
(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating
Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. In 1924,
C-T-R adopted the name International Business Machines Corporation.

    IBM uses advanced information technology to provide customer solutions. The
company operates primarily in a single industry using several segments that
create value by offering a variety of solutions that include, either singularly
or in some combination, technologies, systems, products, services, software and
financing.

    Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise three hardware
product segments -- Technology, Personal Systems and Server; a Global Services
segment; a Software segment; a Global Financing segment and an Enterprise
Investments segment. The segments are determined based on several factors,
including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery
channels.

    IBM offers its products through its global sales and distribution
organizations. The sales and distribution organization has both a geographic
focus (in the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa, and Asia Pacific) and a
specialized and global industry focus. In addition, this organization includes a
global sales and distribution effort devoted exclusively to small and medium
businesses. IBM also offers its products through a variety of third party
distributors and resellers, as well as through its on-line channels.

    While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are
important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially
dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of
patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which
vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM
have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions.
These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing
products and services similar to or duplicative of the company's nor can there
be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation
or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances
that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the
future.

    IBM's businesses employ a wide variety of components, supplies and raw
materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. To date, the
company has found that the components, supplies and raw materials that are
necessary for the manufacture, production and delivery of its products have been
available in the quantities that are required. Certain of the company's
businesses rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although the company
makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need
arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies
and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could
adversely affect the company's business.

    IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new
products, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology
purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These
factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in
the immediately preceding fourth quarter.

    The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future
revenues from the company's product offerings due to the significant proportion
of revenue from services, the volume of products delivered from shelf
inventories, and the shortening of product delivery schedules. With respect to
the company's Global Services segment, in 1999 the company signed contracts
totaling over $38 billion, which contributed to a services backlog at
December 31, 1999 in excess of $60 billion, compared with $51 billion at the end
of 1998.

                                       1
<PAGE>
    The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive
pressures. The company's businesses face a significant number of competitors,
ranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small,
rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes that
its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the
breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors.

    Intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the
company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss
of market opportunity. Unlike many of its competitors, the company has a
portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses
while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product
lines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its
businesses to the same degree that its competitors do and these competitors may
have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than
the businesses against which they compete.

    The company operates in more than 150 countries worldwide and derives more
than half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the
laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the
company's business in that country and the company's results of operations. The
company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political
changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions
and inflation. For example, weakness in the Asian and Latin American economies
had an adverse effect on the company's business in 1998.

    The following information is included in IBM's 1999 Annual Report to
Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:

    Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or
services--Pages 89 through 93.

    Financial information by geographic areas--Page 93.

    Amount spent during each of the last three years on research and development
activities--Page 82.

    Financial information regarding environmental activities--Page 77.

    The number of persons employed by the registrant--Page 63.

    The management discussion overview--Page 52.

    Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in
this Annual Report may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("Reform Act").
The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders
and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time
to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide
current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include
any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.
Words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "estimates," "intends,"
"plans," "projects," and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking
statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth below are cautionary
statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should
carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The following cautionary
statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed
elsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference.

    New Products and the Pace of Technological Change: The company's results of
operations depend on the continued successful development and marketing of new
and innovative products and services. The development of new products and
services requires significant capital investments by the company's

                                       2
<PAGE>
various businesses and the success of these products and services depends on
their acceptance by customers and business partners. Further, the company's
businesses are characterized by rapid technological changes and corresponding
shifts in customer demand, resulting in unpredictable product transitions and
shortened life cycles and increasing emphasis on being first to market with new
products and services.

    There can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce new
products and services, that these products and services will be accepted by
customers, or that the company's businesses will recoup or realize a return on
their capital investments. In addition, from time to time the company may
experience difficulties or delays in the development, production or marketing of
new products and services.

    Volatility of Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a
number of factors, including quarterly variations in results, the competitive
landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections
by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the
company's stock price is subject to significant volatility.

    Dependence on Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company
depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel,
including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the
information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their
talents is intense. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to
successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs.

    Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant
percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from its affiliates operating in local
currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative
values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the
company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of
credit risk and the creditworthiness of the customer, interest rate and currency
fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of
residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these
risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives
involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can
be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be
successful.

    Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through
a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or
business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company
to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market.

    Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to
make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and
alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration
of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the
company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES:

    At December 31, 1999, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the
United States had aggregate floor space of 41.6 million square feet, of which
33.3 million was owned and 8.3 million was leased. Of these amounts,
2.8 million square feet was vacant and 2.1 million square feet was being leased
to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled
16.1 million square feet, of which 11.1 million was owned and 5.0 million was
leased. Of these amounts, .3 million square feet was vacant and .4 million
square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses.

    Although improved production techniques, productivity gains and
infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor
space, continuous upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological
leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand. For additional
information on expenditures for plant, rental machines and other property, refer
to "Investments" on page 60 of IBM's 1999 Annual Report to Stockholders which is
incorporated herein by reference.

                               SUMMARY OF THE
                   IBM SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETENTION PLAN

      The IBM Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan is amended and renamed
the IBM Supplemental Executive Retention Plan ("SERP"), effective July 1,
1999.

I. ELIGIBILITY

      All retired executives currently receiving benefits from the prior SERP
on June 30, 1999, and all executives who (a) are within five years of
retirement eligibility, and have completed IBM employment of at least one
year, on June 30, 1999, and (b) have met the prior SERP average pay threshold
based on earnings for service to December 31, 1998, will continue to be
covered by the provisions of the prior SERP in existence on June 30, 1999.
The calculation of any additional benefits payable under the prior SERP will
always be based on the IBM Retirement Plan as the offsetting pension plan
even if the executive chooses to be covered by the IBM Personal Pension Plan
and the formula breakpoint (but not the pay threshold) will be indexed by at
least 5% per year beginning in 2000).

     Executives who (a) are more than 5 years from retirement eligibility, and
have completed IBM employment of at least one year on June 30, 1999 and (b)
have met the prior SERP average pay threshold based on earnings for service
to December 31, 1998, will be covered by transition provisions as described
in Section III below.

      All executives who meet the following criteria on the day they leave
active employment of IBM US, will be covered by the provisions of the current
SERP as described in Section II below:

      - actively employed by IBM US as an executive;

      - at least age 60 with 5 years of service (or age 55 with 15 years of
        service and leave with the approval of senior management);

      - Meet the average pay threshold of $250,000 for 1999 (increased
        annually by at least 5% per annum).

      Executives who are eligible under the provisions of both the prior SERP
and current SERP, shall receive benefits based on the provisions of the SERP
which provides the greater benefits.

II. CURRENT SERP PROVISIONS AS OF JULY 1, 1999

      Full benefits (based on the formula described below) are available only
to eligible executives who leave employment with IBM US at or after age 60
with at least five years of service.  Eligible executives who leave
employment with IBM at or after age 55 with at least 15 years of service may
receive a reduced benefit at the discretion of IBM senior management
(reduction is 6% per year on the total benefit based on the formula described
below), prorated for years and months of age prior to age 60).

      The total benefit formula is based on "average pensionable pay."  This
is "eligible compensation" (as defined in the IBM Retirement Plan, except
that annual incentive for Sales Executives will be counted at target starting
with 1999 earnings) earned over a five-year period (greater of final
five-years of IBM or five highest consecutive calendar years).  The formula
is:

      the sum of (a) 1% of average pensionable pay up to the Current SERP
      pay threshold for that year and (b) 2.5% of average pensionable pay
      above the Current SERP pay threshold for that year,

      multiplied by years of service (up to a maximum of 35 years of service).

      In no case can the total benefit under the SERP formula be greater than
65% of average pensionable pay times a fraction, the numerator of which is
actual years of service (up to a maximum of 35) and the denominator of which
is 35.

<PAGE>

      The total benefit derived from this formula is then offset by the
single-life annuity available to or chosen by the individual from the IBM
Personal Pension Plan, except that, for executives who were within 5 years of
retirement under the IBM Retirement Plan and have completed IBM employment of
at lest one year on June 30, 1999, the formula is offset by the single life
annuity under the IBM Retirement Plan, even if the executives chooses to be
covered by the IBM Personal Pension Account.  The annuity options available
are the same as the annuity options available under the IBM Personal Pension
Plan (and different forms of annuity distribution may be elected under each
of the plans).

      If an eligible executives dies while in service after reaching age 55
with at least 15 years of service or age 60 with at least 5 years of service
(and met the average pay threshold in effect at time of death), the surviving
spouse or domestic partner will be eligible for a benefit payable as a single
life annuity.  The total benefit will be calculated based on the annuity that
would have been payable had the executive separated on the date of death,
elected a 50% joint and survivor annuity and died the same day.  This benefit
will be offset by the Personal Pension Plan annuity paid to the surviving
spouse or domestic partner (or otherwise payable had a different form of
Personal Pension Plan payout not applied).  If an eligible executive becomes
disabled after reaching age 55 with at least 15 years of service or age 60
with at least 5 years of service (and met the average pay threshold in effect
at that time), the SERP applies based on service to the date the IBM
disability benefit starts.  Pre-age 60 reduction factors apply to both death
and disability benefits.

      SERP benefits continue to be subject to forfeiture if the executive
engages in activities which IBM in its discretion considers to IBM, including
for an IBM competitor.

      If an executive is rehired after a period of severance, service prior
to that period of severance will be forfeited for purposes of the current
SERP formula.

III. TRANSITION

      Executives who (a) are more than 5 years form retirement eligibility,
and have completed IBM employment o fat least one year, on June 30, 1999 and
(b) have met the prior SERP average pay threshold based on earnings for
service to December 31, 1998, will be covered by the following transition
provisions:

      These individuals will be covered by the current SERP provisions as of
July 1, 1999.  In addition, the prior SERP formula in effect on June 30,
1999, will continue to accrue until December 31, 2003 (the formula breakpoint
(but not the pay threshold) will be indexed by at least 5% per year beginning
in 2000).  At that time, the total benefit accrued under that formula will be
calculated and will be frozen.  When the executives leave IBM US, he or she
will be eligible for a SERP benefit equal to the greater of:

      - The current SERP benefit determined based on the provisions in
        Section II (provided the individual is eligible based on those
        provisions); or

      - The frozen benefit calculated as described above provided at
        departure the individual meets the age and service eligibility
        criteria of the prior SERP (and reduced if the executive leaves
        before age 60);

Offset by the IBM Personal Pension Plan benefit as described in Section II.

                              report of management

                   International Business Machines Corporation
                            and Subsidiary Companies

Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information
presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of
organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and
delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. We
believe this structure provides reasonable assurance that transactions are
executed in accordance with management authorization, and that they are
appropriately recorded, in order to permit preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to adequately
safeguard, verify and maintain accountability of assets. An important element of
the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program.

To assure the effective administration of internal control, we carefully select
and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and
procedures, provide appropriate communication channels, and foster an
environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that
it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance
with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct
Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are
distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal
programs to assure that they are understood and followed.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, is retained to examine
IBM's financial statements. Its accompanying report is based on an examination
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including a
review of the internal control structure and tests of accounting procedures and
records.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of outside
directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent
accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder
approval. The Audit Committee meets periodically and privately with the
independent accountants, with our internal auditors, as well as with IBM
management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure and
financial reporting matters.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of International Business Machines
Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, appearing on
pages 64 through 93, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.

                              management discussion

                   International Business Machines Corporation
                            and Subsidiary Companies

Overview of 1999

IBM's financial performance reflects two very different halves of 1999. The
company's performance in the first half was strong. The second half was hit hard
by Y2K-related issues, as many of its large customers locked down their systems
and technology purchases heading into the Y2K transition. Despite the difficult
second half, the overall year was a good one for the company. Revenue, net
income and earnings per share were at record levels. The company also had good
results on a full-year basis in the strategic growth areas of services, software
and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology.

The company reported revenue of $87.5 billion and net income of $7.7 billion
which yielded $4.12 per diluted common share. The results include an after-tax
benefit of $750 million, or $.40 per diluted common share, for a gain from the
sale of the company's Global Network to AT&T, charges for actions intended to
improve the long-term competitiveness of the company, a change in personal
computer depreciable lives and charges for acquired in-process research and
development related to acquisitions.

The company ended 1999 with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities
of $5.8 billion, after funding investments of approximately $20 billion in
capital expenditures, research and development, strategic acquisitions and
repurchases of common stock. The company's debt ratios were well below 1998
levels. The non-global financing debt-to-capital ratio was 9 percent, and the
Global Financing business leverage was 5.5 to 1.

Challenges

The company believes that it has passed the most critical stage of Y2K. However,
because it expects the lockdowns to be lifted at different times by different
customers during the early part of 2000, the company will feel the lingering
effects of Y2K.

Consistent with the fundamental strategy that it put in place several years ago,
the company is well positioned to help its customers build integrated e-business
solutions. Services, software and OEM technology that are required for this
demanding e-business environment will drive the growth in IBM's revenue and
earnings.

In addition, the company is aggressively pursuing expanding markets. By
increasing sales and distribution through ibm.com, the company will continue to
build itself into a leading e-business company.

===============================================================================

The overall gross profit margin of 36.4 percent decreased 1.4 points from 1998,
following a 1.2 point decrease in 1998 versus 1997. The company's continued
shift in revenue to Global Services primarily drove the decline. Global Services
has a lower gross profit margin than the company's server products (S/390,
AS/400, RS/6000 and NUMA-Q), which are a declining percentage of total revenue.

Revenue for 1999 from the company's end-user businesses totaled $38.8 billion
from the Americas, an increase of 5.2 percent (7 percent increase in constant
currency) from 1998. Revenue from Europe/Middle East/Africa was $25.7 billion,
up 1.8 percent (6 percent increase in constant currency). Asia Pacific revenue
increased 19.4 percent (8 percent increase in constant currency) to $15.2
billion. OEM revenue was $7.8 billion, a 15.3 percent increase (14 percent
increase in constant currency) compared with 1998.

Information about the company's operating segments can be found in note Y,
"Segment Information," on pages 89 through 93. This note provides additional
information, including a description of the products and services of each
segment, as well as financial data pertaining to each segment.

The following discussion is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 64 through 68, which reflect, in all material respects, the company's
segment results on an external basis.

Revenue                               $37,041          $35,419          $36,630
Cost                                   27,071           24,214           23,473

Gross profit                          $ 9,970          $11,205          $13,157
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gross profit margin                      26.9%            31.6%            35.9%

Hardware revenue increased 4.6 percent from 1998, following a decline of 3.3
percent in 1998 versus 1997. Hardware gross profit dollars declined 11.0 percent
from 1998, following a decrease of 14.8 percent in 1998 from 1997.

Technology revenue increased 5.9 percent when compared with 1998, following an
increase of 7.3 percent in 1998 versus 1997. Strong growth in OEM technology,
primarily custom logic and high-performance static random access memory (SRAM)
revenue drove the increase in 1999 revenue. A slower growth rate in hard disk
drive (HDD) storage revenue in 1999 versus 1998 reflected pricing pressures and
a revenue mix away from high-end products. Lower revenues from storage tape and
direct access storage device (DASD) products, as well as lower networking
hardware revenue, partially offset those increases. The networking hardware
decreases resulted, in part, from the sale of routing and switching intellectual
property (IP) to Cisco Systems, Inc.

The company took actions in 1999 in the microelectronics and storage areas that
are aimed directly at strengthening the Technology Group over the long term.
Those actions are intended to shift the focus of the Technology Group to higher
margin businesses and more efficient operations. (See note R, "1999 Actions," on
pages 81 and 82 for additional information.)

Strong growth in HDD storage products, storage tape products and growth in
custom logic products drove the revenue increase in 1998 versus 1997. Lower
revenue from dynamic random access memory (DRAMs) and DASD sales partially
offset this revenue growth.

Personal Systems revenue grew 19.7 percent in 1999 from 1998, following a 10.9
percent decline in 1998 versus 1997. Despite continued pricing pressures,
personal computer revenue improved in 1999. Supply shortages of flat-panel
displays in the second half of 1999 constrained sales of ThinkPads, although
overall ThinkPad revenue was good. Netfinity servers demonstrated strong revenue
growth, compared with 1998 levels. The company continues to focus on expanding
its direct channel customers; improving its indirect channel efficiency;
increasing its attention on fast-growing, small- and medium-size businesses; and
realizing more opportunity in businesses that are tied to the personal computer,
including services, software and financing.

                              management discussion

                   International Business Machines Corporation
                            and Subsidiary Companies

Server revenue declined 17.9 percent in 1999 from 1998, following a decrease of
5.9 percent in 1998 versus 1997. S/390 revenue declined in 1999 as customers
completed the task of making Y2K ready the mainframe computers that they use in
data centers to run mission critical, highly integrated enterprise-wide
applications with large transaction volumes. Once the systems were Y2K tested
and ready, customers were not inclined to enhance them because of concerns about
affecting their Y2K readiness. AS/400 revenue declined due to a slowdown in
sales related to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions because of Y2K
concerns. RS/6000 revenue declined for SP-2 and entry models, partially offset
by the enterprise servers which had strong revenue growth in 1999.

Lower revenue from S/390, AS/400 and RS/6000 drove the 5.9 percent decrease in
revenue in 1998 versus 1997. While S/390 revenue declined, total delivery of
computing power increased more than 60 percent as measured in MIPS (millions of
instructions per second) versus 1997. Product transitions late in 1998 affected
the revenue for AS/400 and RS/6000 in 1998 versus 1997.

In January 2000, the Server Group reorganized to become the Enterprise Systems
Group and adopted a market-centric alignment to help customers connect and
integrate S/390, AS/400, RS/6000, NUMA-Q and Netfinity servers to support a
wider variety of applications. The reorganized group will focus on cross-server
customer requirements for Web servers, enterprise servers, mid-market servers,
and for storage subsystems across all computing environments.

During the year, the company signed major technology contracts with Dell
Computer Corporation (for the purchase of personal computer parts from the
company over seven years), Acer Incorporated (technology purchase contract over
seven years), EMC Corporation (five-year strategic technology and business
alliance), Cisco Systems, Inc. (technology purchase over five years) and
Nintendo Company, Ltd. (multi-year contract to purchase technology). The total
of these contracts could be in excess of $15 billion.

Hardware gross profit dollars decreased 11.0 percent in 1999 from 1998,
following a 14.8 percent decrease in 1998 versus 1997. In 1999, the shift in the
company's revenue away from servers, pricing pressures associated with HDDs and
memory chip prices drove the declines in gross profit dollars from 1998. A lower
model mix in the mobile HDDs (in which some customers are meeting their capacity
needs with new mid-range products, rather than with the more profitable high-end
mobile products) also had a negative effect on gross profit dollars. The decline
in gross profit dollars in 1998 was primarily driven by lower margins associated
with significant price reductions in Personal Systems products.

Hardware gross profit margin decreases in 1999 versus 1998 and 1998 versus 1997
continued to be driven by the shift in the company's revenue away from servers
to lower gross profit products, such as personal computers, OEM chip technology
and HDDs, as well as price pressures.

Global Services revenue increased 11.3 percent in 1999 from 1998 and 14.9
percent in 1998 over 1997. Revenue growth in 1999 without the effect of the sale
of the company's Global Network to AT&T would have been 13 percent. (See note D,
"Acquisitions/Divestitures," on pages 72 and 73 for additional information about
this sale.)

While maintenance revenues declined 1 percent, reflecting continued price
pressures as customers transitioned to new technologies, services revenue
excluding maintenance and the effect of the sale of the Global Network grew 17
percent. Strategic Outsourcing Services was a major contributor to this
performance. Strategic Outsourcing Services creates business value through
long-term strategic partnerships with customers by taking on responsibility for
their processes and systems. Business Innovation Services (formerly Systems
Integration and Consulting) and Integrated Technology Services (formerly Product
Support Services) performance was strong through the first nine months of 1999
but slowed in the fourth quarter due to the effect of Y2K-related customer
lockdowns and a slowdown in Y2K services.

Toward the end of the third quarter of 1999, the company started to see a
decline in demand for Y2K services and expects the effect of Y2K to linger into
2000 as the need for those services disappears. The company sees growing demand
for new services offerings especially in Business Innovation Services, which
provides business/industry consulting and end-to-end e-business implementation
of offerings like Supply Chain Management, Customer Relationship Management,
Enterprise Resource Planning and Business Intelligence. Integrated Technology
Services offers customers a single IT partner to manage multi-vendor IT systems
complexity in today's e-business environment, including traditional offerings
like Product Support Services, Business Recovery Services, Site and Connectivity
Services and Systems Management and Networking Services.

e-business spans many of the Global Services offerings and contributed
significantly to 1999 performance. e-business services offerings include:
e-business strategy and planning; e-commerce services for Web selling,
e-payments, e-procurement, security and privacy; e-business enablement services;
distributed learning; and hosted business applications such as network-delivered
applications, Web hosting and Web infrastructure outsourcing. The company's
total discrete e-business services revenue grew 60 percent to over $3 billion in
1999. Revenue from Web hosting and e-business infrastructure services doubled
over 1998 and revenue from supply chain and e-procurement services tripled.

In 1999, the company signed contracts totaling over $38 billion, including 46
deals in excess of $100 million with four of those deals in excess of $1
billion. These deals contributed to a services backlog at December 31, 1999, in
excess of $60 billion compared with $51 billion at December 31, 1998. In
addition to these contracts, the company signed two extensive strategic
alliances with Dell Computer Corporation and Cisco Systems, Inc. The company
continued to meet the demand for its services by hiring more than 17,000
employees in 1999 and 18,000 employees in 1998.

Gross profit dollars and gross profit margins improved in 1999 over 1998.
Significant productivity improvements more than offset competitive pressures and
the negative effect of the changing mix of services and maintenance within the
Global Services portfolio.

Software revenue increased 6.7 percent in 1999 from 1998, following an increase
of 6.3 percent from 1997. The company's middleware products (which comprise, for
both IBM and non-IBM platforms, data management, transaction processing, Tivoli
systems management and Lotus Notes messaging and collaboration) had revenue
growth of 12 percent in 1999 and 9 percent in 1998. The company continues to
focus on helping customers use its software to transform their businesses into
e-businesses, particularly in collaboration with the company's Global Services
and channel partners.

The company's middleware products continued their momentum due to the company's
ability to integrate; the growing participation on non-IBM platforms and the
expanding market coverage as more partnerships were formed with Independent
Software Vendors, Web integrators and service providers; and a dedicated sales
force of 6,600 people.

Operating systems software revenue declined 4 percent in 1999 and increased 3
percent in 1998 when compared with previous periods. The decline in 1999 was
driven by lower revenue in AS/400. The 1998 increase was driven by higher AS/400
operating systems revenue versus 1997.

Software gross profit dollars increased 8.5 percent in 1999 from 1998, following
an increase of 14.6 percent in 1998 from 1997. Increased revenue and lower
levels of amortization costs associated with previously deferred software
development spending drove the improvement, partially offset by higher vendor
royalty payments due primarily to increased volumes.

Global Financing revenue increased 9.0 percent in 1999 from 1998, following an
increase of 2.5 percent in 1998 versus 1997. Growth in working capital
financing, along with continued growth in financing of software and services,
drove the revenue increase in 1999. Financing originations increased to
approximately $43 billion, with year-to-year growth in working capital
financing, along with software and services financing. The revenue increase in
1998 over 1997 was due to improved sales of used equipment and growth in
software and services financing, offset by a decline in working capital
financing.

Gross profit dollars increased 22.3 percent in 1999 versus 1998, following an
increase of 1.8 percent in 1998 over 1997. The increase in 1999 reflects Global
Financing's ongoing strategy to increase its use of the company's Global
Treasury Centers rather than external banks as a funding source and lower costs
of borrowing. The increase in gross profit dollars in 1998 versus 1997 was
primarily due to increased revenue and a higher gross profit margin in the U.S.
markets.

Enterprise Investments/Other revenue decreased 2.2 percent from 1998, following
a decrease of 5.5 percent in 1998 from 1997. The decrease was driven by lower
revenue from discontinued product lines, such as automated teller machines
(ATMs), partially offset by growth in point-of-sale terminals and computer-aided
three-dimensional interactive application (CATIA) software. The decrease in 1998
versus 1997 was primarily a result of lower software revenue, partially offset
by higher revenue from point-of-sale terminals.

The gross profit dollars from Enterprise Investments/Other increased 9.9 percent
in 1999 versus 1998, following a decrease of 12.1 percent in 1998 versus 1997.
The increase in 1999 gross profit dollars and gross profit margin was primarily
driven by an improving gross profit margin for point-of-sale terminals and
software. The decline in 1998 gross profit dollars and gross profit margin was
primarily driven by the lower software revenue versus 1997.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense declined 11.6 percent in 1999
versus 1998 and was essentially flat in 1998 with 1997. The decrease in 1999
reflects the net pre-tax benefit associated with the sale of the Global Network
and the actions taken by the company in 1999 to improve its competitiveness and
to strengthen further the company's overall business portfolio. (See note D,
"Acquisitions/Divestitures," on pages 72 and 73, and note R, "1999 Actions," on
pages 81 and 82 for further information.)

The company continues to manage aggressively its infrastructure expense and its
overall portfolio to allow for investment in growth areas of the business. Key
ongoing investments include software marketing, major marketing campaigns, and
new offerings for small and medium business opportunities, as well as the
e-business campaign. These types of expenditures are consistent with the
company's ongoing objective of growing revenue while improving the
expense-to-revenue ratio over time.

Research, development and engineering expense increased 4.5 percent in 1999 from
1998, following an increase of 3.5 percent in 1998 from 1997. The increase in
1999 reflects additional expenses associated with the acquisition of Sequent
Computer Systems, Inc., Mylex Corporation and DASCOM, Inc. Those acquisitions
are intended to improve the company's long-term

competitiveness in the server, storage and Web-security markets, respectively.
(See note D, "Acquisitions/Divestitures," on pages 72 and 73 for further detail
about the in-process research and development charge.) In addition, the
increases in both 1999 and 1998 reflect the company's continued investments in
high-growth opportunities like e-business, Tivoli systems management and Lotus
products, as well as the effect of ongoing research, development and engineering
expense associated with new acquisitions.

As a result of its ongoing research and development efforts, the company
received 2,756 patents in 1999, placing it number one in patents granted in the
U.S. for the seventh consecutive year. The application of these technological
advances transforms the company's research and development into new products.
Examples of these efforts range from new e-business solutions to innovative
manufacturing techniques. A patent for performing computer-based online commerce
using an intelligent agent will play a major role in future e-business. This
patent enables customers to use intelligent software agents to negotiate for
services from multiple providers. The intelligent agents take into account both
the availability of the requested service, such as airline seats, and the
providers' business policies, such as those on cancellations. The agents commit
to services with the most flexible policies first, giving the user the greatest
possible protection. With respect to manufacturing technologies, the
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip technology can reduce power consumption and
improve chip performance. A new patent in 1999 defines processing improvements
that increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of manufacturing SOI chips.
This technology will be crucial in the industry's development of a new class of
"pervasive computing" devices, handheld and embedded products such as smart
phones, and Internet appliances that business professionals and consumers will
rely on for easy access to e-business data and services.

See note Y, "Segment Information," on pages 89 through 93 for additional
information about the pre-tax income of each segment, as well as the
methodologies employed by the company to allocate shared expenses to the
segments.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.4 percent
for 1999, compared with the 1998 effective tax rate of 30.0 percent and a 1997
effective tax rate of 32.5 percent. The 4.4 point increase from the 1998 rate is
the result of the company's sale of its Global Network business to AT&T and
various other actions implemented during 1999. (See note D,
"Acquisitions/Divestitures," on pages 72 and 73 and note R, "1999 Actions," on
pages 81 and 82 for further detail regarding the tax impacts of these items.)
The reduction in the 1998 tax rate versus 1997 reflects the company's continued
expansion into markets with lower effective tax rates.

The company accounts for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which provides that a
valuation allowance should be recognized to reduce the deferred tax asset to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood
of realization, management considered estimates of future taxable income.

Fourth Quarter

For the quarter ended December 31, 1999, the company had revenue of $24.2
billion, a decrease of 3.8 percent from the same period in 1998. Net income in
the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion ($1.12 per diluted common share), compared
with net income of $2.3 billion ($1.24 per diluted common share) in the fourth
quarter of 1998.

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 1999 from the company's end-user businesses
totaled $10.4 billion from the Americas, a decrease of 3.7 percent (2 percent
decrease in constant currency) compared with the same period last year. Revenue
from Europe/Middle East/Africa was $7.2 billion, down 15.0 percent (6 percent
decrease in constant currency). Asia Pacific revenue grew 12.3 percent (2
percent increase in constant currency) to $4.4 billion. OEM revenue across all
geographies was $2.2 billion, a 12.5 percent increase (12 percent in constant
currency) compared with the fourth quarter of 1998.

                            and Subsidiary Companies

Hardware revenue declined 10.7 percent (10 percent in constant currency) to
$10.2 billion from the 1998 fourth quarter. Y2K-related declines in customer
demand were a significant factor behind fourth-quarter revenue decreases in
S/390, AS/400, RS/6000 and personal computers. However, within the company's
server family, Netfinity PC revenues increased significantly, as did revenues
from RS/6000 mid-range servers, including the advanced RS/6000 Model S80.
Microelectronics revenues increased substantially, principally due to growth in
custom logic shipments. Shipments of the company's new "Shark" disk storage
product were strong in the quarter, although overall storage revenues declined
largely as a result of ongoing price pressures in HDDs. The overall hardware
gross profit margin declined to 26.6 percent from 34.2 percent.

Global Services revenue grew 2.0 percent (4 percent in constant currency) versus
the fourth quarter of 1998. Strategic Outsourcing showed good growth versus the
fourth quarter of 1998. Networking Services declined year to year due to the
sale of the Global Network to AT&T during 1999, while revenue from the other
categories of services was flat or declined as a result of the Y2K-related
slowdown. The company's services unit signed more than $10 billion in services
contracts in the quarter. Revenue from maintenance offerings was essentially
flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 1998.

Software revenue totaled $3.6 billion, up 1.7 percent (6 percent in constant
currency) over the prior year's final quarter. Middleware--which is critical for
e-business--grew 8 percent (13 percent at constant currency), with record fourth
quarter shipments of Lotus Notes and Domino groupware products and strong
performance in database, transaction processing, and Tivoli system management
software. The software gross profit margin improved 1.1 points year over year to
83.4 percent.

Global Financing revenue increased 19.3 percent (22 percent in constant
currency) versus the same period of 1998, and Enterprise Investments/Other
declined 13.3 percent (10 percent in constant currency) compared with 1998's
fourth quarter. The revenue decline in Enterprise Investments/Other resulted
from the company's strategy to withdraw from certain businesses, such as ATMs.

The company's overall gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 36.7
percent, compared with 39.0 percent in the year-earlier period. The decrease was
primarily due to a drop in the hardware margin of 7.6 points from the fourth
quarter 1998 across S/390 and AS/400 servers, storage and personal computer
products. This decrease was partially offset by improved margins for services
and software in the fourth quarter of 1999 versus the same period in 1998.

Total fourth-quarter 1999 expense declined 9.3 percent when compared with the
fourth quarter of 1998. The decline reflects lower revenue-related expenses due
to the slowdown that is included in the fourth quarter results. The quarter also
reflected expenses associated with infrastructure reductions in areas such as
Sales and Distribution, Personal Systems and Server Group, which offset a gain
associated with the sale to Cisco Systems, Inc. of certain IBM intellectual
property. The expense-to-revenue ratio in the fourth quarter of 1999 was 24.4
percent, compared with 25.9 percent in the year-earlier period.

The company's tax rate was 30.0 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with
28.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998.

The company spent approximately $2.1 billion on common share repurchases in the
fourth quarter. The average number of shares outstanding in the fourth quarter
of 1999 was 1,793.0 million, compared with 1,839.5 million in the year-earlier
period. The average number of shares outstanding for purposes of calculating
diluted earnings per share was 1,847.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1999
versus 1,894.3 million in the fourth quarter of 1998.

Financial Condition

During 1999, the company continued to make significant investments to fund
future growth and increase shareholder value, spending $5,806 million for
research, development and engineering; $4,346 million for plant and other
property, including machines used in strategic outsourcing contracts; $1,613
million for machines on operating leases with customers; $1,542 million for
strategic acquisitions; and $7,280 million for the repurchase of the company's
common shares. The company had $5,831 million in cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities at December 31, 1999.

The company has access to global funding sources. During 1999, the company
issued debt in a variety of geographies to a diverse set of investors, including
significant funding in the United States, Japan and Europe. The funding has a
wide range of maturities from short-term commercial paper to long-term debt.

In December 1993, the company entered into a $10 billion committed global credit
facility to enhance the liquidity of funds. This facility was amended in
February 1997, and extended to February 2002. As of December 31, 1999, $8,562
million was unused and available.

The company managed assets of $273 million and $864 million at December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively, from the securitization of loans, leases and trade
receivables. For additional information, see note I, "Sale and Securitization of
Receivables," on page 74.

The major rating agencies have continued their review of the company's financial
condition. None of the agencies announced a change in rating in 1999. Standard
and Poor's rates the company and its rated subsidiaries' senior long-term debt
as A+, the commercial paper as A-1 and IBM's preferred stock as A.

Moody's Investors Service rates the senior long-term debt of the company and its
rated subsidiaries as A1, the commercial paper as Prime-1, and the company's
preferred stock as "a1."

Fitch Investors Service rates the company and its rated subsidiaries' senior
long-term debt as AA-, commercial paper as F-1+, and preferred stock as A+.

Duff & Phelps rates the company and its rated subsidiaries' senior long-term

Working Capital

(Dollars in millions)

At December 31:                                         1999                1998

Working capital                                      $ 3,577             $ 5,533

Current ratio                                         1.09:1              1.15:1
================================================================================

Current assets increased $795 million, driven primarily by increases of $837
million in accounts receivable, $227 million in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and $63 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities, offset by a decrease of $332 million in inventories. The increase in
accounts receivable is due to strong global financing activity in the software
and services businesses across all geographies. The increase in prepaid expenses
and other current assets is due to increases in deferred tax assets from
year-end 1998. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities resulted primarily from cash generated from operations and the net
proceeds from the sale of the company's Global Network, offset by stock
repurchases, capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions.

The company ended 1999 with inventories of $4,868 million, the lowest level
since 1983, due to continued focus on inventory management process improvements,
notably in Personal Systems. These improvements increased the company's
inventory turnover to 5.9 in 1999 from 5.3 in 1998.

Current liabilities increased $2,751 million from year-end 1998 with increases
of $1,667 million in taxes payable, $325 million in short-term debt and $759
million in other current liabilities. The increase in other current liabilities
resulted from increases in accounts payable ($148 million), compensation and
benefits ($310 million), and deferred income ($414 million), and a $113 million
decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities. The increase in taxes
payable primarily reflects improvements in the company's results associated with
the sale of the company's Global Network to AT&T. Short-term debt increased to
support the growth of global financing assets. The increase in other current
liabilities was primarily related to deferred income, mainly advanced billings
for software.

Investments

The company's investments for plant, rental machines and other property were
$5,959 million for 1999, a decrease of $561 million from 1998. The company
continues to invest significantly in its rapidly growing services business,
primarily in the management of customers' information technology, and in
manufacturing capacity for HDDs and microelectronics.

In addition to software development expenses included in research, development
and engineering, the company capitalized $464 million of software costs during
1999, an increase of $214 million from the 1998 period. The increase resulted
primarily from the adoption by the company as of January 1, 1999, of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP)
98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use." The SOP requires the capitalization of internal use computer
software if certain criteria are met. The company amortizes the capitalized
costs over two years. Amortization of capitalized software costs (both internal
use and licensed programs) was $426 million in 1999, a decline of $91 million
from 1998.

Investments and sundry assets were $26,087 million at the end of 1999, an
increase of $2,577 million from 1998, primarily the result of increases in
prepaid pension assets, customer loan receivables-not yet due, and alliance
investments, which include investments in high-growth-potential technology
companies. See note G, "Investments and Sundry Assets," on page 73 for
additional information.

Because a financing business has a different capital structure than a technology
business, the company's debt and key financial ratios are calculated on both a
global financing and non-global financing basis.

Total debt decreased $1,059 million from year-end 1998 as debt supporting the
growth of global financing assets decreased $955 million and non-global
financing debt decreased $104 million.

Stockholders' equity increased $1,078 million to $20,511 million at December 31,
1999, primarily due to the increase in retained earnings and accumulated gains
and losses not affecting retained earnings, partially offset by the company's
ongoing stock repurchase program. (See note N, "Stockholders' Equity Activity,"
on pages 78 and 79.)

The ratio of non-global financing earnings before interest and taxes plus
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to non-global financing interest expense,
adjusted for future gross minimum rental commitments, was 19x and 15x in 1999
and 1998, respectively. EBITDA is a useful indicator of the company's ability to
service its debt.

Currency Rate Fluctuations

Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect
the company's results. At December 31, 1999, currency changes resulted in assets
and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer
dollars than at year-end 1998. The currency rate changes had minimal effect on
1999 revenue growth, but had an unfavorable effect on 1998 and 1997 revenue
growth of approximately 2 percent and 5 percent, respectively.

In high-inflation environments, translation adjustments are reflected in period
income, as required by SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." Generally,
the company limits currency risk in these countries by linking prices and
contracts to U.S. dollars, financing operations locally and entering into
foreign currency hedge contracts.

The company uses a variety of financial hedging instruments to limit specific
currency risks related to global financing transactions and the repatriation of
dividends and royalties. Further discussion of currency and hedging appears in
note L, "Financial Instruments," on pages 75 through 77.

Market Risk

In the normal course of business, the financial position of the company
routinely is subject to a variety of risks. In addition to the market risk
associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and
non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, other examples of risk
include collectibility of accounts receivable and recoverability of residual
values on leased assets.

The company regularly assesses all of these risks and has established policies
and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other
potential exposures. As a result, the company does not anticipate any material
losses from these risks.

The company's debt in support of the global financing business and the
geographic breadth of the company's operations contain an element of market risk
from changes in interest and currency rates. The company manages this risk, in
part, through the use of a variety of financial instruments including
derivatives, as explained in note L, "Financial Instruments," on pages 75
through 77.

For purposes of specific risk analysis, the company uses sensitivity analysis to
determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of
the company's debt and other financial instruments.

The financial instruments that are included in the sensitivity analysis comprise
all of the company's cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, long-term
non-lease receivables, investments, long-term and short-term debt and all
derivative financial instruments. The company's portfolio of derivative
financial instruments includes interest rate swaps, interest rate options,
foreign currency swaps, forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts.

To perform sensitivity analysis, the company assesses the risk of loss in fair
values from the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments. The market values for
interest and foreign currency exchange risk are computed based on the present
value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in rates that are
attributable to the market risk that is being measured.

The company selected the discount rates that it used for the present value
computations based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in
effect at December 31, 1999 and 1998. The differences in this comparison are the
hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk.

Information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent
the actual changes in fair value that the company would incur under normal
market conditions because, due to practical limitations, all variables other
than the specific market risk factor are held constant. In addition, the results
of the model are constrained by the fact that certain items are specifically
excluded from the analysis, while the financial instruments that relate to the
financing or hedging of those items are included by definition. Excluded items
include leased assets, forecasted foreign currency cash flows, and the company's
net investment in foreign operations. As a consequence, the reported changes in
the values of some financial instruments that affect the results of the
sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values
of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge.

The results of the sensitivity analysis at December 31, 1999, and December 31,
1998, are as follows:

Interest Rate Risk: As of December 31, 1999, a 10 percent decrease in the levels
of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a
decrease in the fair value of the company's financial instruments of $164
million as compared with a decrease of $322 million as of December 31, 1998. A
10 percent increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables
held constant would result in an increase in the fair value of the company's
financial instruments of $145 million as compared with an increase of $282
million as of December 31, 1998. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair
value of the company's financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical
changes in the level of interest rates primarily are driven by changes in the
company's debt maturity and interest rate profile and amount. In 1999 versus
1998, the reported decline in interest rate sensitivity primarily is due to the
effect of increased activity in receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk: As of December 31, 1999, a 10 percent
decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against
the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a
decrease in the fair value of the company's financial instruments of $1,319
million or an increase in the fair value of the company's financial instruments
of $1,340 million, respectively, compared with a decrease of $597 million or an
increase of $855 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1998. The change in
the relative sensitivity of the fair market value of the company's financial
instrument portfolio to the level of foreign currency exchange rates primarily
is driven by an increase in the overall level of net foreign investment hedging
activity as well as by an increase in the use of foreign currency forwards in
lieu of foreign currency options to hedge the company's various foreign currency
exposures in accordance with the company's established risk management
practices. As the effect of offsetting changes in the fair market value of the
company's net foreign investments are not included in the sensitivity model, the
results of the analysis do not indicate an increase in the company's actual
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Financing Risks

Global financing is an integral part of the company's total worldwide offerings.
Inherent in global financing are certain risks, including credit, interest rate,
currency and residual value. The company manages credit risk through
comprehensive credit evaluations and pricing practices. To manage the risks
associated with an uncertain interest rate environment, the company pursues a
funding strategy of substantially matching the terms of its debt with the terms
of its assets. Currency risks are managed by denominating liabilities in the
same currency as the assets.

Residual value risk is managed by developing projections of future equipment
values at lease inception, reevaluating these projections periodically, and
effectively deploying remarketing capabilities to recover residual values and
potentially earn a profit. Remarketing efforts consistently have generated
profits. The following table depicts an approximation of the unguaranteed
residual value maturities for the company's sales-type leases, as well as a
projection of the remaining net book value of machines on operating leases at
the end of the lease terms as of December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999. The following
table excludes approximately $34 million of estimated residual value associated
with non-information technology equipment.

IBM employees, including wholly owned subsidiaries, increased by more than
16,000 in 1999. The growth areas of the company, Global Services and the
Software Group, continue to drive the increase; Global Services hired
approximately 17,000 in 1999. Acquisitions also contributed to the increase. The
company also continues to reduce its infrastructure and to withdraw from certain
businesses, thereby offsetting some of the growth. For example, during 1999, IBM
sold its Global Network to AT&T, resulting in the loss of about 5,300 employees.

The decrease in employees in the less than wholly owned subsidiaries over the
last year reflects a number of entities that were converted to a wholly owned
status, such as Global Services in India and MiCRUS in the U.S., or divested
during the year. Partially offsetting the decrease was continued growth in
Global Services, notably in Australia, and in a number of subsidiaries in China.

The company's complementary workforce is an approximation of equivalent
full-time employees hired under temporary, part-time and limited-term employment
arrangements to meet specific business needs in a flexible and cost-effective
manner.

Year 2000

The issues raised by the transition to the Year 2000 presented a pervasive and
unprecedented global challenge to IBM, its customers, partners, suppliers and
employees, as well as to governments, communities and individuals. The company
believes that the overall uneventful arrival of the Year 2000 is testimony to
the hard work and investment of organizations and individuals around the world.

With respect to the company's own operations, it prepared more than one million
critical items for the transition, including PCs and servers, application
software, and manufacturing tools and instruments. In addition, 2,500 suppliers,
750 business partners and 200 subsidiaries were assessed for risk mitigation
planning purposes. The company estimates that it will have spent approximately
$500 million over a multi-year period in these efforts, including conversion,
testing and contingency planning.

Over the past five years, the company undertook numerous initiatives to help
customers prepare for the Year 2000 including contacting customers around the
world to help promote awareness of Year 2000 issues; developing a range of
service offerings and tools to help customers assess, develop and execute plans
to make their systems Year 2000 ready; and making the company's own current
hardware and software offerings Year 2000 ready. To illustrate the extent of the
company's efforts, more than one million customers used the company's technical
support Year 2000 Web site; and the company's Global Services organization
processed more than one billion lines of customer code. Further, the company
found that a large number of its enterprise customers locked down their
information technology systems and postponed technology purchases heading into
the Year 2000 transition, which adversely affected the company's business
performance during the second half of 1999. See the Results of Operations and
Financial Condition sections within the Management Discussion for further
information.

In the near term, the company recognizes the need to maintain its vigilance in
the event Y2K issues do arise. Further, some commentators believe that a
significant amount of litigation will arise from Year 2000 issues. The company
continues to believe that it has good defenses to any such potential claims
brought against it.

The Year 2000 statements set forth above are designated as "Year 2000 Readiness
Disclosures" pursuant to the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act
(P.L. 105-271).

A Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International
Business Machines Corporation and its controlled subsidiary companies, which in
general are majority owned. Investments in business entities in which IBM does
not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over
operating and financial policies (generally 20-50 percent ownership), are
accounted for by the equity method. Other investments are accounted for by the
cost method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts that are reported in the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management's
best knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in
the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.

Revenue

The company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The
company reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances and
anticipated price actions. The following are the specific revenue recognition
policies for each major category of revenue.

HARDWARE

Revenue from hardware sales or sales-type leases is recognized when the product
is shipped. Revenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized monthly as
the fees accrue.

SERVICES

Revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized as the services
are provided. Revenue from fixed price long-term service contracts is recognized
over the contract term based on the percentage of services that are provided
during the period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over
the entire contract. Losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the
period in which the loss first becomes apparent. Revenue from maintenance is
recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed. Revenue
in excess of billings on service contracts is recorded as unbilled receivables
and is included in trade accounts receivable. Billings in excess of revenue that
is recognized on service contracts are recorded as deferred income until the
above revenue recognition criteria are met.

SOFTWARE

Revenue from one-time charge licensed software is recognized at the inception of
the license term, provided the company has vendor-specific objective evidence of
the fair value of each element of the software offering and the software has
been delivered. Revenue is deferred if vendor-specific objective evidence does
not exist for each contract element, or if there are uncertainties about the
timing of delivery of specific contract elements. The revenue that is deferred
for any contract element is recognized when all of the revenue recognition
criteria have been met for that element. Revenue from monthly software licenses
is recognized as license fees accrue.

FINANCING

Revenue from financing is recognized at level rates of return over the term of
the lease or receivable.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred
income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and
liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
that are recognized for income tax purposes. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
these deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws.

Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency
environment are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income
and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during
the year. Translation adjustments are recorded in Accumulated gains and losses
not affecting retained earnings within stockholders' equity.

Inventories and plant, rental machines and other non-monetary assets and
liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars,
or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, are translated at
approximate exchange rates prevailing when the company acquired the assets or
liabilities. All other assets and liabilities are translated at year-end
exchange rates. Cost of sales and depreciation are translated at historical
exchange rates. All other income and expense items are translated at the average
rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses that result from
translation are included in net income.

Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, the company uses a variety of derivative
financial instruments to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the company requires that the derivative
instruments that are used for risk management purposes effectively reduce the
risk exposure that they are designed to hedge. For instruments that are
associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction, hedge effectiveness
criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction will
occur. Instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as
hedges at the inception of the contract. When the terms of an underlying hedged
item or transaction are modified, or when the underlying hedged item ceases to
exist, all changes in the fair value of the risk management instrument are
recognized in income each period until the instrument matures. Those risk
management instruments that do not meet the hedging criteria are accounted for
at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized immediately in net
income. Refer to note L, "Financial Instruments," on pages 75 through 77 for
descriptions of the major classes of derivative financial instruments used by
the company, including the specific methods that the company uses to account for
them.

In determining the fair value of its derivative and non-derivative financial
instruments, the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are
based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. For
the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives, long-term
investments and long-term debt, standard market conventions and techniques such
as estimated discounted value of future cash flows, option pricing models,
replacement cost and termination cost are used to determine fair value. Quoted
market prices or dealer quotes for the same or similar instruments are used for
the remaining financial instruments.

Cash Equivalents

All highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of
purchase are carried at fair value and considered to be cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities included in current assets represent securities with a
maturity of less than one year. The company's policy is to invest in primarily
high-grade marketable securities. The company's marketable securities are
considered available for sale and are reported at fair value with changes in
unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded in Accumulated
gains and losses not affecting retained earnings within stockholders' equity.
Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific identification
method.

Inventories

Raw materials, work in process and finished goods are stated at the lower of
average cost or net realizable value.

Depreciation

Plant, rental machines (computer equipment that is used internally, subject to
an operating lease or as part of strategic outsourcing contracts) and other
property are carried at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives
using the straight-line method.

The estimated useful lives of depreciable properties generally are as follows:
buildings, 50 years; building equipment, 20 years; land improvements, 20 years;
plant, laboratory and office equipment, 2 to 15 years; and computer equipment,
1.5 to 5 years.

Software

Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed
programs are expensed as research and development. Also, for licensed programs,
the company capitalizes costs to produce the finished product that are incurred
after technological feasibility is established. The annual amortization of the
capitalized amounts is the greater of the amount computed based on the estimated
revenue distribution over the products' revenue-producing lives, or the
straight-line method, and is applied over periods ranging up to three years. The
company performs periodic reviews to ensure that unamortized program costs
remain recoverable from future revenue. The company charges costs to support or
service licensed programs against income as they are incurred.

The company capitalizes certain costs that are incurred to purchase or to create
and implement internal use computer software, which include software coding,
installation, testing and data conversion. Capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over two years.

Retirement Plans and Nonpension Postretirement Benefits

Current service costs of retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and life
insurance benefits are accrued in the period. Prior service costs that result
from amendments to the plans are amortized over the average remaining service
period of the employees expected to receive benefits. Unrecognized net gains and
losses that exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized to service
cost over the average remaining service life of employees expected to receive
benefits. See note W, "Retirement Plans," on pages 86 through 88 and note X,
"Nonpension Postretirement Benefits," on pages 88 and 89 for further discussion.

Goodwill

Goodwill is charged to net income on a straight-line basis over the periods
estimated to benefit, generally not to exceed five years. The company performs
reviews to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and takes into account events
or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate
that an impairment exists.

Common Stock

Common stock refers to the $.20 par value capital stock as designated in the
company's Certificate of Incorporation.

Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

Earnings per share of common stock--basic is computed by dividing Net income
applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Earnings per share of common stock--assuming
dilution reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock and would then share in the net income of the company. See note T,
"Earnings Per Share of Common Stock," on page 83 for further discussion.

B Accounting Changes

Standards Implemented

The company implemented new accounting standards in 1999, 1998 and 1997. None of
these standards had a material effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the company.

Effective January 1, 1999, the company adopted American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, "Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." The SOP
requires a company to capitalize certain costs that are incurred to purchase or
to create and implement internal use computer software. See note A, "Significant
Accounting Policies" on pages 69 through 71 for a description of the company's
policies for internal use software.

Effective December 31, 1998, the company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which establishes
standards for reporting operating segments and disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. See note Y, "Segment
Information," on pages 89 through 93 for the company's segment information.

Effective December 31, 1998, the company adopted SFAS No. 132, "Employers'
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," which establishes
standardized disclosures for defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit
plans. See note W, "Retirement Plans," on pages 86 through 88 and note X,
"Nonpension Postretirement Benefits," on pages 88 and 89 for the disclosures.

Effective January 1, 1998, the company adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting
Comprehensive Income," which establishes standards for reporting and displaying
in a full set of general-purpose financial statements the gains and losses not
affecting retained earnings. The disclosures required by SFAS No. 130 are
presented in the Accumulated gains and losses not affecting retained earnings
section in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity on pages 66 and 67
and in note N, "Stockholders' Equity Activity," on pages 78 and 79.

Effective January 1, 1998, the company adopted the AICPA SOP 97-2, "Software
Revenue Recognition." This SOP provides guidance on revenue recognition for
software transactions. See note A, "Significant Accounting Policies" on pages 69
through 71 for a description of the company's policy for software revenue
recognition.

Effective December 31, 1997, the company implemented SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per
Share" (EPS). This statement prescribes the methods for calculating basic and
diluted EPS and requires dual presentation of these amounts on the face of the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Effective January 1, 1997, the company implemented SFAS No. 125, "Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities."
This statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and
servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities.

New Standards to be Implemented

In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 137,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133." This statement defers the effective
date of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, although early
adoption is encouraged. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments. It requires a company to recognize all
derivatives as

either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to
measure those instruments at fair value. Additionally, the fair value
adjustments will affect either stockholders' equity or net income depending on
whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes
and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. The company will adopt this
standard as of January 1, 2001. Management does not expect the adoption to have
a material effect on the company's results of operations; however, the effect on
the company's financial position depends on the fair values of the company's
derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of adoption.

C Common Stock Split

On January 26, 1999, the company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
stock split effective May 10, 1999. On April 27, 1999, the stockholders of the
company approved amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the
number of authorized shares of common stock from 1,875 million to 4,687.5
million, which was required to effect that stock split. In addition, the
amendment reduced the par value of the common shares from $.50 to $.20 per
share. Common stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 1999,
received one additional share for each share held. All share and per share data
presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes of this Annual
Report reflect the two-for-one stock split.

D Acquisitions/Divestitures

Acquisitions

In 1999, the company completed 17 acquisitions at a cost of approximately $1.5
billion. Three of the major acquisitions for the year are detailed in the
following discussion.

On September 24, 1999, the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of Sequent Computer Systems, Inc. (Sequent) for approximately $828 million.
Sequent was an acknowledged leader in systems based on NUMA (non-uniform memory
access) architecture.

On September 29, 1999, the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Mylex Corporation (Mylex) for approximately $259 million. Mylex was a leading
developer of technology for moving, storing, protecting and managing data in
desktop and networked environments.

On September 27, 1999, the company acquired DASCOM, Inc. (DASCOM), an industry
leader in Web-based and enterprise-security technology, for approximately $115
million.

The company accounted for each acquisition as a purchase transaction. The
effects of these acquisitions on the company's Consolidated Financial Statements
were not material. Hence, the company has not provided pro forma financial
statements as if the companies had combined at the beginning of the current
period or the immediately preceding period.

The company engaged a nationally recognized independent appraisal firm to
express an opinion on the fair value of the net assets that the company acquired
to serve as a basis for the following allocation of the purchase price.

The tangible net assets comprise primarily cash, accounts receivable, land,
buildings and leasehold improvements. The identifiable intangible assets
comprise primarily patents, trademarks, customer lists, assembled workforce,
employee agreements and leasehold interests. The identifiable intangible assets
and goodwill will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period.

In connection with the acquisitions of Sequent, Mylex and DASCOM, the company
recorded a pre-tax charge for research, development and engineering of $111
million ($111 million after tax, or $.06 per diluted common share) for acquired
in-process research and development (IPR&D). At the date of each acquisition,
the IPR&D projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future uses. The value of the IPR&D reflects the relative value and
contribution of the acquired research and development to the company's existing
research or product lines.

In January 1998, the company acquired Software Artistry, Inc., a leading
provider of both consolidated service desk and customer relationship management
solutions for distributed enterprise environments. In March 1998, the company
acquired CommQuest Technologies, Inc., a company that designs and markets
advanced semiconductors for wireless communications applications such as
cellular phones and satellite communications. In connection with these
acquisitions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge for IPR&D of $111 million
($111 million after tax, or $.06 per diluted common share).

On April 16, 1997, the company purchased a majority interest in NetObjects, a
leading provider of Web site development tools for designers and intranet
developers. In 1999, as a result of NetObject's initial public offering, the
company's interest declined to less than 50 percent. In September 1997, the
company acquired the 30 percent equity interest held by Sears in Advantis, the
U.S. network services arm of the company's Global Network. Advantis was then
owned 100 percent by the company. Advantis became part of the company's Global
Network, which the company sold to AT&T in 1999. In December 1997, the company
acquired Eastman Kodak's share of Technology Service Solutions, which was formed
in 1994 by the company and Eastman Kodak. In December 1997, the company acquired
Unison Software, Inc., a leading developer of workload management software. In
connection with these acquisitions the company recorded a pre-tax charge for
IPR&D of $111 million ($111 million after tax, or $.05 per diluted common
share).

Divestitures

In December 1998, the company announced that it would sell its Global Network
business to AT&T. During 1999, the company completed the sale to AT&T for $4,991
million. More than 5,300 IBM employees joined AT&T as a result of these sales of
operations in 71 countries.

The company recognized a pre-tax gain of $4,057 million ($2,495 million after
tax, or $1.33 per diluted common share). The net gain reflects dispositions of
Plant, rental machines and other property of $410 million, other assets of $182
million and contractual obligations of $342 million.

*     These leases relate principally to IBM equipment and are generally for
      terms ranging from three to five years. Net investment in sales-type
      leases includes unguaranteed residual values of approximately $737 million
      and $685 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and is
      reflected net of unearned income at those dates of approximately $1,600
      million for both years. Scheduled maturities of minimum lease payments
      outstanding at December 31, 1999, expressed as a percentage of the total,

I Sale and Securitization of Receivables

The company manages assets of $273 million and $864 million from the
securitization of loans, leases and trade receivables, at year-end 1999 and
1998, respectively. The company received cash proceeds of $1,311 million and
$2,425 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively, from the sale and securitization
of these receivables and assets. No significant gain or loss resulted from these
transactions. The company expects recourse amounts associated with the
aforementioned sale and securitization activities to be minimal, and has
adequate reserves to cover potential losses.

K Interest on Debt

Interest paid and accrued on borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries was
$1,475 million in 1999, $1,585 million in 1998 and $1,596 million in 1997. Of
these amounts, the company capitalized $23 million in 1999, $28 million in 1998
and $32 million in 1997. Of the remainder, the company charged to the cost of
financing $725 million in 1999, $844 million in 1998 and $836 million in 1997,
and to interest expense $727 million in 1999, $713 million in 1998 and $728
million in 1997. The decrease in total interest in 1999 versus 1998 was due
primarily to lower average interest rates, partially offset by an increase in
average debt outstanding during 1999. The decrease in 1998 versus 1997 was due
primarily to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher
outstanding average debt. The average effective interest rate for total debt was
5.1 percent, 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
These rates include the results of currency and interest rate swaps applied to
the debt described in note J, "Debt," on page 74.

L Financial Instruments

The company maintains on- and off-balance sheet portfolios of financial
instruments.

Financial Instruments On-Balance Sheet (excluding derivatives)

Financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value include cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, notes and other accounts receivable
and other investments. Financial liabilities with carrying values that

The company enters into contracts that effectively provide the company with
committed future borrowings in select foreign currencies. The aggregate notional
value of these contracts was $6.4 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. The terms of these contracts generally are less
than eighteen months. Foreign exchange gains and losses associated with these
contracts are recorded in net income as they are realized. These amounts have
not been and are not expected to be material to the company's financial results.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The company uses derivative financial instruments as an element of its risk
management strategy. The company manages the risk of nonperformance by
counterparties by establishing explicit dollar and term limitations that
correspond to the credit rating of each carefully selected counterparty. The
company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it
anticipate any material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial
position in the future.

The following table summarizes the notional value, carrying value and fair value
of the company's derivative financial instruments on- and off-balance sheet. The
notional value at December 31 provides an indication of the extent of the
company's involvement in these instruments at that time, but does not represent
exposure to credit, interest rate or foreign exchange rate market risks.

</TABLE>

      Amounts in parentheses are liabilities.
*     The estimated fair value of derivatives both on- and off-balance sheet at
      December 31, 1999 and 1998, comprises assets of $616 million and $486
      million and liabilities of $1,053 million and $868 million, respectively.

A significant portion of the company's derivative transactions relates to
matching the interest and foreign currency rate profiles of funding liabilities
with the interest and foreign currency rate profiles of global financing and
other market risk sensitive assets. The company issues debt, using the most
efficient capital markets and products, which may result in a currency or
interest rate mismatch with the underlying assets. The company uses interest
rate swaps or currency swaps to match the interest rate and currency profiles of
its debt to the related assets. The terms of these swap contracts generally are
less than five years. Net interest settlements and currency rate differentials
that accrue under interest rate and currency swap contracts, respectively, are
recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts.

The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its
subsidiaries. These treasury centers principally use currency swaps to convert
cash flows in a cost-effective manner, predominantly for the company's European
subsidiaries. The terms of the swaps generally are less than one year. The
interest rate differential in these contracts is recognized in interest expense
over the life of the contracts.

The company also uses currency swaps and other foreign currency contracts to
hedge the foreign currency exposures of certain of the company's net investments
in foreign subsidiaries. The currency effects of these hedges are reflected in
the Accumulated gains and losses not affecting retained earnings section of
stockholders' equity thereby offsetting a portion of the translation of the net
foreign assets.

                   International Business Machines Corporation
                            and Subsidiary Companies

The company also uses derivatives to limit its exposure to loss resulting
primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on anticipated
cash transactions among foreign subsidiaries and with the parent company. The
company receives significant intracompany royalties and net payments for goods
and services from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. In anticipation of these foreign
currency flows, and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the
company selectively employs foreign currency derivatives to manage its currency
risk. The terms of these instruments generally are less than eighteen months.

For purchased options that hedge qualifying anticipated transactions, gains and
losses are deferred and recognized in net income in the same period that the
underlying transaction occurs, expires or otherwise is terminated. At December
31, 1999 and 1998, there were no material deferred gains or losses. The premiums
associated with entering into these option contracts generally are amortized
over the life of the options and are not material to the company's results.
Unamortized premiums are recorded in prepaid assets. Gains and losses on
purchased options that hedge anticipated transactions that do not qualify for
hedge accounting, and on written options, are recorded in earnings as they occur
and are not material to the company's results.

M Other Liabilities and Environmental Remediation

Other liabilities principally comprises accruals for nonpension postretirement
benefits for U.S. employees ($6,392 million) and nonpension postretirement
benefits, indemnity and retirement plan reserves for non-U.S. employees ($1,028
million). More detailed discussion of these liabilities appears in note X,
"Nonpension Postretirement Benefits," on pages 88 and 89, and note W,
"Retirement Plans," on pages 86 through 88.

Also included in other liabilities are non-current liabilities associated with
infrastructure reduction and restructuring actions taken through 1993. Other
liabilities includes $659 million for postemployment preretirement accruals and
$503 million (net of sublease receipts) for accruals for leased space that the
company vacated.

The company employs extensive internal environmental protection programs that
primarily are preventive in nature. The cost of these ongoing programs is
recorded as incurred.

The company continues to participate in environmental assessments and cleanups
at a number of locations, including operating facilities, previously owned
facilities and Superfund sites. The company accrues for all known environmental
liabilities when it becomes probable that the company will incur clean-up costs
and those costs can reasonably be estimated. In addition, estimated
environmental costs that are associated with post-closure activities (for
example, the removal and restoration of chemical storage facilities and
monitoring) are accrued when the decision is made to close a facility. The total
amounts accrued, which do not reflect actual or anticipated insurance
recoveries, were $240 million and $238 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

The amounts accrued do not cover sites that are in the preliminary stages of
investigation; that is, for which neither the company's percentage of
responsibility nor the extent of cleanup required has been identified. Estimated
environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position
or results of the company's operations in future periods. However, estimates of
future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and
changing environmental remediation regulations.

N Stockholders' Equity Activity

Stock Repurchases

From time to time, the Board of Directors authorizes the company to repurchase
IBM common stock. The company repurchased 71,618,800 common shares at a cost of
$7.3 billion and 114,768,200 common shares at a cost of $6.9 billion in 1999 and
1998, respectively. In 1999, the company did not retire the shares it
repurchased. The 1998 repurchases resulted in a reduction of $28,498,409 in the
stated capital (par value) associated with common stock. In 1998, the company
retired the repurchased shares and restored them to the status of authorized but
unissued shares. In 1999 and 1998, the company issued 906,829 and 774,564
shares, respectively, as a result of exercises of employee stock options. At
December 31, 1999, approximately $2.5 billion of Board authorization for
repurchases remained. The company plans to purchase shares on the open market
from time to time, depending on market conditions.

In 1995, the Board of Directors authorized the company to purchase all of its
outstanding Series A 7-1/2 percent preferred stock. The company did not
repurchase any shares in 1999. During 1998, the company repurchased 51,250
shares at a cost of $5.5 million. This resulted in a $512.50 ($.01 par value per
share) reduction in the stated capital associated with preferred stock as of
December 31, 1998. The company retired the repurchased shares and restored them
to the status of authorized but unissued shares. The company plans to purchase
the remaining outstanding shares on the open market and in private transactions
from time to time, depending on market conditions. There were 2,546,011 shares
outstanding at December 31, 1999 and 1998.

Employee Benefits Trust

Effective November 1, 1997, the company created an employee benefits trust to
which it contributed 20 million shares of treasury stock. The company is
authorized to instruct the trustee to sell shares from time to time and to use
proceeds from those sales, and any dividends paid on the contributed stock,
toward the partial satisfaction of the company's future obligations under
certain of its compensation and benefits plans. The shares held in trust are not
considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share until they
are committed to be released. The trustee will vote the shares in accordance
with its fiduciary duties. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the company had not
committed any shares to be released.

At December 31, 1998, the company adjusted its valuation of the employee
benefits trust to fair value. This adjustment affected only line items within
stockholders' equity; it did not affect total stockholders' equity or net
income.

The valuation allowance at December 31, 1999, principally applies to certain
state and local and foreign tax loss carryforwards that, in the opinion of
management, are more likely than not to expire before the company can use them.

A reconciliation of the company's effective tax rate to the statutory U.S.
federal tax rate is as follows:

For tax return purposes, the company has available tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $1,919 million, of which $1,244 million have an indefinite
carryforward period, $199 million expire in 2004 and the remainder thereafter.
The company also has state and local and foreign tax loss carryforwards, the tax
effect of which is $633 million. Most of these carryforwards are available for
10 years or have an indefinite carryforward period.

Undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries included in consolidated
retained earnings were $14,900 million at December 31, 1999, $13,165 million at
December 31, 1998, and $12,511 million at December 31, 1997. These earnings,
which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are indefinitely
reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted substantially free of
additional tax.

Q Selling and Advertising

Selling and advertising expense is charged against income as incurred.
Advertising expense, which includes media, agency and promotional expenses, was
$1,758 million, $1,681 million and $1,708 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

R 1999 Actions

Technology Group Actions

During 1999, the company implemented actions that were designed to better align
the operations and cost structure of IBM's Technology Group with that group's
strategic direction in view of the competitive environment, overcapacity in the
industry and resulting pricing pressures. The actions affect the
Microelectronics Division (MD), the Storage Systems Division (SSD) and the
Networking Hardware Division (NHD) of the company's Technology Group. The
company expects these actions to be substantially completed by the first half of
2000.

In total, the Technology Group actions resulted in a charge of $1,690 million
($1,366 million after tax, or $.73 per diluted common share) as described below
and in the table on page 82.

The actions within MD addressed a prolonged, industry-wide downturn in memory
chip prices that affected the results of the company's semiconductor business.
They are intended to enable the company to (1) reconfigure the assets and
capabilities of the division to allow more focus on the faster-growth,
higher-margin custom logic portion of the MD business and (2) enhance its
ability to more cost effectively manage a partnership agreement that was formed
to produce complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based logic
components.

The company will reduce its internal dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
capacity by converting its manufacturing facility in Essonnes, France, from DRAM
to custom logic over an 18-month period. The company is effecting that
conversion through a joint venture with Infineon Technologies, a subsidiary of
Siemens AG. Also related to DRAM, the company executed contracts with various
banks and other financing institutions to sell and lease back test equipment.

The company also participates in a 50/50 joint venture (Dominion Semiconductor
Company) with Toshiba Corporation to produce DRAM memory components. The company
entered into an agreement whereby Toshiba will assume the company's interest in
Dominion effective December 31, 2000. The company will participate in the
capacity output of Dominion at a significantly reduced rate in the interim
period.

The company held a majority interest in a joint venture (MiCRUS) with Cirrus
Logic Inc. (the partner) to produce CMOS-based logic components for IBM and its
partner based on contractual capacity agreements. The partner indicated that it
would not require the output capacity that is provided for in the partnership
agreement. The company determined that the most cost-effective manner in which
to address the partner's desire to exit the partnership agreement was to acquire
the minority interest held by that partner.

The company also announced aggressive steps intended to improve its competitive
position in the markets that SSD serves by merging server hard disk drive (HDD)
product lines and realigning operations. The company is integrating all server
HDDs into a single low-cost design platform that uses common development and
manufacturing processes. The company continues to transfer manufacturing
assembly and test operations to Hungary and Mexico and expects to complete these
actions by mid 2000.

The actions within NHD relate to a global alliance with Cisco Systems, Inc. As a
result of the announcement of the alliance, demand for the router and switch
products from both existing and new customers deteriorated.

      reductions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the
      first quarter of 2000.

(5)   Represents (a) the book value of assets that were idled as a result of the
      SSD actions and scrapped, (b) write-downs to fair value of equipment under
      contract for sale and delivery by December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2000,
      and (c) the difference between the net book value and the appraised fair
      value of equipment subject to sale-leaseback agreements.
(6)   Workforce reductions that affect approximately 900 employees (780 direct
      manufacturing and 120 indirect manufacturing) in the United States. There
      are 210 terminations remaining in the first half of 2000.
(7)   Write-down to net realizable value of inventory of router and switch
      products ($144 million) and contract cancellation fees ($34 million)
      related to deterioration in demand for router and switch products.

Change in Estimate

As a result of a change in estimate of the useful life of personal computers
(PCs) from five years to three years, the company recognized a charge in the
second quarter of 1999 of $404 million ($241 million after tax, $.13 per diluted
common share). In the second quarter, the company wrote off the net book value
of PCs that were 3 years or older and, therefore, had no remaining useful life.
The remaining book value of the assets will be depreciated over the remaining
new useful life. The net effect on future operations is expected to be minimal
as the increased depreciation due to the shorter life will be offset by the
lower depreciable base attributable to the write-off of PCs older than three
years.

S Research, Development and Engineering

Research, development and engineering expense was $5,273 million in 1999, $5,046
million in 1998 and $4,877 million in 1997. Expenses for product-related
engineering included in these amounts were $698 million, $580 million and $570
million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

The company had expenses of $4,575 million in 1999, $4,466 million in 1998 and
$4,307 million in 1997 for basic scientific research and the application of
scientific advances to the development of new and improved products and their
uses. Of these amounts, software-related expenses were $2,036 million, $2,086
million and $2,016 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Included in the
expense each year are charges for acquired in-process research and development.
See note D, "Acquisitions/Divestitures" on pages 72 and 73 for further
information about that expense.

Stock options to purchase 27,355,056 common shares in 1999, 4,124,730 shares in
1998 and 331,666 shares in 1997 were outstanding, but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the
options was greater than the average market price of the common shares and,
therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive. In addition, 5,131,038
restricted stock units in 1998 relating to the company's Long Term Performance
Plan were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as their
effect would have been antidilutive. Net income applicable to common
stockholders excludes preferred stock dividends of $20 million for 1999, 1998
and 1997.

U Rental Expense and Lease Commitments

Rental expense, including amounts charged to inventories and fixed assets and
excluding amounts previously reserved, was $1,397 million in 1999, $1,431
million in 1998 and $1,280 million in 1997. The table below depicts (a) gross
minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases, including amounts related
to vacant space associated with infrastructure reduction and restructuring
actions taken through 1993 (previously reserved), and (b) offsetting sublease
income commitments. These amounts generally reflect activities related to office
space and manufacturing equipment.

V Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations in
accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. A description of the terms of
the company's stock-based compensation plans follows:

Long-Term Performance Plan

Incentive awards are provided to officers and other key employees under the
terms of the IBM 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan, which was approved by
stockholders in April 1999, the IBM 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan, which was
approved by stockholders in April 1997, and its predecessor plan, the IBM 1994
Long-Term Performance Plan ("the Plans"). The Plans are administered by the
Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of
Directors. The committee determines the type and terms of the awards to be
granted, including vesting provisions.

Awards may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
cash or stock awards, or any combination thereof. The number of shares that may
be issued under the IBM 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan is 118.7 million, which
was 6.5 percent of the company's outstanding common stock on February 10, 1999.
No shares were issued under this Plan during 1999. There were 33.7 million and
68.8 million unused shares available to be granted under the IBM 1997 Long-Term
Performance Plan as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. As of December
31, 1999, there were no unused shares under the IBM 1994 Long-Term Performance
Plan. There were 4.1 million shares available to be granted under that Plan as
of December 31, 1998.

With the exception of stock options, these awards (which are expressed in terms
of shares) are adjusted to fair value at the end of each period and the change
in value is included in net income. Awards under the Plans resulted in
compensation expense of $267.3 million, $322.4 million and $214.1 million in
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

STOCK OPTION GRANTS

Stock options are granted to employees at an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the company's stock at the date of grant. Generally, options
vest 25 percent per year, are fully vested four years from the grant date and
have a term of 10 years. The following tables summarize option activity under
the Plans during 1999, 1998 and 1997:

IBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan

The IBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) enables substantially all regular
employees to purchase full or fractional shares of IBM common stock through
payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation. The price an
employee pays is 85 percent of the average market price on the last day of the
applicable pay period. The stockholders approved the current plan in 1995.
Approximately 57.3 million, 63.0 million and 71.0 million reserved unissued
shares were available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively.

During 1999, 1998 and 1997, employees purchased 5.7 million, 8.0 million and 9.4
million shares, respectively, all of which were treasury shares, and paid to IBM
$514 million, $415 million and $354 million, respectively, for these shares.

Pro Forma Disclosure

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, the company does not recognize expense
for stock options granted under the Plans or for employee stock purchases under
the ESPP. SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires a
company to determine the fair market value of all awards of stock-based
compensation using an option-pricing model and to disclose pro forma net income
and earnings per share as if the resulting stock-based compensation amounts were
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The table below presents
these pro forma disclosures.

U.S. Plan

U.S. regular, full-time and part-time employees are covered by a noncontributory
plan that is funded by company contributions to an irrevocable trust fund, which
is held for the sole benefit of participants.

Effective July 1, 1999, IBM converted to a new formula, the Personal Pension
Account (PPA), for determining pension benefits for most of its employees. Under
the PPA, retirement benefits are credited to each employee's cash balance
account monthly based on a percentage of the employee's pensionable
compensation. Employees who were retirement eligible or within five years of
retirement eligibility with at least one year of service, or who were at least
forty years of age with at least ten years of service as of June 30, 1999, could
elect to participate in the PPA or to have their service and earnings credit
accrue under the preexisting benefit formula. Benefits become vested on the
completion of five years of service under either formula.

The number of individuals who were receiving benefits at December 31, 1999 and
1998, was 124,175 and 116,685, respectively.

Non-U.S. Plans

Most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S. have retirement plans that cover
substantially all regular employees, under which the company deposits funds
under various fiduciary-type arrangements, purchases annuities under group
contracts or provides reserves. Retirement benefits are based on years of
service and the employee's compensation, generally during a fixed number of
years immediately before retirement. The ranges of assumptions that are used for
the non-U.S. plans reflect the different economic environments within various
countries.

U.S. Supplemental Executive Retention Plan

The company also has a non-qualified U.S. Supplemental Executive Retention Plan
(SERP). The SERP, which is unfunded, provides defined pension benefits outside
the IBM Retirement Plan to eligible executives based on average earnings, years
of service and age at retirement. Effective July 1, 1999, the company adopted
the Supplemental Executive Retention Plan (which replaces the previous
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan). Some participants of the pre-existing
SERP still will be eligible for benefits under that plan, but will not be
eligible for the new plan. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the projected benefit
obligation was $149 million and $178 million, respectively, and the amounts
included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position were pension
liabilities of $109 million and $81 million, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost is determined using the Projected Unit Credit
actuarial method.

The effects on the company's results of operations and financial position
from most changes in the estimates and assumptions used to compute pension
and prepaid pension assets or pension liability is mitigated by the delayed
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."
The effects of settlement gains, curtailment losses and early terminations
are recognized immediately. The 1.25 percent increase in the discount rate in
1999 resulted in an actuarial gain of $5,003 million for the U.S. plan. The
0.5 percent decrease in the discount rate in 1998 resulted in an actuarial
loss of $2,144 million for the U.S. plan.

It is the company's practice to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet the
minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local
tax laws. From time to time, the company contributes additional amounts as it
deems appropriate. Liabilities for amounts in excess of these funding levels are
accrued and reported in the company's Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position. The assets of the various plans include corporate equities, government
securities, corporate debt securities and real estate.

At December 31, 1999, the material non-U.S. defined benefit plans in which the
plan assets exceeded the benefit obligation had obligations of $21,168 million
and assets of $27,400 million. The material non-U.S. defined benefit plans in
which the benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets had
obligations of $602 million and assets of $443 million.

At December 31, 1998, the material non-U.S. defined benefit plans in which the
plan assets exceeded the benefit obligation had obligations of $18,217 million
and assets of $21,736 million. The material non-U.S. defined benefit plans in
which the benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets had
obligations of $3,831 million and assets of $3,558 million.

X Nonpension Postretirement Benefits

The company and its U.S. subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans
that provide medical, dental and life insurance for retirees and eligible
dependents. Effective July 1, 1999, IBM established a "Future Health Account
(FHA) Plan" for employees who are more than five years away from retirement
eligibility. Employees who are eligible to retire within five years retained the
benefits under the company's preexisting retiree health benefits plan. Under
either the FHA or the preexisting plan, there is a maximum cost to the company
for retiree health care. For employees who retired before January 1, 1992, that
maximum will become effective in the year 2001. For all other employees, the
maximum is effective on retirement.

The changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets of the U.S. plans for 1999
and 1998 are as follows:

The benefit obligation was determined by applying the terms of medical, dental
and life insurance plans, including the effects of established maximums on
covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions. These actuarial
assumptions include a projected healthcare cost trend rate of 6 percent.

The net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the U.S. plan for the years
ended December 31 included the following components:

The plan assets primarily comprise short-term fixed income investments.

Certain of the company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have similar plans for retirees.
However, most of the retirees outside the United States are covered by
government-sponsored and administered programs. The obligations and cost of
these programs are not significant to the company.

A one-percentage-point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would
have the following effects as of December 31, 1999:

Y Segment Information

IBM uses advanced information technology to provide customer solutions. The
company operates primarily in a single industry using several segments that
create value by offering a variety of solutions that include, either singularly
or in some combination, technologies, systems, products, services, software and
financing.

Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise three hardware product
segments--Technology, Personal Systems and Server; a Global Services segment; a
Software segment; a Global Financing segment and an Enterprise Investment
segment. The segments are determined based on several factors, including
customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and delivery channels.

The Technology segment produces peripheral equipment for use in general-purpose
computer systems, including storage and networking devices, advanced function
printers and display devices. In addition, the segment provides components such
as semiconductors and HDDs for use in the company's products and for sale to
original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Major business units include Storage
Systems, Microelectronics, Printer Systems and Networking Hardware.

The Personal Systems segment produces general-purpose computer systems,
including some system and consumer software, that operate applications for use
by one user at a time (personal computer clients) or as servers, and display
devices. Major brands include the Aptiva home PCs, IntelliStation workstations,
Netfinity servers, PC 300 commercial desktop and ThinkPad mobile systems. These
products are sold directly by the company and through reseller and retail
channels.

The Server segment produces powerful multi-purpose computer systems that operate
many open-network-based applications and are used simultaneously by multiple
users. They perform high-volume transaction processing and serve data to
personal systems and other end-user devices. The servers are the engines behind
the bulk of electronic business transactions, including e-commerce. Brands
include S/390, AS/400, RS/6000 and NUMA-Q. The segment's products are sold
directly by the company and through business partner relationships.

The Global Services segment is the world's largest and most versatile
information technology services provider, supporting computer hardware and
software products and providing professional services to help customers of all
sizes realize the full value of information technology. The segment provides
value through three primary lines of business: Strategic Outsourcing Services;
Business Innovation Services; and Integrated Technology Services. Strategic
Outsourcing Services create business value through long-term strategic
partnerships with customers by taking on responsibility for their processes and
systems. Business Innovation Services (formerly Systems Integration and
Consulting) provide business/industry consulting and end-to-end e-business
implementation of offerings like Supply Chain Management, Customer Relationship
Management, Enterprise Resource Planning and Business Intelligence.

                   International Business Machines Corporation
                            and Subsidiary Companies

Integrated Technology Services offer customers a single IT partner to manage
multi-vendor IT systems' complexity in today's e-business environment including
traditional offerings like Product Support, Business Recovery Services, Site and
Connectivity Services, and Systems Management and Networking Services. Learning
Services supports the three primary lines of business and help customers design,
develop and deploy curricula to educate their employees. The Global Services
segment is uniquely suited to integrate the full range of the company's and key
industry participants' capabilities, including hardware, software, services and
research.

The Software segment delivers operating systems for the company's servers and
e-business enabling software (middleware) for IBM and non-IBM platforms. The
company has reorganized its e-business offerings to align with key customer
opportunity areas--transformation and integration, leveraging information,
organizational effectiveness and managing technology. In addition to its own
development, product and marketing effort, the segment supports more than 35,000
Independent Software Vendors to ensure that the company's software and hardware
offerings are included in those partners' solutions.

The Global Financing segment is the world's largest provider of financing
services for information technology (IT). The segment provides lease and loan
financing that enables the company's customers to acquire complete IT and
e-business solutions--hardware, software and services--provided by the company
and its business partners. Special focus is placed on the financing needs of
small and medium businesses, and the emerging financing needs of NetGen
companies. Global Financing, as a reliable source of capital for the
distribution channel, also provides the company's business partners with
customized commercial financing for inventory, accounts receivable, term loans
and acquisitions, helping them manage their cash flow, invest in infrastructure
and grow their business.

The Enterprise Investments segment provides industry specific information
technology solutions, supporting the hardware, software and services segments of
the company. The segment develops unique products designed to meet specific
marketplace requirements and to complement the company's overall portfolio of
products.

Segment revenue and pre-tax income include transactions between the segments
that are intended to reflect an arm's-length transfer at the best price
available for comparable external customers. Specifically, semiconductors and
disk drives are sourced internally from the Technology segment for use in the
manufacture of the Server segment and Personal Systems segment products.
Technology, hardware and software that are used by the Global Services segment
in outsourcing engagements are sourced internally from the Technology, Server,
Personal Systems and Software segments. For the internal use of information
technology services, the Global Services segment recovers cost as well as a
reasonable fee reflecting the arm's-length value of providing the services. The
Global Services segment enters into arm's-length leases at prices equivalent to
market rates with the Global Financing segment to facilitate the acquisition of
equipment used in outsourcing engagements. All internal transaction prices are
reviewed and reset annually if appropriate.

The company extensively uses shared-staff concepts to realize economies of scale
and efficient use of resources. Thus, a significant amount of expense is shared
by all of the company's segments. This expense represents sales coverage,
marketing and support functions such as Accounting, Treasury, Procurement,
Legal, Human Resources, and Billing and Collections. Where practical, shared
expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense; e.g., Human
Resources costs are allocated on headcount while account coverage expenses are
allocated on a revenue mix that reflects the company's sales commission plan.
When a clear and measurable driver cannot be identified, shared expenses are
allocated on a financial basis that is consistent with the company's management
system; e.g., image advertising is allocated based on the gross profit of the
segments. The unallocated corporate expenses arising from certain acquisitions,
indirect infrastructure reductions, certain intellectual property income and
currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in net income but are not
allocated to the segments.

The following tables reflect the results of the segments consistent with the
company's management system. These results are not necessarily a depiction that
is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; e.g., employee
retirement plan costs are developed using actuarial assumptions on a
country-by-country basis and allocated to the segments on headcount. A different
result could be arrived at for any segment using actuarial assumptions that are
unique to the segment. Performance measurement is based on income before income
taxes (pre-tax income). These results are used, in part, by management, both in
evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the
segments.

Segment Assets and Other Items

The assets of the hardware segments primarily are inventory and plant, property
and equipment. The software segment assets mainly are plant, property and
equipment, and investment in deferred software development. The Global Services
segment assets primarily are maintenance inventory and plant, property and
equipment associated with its strategic outsourcing business.

To accomplish the efficient use of the company's space and equipment, it usually
is necessary for several segments to share plant, property and equipment assets.
Where assets are shared, landlord ownership of the assets is assigned to one
segment and is not allocated to each user segment. This is consistent with the
company's management system and is reflected accordingly in the schedule below.
In those cases, there will not be a precise correlation between segment pre-tax
income and segment assets.

Similarly, the depreciation amounts reported by each segment are based on the
assigned landlord ownership and may not be consistent with the amounts that are
included in the segments' pre-tax income. The amounts that are included in
pre-tax income reflect occupancy charges from the landlord segment and are not
specifically identified by the management reporting system.

Capital expenditures that are reported by each segment also are in line with the
landlord ownership basis of asset assignment.

The Global Financing segment amounts below for interest income and interest
expense reflect the interest income and interest expense associated with the
financing business as well as the investment in cash and marketable securities.
The remaining amounts of interest income and interest expense are not discretely
identified to the other segments, but are included as part of an indirect
expense allocation.
