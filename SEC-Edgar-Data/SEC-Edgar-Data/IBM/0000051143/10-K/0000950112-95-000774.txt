                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
 
    IBM has two fundamental missions. First, the company strives to lead in the
creation, development and manufacture of the industry's most advanced
information technologies, including computer systems, software, networking
systems, and microelectronics. Second, the company translates these advanced
technologies into value for our customers worldwide through its sales and
professional services units in North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa, Asia
Pacific, and Latin America.
 
    Management continues to believe its decision, in 1993 to remain an
integrated provider of information technology rather then becoming an emerging
federation of companies, was the correct one. This single interface to the
customer allows IBM employees to better understand and address the full range of
the customers' information needs and to provide them with comprehensive and
timely solutions.
 
    The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future
revenues due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume
of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product
delivery schedules. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is
not material to an understanding of its business.
 
    IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its products.
Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others.
IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any
particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.
 
    The following information is included in IBM's 1994 Annual Report to
Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:
 
       1. Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or
          services--Pages 74 and 75.
 
       2. Financial information by geographic areas--Pages 76 and 77.
 
       3. Amount spent during each of the last three years on research and
          development activities--Page 59.
 
       4. The number of persons employed by the registrant-- Page 47.
 
       5. The management discussion overview--Page 36.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES:
 
    At December 31, 1994, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the
United States had aggregate floor space of 55.2 million square feet, of which
43.4 million was owned and 11.8 million was leased. Of these amounts, 8.5
million square feet was vacant and 1.0 million square feet was being leased to
non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 21.0
million square feet, of which 18.0 million was owned and 3.0 million was leased.
Of these amounts, 2.0 million square feet was vacant and .7 million square feet
was being leased to non-IBM businesses.
 
    Although improved production techniques, productivity gains, and
restructuring actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space,
continuous upgrading of facilities is essential to
 
                                       1

maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON
                          FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE
 
To the Board of Directors of
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our report
dated January 20, 1995 (which refers to the changes in the methods of accounting
for postemployment benefits in 1993, and income taxes in 1992), appearing on
page 35 of the 1994 Annual Report to Stockholders of International Business
Machines Corporation, (which report and consolidated financial statements are
incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included an
audit of the Financial Statement Schedule listed in Item 14(a)2 of this Form
10-K. In our opinion, this Financial Statement Schedule presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements.

(A) Includes additions charged to costs and expenses less accounts written off
    and translation adjustments.
 
Note--
    The receivables upon which the above allowances are based are highly
diversified by geography, industry, and individual customer. With the growth of
the company's working capital financing business in 1994, the concentration of
such financings for certain large dealers and remarketers of information
industry products has become more significant. The allowances for receivable
losses for the year ended 1994, approximate less than three and one-quarter
percent of the company's current receivables and less than one and one-half
percent of the company's non-current receivables. The allowances for the year
ended 1993, approximate less than three and one-half percent of the company's
current receivables and less than two percent of the company's non-current
receivables. The allowances for the year ended 1992, approximate less than three
percent of the company's current receivables and less than two percent of the
company's non-current receivables.

* In 1993, 1992, and 1991, incremental shares under stock plans and the effect
  of the convertible debentures and bonds were not considered for the fully
  diluted earnings per share calculation due to their antidilutive effect. As
  such, the amounts reported for primary and fully diluted earnings per share
  are the same. The 7 7/8% convertible debentures were called and redeemed on
  November 21, 1992.

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS


 SECTION 1.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of the stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held at such place either within or outside the State
of New York as may from time to time be fixed by the Board or specified or
fixed in the notice of any such meeting.

  SECTION 2.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the stockholders of
the Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of
such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held
on the last Tuesday of April of each year, if not a legal holiday, or, if

designated herein, or if the directors to be elected at such annual meeting

[February 1, 1995]               -1-
<PAGE>
shall not have been elected thereat or at any adjournment thereof, the
Board shall forthwith call a special meeting of the stockholders for the
election of directors to be held as soon thereafter as convenient and give
notice thereof as provided in these By-laws in respect of the notice of an
annual meeting of the stockholders. At such special meeting the
stockholders may elect the directors and transact other business with the
same force and effect as at an annual meeting of the stockholders duly
called and held.

  SECTION 3.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the stockholders,
unless otherwise provided by law, may be called at any time by the Chairman
of the Board or by the Board.

  SECTION 4.  Notice of Meetings.  Notice of each meeting of the

of the Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board or the President
or a Vice President or the Secretary.  Such notice shall state the purpose
or purposes for which the meeting is called and the date and hour when and

entitled to have their stock appraised if such action were taken, not less

mailed to the address designated in such request. Nevertheless, notice of
any meeting of the stockholders shall not be required to be given to any
stockholder who shall waive notice thereof as hereinafter provided in
Article IX of these By-laws. Except when expressly required by law, notice
of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders need not be given nor shall
publication of notice of any annual or special meeting thereof be required.

  SECTION 5.  Quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by law, at all meetings
of the stockholders, the presence of holders of record of a majority of the
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation having voting power, in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereat, shall be
necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the
absence of a quorum at any such meeting or any adjournment or adjournments
thereof, a majority in voting interest of those present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereat, or, in the absence of
all the stockholders, any officer entitled to preside at, or to act as
secretary of, such meeting, may adjourn such meeting from time to time
without further notice, other than by announcement at the meeting at which
such adjournment shall be taken, until a quorum shall be present thereat.
At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present any business
may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally called.

the President, and all Vice Chairmen of the Board shall be absent
therefrom, an Executive Vice President, or if the Chairman of the Board,
the President, all Vice Chairmen of the Board and all Executive Vice
Presidents shall be absent therefrom, a Senior Vice President shall act as
chairman. The Secretary, or, if the Secretary shall be absent from such
meeting or unable to act, the person whom the Chairman of such meeting
shall appoint secretary of such meeting shall act as secretary of such
meeting and keep the minutes thereof.

  SECTION  7.   Items of Business.  The items of business at all meetings
of the stockholders shall be, insofar as applicable, as follows:

  -- Call to order.

  Any items of business not referred to in the foregoing may be taken up at
the meeting as the chairman of the meeting shall determine. The chairman of
the meeting shall determine all matters relating to the efficient conduct
of the meeting, including but not limited to the maintenance of order and
decorum.

  SECTION 8.  Voting.  Except as otherwise provided by law, each holder of
record of shares of stock of the Corporation having voting power shall be
entitled at each meeting of the stockholders to one vote for every share of
such stock standing in the stockholder's name on the record of stockholders
of the Corporation:

    (a) on the date fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 of
Article VII of these By-laws as the record date for the determination of
the stockholders who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting, or

[February 1, 1995]               -3-
<PAGE>
    (b) If such record date shall not have been so fixed, then at the close
of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of such
meeting shall have been given, or

    (c) if such record date shall not have been so fixed and if no notice
of such meeting shall have been given, then at the time of the call to
order of such meeting.

  Any vote on stock of the Corporation at any meeting of the stockholders
may be given by the stockholder of record entitled thereto in person or by
proxy appointed by an instrument in writing, subscribed by such stockholder
or by the stockholder's attorney thereunto duly authorized and delivered to
the secretary of such meeting at or prior to the time designated in the
order of business for turning in proxies. At all meetings of the
stockholders at which a quorum shall be present, all matters (except where
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
By-laws) shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting interest of
the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote thereat. Unless required by law, or determined by the chairman of the
meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by ballot. On
a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or
by the stockholder's proxy as such, if there be such proxy.

  SECTION 9.  List of Stockholders.  A list, certified by the Secretary, of
the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote shall be produced at
any meeting of the stockholders upon the request of any stockholder of the
Corporation pursuant to the provisions of applicable law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these By-laws.

  SECTION  10.   Inspectors of Election.   Prior to the holding of each
annual or special meeting of the stockholders, two inspectors of election
to serve thereat shall be appointed by the Board, or, if the Board shall
not have made such appointment, by the Chairman of the Board. If there
shall be a failure to appoint inspectors, or if, at any such meeting, any
inspector so appointed shall be absent or shall fail to act or the office
shall become vacant, the chairman of the meeting may, and at the request of
a stockholder present in person and entitled to vote at such meeting shall,
appoint such inspector or inspectors of election, as the case may be, to
act thereat. The inspectors of election so appointed to act at any meeting
of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties,
shall be sworn faithfully to execute the duties of inspectors at such
meeting, with strict impartiality and according to the best of their
ability, and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. Such inspectors
of election shall take charge of the polls, and, after the voting on any
question, shall make a certificate of the results of the vote taken. No
director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector
of an election of directors. Inspectors need not be stockholders.

  SECTION 1.  General Powers.  The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by the Board. The Board may exercise all such authority

of directors of the Corporation shall be fourteen, but the number thereof

than nine, by amendment of these By-laws. The directors shall be elected at
the annual meeting of the stockholders. At each meeting of the stockholders
for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the persons
receiving a plurality of the votes at such election shall be elected. Each

also as specified in Section 1, Section 5, and Section 6 of Article IV, in
Section 3 of Article V and in Article XII of these By-laws, the act of a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is

thereat. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. At any
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be

effect at the time specified therein, or if the time when it shall become

for which any director shall have been elected by the stockholders.




                                   ARTICLE IV

  SECTION 1.  Executive Committee.  The Board, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, may designate not less than four of the directors
then in office to constitute an Executive Committee, each member of which
unless otherwise determined by resolution adopted by a majority of the
whole Board, shall continue to be a member of such Committee until the
annual meeting of the stockholders which shall be held next after
designation as a member of such Committee or until the earlier termination
as a director. The Chief Executive Officer shall always be designated as a
member of the Executive Committee. The Board may by resolution appoint one
member as the Chairman of the Executive Committee who shall preside at all
meetings of such Committee. In the absence of said Chairman, the Chief
Executive Officer shall preside at all such meetings. In the absence of
both the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chairman of the Board shall preside at all such meetings. In
the absence of the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board, the President shall
preside at all such meetings. In the absence of all such persons, a
majority of the members of the Executive Committee present shall choose a
chairman to preside at such meetings. The Secretary, or if the Secretary
shall be absent from such meeting, any person appointed by the chairman,
shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep the minutes thereof.

  SECTION 2.  Powers of the Executive Committee.  To the extent permitted
by law, the Executive Committee may exercise all the powers of the Board in
the management of specified matters where such authority is delegated to it
by the Board, and also, to the extent permitted by law, the Executive
Committee shall have, and may exercise, all the powers of the Board in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation (including the
power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers
which may require it; but excluding the power to appoint a member of the
Executive Committee) in such manner as the Executive Committee shall deem
to be in the best interests of the Corporation and not inconsistent with
any prior specific action of the Board. An act of the Executive Committee
taken within the scope of its authority shall be an act of the Board. The
Executive Committee shall render in the form of minutes a report of its
several acts at each regular meeting of the Board and at any other time
when so directed by the Board.

  SECTION 3.  Meetings of the Executive Committee.  Regular meetings of the
Executive Committee shall be held at such times, on such dates and at such
places as shall be fixed by resolution adopted by a majority of the

[February 1, 1995]               -7-
<PAGE>
Executive Committee, of which regular meetings notice need not be given, or
as shall be fixed by the Chairman of the Executive Committee or in the
absence of the Chairman of the Executive Committee the Chief Executive
Officer and specified in the notice of such meeting. Special meetings of
the Executive Committee may be called by the Chairman of the Executive
Committee or by the Chief Executive Officer. Notice of each such special
meeting of the Executive Committee (and of each regular meeting for which
notice shall be required), stating the time and place thereof shall be
mailed, postage prepaid, to each member of the Executive Committee, by
first-class mail, at least four days before the day on which such meeting
is to be held, or shall be sent by facsimile transmission or comparable
medium, or be delivered personally or by telephone, at least twenty-four
hours before the time at which such meeting is to be held; but notice need
not be given to a member of the Executive Committee who shall waive notice
thereof as provided in Article IX of these By-laws, and any meeting of the
Executive Committee shall be a legal meeting without any notice thereof
having been given, if all the members of such Committee shall be present
thereat.

  SECTION 4.  Quorum and Manner of Acting of the Executive Committee.  Four
members of the Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the members of the
Executive Committee present at a meeting at which a quorum shall be present
shall be the act of the Executive Committee. Participating in a meeting by
means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment
allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other shall
constitute presence at a meeting of the Executive Committee. The members of
the Executive Committee shall act only as a committee and individual
members shall have no power as such.

  SECTION 5.  Other Committees.  The Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, designate members of the Board to constitute other
committees, which shall have, and may exercise, such powers as the Board
may by resolution delegate to them, and shall in each case consist of such
number of directors as the Board may determine; provided, however, that
each such committee shall have at least three directors as members thereof.
Such a committee may either be constituted for a specified term or may be
constituted as a standing committee which does not require annual or
periodic reconstitution. A majority of all the members of any such
committee may determine its action and its quorum requirements and may fix
the time and place of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise
provide. Participating in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or
similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the
meeting to hear each other shall constitute presence at a meeting of such
other committees.

  In addition to the foregoing, the Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, create a committee of indeterminate membership and
duration and not subject to the limitations as to the membership, quorum
and manner of meeting and acting prescribed in these By-laws, which
committee, in the event of a major disaster or catastrophe or national

[February 1, 1995]               -8-
<PAGE>
emergency which renders the Board incapable of action by reason of the
death, physical incapacity or inability to meet of some or all of its
members, shall have, and may exercise all the powers of the Board in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation (including,
without limitation, the power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it and the power to fill
vacancies in the Board). An act of such committee taken within the scope of
its authority shall be an act of the Board.

  SECTION 6.  Changes in Committees; Resignations; Removals; Vacancies.
The Board shall have power, by resolution adopted by a majority of the
Board, at any time to change or remove the members of, to fill vacancies
in, and to discharge any committee created pursuant to these By-laws,
either with or without cause. Any member of any such committee may resign
at any time by giving written notice to the Board or the Chairman of the
Board or the Secretary. Such resignation shall take effect upon receipt of
such notice or at any later time specified therein; and, unless otherwise
specified therein, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to
make it effective. Any vacancy in any committee, whether arising from
death, resignation, an increase in the number of committee members or any
other cause, shall be filled by the Board in the manner prescribed in these
By-laws for the original appointment of the members of such committee.

domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, for which any director or officer of the

was a director or officer of the Corporation, or served such other

[February 1, 1995]               -14-
<PAGE>
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise in any capacity, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in
settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees actually and
necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, or any
appeal therein. Such indemnification shall be a contract right and shall
include the right to be paid advances of any expenses incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, consistent with
the provisions of applicable law in effect at any time. Indemnification
shall be deemed to be 'permitted' within the meaning of the first sentence
hereof if it is not expressly prohibited by applicable law as in effect at
the time.


                                  ARTICLE VII

                                     SHARES

  SECTION 1.  Stock Certificates.  Each owner of stock of the Corporation
shall be entitled to have a certificate, in such form as shall be approved
by the Board, certifying the number of shares of stock of the Corporation
owned. The certificates representing shares of stock shall be signed in the
name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or a Vice Chairman of
the Board or the President or a Vice President and by the Secretary and
sealed with the seal of the Corporation (which seal may be a facsimile,
engraved or printed); provided, however, that where any such certificate is
signed by a registrar, other than the Corporation or its employee, the
signatures of the Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, the
President, the Secretary, and transfer agent or a transfer clerk acting on
behalf of the Corporation upon such certificates may be facsimiles,
engraved or printed. In case any officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk
acting on behalf of the Corporation ceases to be such officer, transfer
agent, or transfer clerk before such certificates shall be issued, they may
nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if they
were still such officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk at the date of
their issue.

  SECTION 2.  Books of Account and Record of Stockholders.  There shall be
kept at the office of the Corporation correct books of account of all its
business and transactions, minutes of the proceedings of stockholders,
Board, and Executive Committee, and a book to be known as the record of
stockholders, containing the names and addresses of all persons who are
stockholders, the number of shares of stock held, and the date when the
stockholder became the owner of record thereof.

  SECTION 3.  Transfers of Stock.  Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made on the record of stockholders of the Corporation
only upon authorization by the registered holder thereof, or by an attorney
thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the
Secretary or with a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and on surrender of
the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed or
accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power and the payment of all

[February 1, 1995]               -15-
<PAGE>
taxes thereon. The person in whose name shares of stock shall stand on the
record of stockholders of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof
for all purposes as regards the Corporation. Whenever any transfers of
shares shall be made for collateral security and not absolutely and written
notice thereof shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent or
transfer clerk, such fact shall be stated in the entry of the transfer.

  SECTION 4.  Regulations.  The Board may make such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-laws,
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for shares
of stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize any officer or
officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents or one or more transfer
clerks and one or more registrars and may require all certificates of stock
to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

  SECTION 5.  Fixing of Record Date.  The Board shall fix a time not
exceeding fifty nor less than ten days prior to the date then fixed for the
holding of any meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on
which the consent or dissent of the stockholders may be effectively
expressed for any purpose without a meeting, as the time as of which the
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or whose
consent or dissent is required or may be expressed for any purpose, as the
case may be, shall be determined, and all persons who were holders of
record of voting stock at such time, and no others, shall be entitled to
notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent, as the case may be. The Board may fix a time not exceeding fifty
days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making
of any distribution or the allotment of rights to subscribe for securities
of the Corporation, or for the delivery of evidences of rights or evidences
of interests arising out of any change, conversion or exchange of capital
stock or other securities, as the record date for the determination of the
stockholders entitled to receive any such dividend, distribution,
allotment, rights or interests, and in such case only the stockholders of
record at the time so fixed shall be entitled to receive such dividend,
distribution, allotment, rights or interests.

  SECTION 6.  Lost, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates.  The holder of any
certificate representing shares of stock of the Corporation shall
immediately notify the Corporation of any loss, destruction or mutilation
of such certificate, and the Corporation may issue a new certificate of
stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it which the
owner thereof shall allege to have been lost or destroyed or which shall
have been mutilated, and the Corporation may, in its discretion, require
such owner or the owner's legal representatives to give to the Corporation
a bond in such sum, limited or unlimited, and in such form and with such
surety or sureties as the Board in its absolute discretion shall determine,
to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it
on account of the alleged loss or destruction of any such certificate, or
the issuance of such new certificate. Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Corporation, in its absolute discretion, may refuse to

[February 1, 1995]               -16-
<PAGE>
issue any such new certificate, except pursuant to legal proceedings under
the laws of the State of New York.

  SECTION 7.  Inspection of Records.  The record of stockholders and
minutes of the proceedings of stockholders shall be available for
inspection, within the limits and subject to the conditions and
restrictions prescribed by applicable law.

  SECTION 8.  Auditors.  The Board shall employ an independent public or
certified public accountant or firm of such accountants who shall act as
auditors in making examinations of the consolidated financial statements of
the Corporation and its subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. The auditors shall certify that the annual financial
statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and shall report on such financial statements to the
stockholders and directors of the Corporation. The Board's selection of
auditors shall be presented for ratification by the stockholders at the
annual meeting. Directors and officers, when acting in good faith, may rely
upon financial statements of the Corporation represented to them to be
correct by the officer of the Corporation having charge of its books of
account, or stated in a written report by the auditors fairly to reflect
the financial condition of the Corporation.


                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                WAIVER OF NOTICE

  Whenever under the provisions of any law of the State of New York, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws or any resolution of the
Board or any committee thereof, the Corporation or the Board or any
committee thereof is authorized to take any action after notice to the
stockholders, directors or members of any such committee, or after the
lapse of a prescribed period of time, such action may be taken without
notice and without the lapse of any period of time, if, at any time before
or after such action shall be completed, such notice or lapse of time shall
be waived in writing by the person or persons entitled to said notice or

[February 1, 1995]               -17-
<PAGE>
entitled to participate in the action to be taken, or, in the case of a
stockholder, by an attorney thereunto authorized. Attendance at a meeting
requiring notice by any person or, in the case of a stockholder, by the
stockholder's attorney, agent or proxy, shall constitute a waiver of such
notice on the part of the person so attending, or by such stockholder, as
the case may be.


                                  ARTICLE X

  These By-laws may be amended or repealed or new By-laws may be adopted by
the stockholders at any annual or special meeting, if the notice thereof
mentions that amendment or repeal or the adoption of new By-laws is one of
the purposes of such meeting. These By-laws, subject to the laws of the
State of New York, may also be amended or repealed or new By-laws may be
adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board given at any
meeting, if the notice thereof mentions that amendment or repeal or the
adoption of new By-laws is one of the purposes of such meeting; provided,
however, that if any By-law regulating an impending election of directors
is adopted or amended or repealed by the Board, there shall be set forth in
the notice of the next meeting of the stockholders for the election of
directors the By-law so adopted or amended or repealed, together with a

            IBM's Executive Compensation Department is responsible for
            advising Participants and Beneficiaries of their Benefits under
            the Plan.  If a Participant or Beneficiary believes he or she
            is entitled to Benefits and has not received them, the
            Participant or Beneficiary must submit a written claim to the
            Director of Executive Compensation, IBM Corporation, Old
            Orchard Road, Armonk, New York l0504.  The Plan Administrator
            shall furnish to the Participant or Beneficiary a written
            decision setting forth the Plan Administrator's decision.

            If the Plan Administrator denies a claim for Benefits in whole
            or in part, the claimant may appeal the denial of the claim in
            writing within 60 days of receiving the Plan Administrator's
            written decision.

            A.   Foreign Service
                 _______________

                 All Foreign Service by a Regular Employee who is otherwise
                 eligible for Benefits under the Plan will be deemed for
                 all Plan purposes, in all respects as Continuous Service
                 with the Company, except that there shall be deducted from
                 the combined amount payable under the Plan and the IBM
                 Retirement Plan, any amount paid or payable to the
                 Participant or Beneficiary arising out of Foreign Service

                 to the extent that credit is given for such Foreign
                 Service under this ARTICLE 6A and pursuant to any pension,
                 retirement, severance indemnity, provident fund or other
                 similar plan--whether in the form of installments or lump
                 sum and whether private or sponsored by a foreign govern-
                 ment--to the extent not provided by direct contributions
                 made by the Participant,

                 (l)  provided that a Participant with such Foreign Service
                      immediately preceded by Continuous Service with the
                      Company must, before credit for such Foreign Service
                      is given, resume employment as a Regular Employee of
                      the Company; and

                 (2)  further provided that a Participant with such Foreign
                      Service not immediately preceded by Continuous
                      Service with the Company must, before credit for such
                      Foreign Service is given, complete one year of

                      Continuous Service as a Regular Employee of the
                      Company subsequent to such Foreign Service.


            B.   Service Credit for Leaves of Absence
                 ____________________________________

                 A Participant who commences a leave of absence granted
                 under IBM's human resources practices then in effect, and
                 who resumes the status of an Executive Level Regular
                 Employee upon completion of the leave, shall be deemed,
                 for all Plan purposes, as having been an actively employed
                 Participant throughout the leave and to have received
                 Compensation during the leave at the rate in effect
                 immediately before the leave began.  If the Participant
                 does not so resume his or her status as an Executive Level
                 Regular Employee for at least 30 days for any reason other
                 than disability or death, the Participant shall be treated
                 as having severed from service with the Company on the
                 date immediately preceding the date the leave began (i.e.,
                 the last day worked), and neither the Participant nor the
                 Participant's Beneficiary shall be eligible for a SERP
                 Benefit.

                 discretion, may grant Continuous Service credit to an
                 Executive in excess of actual Continuous Service subject
                 to such limitations and conditions as the officer

                 the best interests of the Company.



                ARTICLE 7 - Retirement Date and Commencement of Benefits
                ________________________________________________________


            A.   Normal Retirement Date
                 ______________________

                 A Participant's Normal Retirement Date is the last working
                 day of the month in which his or her 65th birthday occurs;
                 provided that the Participant has completed one year of
                 Continuous Service, and further provided that, if a
                 Participant was born on the first day of the month, the
                 Normal Retirement Date shall be the last day of the month
                 immediately preceding the 65th anniversary of birth.

            B.   Early Retirement Date
                 _____________________

                 A Participant described in any of the following paragraphs
                 may retire from employment on an Early Retirement Date

                                           -6-

<PAGE>

                      1.   A Participant with 30 years or more of
                           Continuous Service may retire on an Early
                           Retirement Date at the end of any month,

                      2.   A Participant with 15 or more years of

                           after reaching age 55,

                      3.   A Participant with five or more years of
                           Continuous Service who is eligible to receive
                           Social Security benefits at age 62 may retire on

                           at or after reaching age 62;

                 provided that in order to retire on an Early Retirement
                 Date a Participant must give the Company at least six
                 months prior written notice, in a form approved by the
                 Plan Administrator, of his or her intention to retire
                 early and to have SERP Benefits commence, unless the Plan
                 Administrator waives such notice requirement.

            C.  Commencement of SERP Benefits
                _____________________________

                 In addition to all other conditions, in no event shall
                 payment of SERP Benefits commence unless and until the
                 Participant applies for such Benefits before his or her
                 Annuity Commencement Date.  In no event shall any SERP
                 Benefit be paid under this Plan unless the Participant (1)
                 meets the Plan's eligibility conditions on the date of his
                 or her retirement, disability, or death, (2) retires (or
                 dies while eligible to retire) under the terms of the IBM
                 Retirement Plan, (3) holds an Executive Level position (as
                 determined by IBM's chief human resources officer in his

                 retirement or death, and (4) complies with the
                 requirements imposed by ARTICLE 11 hereof.


                               ARTICLE 8 - SERP Benefits
                               _________________________


            A.   Normal Retirement Benefit
                 _________________________

                 The Participant's SERP Benefit, when expressed as a single
                 life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month
                 next following the Participant's Normal Retirement Date,
                 shall be equal to one-twelfth of the Phase-In Percentage
                 (defined below) multiplied by the excess of (i) the
                 Pension Credit (defined below) over (ii) the total annual
                 single life annuity benefit at Normal Retirement Age,
                 including the single life annuity benefit attributable to

                                           -7-

<PAGE>

                 the Personal Retirement Provision whether such is paid in
                 annuity form or not, payable monthly to the Participant
                 under the IBM Retirement Plan or under any pension
                 arrangement between the Company and a Participant which is
                 payable monthly for life after termination of employment.

                 The Phase-In Percentage shall be determined on the date
                 the Participant retires, and shall not be increased
                 thereafter.  If the Participant retires on January 31,
                 1995, the Phase-In Percentage shall be 27%.  If the
                 Participant retires after January 31, 1995, the Phase-In
                 Percentage shall be 27% plus 2% for each succeeding month
                 (3% for the month of December) up to and including the
                 month of the Participant's retirement, until the Phase-In
                 Percentage reaches 100% for a Participant retiring on or
                 after December 31, 1997.  The Phase-In Percentage shall
                 in no event exceed 100%.

                 The Pension Credit shall be a single life annuity equal to
                 the sum of:

                 (1) 1.7% of Pay up to the Breakpoint, plus 2.55% of Pay in
                 excess of the Break Point (if any), multiplied by the
                 Participant's years of Continuous Service up to a maximum
                 of 20 years,

                 (2) 1.3% of Pay multiplied by the Participant's years of
                 Continuous Service between 20 and 30 years (if any), plus

                 (3) .75% of Pay multiplied by the Participant's Continuous
                 Service between 30 and 35 years (if any).


            B.   Early SERP Benefit
                 __________________

                 If the Participant elects to retire on an Early Retirement
                 Date with an Annuity Commencement Date on or after his or
                 her 60th birthday, the Participant's SERP Benefit when
                 paid in the form of a single life annuity, shall be equal
                 to the SERP Benefit calculated in accordance with Section
                 A of this ARTICLE 8 based on the Participant's years of
                 Continuous Service and Pay on the Participant's Early
                 Retirement Date.

                 If the Participant elects to retire on an Early
                 Retirement Date with an Annuity Commencement Date before
                 his or her 60th birthday, the Participant's SERP Benefit,
                 when paid in the form of a single life annuity, shall be
                 be the amount determined in accordance with the following
                 table:

                 Participant's       SERP Benefit under
                 Age at Annuity      ARTICLE 8A hereof,
                 Commencement Date   reduced
                 begins              by the following
                 ______              ________________

                 59                     3%
                 58                     7%

                 below 55               20% plus 5% per year for
                                        each year before the Participant's
                                        55th birthday

                 For each month of age falling between the ages or years
                 shown above, one-twelfth of the difference between the
                 respective factors should be added.

                 The reductions described in this Section 8B shall be
                 applied to the Pension Credit calculation under ARTICLE 8A
                 prior to the subtraction of any benefit payable under the
                 IBM Retirement Plan.  The Phase-In Percentage shall be
                 applied to the net SERP Benefit.


            C.   Form and Method of Payment
                 __________________________

                 The normal form of payment of the SERP Benefit for a
                 Participant who is unmarried on his or her Annuity
                 Commencement Date is a single life annuity for the
                 Participant's life.

                 The normal form of payment of the SERP Benefit for a
                 Participant who is married on his or her Annuity
                 Commencement Date is a joint and survivor annuity
                 providing an annuity to the Participant for life, in a
                 monthly amount that is less than that payable under a
                 single life annuity, and a survivor annuity for the life
                 of the Participant's Spouse in a monthly amount equal to
                 50 percent of the monthly amount payable to the married
                 Participant during his or her lifetime.  This form of
                 payment, which constitutes a 50% joint and survivor
                 annuity, shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the single
                 life annuity otherwise payable to the Participant, based
                 on the age of the Participant and the age of the
                 Participant's Spouse as of the Annuity Commencement Date.

                 A Participant also may elect to be paid under any
                 alternative form of payment available under the IBM
                 Retirement Plan except for the Early Retirement Level
                 Income Option.  Any such election must be made in the
                 manner and form prescribed by IBM's Executive Compensation

                                           -9-

<PAGE>

                 Department which may, in certain instances, require the
                 consent of the Participant's Spouse to the alternative
                 form of payment.  Each alternative form of payment shall
                 be the Actuarial Equivalent of the single life annuity
                 payable to the Participant in accordance with this ARTICLE
                 8.

                 Payment of the SERP Benefit shall be made monthly as of
                 the first day of the month beginning with the month
                 following the month in which the Participant retires from
                 employment with the Company.


            D.   Effective Date of Election
                 __________________________

                 Any election under this ARTICLE 8 shall be effective on
                 the later of the Participant's Annuity Commencement Date
                 or 30 days after IBM's Executive Compensation Department
                 receives the election.  The death of a survivor annuitant
                 before the Participant's Annuity Commencement Date
                 automatically revokes any such election.  The death of a
                 survivor annuitant on or after the Participant's Annuity
                 Commencement Date does not revoke the Participant's
                 election.

 
           E.   Revocation of Election
                 ______________________

                 A Participant may revoke an election he or she has made
                 under this ARTICLE 8 at any time before the Participant's
                 Annuity Commencement Date.  In order to be effective, any
                 such revocation must be received by IBM's Executive
                 Compensation Department before the Annuity Commencement
                 Date and must be made in the manner and form prescribed by
                 IBM's Executive Compensation Department.  A timely
                 revocation of an election shall only become effective upon
                 receipt by IBM's Executive Compensation Department.

                 If a Participant revokes an election of an alternative
                 form of payment, the Participant's form of payment shall
                 automatically revert to the normal form of payment
                 prescribed by this ARTICLE 8.  After revoking an election,
                 the Participant may elect an alternative form of payment
                 in accordance with this ARTICLE 8; however, in order to
                 become effective, the Participant's election of an
                 alternative form of payment (other than the normal form of
                 payment) must be received by IBM's Executive Compensation
                 Department before the Participant's Annuity Commencement
                 Date.  A timely election shall become effective as of the
                 later of the Participant's Annuity Commencement Date or 30
                 days after IBM's Executive Compensation Department
                 receives the election.

                 disabled (as determined in accordance with the terms of

                 remains so disabled until Normal Retirement Age, and (iii)
                 receives benefits under the IBM Long Term Disability Plan,
                 shall be eligible to receive a SERP Benefit upon reaching
                 Normal Retirement Age, notwithstanding his or her
                 ineligibility for that Benefit under other provisions of
                 the Plan.

                 The Annuity Commencement Date for such disabled
                 Participant shall be his or her Normal Retirement Date.
                 The disabled Participant's SERP benefit shall be based on
                 the Participant's Pay and Continuous Service on the date
                 the Participant's IBM Sickness and Accident Income Plan
                 benefits cease.

                      _________________________________________

            A preretirement spousal annuity shall be payable to the Spouse
            of a Participant who dies before his or her Annuity
            Commencement Date, but who, on the date of death, is both
            married and eligible to retire immediately hereunder.  The
            preretirement spousal annuity shall be the survivor annuity
            that the Participant's Spouse would have received under the
            Plan had the Participant retired on his or her date of death
            with a 50 percent joint and survivor annuity in effect in
            accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE 8 hereof.  In no
            event shall the preretirement spousal annuity be payable to
            anyone other than the Participant's Spouse on the date of the
            Participant's death.

                                  ____________________

            If a retired Participant is reemployed by the Company, any SERP
            Benefits otherwise payable to the Participant shall be
            suspended during the period of reemployment.  If the reemployed
            Participant subsequently completes one year of Continuous
            Service and retires from the Company, the Participant shall be
            eligible for SERP Benefits under the terms of the Plan in
            effect on the date the Participant's employment with the
            Company ceases, based on the Participant's Pay and Continuous
            Service as of that date, but reduced by the Actuarial
            Equivalent of any Benefits paid before the Participant's
            reemployment.  If the reemployed Participant again retires

            without having completed one year of Continuous Service during
            his or her period of reemployment, the SERP Benefits being paid
            to the Participant immediately before his or her reemployment
            shall resume, without adjustment, immediately following his or
            her retirement.

            A.   Competitive or Prejudicial Conduct
                 __________________________________

                 A Participant shall not render services for any
                 organization or engage directly or indirectly in any
                 business which, in the judgment of the chief executive
                 officer of the Company or other senior officer designated
                 by the Committee, is or becomes competitive with the
                 Company, or which organization or business, or the
                 rendering of services to such organization or business, is
                 or becomes otherwise prejudicial to or in conflict with
                 the interests of the Company.  For a Participant whose
                 employment has terminated, the judgment of the chief
                 executive officer shall be based on the Participant's
                 position and responsibilities while employed by the
                 Company, the Participant's post-employment
                 responsibilities and position with the other organization
                 or business, the extent of past, current and potential
                 completion or conflict between the Company and the other
                 organization or business, the effect on the Company's
                 customers, suppliers and competitors of the Participant
                 assuming the post-employment position, the guidelines
                 established in the then current edition of IBM's booklet,
                 Business Conduct Guidelines, and such other considerations
                 ___________________________

                 as are deemed relevant given the applicable facts and
                 circumstances.  A Participant who has retired shall be
                 free, however, to purchase as an investment or otherwise,
                 stock or other securities of such organization or business
                 so long as they are listed upon a recognized securities
                 exchange or traded over-the-counter, and such investment
                 does not represent a substantial investment to the
                 Participant or a greater than 10 percent equity interest
                 in the organization or business.


            B.   Disclosure of Confidential Information
                 ______________________________________

                 authorization from the Company, disclose to anyone outside
                 the Company, or use in other than the Company's business,
                 any confidential information or material, as defined in
                 the Company's Agreement Regarding Confidential Information
                 and Intellectual Property, related to the business of the
                 Company, acquired by the Participant either during or

                 after employment with the Company.


            C.   Disclosure and Assignment of Rights
                 ___________________________________

                 A Participant, pursuant to the Company's Agreement
                 Regarding Confidential Information and Intellectual
                 Property shall disclose promptly and assign to the Company
                 all right, title, and interest in any invention or idea,
                 patentable or not, made or conceived by the Participant
                 during employment by the Company, relating in any manner
                 to the actual or anticipated business, research, or 
                 development work of the Company and shall do anything 
                 reasonably necessary to enable the Company to secure a 
                 patent where appropriate in the United States and in other 
                 countries.


            D.   Forfeiture and Rescission
                 _________________________

                 Upon retirement, and from time to time thereafter upon
                 request by the Committee, the Participant shall certify on
                 a form acceptable to the Committee that he or she is in
                 compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.
                 Failure to comply with the provisions of Section A, B, or
                 C of this ARTICLE prior to retirement or receipt of any
                 Benefit payment hereunder shall cause the forfeiture of
                 all SERP Benefits even if the failure to comply is not
                 discovered until Benefits have commenced.  Failure to
                 comply with the provisions of Section A, B, and C of this
                 ARTICLE after SERP Benefits have commenced hereunder shall
                 cause any such payments to be rescinded from the point in
                 time when the conduct which led to the failure to comply
                 occurred.  The Plan Administrator shall notify the
                 Participant in writing of any such rescission, and within
                 ten days after receiving a notice of rescission from the
                 Company, the Participant shall pay to the Company in cash
                 the amount of any payment that has been rescinded in
                 accordance with this ARTICLE.


                 ARTICLE 12 - Information for Benefits Calculations
                 __________________________________________________


            A.   Incomplete or Incorrect Information
                 ___________________________________

                 Any delay in receiving from a Participant or Beneficiary
                 information requested by the Company's Executive
                 Compensation Department, including but not limited to
                 information regarding a Participant's Spouse or other
                 factors necessary for the calculation of Benefits under
                 the Plan, shall result in the Benefits payable being based
                 initially on the information then available to IBM's

                                           -13-

<PAGE>

                 Executive Compensation Department and the Plan
                 Administrator, and their estimate of any unavailable
                 information.  If additional or different information
                 thereafter becomes available to IBM's Executive
                 Compensation Department or the Plan Administrator,
                 Benefits shall be adjusted appropriately as determined by
                 the Plan Administrator.


            B.   Overpayments
                 ____________

                 If any overpayment of Benefits is made under the Plan, the
                 amount of the overpayment may be set off against further
                 amounts payable to or on account of the person who
                 received the overpayment until the overpayment has been
                 recovered in full.  The foregoing remedy is not intended
                 to be exclusive.


                           ARTICLE 13 - Alienation of Benefits
                           ___________________________________

            No Benefit payable under the Plan shall be subject to
            alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment,
            garnishment, lien, levy or like encumbrance.  No Benefit under
            the Plan shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the
            debts or liabilities of any person entitled to Benefits under
            the Plan.


                            ARTICLE 14 - Withholding Taxes
                            ______________________________

            The Company and the Plan Administrator shall withhold such
            taxes and make such reports to governmental authorities as they
            reasonably believe to be required by law.



                  ARTICLE 15 - Distributions to Minors and Incompetents
                  _____________________________________________________

            If the Plan Administrator determines that any Participant or
            Beneficiary receiving or entitled to receive Benefits under the
            Plan is incompetent to care for his or her affairs, and in the
            absence of the appointment of a legal guardian of the property
            of the incompetent, payments due under the Plan (unless prior
            claim thereto has been made by a duly qualified guardian,
            committee or other legal representative) may be made to the
            spouse, parent, brother or sister or other person, including a
            hospital or other institution, deemed by the Plan Administrator
            to have incurred or to be liable for expenses on behalf of such
            incompetent.

            In the absence of the appointment of a legal guardian of the
            property of a minor, any minor's share of Benefits under the

                                           -14-

<PAGE>

            Plan may be paid to such adult or adults as in the opinion of
            the Plan Administrator have assumed the custody and principal
            support of such minor.

            The Plan Administrator, however, in its sole discretion, may
            require that a legal guardian for the property of any such
            incompetent or minor be appointed before authorizing the
            payment of Benefits in such situations.  Benefit payments made
            under the Plan in accordance with determinations of the Plan
            Administrator pursuant to this ARTICLE 15 shall be a complete
            discharge of any obligation arising under the Plan with respect
            to such Benefit payments.

 
                     ARTICLE 16 - No Right to Employment
                      ___________________________________

            Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any employee
            the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to
            interfere with the right of the Company to discharge any
            employee at any time without regard to the effect that such
            discharge may have upon the employee under the Plan.


                          ARTICLE 17 - Unfunded Plan
                          __________________________

            The Plan shall be unfunded.  The Company shall not be required
            to segregate any assets to provide Benefits, nor shall the Plan
            be construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the
            Company or the Committee be deemed to be a trustee of any
            assets of the Plan.  Any liability of the Company to any
            Participant or Beneficiary with respect to SERP Benefits shall
            be based solely upon any contractual obligations created by the
            Plan.  No such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be
            secured by any pledge or other encumbrance or any property of
            the Company.  Neither the Company nor the Committee shall be
            required to give any security or bond for the performance of
            any obligation created by the Plan.


                          ARTICLE 18 - Miscellaneous
                          __________________________


            A.   Construction
                 ____________

                 wherever any words are used herein in the masculine
                 gender, they shall be construed as though they were also
                 used in the female gender, and vice versa, and wherever
                 any words are used herein in the singular form, they shall
                 be construed as though they were also used in the plural

            B.   Severability
                 ____________

                 If any provision of the Plan is held illegal or invalid
                 for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not
                 affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall
                 be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid
                 provision had never been inserted herein.


            C.   Titles and Headings Not to Control
                 __________________________________

                 Plan are placed herein for convenience of reference only,
                 and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan,
                 rather than such titles or headings, shall control.

                 __________________________

                 This document is a complete statement of the Plan.  The
                 Plan may be amended, modified or terminated only in

                 ______________________

                 The Company shall from time to time issue to Participants
                 one or more booklets or brochures summarizing the Plan.
                 In the event of any conflict between the Plan document and
                 the booklets and brochures, the Plan document shall

                              TAX DEFERRED SAVINGS PLAN
















     Effective January 1, 1995


















<PAGE>




                             INTRODUCTION

   The IBM Extended Tax Deferred Savings Plan has been authorized by the
   Board of Directors of International Business Machines to be applicable
   effective on and after January 1, 1995. The purpose of this Plan is to
   attract and retain executives by providing a means for making
   compensation deferrals and matching company contributions for those
   employees eligible to participate in the International Business Machines
   Tax Deferred Savings Plan with respect to whom compensation deferrals
   and company contributions under the TDSP are or would be limited by
   application of the limitations imposed on qualified plans by Sections
   401(a)(17), 401(a)(30), and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.

   This Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded deferred compensation
   plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees
   under Sections 201(2), 301(a)(2), 401(a)(1), and 4021(b)(6) of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. All
   benefits payable under the Plan shall be paid out of the general assets
   of the Company.

                             ARTICLE 2. PARTICIPATION

2.01 Eligibility

     Eligibility is limited To US executive level Eligible Employees of IBM and
     selected Domestic Subsidiaries whose rate of annual Compensation (defined
     as salary and annual incentive rat,e) is $1S0,000 or more for calendar year
     1995 (adjusted periodically thereafter based on industry trends and
     government guidelines). For this purpose, "selected Domestic Subsidiaries"
     and the "executive level" are defined by the chief human resources
     officer in his or her sole discretion and is subject to change. The
     Committee shall notify employees of their eligibility for participation in
     the Plan as soon as practicable after the chief human resources officer
     has made its determination that such employees qualify as Eligible
     Employees for a calendar year.

2.02 Participation

 (a) No later than one month before the first day of the calendar year during
     which an Eligible Employee desires to have contributions credited on his
     or her behalf pursuant to Section 3.01, an Eligible Employee must execute
     a Deferral Election Agreement authorizing Deferrals under this Plan for
     such year in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.0l.

 (b) If an Eligible Employee becomes an employee of the Company during a
     calendar year, he or she may execute a Deferral Election Agreement within
     30 days of his or her date of hire. The Deferral Election Agreement shall
     apply to Compensation earned by the Eligible Employee in the payroll
     periods beginning after such agreement is submitted to the Committee.

 (c) Each Deferral Election Agreement under the Plan shall be irrevocable for
     the calendar year to which it relates.

 (d) Irrespective of whether an employee has made the election described above,
     any employee who has been selected by the Committee to have Company
     Contributions credited on his or her behalf pursuant to Section 3.03 shall
     be a Participant.

 (e) As a condition to participation in the Plan, a Participant may also be
     required by the Committee to provide such other information as the
     Committee may deem necessary to properly administer the Plan.

                     ARTICLE 3. CONTRIBUTIONS

3.01 Amount of Deferral Contributions

     For each payroll period that an Eligible Employee has Compensation
     beginning on or after the effective date of an Eligible Employee's
     Deferral Election Agreement, his or her Deferral Account shall be credited
     with an amount of Deferrals. The amount of Deferrals shall be equal to
     the designated percentage of Compensation elected by the Participant in
     his or her Deferral Election Agreement. Under the Deferral Election
     Agreement, the Eligible Employee may elect to forego receipt of amounts
     equivalent to 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, or 12% of the
     Employee's Compensation for each pay period during which the election is
     in effect, and in the event an Eligible Employee is a DCP Participant for
     the calendar year, he or she may defer up to 100% of his or her annual
     incentive payment for the calendar year.

     Deferrals shall be made under this Section 3.01 shall commence for payroll
     periods for a calendar year at such time as the Participant may no longer
     actively participate in the TDSP for the calendar year (or would have been
     unable to actively participate in the TDSP if the Participant was an
     active participant in the TDSP for the calendar year) by reason of Code
     Section 401(a)(17) or Code Section 401(a)(30) and has Compensation. No
     Deferrals may be made hereunder prior to such time, except for the
     deferral of a DCP Participant's annual incentive payment.

3.02 Matching Contributions

     The amount of Company Matching Contributions credited to a Participant for
     each payroll period shall be equal to 50% of the Participant's Deferrals
     for the payroll period; provided however, that no Company Matching
     Contributions will be made for a Participant's Deferrals in excess of 6%
     of the Participant's Compensation for that payroll period. Company
     Matching Contributions will be made in units of IBM Stock with no right to
     transfer such units, except as otherwise provided in this Plan.

3.03 Additional Company Contributions

     IBM may cause the Committee to credit on behalf of any Participant or any
     Eligible Employee who is not yet a Participant for a particular calendar
     year an additional amount of Company Matching Contributions or other
     Company Contributions, which will be made only in units of IBM Stock with
     no right to transfer such units, except as otherwise provided in this
     Plan; provided however, that any employee who was not eligible for a given
     calendar year because his or her rate of Compensation was expected to be
     below the $150,000 threshold (as adjusted) will nonetheless be credited
     with Company Matching Contributions (but may not make Elective Deferrals)
     under the Plan without any further action by IBM or the Committee, based
     upon such employee's Elective Deferral rate under the TDSP at the end of




<PAGE>




                                                                        Page 6

     the calendar year, if the employee's actual Compensation for that calendar
     year exceeds $150,000 (as adjusted and only to the extent that the Company
     Matching Contributions would have been at least $300).

3.04 Investment of Accounts

     A Participant's Deferral Account shall be treated as if the Participant
     had invested it in certain TDSP investment Funds in accordance with
     Article 4. A Participant's Company Account shall be treated as if it had
     been invested in the IBM Stock Fund under the TDSP; provided however, that
     in the event a Participant retires from the Company and does not elect to
     have the entire amount of his or her Accounts then paid to him or her, any
     amounts credited to the Participant's Company Account after retirement
     will be treated as if they were transferred to the Participant's Deferral
     Account for purposes of this Section 3.04 and Article 4.

3.05 Vesting of Accounts

       A Participant always shall be fully vested in his or her Accounts.

3.06 Individual Accounts

     The Committee shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing
     the individual balances of each Participant's Accounts. Periodically,
     each Participant shall be furnished with a statement setting forth the
     value of his or her Accounts.

        ARTICLE 4. INVESTMENT OF DEFERRALS AND DEFERRAL ACCOUNTS


4.01 Deemed TDSP Investments; Participant Control

     A Participant shall designate the proportions in which his or her
     Deferrals shall be treated as if they had been allocated among certain
     Investment Funds under the TDSP. Those Investment Funds are:

     (a) The Fixed Income Fund

          This fund's objective is to preserve principal (the amount invested)
          and to provide a relatively stable rate of interest. Under TDSP,
          the fund invests in interest-bearing instruments, including
          contracts with highly rated insurance companies, banks, and other
          financial institutions.

     (b) The Large Company Index Fund

          This fund is for investors seeking long-term growth of capital by
          achieving a market rate of return from a diversified group of large-
          and medium-sized company common stocks in the United States. Under
          TDSP, the fund invests in a broad range of common stocks to produce
          investment results approximating the price and yield performance of
          Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

     (c) The Small Company Stock Fund

          Investors who would like to pursue long-term capital growth from a
          diversified group of small- and medium-sized company common stocks
          in the United States may want to consider this fund. Under TDSP,
          the fund seeks to produce results that substantially duplicate the
          price and yield performance of small- and medium-sized company
          stocks generally not represented in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

     (d) The International Stock Fund

          This fund is for aggressive investors seeking long-term capital
          appreciation and diversification through investments in stocks based
          outside of the United States. Under TDSP, the fund invests in
          equity market investments outside North America, based on the Morgan
          Stanley Capital International Europe, Australia, and Far East (EAFE)
          Index, with a modified country weighting that limits investments in
          securities of any one country to approximately 25% of the fund.

     (e) The IBM Stock Fund

          The IBM Stock Fund will appeal to aggressive investors looking for
          capital appreciation from a single stock investment. The objective
          of the fund is participation in IBM's future stock performance. IBM
          corporate officers who elect this investment are subject to such




<PAGE>




                                                                       Page 8

     restrictions which are necessary for compliance with securities laws.

     The Committee may, in its discretion (which discretion may be delegated to
     the Treasurer or other executive officer of IBM), from time to time make
     additional TDSP Investment Funds available as an investment measure under
     this Plan and may determine that any TDSP Investment Fund, including any
     of the Funds described above, may be terminated as an investment measure
     under this Plan.

     A Participant may elect to invest his or her Deferrals entirely in any one
     of the funds or may elect any combination in 5% multiples.

4.02 Change of Investment Selection on Future Deferrals

     A Participant may elect to change his or her investment selection for
     future Deferrals once per month. The Participant must make this election
     in the manner prescribed by the Committee.

4.03 Change of Investment Selection on Existing Deferral Accounts

     With regard to a Participant's existing Deferral Account balance, a
     Participant may elect to transfer balances among the Investment Funds once
     per month; provided however, that the portion of the Deferral Account of
     a Company officer that is allocated to the IBM Stock Fund may not be
     transferred to another Investment Fund while the officer remains in
     Company employment. Any permissible transfers, if among more than one
     Investment Fund, must be made in 5% multiples. The Participant must make
     this election in the manner prescribed by the Committee, and the Committee
     may impose such additional rules and limitations upon transfers between
     Investment Funds as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate.

                                                                       Page 9

                   ARTICLE 5. PAYMENT OF ACCOUNTS

5.01 Commencement of Deferral Payments

     A Participant shall be entitled to receive payment of his or her Accounts
     upon the Participant's (1) termination of employment from the Company for
     any reason other than retirement from the Company or (2) retirement from
     the Company with a balance of less than $25,000 in his or her Accounts.
     Any other Participant who is a DCP Participant and who has a termination
     of employment from the Company while a DCP Participant or any other
     Participant who retires from the Company shall be entitled to receive
     payment of his or her Accounts during the January following the calendar
     year during which the Participant had a termination of employment from the
     Company.

5.02 Method of Payment

     Payment of Accounts shall be made in a single lump sum payment.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant with a balance of at least
     $25,000 in his or her Accounts who either retires from the Company or is
     a DCP Participant for the calendar year in which he or she no longer works
     for the Company may elect to receive (1) a lump sum payment upon his or
     her termination of employment from the Company or (2) up to ten ratable
     annual installment payments of the balance in his or her Accounts
     commencing during the January following the calendar year during which the
     Participant had a termination of employment from the Company. For this
     election to be effective, at least one full calendar year must pass
     between the calendar year the Participant makes the election and the
     calendar year the Participant has a termination of employment from the
     Company. The Participant must make this election in the manner prescribed
     by the Committee.

     Upon application of a Participant, the Committee may authorize earlier
     payment to the Participant after termination of employment with the
     Company of an amount reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency need
     caused by an unforeseeable emergency that causes severe financial hardship
     to the Participant. If a Participant dies before payment of the entire
     balance of his or her Accounts, an amount equal to the unpaid portion
     thereof as of the date of his or her death shall be payable in one lump
     sum to his or her Beneficiary.

5.03 Designation of Beneficiary

     Each Participant's Beneficiary under this Plan shall automatically be the
     person or persons designated as the Participant's beneficiary under the
     TDSP even if such designation is found to be invalid under the provisions
     of ERISA or the Code. Such Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive the
     lump sum amount, if any, payable under the Plan upon the Participant's
     death pursuant to this Section 5.03 (except if that Participant was a DCP
     Participant and had made an election pursuant to Section 5.02); provided

                                                                       Page 10

however, that the beneficiary is alive at the time of the Participant's
death. If no such Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of the
Participant's death, or if no designated Beneficiary survives the
Participant, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be deemed to be the
Participant's beneficiary under IBM's Group Life Insurance Plan.

                   ARTICLE 6. GENERAL PROVISIONS


6.01 Funding

  (a)  All amounts payable in accordance with this Plan shall constitute a
       general unsecured obligation of the Company. Such amounts, as well as any
       administrative costs relating to the Plan, shall be paid out of the
       general assets of the Company, to the extent not paid by a grantor trust
       established pursuant to paragraph (b) below. In the sole discretion of
       the Committee, a Participant's Accounts may be reduced to reflect
       allocable administrative expense.

 (b)   IBM may, for administrative reasons, establish a grantor trust for the
       benefit of Participants participating in the Plan. The assets of said
       trust will be held separate and apart from other Company funds and shall
       be used exclusively for the purposes set forth in the Plan and the
       applicable trust agreement, subject to the following conditions:

       (i)   The creation of said trust shall not cause the Plan to be other 
             than "unfunded" for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement
             Income Security Act of 1974, as amended;

       (ii)  The Company shall be treated as "grantor" of said trust for 
             purposes of Section 677 of the Code; and

       (iii) Said trust agreement shall provide that its assets may be used to
             satisfy claims of the Company's general creditors in the event of
             its insolvency, and the rights of such general creditors are
             enforceable by them under federal and state law.

 (c)  Neither the Company nor the Committee guarantees the investment alterna-
      tives available under the Plan in any manner against loss or depreciation.

6.02 No Contract of Employment

      Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any employee the right to
      be retained in the service of the Company or an Affiliate or to interfere
      with the right of the Company or an Affiliate to discharge any employee at
      any time without regard to the effect that such discharge may have upon
      the employee under the Plan. Nothing appearing in or done pursuant to the
      Plan shall be held or construed to create a contract of employment with
      the Company, to obligate the Company to continue the services of any
      Employee, or to affect or modify any Employee's terms of employment in any
      way or to give any person any legal or equitable right or interest in the
      Plan or any part thereof or distribution therefrom or against the Company
      except as expressly provided herein.

6.03 Facility of Payment

     In the event the Plan Administrator determines that any Participant or
     Beneficiary receiving or entitled to receive benefits under the Plan is
     incompetent to care for his or her affairs and in the absence of the
     appointment of a legal guardian of the property of the incompetent,
     benefit payments due under the Plan (unless prior claim thereto has been
     made by a duly qualified guardian, committee, or other legal representa-
     tive) may be made to the spouse, parent, brother or sister, or other
     person, including a hospital or other institution, deemed by the Plan
     Administrator to have incurred or to be liable for expenses on behalf of
     such incompetent. In the absence of the appointment of a legal guardian

ARTICLE IV.     Deferral of Fees
                ----------------

         (a)    Eligibility and Election
                ------------------------

                Any Outside Director may elect to defer receipt of
                all or any portion of the other compensation for
                services ("Fees") to be earned by such Outside
                Director by indicating such election to the Secretary
                of IBM on an Election Form supplied by the Secretary
                ("Deferral Election"). The Outside Director's
                election must specify (i) the portion of the Fees to
                be deferred, (ii) the "Deferral Period" (a minimum of
                one "Election Term"), (iii) the choice of deferral in
                cash or a promise by IBM to deliver Shares ("Promised
                Fee Shares"), pursuant to ARTICLE VII hereof, and
                (iv) the time(s) of payment or delivery. Each
                Deferral Election is irrevocable with respect to the
                Fees payable for the Deferral Period to which it
                applies.
         
                "Deferral Period" shall mean, with respect to a
                Deferral Election, the period of Fee payments that
                are being deferred pursuant to such Deferral
                Election.
         
                "Election Term" shall mean the period beginning on
                the date an Outside Director is elected to the Board
                and ending on the date of the next succeeding Annual
                Meeting of IBM Stockholders.
         
     (b)        Credit for Amounts Deferred
                ---------------------------
         
                     (i) The Cash Account will be credited with the
                     amount of Fees accrued during a Deferral Period
                     and deferred as cash (such credit to be made
                     when such Fees become payable), plus interest at
                     an annual rate equal to the average of the first
                     26-week Treasury Bill issued in January and July
                     of each year, computed from the date such Fees
                     would have been paid had they not been deferred.
         
                     (ii) The Promised Fee Shares Account will be
                     credited with the number of Shares, including
                     fractions, which could have been purchased had
                     the amount of the Fees accrued during a Deferral




                                    -2-




<PAGE>




                     Period and deferred as Promised Fee Shares been
                     used to purchase Shares on the date such Fees
                     would have been paid had they not been deferred,
                     at a price equal to Fair Market Value on such
                     date.
                    
                     (iii) "Fair Market Value" shall be the average
                     of the high and low prices of Shares on the New
                     York Stock Exchange on the date in question,
                     provided that if no sales of Shares were made on
                     said Exchange on that date, the average of the
                     high and low prices reported for the preceding
                     day on which sales of Shares were made on said
                     Exchange.
                    
                     (iv) Promised Fee Shares do not have voting
                     rights.

        (c)     Advance Notice of Election
                --------------------------

                Any Deferral Election with respect to Fees to be
                earned during an Election Term shall be
                delivered to the Secretary of IBM:
               
                        (i) in the case of Fees deferred and
                    to be recorded in the Cash Account, on or
                    before the date 30 days prior to the first
                    date of such Election Term or, with respect
                    to a new Outside Director, before the first
                    date of such Election Term; or
               
                        (ii) in the case of Fees deferred and
                    to be recorded in the Promised Fee Shares
                    Account, on or before the date six months
                    prior to the first date of such Election
                    Term or, with respect to a new Outside
                    Director, before the first date of such
                    Election Term.

          (d)   Duration of Election
                --------------------

                A Deferral Election may be made annually for the
                succeeding Election Term or, at the Outside
                Director's direction, shall continue from
                Election Term to Election Term unless a written
                request to modify or terminate that election for
                subsequent Election Terms is submitted to the
                Secretary of IBM on or before the date six
                months prior to the first date of the first such
                subsequent Election Term, provided that such
                                          --------
                six-month period may be reduced to 30 days if




                                    -3-


<PAGE>




                neither the Deferral Election being modified or
                terminated nor the modified Deferral Election
                provides for a deferral of Fees as Promised Fee
                Shares during such first Election Term.
              
        (e)     Financial Hardship
                ------------------
              
                In the event that an Outside Director incurs a
                severe financial hardship, the Outside
                Director's deferral schedule with respect to his
                or her Cash Account or Promised Fee Shares
                Account shall be revised by the Board (or an
                authorized Committee of the Board) to the extent
                reasonably necessary to eliminate the severe
                financial hardship. Such severe financial
                hardship must be caused by an accident, illness,
                or event beyond the control of the Outside
                Director.
              
          (f)   Conversion of DCP Elections
                ---------------------------
              
                Ongoing elections under the DCP to defer Fees as
                share units and/or cash shall be continued and
                converted to elections to defer Fees into a
                Promised Fee Shares Account and/or a Cash
                Account, respectively, under the Plan, except to
                the extent the Outside Director elects prior to
                July 27, 1993 to change such an election to
                defer Fees into share units into an election to
                defer Fees into the Cash Account.
              
ARTICLE V.      Dividends, Distributions and Adjustments
                ----------------------------------------
              
                Whenever a cash dividend or any other
                distribution is paid with respect to Shares, the
                Promised Fee Shares Account and Promised Award
                Shares Account of each Outside Director shall be
                credited with an additional number of Promised
                Fee Shares or Promised Award Shares, as
                applicable, equal to the number of Shares,
                including fractional Shares, that could have
                been purchased had such dividend or other
                distribution been paid on each Promised Fee
                Share in the Promised Fee Shares Account and
                Promised Award Share in the Promised Award
                Shares Account (on the record date for such
                dividend or distribution) and the amount of such
                dividend or value of such other distribution
                been used to acquire additional Shares at the
                Fair Market Value on the date such dividend or




                                    -4-




<PAGE>




                other distribution is paid. The value of any
                such other distribution on or related to Shares
                shall, at the option of the Board (or an
                authorized Committee of the Board), be either
                determined by the Board or independently
                established.
               
                The number of Promised Award Shares and Promised
                Fee Shares shall be fully adjusted upon the
                occurrence of any stock split, stock dividend,
                combination or reclassification,
                recapitalization, merger or similar event, and
                shall be appropriately adjusted for the value
                (determined in the manner provided above with
                respect to distributions) of any right,
                privilege or opportunity provided or offered by
                IBM to holders of Shares.

ARTICLE VI.     Conversion of REAP and DCP Shares Account
                -----------------------------------------
                Balances
                --------

The amount in the account of an Outside Director as of July 27,
1993 under the DCP in units equivalent to a number of Shares
(including fractions of Shares) and payable in cash only
("units") shall be converted under the Plan as of July 27, 1993
to an amount in the same number of Shares (including fractions
of Shares) credited to the Outside Director's Promised Fee
Shares Account, unless the Outside Director elects prior to
July 27, 1993 to convert the units as of July 27, 1993 into
credits in the Cash Account.

The number of Shares in the escrow account of an Outside
Director as of July 27, 1993 under the REAP shall be converted
under the Plan as of July 27, 1993 to an equal number of
Promised Award Shares credited to the Outside Director's
Promised Award Shares Account.

An Outside Director's cash account balance under the DCP as of
July 27, 1993 will be converted to an equivalent balance under
the Outside Director's Cash Account under the Plan as of
July 27, 1993.


ARTICLE VII.    Delivery
                --------

Delivery of amounts from the Cash Account and Shares from the
Promised Award Shares Account and Promised Fee Shares Account
will be made to an Outside Director in accordance with his or
her applicable Deferral Elections or, if no election applies,
promptly after the date on which the Outside Director ceases to




                                    -5-




<PAGE>




be a member of the Board; provided, that when an Outside
                          --------
Director terminates service on account of any act of (i) fraud
or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) embezzlement,
misappropriation or conversion of assets or opportunities of
IBM or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of IBM,
Promised Award Shares credited to such Outside Director's
Promised Award Shares Account shall be forfeited.

In the event of an Outside Director's death, such Outside
Director's estate or beneficiary, as appropriate, shall be paid
the amount credited to his or her Cash Account and an amount
equal to the Fair Market Value on the date of death of the
Promised Award Shares and Promised Fee Shares credited to his
or her Promised Award Shares Account and Promised Fee Shares
Account.

Upon becoming entitled to receive Shares, an Outside Director
may elect to receive in lieu thereof a cash payment. In the
case of Shares to be delivered pursuant to a Deferral Election,
the cash payment shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the
Shares on the delivery date specified in the Deferral Election.
In the case of shares to be delivered promptly after the date
on which a Director ceases to be a member of the Board, the
cash payment shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the
Shares on the first day after such date. In any case when
Shares are to be delivered, a cash payment will be so made in
lieu of delivering a fractional Share.

ARTICLE VIII. Source of Shares
              ----------------

45,000 Shares as of July 27, 1993, plus an additional 20,000
Shares as of May 1, 1994, and as of each May 1 thereafter,
shall be reserved and authorized for delivery under the Plan
from time to time. These Shares may be provided from
newly-issued or repurchased Shares. If any change is made in
the number of Shares outstanding or in the rights of such
outstanding Shares (such as by stock split, stock dividend,
combination or reclassification, recapitalization, merger or
similar event), the Board (or an authorized Committee of the
Board) may make such adjustments in the number of or rights
relating to Shares authorized to be delivered pursuant to the
Plan as the Board (or such Committee) determines is equitable
to preserve the respective rights of the participants in the
Plan. Shares forfeited under the Plan or settled in cash in
lieu of delivery shall not reduce the number of Shares
authorized under the Plan and shall not be deemed to have been
delivered under the Plan; provided, that the number of Shares
                          --------
settled in cash in lieu of delivery shall not exceed the
cumulative number of Shares authorized for delivery under the
Plan (without deduction for Shares delivered).

 in any respect amend, the Plan for any reason; provided that
                                                --------
 the Plan may not be amended more than once every six months,

    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES



Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information
presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part,
of organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility
and delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures.
We believe this structure provides reasonable assurance that transactions are
executed in accordance with management authorization, and that they are
appropriately recorded, in order to permit preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to adequately
safeguard, verify, and maintain accountability of assets. An important element
of the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program.

To assure the effective administration of internal control, we carefully select
and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and
procedures, provide appropriate communication channels, and foster an
environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that
it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance
with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct
Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are
distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal
programs to assure that they are understood and followed.

Price Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants, is retained to examine IBM's
financial statements. Their accompanying report is based on an examination
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including a
review of the internal control structure and tests of accounting procedures and
records. 

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of outside
directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent
accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder
approval. The Audit Committee meets periodically and privately with the
independent accountants, with our internal auditors, as well as with IBM
management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure, and
financial reporting matters.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES


To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of International Business Machines
Corporation: 

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, appearing on
pages 48 through 78, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

As discussed in the note on accounting changes on pages 53 and 54, the company
changed its methods of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993 and income
taxes in 1992. We concur with these changes.

    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES


overview

IBM has made substantial progress during 1994 in stabilizing its operations,
rebuilding its balance sheet, improving its cost structure, and increasing
shareholder value. The actions taken during the past two years to "right-size"
the company have improved IBM's competitiveness in the rapidly changing market
for information technology products and services. As a result, the company
returned to profitability for the first time since 1990. 

Overall, the company's hardware offerings remain under price and competitive
pressure. Revenue growth was strong for RISC System/6000* products,
merchant-market semiconductors, and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) files,
while Application System/400* (AS/400) products showed moderate growth. Although
mainframe processor revenue declined, it was stronger than expected. In
addition, introduction of CMOS technology is progressing well and the broader
use of these products in parallel processing is expected to continue. Personal
computer revenue grew, but at a slower rate than certain competitors and the
industry as a whole. The company believes that the restructuring actions taken
this year will, in the long run, lead to improved performance in this area. It
is also anticipated that the pressures on price and margin will remain for all
hardware offerings. The company's services offerings continue to grow rapidly,
but remain at margins lower than the company's traditional hardware offerings.

While much progress has been made, IBM must continue its pace of change as it
focuses increasingly on revenue growth, improving the time to market with new
products, re-engineering its business processes, and reducing its cost and
expense structure.

Revenue as reported in the United States was $24.1 billion, a decrease of 6.2
percent compared to 1993. When adjusted for the Federal Systems Company (FSC)
sale, which is discussed on page 47, U.S. revenue grew 3.0 percent in 1994,
following a 4.3 percent increase in 1993 over 1992. Revenue from Europe was
$23.0 billion, an increase of 5.8 percent over 1993, following a 12.8 percent
decrease in 1993 from 1992. Asia-Pacific revenue grew 13.4 percent to $11.4
billion compared to 1993, following a 3.6 percent increase over 1992 levels.
Revenue from Canada was $2.5 billion, an increase of 15.8 percent over 1993,
following a 6.1 percent decrease

in 1993 versus 1992. Latin America revenue decreased .7 percent to $3.0 billion
in 1994, following a 3.7 percent increase in 1993 over 1992.

The overall gross profit margin has been relatively stable for the last two
years at approximately 39 percent. The gross profit margins continue to be
affected by hardware pricing pressures and the company's shift to services
revenue, which has lower gross profit margins than its hardware offerings.

The company reported net earnings of $3,021 million ($5.02 per common share), a
net loss of $8,101 million ($14.22 per common share), and a net loss of $4,965
million ($8.70 per common share) for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

When adjusted for the FSC sale ($248 million or $.43 per common share) and the
effect of increased amortization resulting from the change in software
amortization periods ($192 million or $.33 per common share), net earnings for
1994 were $2,965 million ($4.92 per common share). This compares to a full-year
1993 net loss of $96 million ($.25 per common share) excluding the FSC results
($105 million or $.18 per common share), the effects of a restructuring charge
of $7,996 million ($14.02 per common share), and the cumulative effect of $114
million ($.20 decrease in earnings per common share) as a result of the
company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." In 1992, the company had
net earnings of $1,328 million ($2.32 per common share) after excluding
the FSC results of $89 million ($.16 per common share), the effects of a
restructuring charge of $8,282 million ($14.51 per common share), and the
cumulative benefit to earnings of $1,900 million ($3.33 per common share) as a
result of the company's adoption of SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Worldwide revenue from hardware sales increased 5.7 percent from 1993, following
a decrease of 9.4 percent in 1993 from 1992. Worldwide gross profit dollars from
hardware sales increased 11.6 percent from 1993, following a decrease of 29.6
percent in 1993 from 1992. 

Revenue from processors decreased 2.8 percent from 1993, following a 27.6 
percent decrease in 1993 from 1992. These decreases were primarily due to 
declines in System/390* processor revenue, resulting from continuing 
competitive pricing pressures associated with these products. AS/400 product 
revenue grew in 1994 over 1993, as the new advanced series processors
showed strong growth. AS/400 product revenue declined in 1993 from 1992,
primarily in Europe, due to lower volumes.

Personal systems revenue grew 14.2 percent in 1994 over 1993, following a 27.6
percent increase in 1993 over 1992. The increases resulted from higher revenue
from personal computers and strong growth for the RISC System/6000 products.
The personal computer revenue continues to reflect severe price competition. 

Storage products revenue decreased 26.1 percent in 1994 from 1993, following a
decrease of 21.2 percent in 1993 from 1992. These declines were a result of
continuing price competition across most storage products.

OEM hardware revenue grew 151.2 percent in 1994 over 1993, following a 132.1
percent increase in 1993 over 1992. These increases are primarily attributable
to increased sales of merchant-market semiconductors and low-end storage files.

Information on revenue by classes of similar products or services is included on
pages 74 and 75. The product trends demonstrated in this discussion and in that
disclosure are indicative, in all material respects, of hardware sales activity.

The increase in hardware sales gross profit margin in 1994 was primarily driven
by cost improvements in System/390 processors, offset by lower personal computer
margins resulting from price pressures. Although the overall hardware margin
increased, it continued to be impacted by pricing pressures on high-end products
and personal computers. The decrease in 1993 gross profit margin from 1992
reflected pricing pressures on high-end products and personal computers. In
addition, personal computer revenue, which carries a lower gross profit margin,
was a proportionally larger part of hardware sales.

Software revenue increased 3.6 percent in 1994 from 1993, following a decline of
1.4 percent in 1993 from 1992. The increase in 1994 was primarily due to higher
one-time-charge revenue associated with RISC System/6000 computer placements.
The decline in 1993 was primarily a result of lower one-time-charge revenue
reflecting decreased AS/400 computer placements.

Software gross profit dollars increased .3 percent in 1994 from 1993, following
a decrease of 7.5 percent in 1993 from 1992. The 1994 software gross profit
dollars and margin were affected by a change in the company's software
amortization periods effective January 1, 1994. This change was a result of a
continuing review of the company's portfolio of software offerings, software
amortization periods, and recoverability of the capitalized investment in
software products. The change reduced amortization periods to a maximum of four
years to recognize more rapid advances in software technology and thus a shorter
period over which to recover capitalized costs. This change resulted in
increased amortization costs after tax of $192 million ($.33 per common
share). Excluding the effects of this change, gross profit dollars would have
increased 4.8 percent and the gross

profit margin would have been 61.4 percent in 1994. The decrease in gross profit
margin in 1993 from 1992 was partially a result of lower one-time-charge revenue
as previously discussed and a higher level of program product write-offs that
were recorded as a result of the continuing review of the company's portfolio of
software offerings. Write-offs in 1994, 1993, and 1992, excluding the effects of
changes in amortization lives, were $491 million, $327 million, and $62 million,
respectively.

Services revenue, excluding maintenance, on an as-reported basis, was flat when
compared to 1993. The 1994 results do not include operational results from FSC,
which were included in 1993 and 1992 results. When adjusted for the effects of
the FSC sale, services revenue continued to show strong overall growth,
increasing 27.0 percent in 1994 over 1993, following an increase of 38.3 percent
in 1993 over 1992. The increases were primarily driven by strong growth in
managed operations for both systems and networks, consulting, and systems
integration activity. 

Services gross profit dollars, excluding maintenance, increased 35.9 percent,
following an increase of 10.1 percent in 1993 over 1992. Adjusted for the FSC
sale, 1994 gross profit dollars increased 54.0 percent over 1993, and 7.3
percent in 1993 versus 1992. The 1993 gross profit dollars were impacted by cost
adjustments that were required on certain older contracts that were not expected
to be profitable. The services gross profit margins adjusted for the FSC
activity, excluding maintenance, were 20.0 percent, 16.5 percent, and 21.3
percent in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

Maintenance revenue decreased 1.0 percent from 1993, following a decrease of 4.4
percent in 1993 from 1992.  Gross profit dollars decreased 4.4 percent
year-over-year, following a decrease of 10.8 percent in 1993 from

affected by the competitive environment and resulting pricing pressures on
maintenance offerings. This trend is expected to continue.

profit dollars decreased 15.9 percent from 1993, following a decrease of 10.5
percent in 1993 from 1992. These decreases are a result of lower financing
volumes and reduced prices of IBM products being financed.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 12.9 percent from
1993, which followed a decrease of 6.4 percent in 1993 from 1992. The 1994
decrease includes the before-tax gain from the FSC sale. Without this gain, SG&A
decreased 10.9 percent. These decreases reflect the results of the company's
focus on productivity, restructuring programs, and expense controls.
Work-force-related SG&A decreased 6.9 percent from 1993, which followed a
decrease of 11.7 percent from 1992. The component of SG&A that is not work force
related decreased in 1994, primarily as a result of the gain from the FSC sale,
lower provisions for accounts receivable, and increased royalty/patent income
over 1993 levels. Late in 1994, the Mexican economy suffered severe disruptions,
which caused a rapid decline in the Mexican Peso. As a result, the company
incurred a $27 million exchange loss, which is recorded in SG&A.

Research, development and engineering expense decreased 21.5 percent in 1994,
following a decrease of 14.8 percent in 1993 from 1992. The reductions reflect
the company's focus on productivity and expense controls, which resulted in
elimination of redundant efforts and reprioritization of development
activities to areas such as microprocessors, RISC technology, networking,
personal computers, and desktop software.

restructuring charges

No restructuring charges were recorded in 1994. Restructuring charges were $8.9
billion in 1993 and $11.6 billion in 1992. These charges include expenses
associated with work force reductions, facility consolidations, capacity
reductions, and other related actions to streamline the company. These charges
are discussed further on pages 60 and 61.  

other income

Other income, principally interest, was $1.4 billion in 1994, an increase of
23.7 percent from 1993, which almost doubled when compared to 1992 levels. The
1994 increase reflects higher levels of available cash and higher interest rates
versus 1993. The 1993 increase over 1992 reflects higher levels of available
cash and higher interest rates in countries whose economic environment is highly
inflationary, notably Brazil. Although other income increased, exchange
losses from currency revaluations of cash largely offset the increase. Exchange
losses are reflected in SG&A expense.

In July 1994, the Brazilian government converted to a new currency, the Real.
The new currency is tied to the U.S. dollar as part of the government's economic
plan to reduce inflation and stabilize the economy. If the changes in Brazil are
successful, it is anticipated that the economic plan will have the effect of
lowering the company's interest income and interest expense, as well as the
exchange gains and losses associated with the local currency cash deposits and
borrowings. Other income and interest expense amounts decreased significantly
during the second half of 1994 compared with previous periods of 1994 and 1993
as a result of this change. Conversely, the Mexican Peso and economy continue
to experience disruption. While the company's operations in Mexico are not as
significant as its Brazilian operations, high-priority attention is being given
to strategies to minimize exchange impacts. 

provision for income taxes

The provision for income taxes resulted in a charge of $2,134 million in 1994, a
benefit of $810 million in 1993,  and a benefit of $2,161 million in 1992.
The 1994 provision was based on earnings before income taxes of $5,155 million,
resulting in an effective tax rate of 41 percent for 1994. The effective tax
rates of (9) percent in 1993 and (24) percent in 1992 were principally due to
limited tax benefits on restructuring charges, along with a high effective tax
rate on earnings in certain non-U.S. operations. Excluding the effects of
restructuring charges, the effective tax rates were 94 percent in 1993 and 46
percent in 1992. The high effective tax rate in 1993 resulted from earnings in
non-U.S. operations of $1.3 billion at an average tax rate of 50.2 percent,
offset by a loss before taxes in the United States of $1.1 billion at a
tax rate of 44.5 percent. 

The company accounts for income taxes under SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," which provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if realization
of such assets is more likely than not. In assessing the likelihood of
realization, management considered estimates of future taxable income. The total
amount of U.S. federal taxable income needed to realize U.S. federal deferred
tax assets, net of valuation allowances, is approximately

                         MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES


$14.0 billion as compared to approximately $15.0 billion in 1993. In estimating
the amount of U.S. taxable income that may be available to the company to
utilize as many deferred tax assets as possible, the last three years' U.S.
taxable income was considered. This was approximately $200 million (estimated
income) in 1994, $(1.2) billion loss for 1993, and $4.4 billion income for 1992.
In addition, consideration was given to the impact of the announced
restructuring actions on the company's future taxable income and tax planning
strategies related to research and development costs. 

changes in accounting principles 

The company implemented SFAS 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," effective January 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of adopting this
standard, which is discussed further on page 54, was a one-time charge of $114
million (net of approximately $61 million of income tax benefits). Most of this
charge was included in U.S. operations. 

Effective January 1, 1992, the company implemented SFAS 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was a one-time
benefit to net earnings of $1,900 million for recognition of previously
unrecognized tax benefits.

fourth quarter

For the quarter ended December 31, 1994, the company had net earnings of $1,230
million ($2.06 per common share) compared to net earnings of $382 million ($.62
per common share) in the fourth quarter of 1993. Revenue for the fourth quarter
of 1994 totaled $19.9 billion, an increase of 2.6 percent when compared to the
same period of 1993. Fourth quarter 1994 revenue increased 6.6 percent over 1993
levels when adjusted for the sale of FSC. 

On a geographic basis, revenue from Europe was $7.6 billion in the fourth
quarter, an increase of 7.8 percent over the same period of last year.
Asia-Pacific revenue grew 10.9 percent to $3.4 billion compared to the fourth
quarter of 1993. Revenue from Canada was $.8 billion, an increase of 19.4
percent over 1993's fourth quarter. U.S. fourth-quarter revenue was $7.0
billion, an increase of 4.6 percent over the same period of last year after
adjusting for the FSC sale. Revenue from Latin America declined 6.5 percent to
$1.1 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 1993.

Revenue gains resulting from currency rate fluctuation were largely offset by
increases in costs and expenses due to currency. Revenue on a constant currency
basis grew approximately 3 percent in the quarter.

Total hardware sales increased 2.5 percent to $10.6 billion in the fourth
quarter compared to the same period of 1993, while total software revenue
grew 6.9 percent to $3.3 billion. Services revenue increased 3.8 percent to $3.3
billion or 31.4 percent when adjusted for the sale of FSC compared to the fourth
quarter of 1993. Maintenance revenue increased 1.9 percent to $1.8 billion in
the quarter over the prior year, and rentals and financing revenue declined
12.5 percent to $862 million.

Within specific hardware product areas, AS/400 and RISC System/6000 revenue
continued to show strong growth. Mainframe and high-end storage products
revenue declined primarily as a result of year-over-year price reductions.
Personal computer revenue declined with particular weakness in the U.S.
Revenue from sales of OEM products continued to show strong growth, particularly
in the semiconductor area.

The company's overall gross profit margin, which has held steady for the last
two years, was 40.6 percent compared to 38.2 percent in the fourth quarter of
1993. Total expenses, including net interest expense, declined 10.9 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1994 compared to the same period of 1993.

financial condition

The company's financial condition improved significantly during 1994, with
increases in cash and stockholders' equity and decreases in outstanding
debt and total liabilities.

        Current ratio              1.41:1          1.18:1


Current assets increased $2.1 billion due to increases in cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities of $3.4 billion and accounts receivable
of $2.1 billion, offset by decreases of $1.2 billion in inventories and $2.2
billion in prepaid expenses. The increase in cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities is primarily attributable to cash generated from
operations and $1.5 billion in proceeds from the sale of FSC, offset by net cash
utilized to settle outstanding debt of $6.1 billion, and net cash outflow of
$2.8 billion due to the company's restructuring programs. The increase in
accounts receivable largely reflects strong year-end business volumes, and the
company's efforts to reduce the securitization and factoring of receivables. The
decline in inventories from year-end 1993 levels results from ongoing efforts to
better manage the company's inventories, particularly personal computer
inventories.  Lower prepaid expenses resulted from the disposition of FSC net
assets, which were being held for sale, as well as a decrease in current
deferred tax assets. 

Current liabilities decreased $3.9 billion from December 31, 1993, with declines
of $2.5 billion in short-term debt and $2.5 billion in other accrued expenses
and liabilities, offset by a net increase of $1.1 billion in other current
liabilities (increases in taxes, accounts payable, and compensation and
benefits, and a slight decrease in deferred income). The reduction in short-term
debt is driven by the company's efforts to reduce its overall  debt obligations,
while the decline in other accrued expenses and liabilities is due to lower
restructuring accrual balances from implementation of the company's
restructuring programs. 

investments

The company's capital expenditures for plant, rental machines and other property
were $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 1994, a decrease of $.1
billion from 1993. The net book value of plant, rental machines and other
property declined $.9 billion from 1993, primarily due to depreciation exceeding
current levels of capital additions.

In addition to software development expense included in research, development
and engineering expense, the company capitalized $1.4 billion of software costs
during 1994, versus the $1.5 billion  capitalized in 1993. Amortization of
capitalized software costs amounted to $2.1 billion for 1994, an increase of
$.1 billion from 1993. This amortization included $.3 billion in accelerated
amortization of capitalized software costs resulting from the software
amortization change implemented in the first quarter of 1994. This change is
discussed on pages 38 and 39.

Long-term debt declined $2.7 billion from December 31, 1993, due to the
company's continuing focus on reduction of its outstanding debt obligations;
long-term debt issued in support of the company's financing activities declined
$1.9 billion, while "core" long-term debt declined  $.8 billion in 1994.

Other non-current liabilities increased $2.8 billion from year-end 1993, due
primarily to the redesignation of restructuring reserves in addition to
increases in postretirement benefit reserves.

The company has accrued for environmental matters, including estimated costs of
cleanup of Superfund sites, operating facilities, and restoration and monitoring
costs related to the closure of facilities. The company also has environmental
programs in place which include investment in state-of-the-art facilities for
environmental protection as well as other programs to ensure compliance with
government regulations and the company's commitment to responsible environmental
practices. Environmental costs, including costs associated with complying with
existing environmental regulations, are not expected to materially affect the
company's financial position or results of operations in future periods. Further
discussion appears in note L on pages 61 and 62.

Stockholders' equity increased $3.7 billion from December 31, 1993, resulting
from increases of $2.4 billion in retained earnings, $1.0 billion in translation
adjustments, and $.3 billion in common stock transactions.

currency rate fluctuations

Approximately 90 percent of the company's non-U.S. business is conducted in
local currency environments. With the majority of worldwide currencies
strengthening versus the U.S. dollar in 1994, assets and liabilities denominated
in local currencies translate into more U.S. dollars. Changes in net worth
arising from these currency fluctuations are accumulated in the translation
adjustments component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 1994, the
cumulative translation adjustment was $2.7 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion
over 1993.

In high-inflation environments, such as parts of Latin America, translation
adjustments are reflected in period income, as required by SFAS 52, "Foreign
Currency Translation." Generally, the company minimizes currency risk in these
countries by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars and by financing
operations locally. 

The company has been, to a great degree, buffered from currency risk in its
business operations by manufacturing, developing and procuring a significant
portion of its product line in non-U.S. countries, so that costs reflect local
economic conditions. Also, financial hedging instruments are used to minimize
currency risks related to the company's customer financing transactions and
the repatriation of dividends and royalties. Currency rate variations did not
have a material effect on the company's operating results in 1994, 1993, or
1992. Revenue gains in 1994, resulting from currency rate fluctuations, were
largely offset by increases in costs and expenses due to currency movements.

liquidity 

In December 1993, the company entered into a $10.0 billion committed global
credit facility as part of the company's ongoing efforts to ensure appropriate
levels of liquidity. As of December 31, 1994, $9.4 billion was unused and still
available. Further discussion appears in note T on page 71.

At year-end 1994, the company had a net balance of $1.8 billion in assets under
management from the securitization of lease and trade receivables. This amount
is $1.3 billion lower than the 1993 year-end balance of $3.1 billion. Further
discussion appears in note U on page 71.

During 1994, the company issued, in lieu of purchasing on the open market, 5.7
million shares of common stock, which has been sold to employees under the IBM
Employees 1990 Stock Purchase Plan. Also, during 1994, the company contributed
 .7 million shares of common stock, as well as cash, to the IBM Retirement Plan
Trust Fund.

In October of 1994, Moody's Investors Service upgraded its short-term debt
rating for IBM and its rated subsidiaries to "Prime-1" from "Prime-2."

The following table summarizes the company's cash flow from operating,
investing, and financing activities as prescribed by Generally Accepted

The improvement in 1994 cash flow from operations, compared with the 1993
period, was mainly driven by the increase in earnings and lower inventories,
offset by cash outlays associated with the company's restructuring activities.

The period-to-period improvement in cash flow from investing activities
primarily results from the proceeds derived from the sale of FSC in the first
quarter of 1994. 

The increase in net cash outflow from financing activities in 1994 is due
principally to the company's ongoing efforts to reduce its overall outstanding
debt obligations.

The company's "core" business involves the sales of information technology
products and services as distinct from its customer financing and certain other
activities. The company believes it is important to understand the different
dynamics of these two businesses. Therefore, the company has derived a model for
separately measuring cash flow of the "core" business. The model is not intended
to replace the GAAP cash flow above, but is supplementary in nature. Under this
model, "core" cash flow from operations was approximately $6.9 billion in 1994.
Operations, as defined in this model, includes operating and investing
activities, but excludes the impact of changes in customer financing assets and
net cash proceeds from securitization of trade accounts receivable, which are
viewed as financing in nature. 

financing risks

Customer financing is an integral part of the company's total worldwide 
offerings. Financial results of customer financing can be found on pages 62
through 65. Inherent in customer financing are certain risks: credit, interest
rate, currency and residual value. The company manages credit risk through
comprehensive credit evaluations and pricing practices. To manage the risks
associated with an uncertain interest rate environment, the company pursues
a funding strategy of substantially matching the terms of its debt with the
terms of its assets. Currency risks are managed by denominating liabilities in
the same currency as the assets. 

Residual value risk is managed by developing projections of future equipment
values at lease inception, reevaluating these projections periodically, and
effectively deploying remarketing capabilities to recover residual values, and
potentially earning a profit. In 1994 and 1993, the remarketing effort generated
profits. The following table depicts an approximation of the unguaranteed
residual value maturities for the company's sales-type leases, as well as a
projection of net book value of operating leases at the end of the lease terms
as of December 31, 1993 and 1994. The following schedule excludes approximately
$50 million of estimated residual value associated with non-information
technology equipment.

The sale of FSC to Loral Corporation for $1.503 billion in cash had a closing
date of March 1, 1994, and was effective January 1, 1994. This transaction
resulted in an after-tax net gain of $248 million ($.43 per common share) in the
company's first-quarter 1994 results. The net gain reflects the impact 
of certain contractual, employee postemployment, and other obligations, which
included amounts for the Advanced Automation System contract for the Federal
Aviation Authority,  that the company recorded as part of the sale. The sale
also resulted in a decrease of $752 million in prepaid expenses and other
current assets, which represents the net assets associated with FSC.
Additionally, as a result of this sale, approximately 10,000 people have
either transferred to Loral, retired, or are on a preretirement leave from the
company.

FSC marketed specialized products and services to the defense, space, and other
agencies of the U.S. government and several non-U.S. governments. Federal
Systems Marketing, which sells the company's standard products to government
agencies, was not part of the transaction. In 1993, FSC had, on a stand-alone
basis, net earnings of $58 million on revenues of $2.3 billion.

As of December 31, 1994, regular employees were down 36,368 from 1993 and 81,703
from 1992. The company continues to form business entities to enhance
efficiencies and achieve its strategic objectives. Some of these entities, while
less than wholly owned, are consolidated into the company's financial
statements. The increase in employees in the less than wholly owned subsidiaries
category in 1994 results primarily from the formation of the following IBM
business ventures: Technology Service Solutions (U.S.) - 4,920; Information
Services Group Limited (South Africa) - 1,400; and Integrated Systems Solutions
Corporation (Australia) - 1,059.

The company's complementary work force comprises equivalent full-time workers
hired under temporary, part-time, and limited-term-employment arrangements to
meet specific short-term business needs in a flexible and cost-effective manner.

looking forward

Although the company returned to profitability in 1994, significant challenges
remain. The company must continue to focus on productivity improvements, growth
industries and emerging markets, costs and implementation of its long-term
strategies. This is particularly true within the Personal Computer Company and
desktop software. In 1995, the company will reduce its expenses as
re-engineering and restructuring programs continue. The company plans to reduce
total annual expenses $8.0 billion from 1992 levels by mid-1996. This is $1.0
billion more than its previously stated goal. At year-end 1994, annual expenses
had decreased by $6.3 billion when compared with full-year 1992 levels.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES




A} significant accounting policies

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International
Business Machines Corporation and its majority owned subsidiary companies.
Investments in business entities in which IBM does not have control, but has the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies
(generally 20--50 percent ownership), are accounted for by the equity method.
Other investments are accounted for by the cost method. 

Revenue

Revenue from hardware sales or sales-type leases is recognized when the product
is shipped. Revenue from one-time-charge licensed software is recognized when
the program is shipped with an appropriate deferral for post-contract customer
support. This deferral is earned over the support period. Revenue from monthly
software licenses is recognized as license fees accrue; from maintenance and
services over the contractual period, or as the services are performed; 
from rentals and operating leases, monthly as the fees accrue; and from
financing at level rates of return over the term of the lease or receivable.
Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns and allowances. 

Selling Expenses

Selling expenses are charged against income as incurred. 

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes.
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets
and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts
recognized for tax purposes. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," these deferred
taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. 

Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency
environment are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income
and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during
the year. Translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of
stockholders' equity. Inventories and plant, rental machines and other property
of non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary are translated at approximate
exchange rates prevailing when acquired. All other assets and liabilities are
translated at year-end exchange rates. Inventories charged to cost of sales and
depreciation are translated at historical exchange rates. All other income and
expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
year. Gains and losses that result from translation are included in earnings.

Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

Raw materials, work in process, and finished goods are stated at the lower of
average cost or market.

Depreciation

Plant, rental machines and other property are carried at cost, and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.

Software

Costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed programs are
expensed as research and development. Costs incurred subsequent to establishment
of technological feasibility to produce the finished product are capitalized.
The annual amortization of the capitalized amounts is the greater of the amount
computed based on the estimated revenue distribution over the products'
revenue-producing lives, or the straight-line method, and is applied over
periods ranging from two to four years. Periodic reviews are performed to ensure
that unamortized program costs remain recoverable over future revenues. Costs
to support or service licensed programs are charged against income as incurred,
or when related revenue is recognized, whichever occurs first.

Retirement Plans and Nonpension Postretirement Benefits

Current service costs of retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and life
insurance benefits are accrued in the period. Prior service costs resulting from
amendments to the plans are amortized over the average remaining service period
of employees expected to receive benefits. 

Goodwill

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the periods
estimated to be benefited, currently not exceeding five years.

Common Stock

Common stock refers to the $1.25 par value capital stock, as designated in the
company's Certificate of Incorporation. Earnings (loss) per common share amounts
are computed by dividing earnings (loss) after deduction of preferred stock
dividends by the average number of common shares outstanding in the period.

B} accounting changes

Effective January 1, 1994, the company implemented SFAS 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Adoption of this standard
had no impact on the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was not materially affected. Prior
years' consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect this
change.

Effective January 1, 1993, the company implemented SFAS 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." While the company was generally in
compliance with the standard prior to adoption, a charge was taken to recognize
the cost of certain benefits, primarily related to healthcare for employees on
disability. The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was a one-time
charge of $114 million (net of approximately $61 million of income tax
benefits). Prior years' consolidated financial statements were not restated to
reflect this change.

In 1992, the company implemented SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes.'' This
standard superseded the previous accounting standard for income taxes, SFAS 96,
which the company adopted in 1988. Under SFAS 109, the company recognizes
deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a benefit will be
realized. The cumulative effect of this accounting change, which was to
recognize previously unrecognized tax benefits for years prior to January 1,
1992, increased net earnings for 1992 by $1,900 million, or $3.33 per common
share. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," in May 1993 and SFAS 118, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan -- Income Recognition and Disclosure," an
amendment of SFAS 114, in October 1994.  These standards prescribe impairment
measurements and reporting related to certain loans. SFAS 114 and SFAS 118 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The implementation
of these standards is not expected to have a material effect on the financial
position or results of operations of the company.

The non-U.S. deferred income tax provision was reduced $106 million due to the
utilization of operating loss carryforwards in 1994.                     

The impact of tax law changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities was not
material to the company's financial results in 1994 and 1992 and was a benefit
of $170 million in 1993. 

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the
amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes
and such amounts recognized for tax purposes.

The valuation allowance applies to U.S. federal tax credit and net operating
loss carryforwards, state and local net deferred tax assets and net operating
loss carryforwards, and net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions
that may expire before the company can utilize them. The net change in the total
valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 1994, was a decrease of $484
million.

The estimated reversal periods for the largest deductible temporary differences
are: Retiree Medical - 1 to 30 years; Restructuring - 1 to 5 years. 

The consolidated effective income tax rate was 41 percent in 1994, (9) percent
in 1993, and (24) percent in 1992.

A reconciliation of the company's effective tax rate to the statutory U.S.
federal tax rate is as follows:

For tax return purposes, the company has available tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $2,944 million, of which $369 million expire in 1996, $776 million
expire in 1998, $576 million expire in 1999, and the remainder thereafter. The
company also has federal, state and local, and foreign tax loss carryforwards,
the tax effect of which is $1,069 million. Most of these carryforwards are
available for fourteen years or have an indefinite carryforward period.

Undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries included in consolidated
retained earnings amounted to $11,280 million at December 31, 1994, $10,915
million at December 31, 1993, and $12,182 million at December 31, 1992. These
earnings, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted
substantially free of additional tax. Accordingly, no material provision has
been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings nor
is it practicable to determine the amount of this liability.

I} research, development and engineering 

Research, development and engineering expenses amounted to $4,363 million in
1994, $5,558 million in 1993, and $6,522 million in 1992. Expenditures for
product-related engineering included in these amounts were $981 million, $1,127
million, and $1,439 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. 

Expenditures of $3,382 million in 1994, $4,431 million in 1993, and $5,083
million in 1992 were made for  research and development activities covering
basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances to the
development of new and improved products and their uses. Of these amounts,
software-related activities were $793 million, $1,097 million, and $1,161
million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

J} restructuring actions

In 1993 and 1992, the company recorded restructuring charges of $8.9 billion
before taxes ($8.0 billion after taxes or $14.02 per common share) and $11.6
billion before taxes ($8.3 billion after taxes or $14.51 per common share),
respectively, as part of restructuring programs to streamline and reduce
resources utilized in the business. These charges and their subsequent
utilization are summarized in the following table:

*Includes redistribution among categories, as described in detail below.
**$1.4 billion included in Other accrued expenses and liabilities and $.9
billion reduction to Plant, rental machines and other property in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 1994.

As of December 31, 1994, the company has determined that restructuring reserve
balances are adequate to cover committed restructuring actions. Based on the
actual restructuring actions in 1994, it was necessary to redistribute by
category $1.2 billion of the $20.5 billion assumed in the original restructuring
plans. The company reduced reserve balances designated for manufacturing
capacity actions by $1.2 billion and increased amounts originally designated for
work-force-related and excess space actions by $.1 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively. All remaining restructuring actions have been announced as of
December 31, 1994, and it is estimated that approximately $1.3 billion of the
remaining $2.3 billion of restructuring reserves will be utilized by March 31,
1995, with the remaining amounts being fully utilized prior to December 
31, 1995.

The company records restructuring charges against operations and provides a
reserve based on the best information available at the time the decision is made
to undertake the restructuring action. The reserves are considered utilized when
specific restructuring criteria are met, indicating the planned restructuring
action has occurred. Work-force-related reserves are considered utilized at
payment for termination or acceptance of other contractual arrangements.

Manufacturing capacity reserves are considered utilized based on execution of
planned actions at each affected location. The reserve for excess space is
utilized when the remaining lease obligations are settled or the space has been
vacated and made available for sublease. It is the company's policy to continue
to charge depreciation, rental, and other operating costs relating to
manufacturing capacity and excess space to ongoing operations while they remain
in business use. Salaries and benefits are charged to operations while the
employee is actively employed.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES


The $11.4 billion of work-force-related reserves taken in 1992 and 1993
contemplated worldwide staff reductions of approximately 110,000 people. Through
1994, approximately 98,000 people have left the company under these programs.
The $.1 billion increase in work-force-related reserves was primarily a result
of higher than planned costs associated with staff reductions in Europe.  The
manufacturing capacity reserves were reduced by $1.2 billion due to the
combination of increased demand for selected products, increased asset
requirements in several significant new Microelectronics Division joint
ventures, as well as a higher level of sales to third parties than originally
planned. The excess space accrual increased by $1.1 billion as a result of
additional lease space being vacated, primarily within the United States as a
result of work force reductions and more efficient utilization of owned space
allowing for consolidation of leased space. 

Remaining cash outlays associated with work-force-related activities are
expected to total $3.7 billion of which $1.7 billion will be expended in 1995.
Remaining amounts relate to the pension plan curtailment portion of the charge
and other postretirement payments which will be made as required for funding
appropriate pension and other postretirement benefits in future years. 
Remaining manufacturing capacity actions will not involve substantial cash
outlays. Cash requirements related to excess space charges are expected to
be expended as follows: $635 million in 1995, $418 million in 1996, $391 million
in 1997,  and $999 million in 1998 and beyond.

K} interest on debt

Interest on borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries amounted to $2,006
million in 1994, $2,298 million in 1993, and $2,698 million in 1992. Of these
amounts, $20 million in 1994, $46 million in 1993, and $101 million in 1992 were
capitalized. The remainder was charged to cost of rentals and financing, and
interest expense. The lower levels of expense were a result of decreases in
total debt outstanding of $5.2 billion in 1994 versus 1993 and $2.0 billion
in 1993 versus 1992. The average interest rate for total debt was 8.0 percent,
7.7 percent, and 9.6 percent in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

L} other liabilities and environmental

Other liabilities consists principally of accruals for nonpension postretirement
benefits, indemnity, and retirement plan reserves for non-U.S. employees, and
restructuring charges. More detailed discussions of these liabilities appear in
note S, "Nonpension Postretirement Benefits," on pages 69 through 71; note R, 
"Retirement Plans," on pages 67 through 69; and note J, "Restructuring Actions,"
on pages 60 and 61. 

In addition, the company continues to participate in environmental assessments
and cleanups at a number of locations, including operating facilities,
previously owned facilities, and Superfund sites. The company accrues for all
known environmental liabilities for remediation cost when a cleanup program
becomes probable and costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimated environmental
costs associated with post-closure activities, such as the removal and
restoration of chemical storage facilities and monitoring, are accrued when the
decision is made to close a facility. The amounts accrued, which are
undiscounted and do not reflect any insurance recoveries, were $179 million and
$77 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The increase in the

<PAGE>

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES


accrual relates to expected costs of post-closure activities, reassessment of
remediation activities at operating facilities, and participation at additional
Superfund sites.

The amounts accrued do not cover sites which are in the preliminary stages of
investigation where neither the company's percentage of responsibility nor
the extent of cleanup required have been identified. Also excluded is the
cost of internal environmental protection programs which are primarily
preventive in nature. Estimated environmental costs are not expected to
materially impact the financial position or results of the company's
operations in future periods. However, environmental cleanup periods are
protracted in length and earnings in future periods are subject to changes
in environmental remediation regulations.

M} contingencies

On February 25, 1993, a consolidated and amended class action complaint was
filed against the company in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging violations of Section 12 of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint
alleges, among other matters, that the company disseminated false and
misleading statements concerning its financial condition and dividends during
certain periods of 1992, as a result of which plaintiffs were injured in
connection with their purchases of IBM stock during the period of September 30,
1992, through December 14, 1992. 

The plaintiffs seek unspecified money damages. The company believes it has good
defenses to the allegations raised in the consolidated complaint and intends to
defend itself vigorously. The company does not believe that the ultimate outcome
of this matter will have a material effect on its results of operations
or its financial position. 

N} customer financing

The primary focus of IBM's worldwide customer financing offerings is to support
customers in their acquisitions of IBM's products and services. This support is
provided both by IBM and through its financing subsidiaries; the results of
which are presented in this note in a consistent manner.

The following schedules reflect the financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows for customer financing in comparison to the company's
consolidated results with customer financing results reflected on the equity
basis. This involves presenting within a single line item the investment and
related return from customer financing as reflected in the company's
consolidated financial statements.  For the statement of financial position,
customer financing's assets net of related liabilities, and after elimination
of applicable intracompany transactions, are shown separately as a single line
item, investment in customer financing. Eliminations primarily pertain to
internal mark-ups to fair value on equipment held on operating leases, and the
normal elimination of intracompany payables and receivables. With respect to the
statement of operations, net earnings for customer financing before applicable
taxes and after elimination of related intracompany transactions, are included
in the line description, other income. For the statement of cash flows, certain
cash flow activities are reclassified to be consistent with the classification
of such activities reflected in the company's Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows. Such reclassifications primarily pertain to cash flow activity related
to financing receivables.

aforementioned type of comparative disclosure enhances an understanding and
analysis of the consolidated financial statements.

Customer financing debt at December 31, 1994, consisted of borrowings directly
with external financial institutions of $16,052 million and intracompany
borrowings of $3,112 million. Intracompany borrowings are made pursuant to loan
agreements between the parties at market rates of interest. 

Customer financing earnings yielded a return on average invested capital of 24.5
percent in 1994, compared to 18.4 percent in 1993. Included within these results
are intracompany services and fees received for tax benefits provided to the
company resulting from tax deferrals generated by financing transactions. Such
fees are eliminated from the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The 1994
earnings include income resulting from IBM Credit Corporation's litigation
settlement with Comdisco, Inc. and from IBM Credit Corporation's sale of IBM
Credit Investment Management Corporation.

The provision for income taxes for customer financing is based on the statutory
income tax rate of each country, calculated on a separate return basis.

O} rental expense and lease commitments

Rental expense, including amounts charged to inventories and fixed assets,
excluding amounts charged to restructuring, was $1,276 million in 1994, $1,686
million in 1993, and $2,108 million in 1992. The table below depicts gross
minimum rental commitments, under non-cancellable leases; amounts related to
vacant space, the majority of which the company had reserved for in
restructuring charges; and sublease commitments. These amounts generally
reflect activities related to office space.

P} long-term performance plan

In April 1994, stockholders approved the IBM 1994 Long-Term Performance Plan,
which provides incentive awards for officers and other key employees. The plan
is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee
of the Board of Directors. The Committee determines the type of award to be
granted, which may include stock, a stock option, a Stock Appreciation Right 
(SAR), cash, or any combination thereof. The number of shares that may be
issued under the plan for awards granted wholly or partly in stock during the
five-year term of the plan is 29,105,600, which is 5% of the outstanding common
stock as determined on February 10, 1994. Prior to April 25, 1994, stock options
were issued under the IBM 1989 Long-Term Performance Plan and the IBM 1986 and
predecessor Stock Option Plans.


Options allow the purchase of IBM's common stock at 100 percent of the market
price on the date of grant and have a maximum duration of 10 years. Payment by
the optionee upon exercise of an option may be made using IBM stock, as well as
cash.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES


SARs offer eligible optionees the alternative of electing not to exercise the
related stock option, but to receive payment in cash and/or stock, equivalent to
the difference between the option price and the average market price of IBM
stock on the date of exercising the right. 

The following table summarizes option activity during 1994 and 1993: 

Number of shares under option              1994             1993

Exercisable at December 31           16,666,537       14,636,324


In April 1993, the committee of the Board of Directors then responsible for
administering the plan, the Nominating and Executive Compensation Committee,
approved management's plan to allow optionees, other than executive officers, to
voluntarily forfeit all of their existing IBM stock options, granted from 1984
through 1992, in exchange for a fewer number of new stock option grants. Under
this program, 18,054,615 options, at average prices ranging from $66.94 to
$159.50, were terminated and 7,405,090 new options, at a price of $47.88, 
were granted subject to certain conditions for vesting and exercise.

The options exercised in 1994 were at an average option price of $46.42 per
share. There were no options exercised in 1993.  The shares under option at
December 31, 1994, and December 31, 1993, were at option prices ranging from
$43.00 to $159.50 per share. 

There were 27,842,801 and 6,011,858 unused shares carried forward and made
available for granting in the subsequent year as of December 31, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

Q} stock purchase plan

The IBM Employees 1990 Stock Purchase Plan enables employees who are not
participants in IBM's stock option programs to purchase IBM common stock through
payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation. The price an
employee pays for a share of stock is 85 percent of the average market price on
the date the employee has accumulated sufficient funds to buy a share.

In July 1993, the Board of Directors approved management's plan to issue,
instead of purchase on the open market, stock to be sold to employees under the
plan. On October 25, 1994, the Board of Directors approved management's plan to
revert to purchasing IBM common stock on the open market for sale to employees
as part of this plan.

During 1994, employees purchased 6,576,030 shares, including 906,629 treasury
shares, for which $350 million was paid to IBM. There were 15,126,471 reserved
unissued shares available for purchase under the plan at December 31, 1994.

Net periodic pension cost is determined using the Projected Unit Credit
actuarial method. Prior service cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over
the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits.
An assumption is made for modified career average plans such that the average
earnings base period will be updated to the years prior to retirement.

Termination incentive expenses represent the cost of special retirement benefits
offered to employees for a short period of time in exchange for voluntary
termination of service. Curtailment losses reflect the significant reductions in
the expected years of future service caused by termination programs and
represent the immediate recognition of associated prior service cost and a
portion of previously unrecognized actuarial losses.

The curtailment losses and termination charges, referred to above, were accrued
as restructuring charges in 1993 and 1992.

In 1994, the company introduced a non-qualified U.S. Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (SERP) effective January 1, 1995, which will be phased in over
three years. The SERP, which is unfunded, provides eligible executives defined
pension benefits, outside the IBM Retirement Plan, based on average earnings,
years of service, and age at retirement. At December 31, 1994, the projected
benefit obligation was $64 million of which $61 million ($73 million of
unrecognized prior service cost and $12 million of unrecognized actuarial gains)
is subject to amortization. The remaining $3 million has been accrued in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Net periodic pension cost for this
plan was $3 million in 1994. These amounts are not reflected in the net periodic
pension cost and funded status of the U.S. retirement plan.

The table below provides information on the status of the U.S. retirement
plan, and selected non-U.S. plans that represent approximately 97 percent of the
total non-U.S. accumulated benefit obligations.

 The U.S. plan's projected benefit obligation decreased in 1994 primarily as a
result of a change  in the discount rate and a plan amendment. The change in the
discount rate decreased the  projected benefit obligation $3,055 million. 
The plan amendment reduced the projected benefit obligation and unrecognized
prior service cost $959 million.

It is the company's practice to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet the
minimum  requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit and tax laws, and
such additional amounts  as the company may determine to be appropriate from
time to time. In July 1993, the Board of  Directors authorized the issuance of
up to 15 million shares of IBM common stock to be contributed to the IBM
Retirement Plan Trust Fund through 1994. Through December 31, 1994, the
company has contributed 6,500,000 shares to the fund. The assets of the various
plans include corporate equities, government securities, corporate debt
securities, and income-producing real estate.

 U.S. Plan: U.S. regular, full-time, and part-time employees are covered by a
noncontributory  plan which is funded by company contributions to an irrevocable
trust fund, which is held for the sole benefit of employees. On October 5,
1994, the company announced major changes to the  plan that take place starting
in 1995. Under a new formula, which will be phased in over five  years,
retirement benefits will be determined based on points  accumulated for each
year worked and final average compensation. To preserve benefits of employees
close to retirement, service and  earnings credit will continue to accrue under
the current core formula through the year 2000 and upon retirement, current
employees will receive the benefit from either the new or current  formulas,
whichever is higher. Benefits become vested upon the completion of five years of
service. The number of individuals receiving benefits at December 31, 1994 and
1993, was  85,009  and 77,664, respectively.

Non-U.S. Plans: Most subsidiaries and branches outside the United States have
retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees, under which funds
are deposited under various fiduciary-type arrangements, annuities are purchased
under group contracts, or reserves are provided. Retirement benefits are based
on years of service and the employee's compensation,  generally during a fixed
number of years immediately prior to retirement. The ranges of  assumptions used
for the non-U.S. plans reflect the different economic environments within the
various countries.


S} nonpension postretirement benefits

The company and its U.S. subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans
that provide  medical, dental, and life insurance for retirees and eligible
dependents. In 1993, the company applied plan cost maximums to those who retired
prior to January 1, 1992. These maximums will  take effect beginning with the
year 2001. Plan cost maximums were established in 1990 for those  employees
retiring after December 31, 1991. 

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application
of the terms of  medical, dental, and life insurance plans, including the
effects of established maximums on  covered costs, together with relevant
actuarial assumptions. These actuarial assumptions include healthcare cost
trend rates projected ratably from 12.0 percent in 1995 to 6 percent in the year
 2007.

The effect of a 1 percent annual increase in these assumed cost trend rates
would increase the  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $52 million; the annual costs  would not be materially affected.

In 1994, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation decreased $649
million as a result of  the change in the assumed discount rate. 

It is the company's practice to fund amounts for postretirement benefits with
an independent trustee, as deemed appropriate from time to time. The plan assets
include corporate equities and government securities. The accounting for the
plan is based on the written plan.

Certain of the company's non-U.S. subsidiaries have similar plans for retirees.
However, most retirees outside the United States are covered by
government-sponsored and administered programs, and the obligations and cost of
these programs are not significant to the company.

T} lines of credit

As part of the company's ongoing efforts toward greater efficiency of its
treasury activities and to ensure appropriate liquidity levels, in December
1993, the company entered into a $10.0 billion committed global credit facility.
Unused committed lines of credit from this global facility and other previously
existing committed and uncommitted lines of credit at December 31, 1994, were
$15.1 billion, compared to $15.7 billion at December 31, 1993. Interest rates on
borrowings vary from country to country depending on local market conditions.

U} sales and securitization of receivables

The company received total cash proceeds of approximately $12.6 billion and $6.8
billion in 1994 and 1993 from the sale and securitization of primarily trade
receivables. At year-end 1994, the company had a net balance of $1.8 billion in
assets under management from the securitization of lease and trade receivables.
This amount is $1.3 billion lower than the 1993 year-end balance of $3.1
billion. No material gain or loss resulted from these transactions. Recourse
amounts associated with the aforementioned sales and securitization activities
are expected to be minimal, and adequate reserves are in place to cover
potential losses.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the December 31, 1993, Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position included $751 million of net assets that had
been reclassified pending the sale of FSC, as discussed on page 47.

V} preferred stock 

On June 7, 1993, the company issued 11.25 million shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, represented by 45 million depositary shares. The preferred stock is not
convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of
stock of the company. The preferred stock has priority for dividends over the
company's common stock. Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative and
accrue from the date of original issue at a rate of $7.50 per share (equivalent
to $1.875 per depositary share). The preferred stock is not redeemable prior to
July 1, 2001. Thereafter, the company, at its option, may redeem the preferred
stock, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price per share of $100
($25 per depositary share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon any
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the company, holders of
the preferred stock will be entitled to receive $100 per share ($25 per
depositary share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends before any distribution to
holders of the company's common stock. See note Z, "Subsequent Events," on page
78 for additional information regarding this subject.

 *Reclassified to conform with 1994 presentation.

 +The estimated fair value of derivatives both on and off balance sheet at
  December 31, 1994, consists of assets of $448 million and liabilities of $239
  million.

In assessing the fair value of these financial instruments, the company has used
a variety of methods and assumptions, which were based on estimates of market
conditions and risks existing at that time. For certain instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, non-trade accounts payable and accruals, and
short-term debt, it was assumed that the carrying amount approximated fair value
for the majority of these instruments because of their short maturities. Quoted
market prices or dealer quotes for the same or similar instrument were used for
the majority of marketable securities, long-term investments, and long-term
debt. Other techniques, such as option pricing models, estimated discounted
value of future cash flows, replacement cost, and termination cost, have been
used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
These values merely represent a general approximation of possible value and may
never actually be realized.

In the normal course of business, the company enters into a variety of
derivative instruments solely for the purpose of currency exchange rate and
interest rate risk management. 

The majority of the company's derivative transactions relates to the matching
of liabilities to assets associated with its worldwide customer financing
business. The company issues debt, using the most efficient capital markets and
products, which may result in a currency or interest rate mismatch. Interest
rate or currency swaps are then used by the company to match the interest
rates and currencies of its debt to the related customer financing receivables.

To a much lesser extent, interest rate swaps are used to rebalance the fixed
versus floating mix on the company's "core" debt. Interest rate swap contracts
are principally one to five years in duration. The company also uses an internal
regional center to manage the cash of its subsidiaries in a cost effective
manner. This regional center principally uses currency swaps to deliver local
currency denominated funding predominantly to the company's European
subsidiaries. The terms of the currency swaps are generally less than five 
years. Additionally, the company uses derivatives to limit its exposure to loss
resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on anticipated
cash transactions between foreign subsidiaries and the parent company. The
company receives significant dividends, intracompany royalties and net payments
for goods and services from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. In anticipation of these
foreign currency flows, and given the volatility of the currency markets, the
company selectively employs foreign currency options and foreign exchange
contracts to manage the currency risk. The terms of these instruments are
generally less than a year. 

The company has used derivative instruments as an element of its risk management
strategy for many years. Although derivatives entail a risk of non-performance
by counterparties, the company manages this risk by establishing explicit dollar
and term limitations which correspond to the credit rating of each carefully
selected counterparty. The company has not sustained a material loss from these
instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its results of
operations or financial condition in the future.

The notional value of derivative instruments held at year end, which provides
an indication of the extent of the company's involvement in such instruments but

The costs associated with entering into derivative contracts are generally
amortized over the life of the instruments and are not material to the company's
results. Unamortized premiums are included in prepaid assets. Interest rate
differentials accruing under interest rate swaps which receive hedge accounting
treatment are recognized over the life of the contracts in interest expense.
Derivative instruments which qualify as hedges of net investments in
subsidiaries are included in prepaid assets, and gains and losses are included
in stockholders' equity. For purchased options which hedge anticipated
transactions, gains and losses are deferred and recognized in other income in
the same period that the underlying transaction occurs or expires. At December
31, 1994, there were no material deferred gains or losses. All written options,
except those that qualify as hedges of net investments, are marked to market
monthly, as are some purchased options which do not qualify for hedge
accounting. These options appear on the balance sheet in prepaid assets or other
liabilities. The related gains and losses are recognized immediately in other
income. Although these options do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are
used by the company as part of its overall risk management program.

The company originates financing for customers in a variety of industries and
throughout the world. The company has a diversified portfolio of capital
equipment financings for end users. With the growth of the company's working
capital financing business in 1994, the concentration of such financings for
certain large dealers and remarketers of information industry products has
become more significant. All such loans are collateralized by the inventory
and accounts receivable of the dealers and remarketers. The company does not
believe that this risk will have a material adverse effect on its financial
position or results of operations. 

IBM has guaranteed certain loans and commitments of various ventures to which it
is a party. Additionally, the company is contingently liable for certain
receivables sold with recourse.  These commitments, which in the aggregate were
approximately $.9 billion and $2 billion at December 31, 1994 and 1993
respectively, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
company's financial position or results of operations.

X} segment information

IBM is in the business of providing customer solutions through the use of
advanced information technologies. The company operates primarily in the single
industry segment that creates value by offering a variety of solutions that
include, either singularly or in some combination, services, software, systems,
products, financing, and technologies. The schedule on page 75 shows revenue by
classes of similar products or services. Financial information by geographic
area is summarized on pages 76 and 77.

For purposes of classifying similar information technology products, user
programmable equipment having the capability of manipulating data arithmetically
or logically and making calculations, in a manner directly addressable by the
user through the operation of a stored program, has been classified as
processors. Processors includes high-end and midrange products. Personal systems
includes personal computers, power personal systems, and RISC System/6000
products. Other workstations includes display-based terminals and consumer and
financial systems. Storage consists of externally attached direct access
storage devices and tape storage devices. Other peripherals consists of advanced
function printers and telecommunication devices. OEM hardware consists primarily
of revenue from the sale of semiconductors and low-end storage files to
external customers.

These hardware classes of products represent groupings that perform similar
functions, as opposed to the complete spectrum of products associated with
IBM's product divisions. Accordingly, they do not represent the full range of
any division's offerings, which could include related peripherals, software,
and maintenance.

Software includes both applications and systems software. Maintenance consists
of separately billed charges for maintenance. Services represents a wide range
of service offerings including consulting, education, systems  design and
development, managed operations, and availability services. Financing and other
is composed primarily of financing revenue and products and supplies not
otherwise classified. 

Some products logically fit in more than one class and are assigned to a
specific class based on a variety of factors. Over time, products tend to
overlap, merge into, or split from existing classes as a result of changing
technologies, market perceptions, and/or customer use. For example, market
demand may create requirements for

technological enhancements to permit a peripheral product to be functionally
integrated with a display, a telecommunication device, and a processor to form a
workstation. Such interchangeability and technological progress tend to make
year-to-year comparisons less valid than they would be in an industry less
subject to rapid change.

Y} geographic areas

Marketing and services in the United States and Canada are managed as a
single enterprise. However, in compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise," the
United States is reported as a separate geographic area. Canadian operations are
included in the "Americas" area. 

Non-U.S. subsidiaries operating in local currency environments account for
approximately 90 percent of the company's non-U.S. revenue. The remaining 10
percent is from subsidiaries and branches operating in U.S. dollars or in
highly inflationary environments.

In the Europe/Middle East/Africa area, European operations accounted for
approximately 95 percent of revenue in 1994, 1993, and 1992.

Interarea transfers consist principally of completed machines, subassemblies and
parts, and software. Machines, subassemblies and parts are generally transferred
at an intracompany selling price. Software transfers represent license fees paid
by non-U.S. subsidiaries. The intracompany selling price that relates to fixed
asset transfers is capitalized and depreciated by the importing area.

Z} subsequent events 

On January 11, 1995, the company commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash
any and all of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by 44.6 million
outstanding depositary shares for a price of $25.00 net per depositary share.
Under the offer, depositary shares tendered and purchased by the company will
not receive or otherwise be entitled to the regular quarterly cash
dividend expected to be paid for the first quarter of 1995 and also will not
receive any accrued dividends for that period. The offer is not conditioned upon
any minimum number of depositary shares being tendered. The offer and withdrawal
rights expired on February 8, 1995. The company has purchased 34.1 million
depositary shares under this offer.

On January 31, 1995, the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase
up to $2.5 billion of IBM common shares on the open market. The company plans to
purchase the shares from time to time, depending on market conditions.
