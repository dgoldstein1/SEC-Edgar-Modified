Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. In the opinion of the management of International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), all adjustments necessary to a fair statement of the
results for the unaudited three month period have been made.

2. The company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130
"Reporting Comprehensive Income," effective January 1, 1998. This standard
requires that the total changes in equity resulting from revenue, expenses, and
gains and losses, including those which do not affect retained earnings, be
reported. Accordingly, these amounts which are comprised of net earnings,
foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities were $949 million and $349 million for the three month
periods ending March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

3. Subsequent Events: On April 28, 1998, the company announced that the Board of
Directors had approved a quarterly dividend increase of 10 percent from $.20 to
$.22 per common share payable June 10, 1998, to shareholders of record on May 8,
1998. In addition, the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase
up to an additional $3.5 billion of IBM common stock shares. The company plans
to buy shares on the open market from time-to-time, depending on market
conditions.

ITEM 2.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                   FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1998

      The company's first quarter results were adversely impacted, as expected,
by acquisition charges, Olympic marketing expenses, currency and weakness in
Asia. In addition, the personal computer business suffered from severe price
competition that was greater than anticipated. Offsetting these problems and
demonstrating once again the strength of the company's broad portfolio, the
non-personal computer businesses performed better than expected. In particular,
services, software, mid-range servers and OEM products had a strong quarter.

      The company recorded first-quarter 1998 diluted earnings per common share
of $1.06 compared with diluted earnings per common share of $1.16 in the first
quarter of 1997. First-quarter 1998 net earnings totaled $1.0 billion compared
with $1.2 billion in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased 1.8 percent (up
about 6 percent in constant currency) in the first quarter of 1998 to $17.6
billion. The average number of common shares outstanding for the period was
950.2 million compared with 1.0 billion in the first quarter of 1997.

Results of Operations

      On an as-reported basis, first quarter revenue in the United States was
$7.6 billion, an increase of 4.5 percent from the same period a year ago.
Revenue from Europe/Middle East/Africa increased by 2.3 percent to $5.4 billion.
Asia-Pacific revenue was $3.2 billion, a decline of 6.2 percent from first
quarter of 1997. Revenue from Latin America totaled $741 million, up 5.8 percent
compared with the year-ago period. Revenue from Canada grew 5.5 percent to $695
million compared to the same period last year.

      Excluding the effects of currency, European revenue grew approximately 9
percent, while Latin America revenue climbed about 8 percent and Canadian
revenue increased about 10 percent year-over-year. Asia-Pacific revenue would
have grown approximately 2 percent from the same period of 1997.

      The total gross profit margin was 36.6 percent in the first quarter
compared to 38.1 percent in the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter
of 1998, gross margin improvement in services and software was offset by
declines in hardware and rentals and financing margins.

      Total first-quarter 1998 expenses, which included acquisition charges and
spending to support the Olympics, increased 3.9 percent.

      The company's tax rate was 32.0 percent in the first quarter compared with
35.5 percent a year ago.

Results of Operations - (continued)

      Hardware sales revenue declined 8.2 percent when compared to the first
quarter of 1997. Revenue from hardware sales was negatively affected by
approximately 3 percentage points from currency in the quarter.

      The hardware sales decline was due principally to the weakness in personal
computers as a result of the severe price pressures this quarter. AS/400 revenue
increased and RS/6000 revenue was flat. System/390 revenue declined as a result
of year-over-year price reductions and on-going product transitions, while
shipments of System/390 computing power grew about 45 percent (as measured in
MIPS, or millions of instructions per second). Storage products revenue
increased, with continued strength in OEM sales of hard disk drives.
Semiconductor revenue grew strongly despite the declines in memory chip prices
in the quarter.

      Hardware sales gross profit dollars decreased 19.8 percent when compared
to the first quarter of 1997. The decrease was primarily driven by pricing
pressures associated with personal computers, hard disk drives and memory chip
prices when compared to the first quarter of 1997. These declines were partially
offset by improved margins for System/390 and AS/400 products.

      Services revenue increased 22.3 percent, when compared to the first
quarter of 1997. Services revenue was negatively affected by about 5 percentage
points from currency in the quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in
all categories of service offerings. The company signed service agreements
totaling about $6.8 billion in the quarter. Services gross profit dollars
increased by 32.3 percent over the first quarter of 1997.

      Revenue from software increased 2.3 percent from the first quarter of
1997. Software revenue was negatively affected by approximately 5 percentage
points from currency in the quarter. The increase was a result of higher
host-based computer software revenue associated with AS/400 products and growth
from distributed software offerings, primarily from Tivoli.

      Software gross profit dollars increased 10.3 percent versus the first
quarter of 1997. The increase was primarily a result of lower amortization costs
incurred in the first quarter of 1998 versus 1997.

margins continue to be affected by price reductions on maintenance offerings.

      Rentals and financing revenue increased 10.7 percent when compared to the
same period in 1997. Revenue from rentals and financing was negatively affected
by approximately 3 percentage points from currency in the quarter. The increase
in revenue was primarily due to higher operating lease activity in 1998 versus
the first quarter of 1997. Gross profit dollars declined 11.0 percent when
compared to the first quarter of 1997. The decrease was primarily a result of a
trend towards financing a greater volume of low-end products and faster revenue
growth in the more competitive U.S. market.

      Selling, general and administrative expense increased 1.0 percent from
first quarter 1997. Currency had a benefit of about 3 percentage points in the
first quarter of 1998. The increase was primarily driven by increased spending
associated with the Olympics in the first quarter of 1998. The company continues
to reduce infrastructure expense, reduce expense associated with low-growth
businesses and invest in growth segments in a disciplined manner.

      Research, development and engineering expense increased 10.2 percent from
the first quarter of 1997. The increase was due to the charges associated with
the acquisition of Software Artistry, Inc. and CommQuest Technologies in the
first quarter of 1998.

Results of Operations - (continued)

      Interest on total borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries, which
includes interest expense and interest costs associated with rentals and
financing, amounted to $408 million for the first quarter of 1998. Of this
amount, $4 million was capitalized.

      The effective tax rate for the three months of 1998 was 32.0 percent
versus 35.5 percent for the same period in 1997. The 3.5 point decrease in the
effective tax rate in 1998 versus 1997 was primarily the result of the mix of
earnings and the corresponding weighting of tax rates on a country- by-country
basis, as the company continued to expand into markets with lower effective tax
rates.

Financial Condition

      The company has continued to make significant investments during the first
quarter to fund its future growth and increase shareholder value. These included
expenditures of $1.8 billion for the repurchase of the company's common shares,
$1.3 billion for research, development and engineering, and $1.2 billion in
plant, rental machines and other property. The company had $5.9 billion in cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 1998.

Current ratio                         1.25:1           1.21:1

      The company's current ratio improved to 1.25 to 1. Current assets declined
$2.8 billion from year-end 1997 with declines $1.7 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities and $1.8 billion in accounts receivable,
offset by an increase of $.3 billion in prepaid expenses. The decrease in cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities results primarily from the share
repurchases, and capital expenditures, offset by cash generated from operations
and debt financing. The decline in accounts receivable was attributable to the
lower volumes normally associated with the first quarter, while prepaid expenses
reflect the seasonal increase in prepaid expenses from year-end levels.

      Current liabilities declined $3.5 billion, with declines of $2.9 billion
in accruals, taxes and accounts payable (resulting primarily from seasonal
declines in these balances from their normally higher year-end levels), and $.6
billion in short-term debt.

Investments

      During the first quarter of 1998, the company continued to invest in its
rapidly growing services business, primarily in the management of customers'
information technology and also invested in manufacturing capacity for hard disk
drives and microelectronics. The company's capital investments for plant, rental
machines and other property were $1.2 billion during the first quarter of 1998,
a decrease of $.1 billion from the comparable 1997 period.

      In addition to software development expenses included in research,
development and engineering expense, the company capitalized $.1 billion of
software costs during the first three months of both 1998 and 1997. Amortization
of capitalized software costs amounted to $.2 billion and $.3 billion during the
first quarter of 1998 and 1997, respectively.

      Investments and sundry assets were $21.4 billion at March 31, 1998, a
decrease of $.5 billion from year-end 1997, resulting primarily from a decrease
in non-current sales-type lease receivables and deferred tax assets, partially
offset by an increase in the company's investment in business alliances.

Financial Condition - (continued)

Other Non-Current Liabilities

      Other non-current liabilities of $12.7 billion at March 31, 1998, declined
$.3 billion from year-end 1997 primarily due to reductions in restructuring
accrual balances related to prior restructuring programs, and in non-U.S.
retirement reserves.

Debt/capitalization                     59.5%            57.6%

Global financing debt/equity           6.8:1            6.5:1

      Total debt increased $.8 billion from year-end 1997, as debt in support of
growth in global financing assets increased $.5 billion and "core" debt
increased $.3 billion. Stockholders' equity declined $1.0 billion from December
31, 1997, as the increase in the company's retained earnings was more than
offset by the common share repurchases.

Liquidity

      The company maintains a $10.0 billion committed global credit facility as
part of its ongoing efforts to ensure appropriate levels of liquidity. At March
31, 1998, $9.1 billion of this confirmed line of credit remained unused and
available for future use.

      At March 31, 1998, the company had an outstanding balance of $1.1 billion
of assets under management from the securitization of loans, leases and trade
receivables.

      On January 6, 1998, the company issued $700 million of 6.5 percent
Debentures due January 15, 2028, the net proceeds of which were used for general
corporate purposes.

      In February 26, 1998, Standard and Poor's upgraded its credit rating for
IBM and its rated subsidiaries senior debt to A+ from A, and its preferred stock
rating to A from A-.

Stock options to purchase 19,730,269 shares in 1998 and 146,200 shares in

market price of the common shares, and therefore, the effect would be
antidilutive.  Net earnings applicable to common shareholders excludes
preferred stock dividends of $5 million for the periods ended March 31,
1998 and 1997.

      and 1997, respectively, are preferred stock dividends of $5 million, or
      $7 million and $8 million, respectively, representing the pre-tax earnings
