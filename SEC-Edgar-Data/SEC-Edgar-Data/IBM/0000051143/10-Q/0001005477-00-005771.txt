3. In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 137, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date Of FASB
Statement No. 133. This statement defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000, although early adoption is encouraged. SFAS No.
133 and SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, issued in June 2000,
establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. They
require an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair
value. Additionally, the fair value adjustments will affect either stockholders'
equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as
a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity.
The company will adopt these standards as of January 1, 2001. Management does
not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the company's results of
operations; however, the effect on the company's financial position depends on
the fair values of the company's derivatives and related financial instruments
at the date of adoption.

      In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. The company is
currently reviewing the provisions of SAB 101. The company expects to complete
its review of SAB 101 by the end of the fourth quarter of 2000.

4. The tables on pages 27 through 30 of this Form 10-Q reflect the results of
the company's segments consistent with the company's management system. These
results are not necessarily a depiction that is in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, e.g., employee retirement plan costs are
developed using actuarial assumptions on a country-by-country basis and
allocated to the segments on headcount. A different result could be arrived at
for any segment if actuarial assumptions unique to each segment were used.
Performance measurement is based on income before income taxes (pre-tax income).
These results are used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the
performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

      Effective in the first quarter of 2000, results reflect changes the
company made in the organization of its business segments, including the
transfer of the systems-level product businesses from the Technology segment to
the Enterprise Systems segment and the transfer of point-of-sale products from
the Enterprise Investments segment to the Personal Systems segment. Also
reflected are changes the company made in its expense allocation methodology,
allocating expense items previously unallocated and enhancing shared expense
allocations. Second-quarter and first-half 1999 results have been reclassified
to conform with the 2000 presentation.

5. The second quarter 1999 results include a pre-tax benefit of $1,610 million
($687 million after tax, or $.37 per diluted common share) related to the sale
of IBM's Global Network, a change in estimate related to the depreciable life of
personal computers used within the company and actions within the company's
Technology Group. That benefit is reflected in Selling, general and
administrative expense.

      Sale of IBM Global Network. In December 1998, the company announced that
it would sell its Global Network business to AT&T for $5 billion.

      During the second quarter of 1999, the company completed the sales of its
Global Network businesses in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and
Ireland, for approximately $4,192 million. The company recognized a pre-tax gain
of $3,430 million on the sales ($2,102 million after tax, or $1.12 per diluted
common share).

      Change in Estimate. As a result of a change in estimate of the useful life
of personal computers (PCs), from five years to three years, the company
recognized a charge in the second quarter of 1999 for $404 million ($241 million
after tax, $.13 per diluted common share). The company wrote off the net book
value of PCs that were 3 years or older and therefore, had no remaining useful
life. The remaining book value of the assets will be depreciated over the
remaining new useful life. The net effect on future operations is expected to be
minimal as the increased depreciation due to the shorter life will be offset by
the lower depreciable base attributable to the write-off of PCs older than three
years.

      Technology Group Actions. During the second quarter of 1999, the company
implemented actions that were designed to better align the operations and cost
structure of IBM's Technology Group with that group's strategic direction in
view of the competitive environment, overcapacity in the industry and resulting
pricing pressures. The actions affected the Microelectronics Division (MD) and
the Storage Systems Division (SSD) of the company's Technology Group.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)

      During the second quarter of 1999, the company recorded a charge of $1,416
million ($1,174 million after tax, or $.62 per diluted common share) related to
the Technology Group actions. The charge included $190 million related to
employee termination benefits and $1,226 million of other costs as described
below.

Summary. The following table identifies the significant components of the
pre-tax charge related to Technology Group actions, the investments and other
asset write-downs in the quarter, and the liability as of June 30, 1999:

      In June 2000, the company reached an agreement to sell its MiCRUS
semiconductor operations to Philips Semiconductors, an affiliate of Royal
Philips Electronics. In the second quarter of 1999 the company accrued shutdown
costs associated with the MiCRUS operations. The liability created was primarily
for lease termination charges for equipment under the MiCRUS operation. Since
June 1999, shutdown activities have been underway and were completed in June
2000. The liabilities accrued for in the second quarter of 1999 have been
utilized during the second quarter of 2000. In addition, the company recorded a
gain of $40 million from the sale of assets associated with this sale in the
second quarter of 2000.

6. Subsequent Event: On July 25, 2000, the company announced that Samuel J.
Palmisano and John M. Thompson had been elected to the IBM Board of Directors.
In addition, the company announced on July 24, 2000, that Mr. Palmisano had been
named president and chief operating officer of IBM and Mr. Thompson had been
named IBM Vice Chairman, reporting to IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.

ITEM 2.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2000

      The company's second-quarter and first-half results were in line with the
company's expectations. The company had experienced three quarters of slow
revenue growth, driven by a combination of Y2K slowdown and a series of actions
taken to improve the company's business portfolio and long-term profitability.

      Revenue performance for the second quarter was constrained by several
factors: currency negatively affected revenue growth by one point, hard disk
drives (HDDs) and personal


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

computers while improving quarter to quarter were a drag on revenue growth, as
were some parts of the company's server business.

      During the second quarter the company began to see a shift in momentum in
several areas. The services business saw significant increases in new contract
signings which totaled $20 billion for the quarter. A number of product areas
also experienced strong growth, including Web management software, e-business
consulting, Web hosting, systems integration and wireless chips. The company
also experienced a firming of its server business, particularly Web servers
which showed strong revenue growth, as well as high-end disk drive revenue, led
by the company's advanced Shark product.

      As a result of the company's share repurchase program, the average number
of common shares outstanding assuming dilution was lower by 52.6 million than
the second quarter in 1999 and the first six months of 1999. The average number
of shares assuming dilution was 1,818.0 million in the second quarter of 2000
and 1,824.0 million for the first six months of 2000. There were 1,760.7 million
shares outstanding at June 30, 2000.

      Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2000 decreased 1.2 percent
versus the same period last year (flat at constant currency). Hardware revenue
declined 4.9 percent driven by lower System/390, AS/400 and storage revenue
partially offset by increased microelectronics and Web server revenue. Revenue
from Global Services increased 2.4 percent in the quarter but was adversely
affected by the sale of the IBM Global Network to AT&T in 1999 and by a
year-over-year decline in Y2K services. Software revenue increased 1.7 percent
as middleware software showed growth, partially offset by lower operating
systems revenue primarily due to lower AS/400 software revenue. Revenue from
Global Financing increased 10.1 percent and revenue from Enterprise
Investments/Other declined 25.9 percent year-over-year.

      Revenue for the second quarter of 2000 from the company's end-user
businesses totaled $9.7 billion from the Americas, a decrease of 3.1 percent (3
percent decrease at constant currency) compared with the same period last year.
Revenue from Europe/Middle East/Africa was $5.9 billion, down 8.5 percent (flat
at constant currency). Asia-Pacific revenue grew 19.9 percent (13 percent at
constant currency) to $4.3 billion. OEM revenue across all

geographies was $1.8 billion, a 6.2 percent decrease (7 percent in constant
currency) compared with the second quarter of 1999.

      The company's overall gross profit margin was 36.7 percent in the second
quarter compared with 37.5 percent in the same period of 1999. The decline in
gross profit margin continues to reflect the changing mix of the company's
business to services, and a decline in margins in the company's hardware
business related to a shift from servers to microelectronics products which have
a lower gross profit margin.

      The company's second quarter expenses were $5.2 billion and the expense to
revenue ratio was 23.9 percent compared with 19.1 percent in the year earlier
period (or 26.4 percent after excluding a 7.3 point improvement from the IBM
Global Network sale and other 1999 actions). The actions are described in Note
No. 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 7 through 9.

      The company's tax rate was 30.0 percent in the second quarter compared
with 40.8 percent in the year-earlier period. The decrease was principally due
to the IBM Global Network sale and other 1999 actions.

      Revenue from hardware for the second quarter and first six months of 2000
decreased 4.9 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively, when compared with the same
periods in 1999.

      Enterprise Systems revenue declined for both the second quarter and first
six months of 2000. Revenue from the Web server product line, which includes
RS/6000 S80 models and NUMA-Q products increased as customer acceptance of the
S80 model continued to be strong. At the end of the second quarter, the company
began shipping mid-range servers using copper technology. In addition, revenue
from the company's enterprise storage products including Shark accelerated in
the second quarter showing growth for the second quarter and first six months of
2000 compared to year-ago periods. These increases were offset by lower revenue
from System/390, other storage products (specifically tape products) and AS/400.
Although System/390 revenue declined, computing power as measured in MIPS
(millions of instructions per second) increased 1 percent reversing the trend of
decline that started in the back half of 1999 and concluded with an 8 percent
decline in the first quarter of 2000. In the second quarter of 2000, the company
announced new models of the AS/400 which began shipping at the end of July 2000.
As a result, second-quarter revenue declined as customers awaited the
availability of the new models.

      Technology revenue increased for the second quarter and declined for the
six months of 2000 when compared with year-ago periods. The increase for the
second quarter was driven by strong growth in custom logic products partially
offset by lower revenue for HDDs, as a result of not shipping the company's new
10,000 RPM drives. The decline in revenue for the first six months of 2000 was
driven by lower HDD revenue, partially offset by strong revenue growth from
microelectronics products primarily custom logic chips.

      Personal Systems revenue declined for the second quarter and first six
months of 2000 versus the same periods in 1999 as the company continued to take
initiatives to improve long-term profitability. During the second quarter, the
company replaced or refreshed over 50 percent of its product offerings with new,
lower cost products that better match customers' needs. In addition, revenue was
affected by the constrained supply from one of the company's major suppliers of
planar boards used on the Netfinity and ThinkPad lines. The company is
aggressively addressing this problem and expects resolution by the end of the
third quarter of 2000.

      Hardware sales gross profit for the second quarter and first six months of
2000 decreased 9.8 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, from comparable
periods in 1999. The hardware gross profit margin decreased 1.5 points and 0.7
points, respectively, from the prior year although microelectronics gross profit
margin improved as a result of actions taken within the company's DRAM business
in 1999. Gross profit margins improved for the second quarter and first six
months of 2000 for AS/400 and Personal Systems products. These increases were
offset by lower gross profit margins associated with System/390, Web Server,
storage products and OEM storage technology. In addition, in the second quarter
of 2000, there was a shift away from server revenue towards microelectronics
which has a lower gross profit margin.

      Global Services revenue increased 2.4 percent and 1.3 percent,
respectively, in the second quarter and first six months of 2000, when compared
with the same periods of last year. Revenue was affected by two events: the sale
of the IBM Global Network to AT&T and a decline in Y2K services activity. After
adjusting for those factors, Global Services revenue (excluding maintenance)
increased 10 percent and 9 percent for the second quarter and first six months
of 2000 versus the same periods of 1999. Growth in Strategic Outsourcing
Services and Integrated Technology Services revenue in the second quarter and
first six months of 2000 was partially offset by lower revenue from Business
Innovation Services (primarily due to a decline in Y2K activity) and the sale of
the IBM Global Network. Maintenance revenue grew 1 percent in the second quarter
of 2000 and was flat for the first six months of 2000 when compared to the same
periods of 1999. New contract signings in the second quarter were over $20
billion and the

backlog is now at $75 billion. Those signings included 20 deals that
individually were valued at over $100 million and three deals individually
valued at over $1 billion.

      The company's discrete e-business services revenue grew very strongly in
the second quarter and first six months of 2000 when compared with the
year-earlier periods. The company continued to invest in the required skills and
capabilities by hiring 1,800 people to address e-business and high growth
offerings, while retraining almost 3,000 employees through its e-mobilization
efforts. In addition, the company has opened 12 of 16 e-business innovation
centers in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company continues to invest in the
development of solutions such as e-commerce, e-marketplaces and web hosting. The
company also provides more e-enablement by building and supporting customers'
web infrastructures and storage area networks.

      Global Services gross profit dollars decreased in the second quarter and
first six months of 2000 by 2.1 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, when
compared with year-ago periods. The decline in gross profit dollars and margin
was a result of lower utilization rates in Business Innovation Services and
Integrated Technology Services due to the rapid hiring and retraining the
company has been doing to rebalance its skills towards e-business. The
maintenance margin declined 1 point in the second quarter of 2000 and was flat
for the first six months of 2000 when compared to the same periods of 1999.

      Revenue from software for the second quarter and first six months of 2000
increased 1.7 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, over comparable periods in
1999. The company's middleware products (which comprise data management,
transaction processing, Tivoli systems management, and Lotus Notes messaging and
collaboration across both IBM and non-IBM platforms) had revenue growth of 7
percent and 6 percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months
of 2000 versus comparable periods of 1999. Middleware is the software that
powers the infrastructure of the company's e-business solutions. The company
continues to focus on helping customers use its software to transform their
businesses to e-businesses, particularly in collaboration with Global Services
and channel partners.

      Operating-systems software revenue declined 12 percent for the second
quarter and first six months of 2000, when compared with year-ago periods. The
decreases were primarily due to lower AS/400 software revenue as a result of
product transitions.

      Software gross profit dollars for the second quarter of 2000 increased 0.7
percent and were flat for the six months of 2000 versus the same periods in
1999. The increase in gross profit dollars in the second quarter of 2000 was due
to increased revenue and lower levels of amortization costs, partially offset by
higher services costs and vendor royalty payments. The year-to-date dynamics
reflected a similar pattern as the second quarter, except the services costs and
royalty payments more closely offset the increase in revenue and lower
amortization costs.

      Global Financing revenue increased 10.1 percent and 12.9 percent,
respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2000, when compared
with the same periods of 1999. The increases in revenue were primarily driven by
growth in used equipment sales and commercial financing.

      Global Financing gross profit dollars increased 9.4 percent and 9.5
percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2000,
versus the same periods of 1999. The increase in gross profit dollars was
primarily driven by higher sales of used equipment and an improving gross profit
margin on these sales. The gross profit margins declined 0.3 points and 1.7
points, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2000 versus
the same periods of 1999. The declines were primarily driven by the mix towards
more used equipment sales.

      Revenue from Enterprise Investments/Other decreased 25.9 percent and 19.5
percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2000,
versus comparable periods in 1999. The decreases were driven primarily by the
company's decision in 1999 to discontinue certain product lines such as
automated teller machines.

      The Enterprise Investments/Other gross profit dollars decreased 10.3
percent and increased 10.2 percent, respectively, in the second quarter and
first six months of 2000, versus the same periods of 1999. The decrease in the
second quarter of 2000 was primarily driven by lower revenue associated with
product lines discontinued in the second quarter of 1999. The increase in gross
profit dollars for the first six months of 2000 was primarily due to the shift
in mix of revenue to software products, which have a higher gross profit margin
than the hardware product lines the company discontinued in 1999.

      Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for the second quarter
and first six months of 2000 increased 35.9 percent and 11.7 percent,
respectively, from the same periods in 1999. The increases were driven by the
net benefit of $1,610 million associated with the sale of the IBM Global Network
and other actions taken in the second quarter of 1999. (See Note No. 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 7 through 9 for further information).
Excluding the 1999 actions, SG&A expense decreased 13.2 percent for the second
quarter of 2000 and 9.8 percent for the first six months of 2000 compared with
the same periods of 1999.

      The company continues to manage aggressively its infrastructure expense
and its overall portfolio to allow for investment in growth segments of the
business. The company remains focused on maintaining affordable expense levels.
The company continues to benefit from growth in licensing its intellectual
property, as well as lower expenses from the sale of the IBM Global Network and
actions taken in 1999 to exit businesses like networking hardware and DRAM.
Expense benefited from gains associated with asset sales related to the MiCRUS
semiconductor operations (See Note No. 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 9 for further information) and the sale of various parcels of
land. Commission and compensation related expenses in the second quarter of 2000
were lower in some of the business units reflecting their year-to-year dynamics,
particularly against a strong second quarter last year and the effect of
currency which also was a benefit to SG&A expense in both the second quarter and
first six months of 2000.

      Research, development and engineering expense decreased 1.8 percent and
1.3 percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2000,
when compared with the same periods of 1999.

      Interest on total borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries, which
includes interest expense and interest costs associated with rentals and
financing, amounted to $351 million and

$699 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2000, respectively.
Of these amounts, the company capitalized $8 million for the second quarter and
$15 million for the first six months of 2000.

      For the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, the company realized cost
and expense reductions of $762 million (as noted in Footnote W on pages 86-88 of
the 1999 IBM Annual Report) due to the funded status of its pension plans. Of
the total 1999 annual savings, the conversion to the amended U.S. pension plan,
the Personal Pension Account (PPA), which was announced in the second quarter of
1999, contributed an estimated $167 million. In 2000, the company continues to
benefit from the returns generated by its pension plan assets. Through the first
six months of 2000, the benefit was approximately $606 million which represented
an increase of $261 million over the same period in 1999, with only $20 million
of the increase due to the PPA conversion. These cost and expense reductions
were offset by other salary and benefit increases. Future effects of pension
plans on the operating results of the company depend on economic conditions and
investment performance.

      The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2000, was 30.0
percent versus 40.8 percent for the same period in 1999 (or 30.0 percent after
excluding 10.8 points due to the IBM Global Network sale and other
second-quarter actions taken by the company in 1999).

      The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2000 was 30.0 percent
versus 37.1 percent for the same period in 1999. The 7.1 point decrease from the
1999 rate was primarily a result of the same factors that affected the second
quarter effective tax rate.

Financial Condition

      During the first half of 2000, the company continued to make significant
investments to fund its future growth and increase shareholder value. These
investments included expenditures of $2,688 million for Research, development
and engineering, $2,372 million for Plant, rental machines and other property
and $3,906 million for the repurchase of the company's common shares. The
company had $3,261 million in Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable
securities at June 30, 2000.

Financial Condition - (continued)

      Cash flows from operating activities in the first half of 2000 declined
$1,035 million from the 1999 period primarily due to tax payments made in 2000
relating to the sale of the IBM Global Network in 1999.

      Cash flows from investing activities declined $1,935 million from the
comparable 1999 period. The 1999 period included the proceeds from the sale of
the IBM Global Network partially offset by payments to purchase marketable
securities and other investments. Payments for plant, rental machines and other
property net of proceeds declined $584 million from the 1999 period.

      Cash flows from financing activities increased $759 million due primarily
to an increase in debt financing in the first half of 2000.

      Current assets declined $3,718 million from year-end 1999 with decreases
of $2,570 million in Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities, $1,417
million in accounts receivable ($253 million in Notes and accounts receivable
and $1,164 million in Sales-type leases receivable) and $109 million in
Inventories offset by an increase of $378 million in Prepaid expenses and other
current assets. The decrease in Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable
securities resulted primarily from capital expenditures and stock repurchases
partially offset by cash generated from operations and the net proceeds from the
issuances of debt and the disposition of marketable securities and other
investments. The decline in accounts receivable is attributable to the
collection of traditionally higher year-end accounts receivable balances.
Inventory declines primarily resulted from inventory reductions within the
Enterprise Systems and Technology Groups. The increase in Prepaid expenses and
other current assets reflects seasonal increases from year-end levels.

      Current liabilities declined $5,716 million with declines of $2,699
million in Accounts payable and accruals (resulting primarily from seasonal
declines in these balances from their normally higher year-end levels), $1,915
million in Short-term debt and $1,102 million in Taxes payable primarily due to
a large tax payment made in the first quarter of 2000, relating to the IBM
Global Network sale in 1999.

Investments

      During the first half of 2000, the company invested $2,372 million in
Plant, rental machines and other property, a decline of $493 million from the
comparable 1999 period. The company's investments were in its services business,
primarily in the management of customers' information technology, as well as in
manufacturing capacity for HDDs and microelectronics.

      In addition to software development expense included in Research,
development and engineering expense, the company capitalized $262 million of
software costs (both internal use and licensed programs) during the first half
of 2000, an increase of $53 million from the comparable period in 1999.
Amortization of capitalized software costs was $220 million during the first
half of 2000, an increase of $17 million from the comparable 1999 period.

      Investments and sundry assets were $26,138 million at June 30, 2000, an
increase of $51 million from year-end 1999, resulting primarily from increases
in non-current sales-type lease receivables and prepaid pension assets offset by
decreases in alliance investments and non-current customer loan receivables and
installment receivables.

      Total debt increased $820 million from year-end 1999 as non-global
financing debt increased $932 million and debt supporting the growth in global
financing assets decreased $112 million. Stockholders' equity declined $1,337
million from December 31, 1999, resulting primarily from the common share
repurchases and the decrease in the accumulated gains and losses not affecting
retained earnings partially offset by the increase in retained earnings.

election of directors to be held as soon thereafter as convenient and give
notice thereof as provided in these By-laws in respect of the notice of an
annual meeting of the stockholders. At such special meeting the stockholders may
elect the directors and transact other business with the same force and effect
as at an annual meeting of the stockholders duly called and held.

      SECTION 3. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the stockholders, unless
otherwise provided by law, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the
Board or by the Board.

      SECTION 4. Notice of Meetings. Notice of each meeting of the stockholders,

Vice Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President or the

reason of any action proposed to be taken at such meeting, would be entitled to
have their stock appraised if such action were taken, not less than ten or more

at any such meeting or any adjournment or adjournments thereof, a majority in
voting interest of those present in person or represented by proxy and entitled
to vote thereat, or, in the absence of all the stockholders, any officer
entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, such meeting, may adjourn
such meeting from time to time without further notice, other than by
announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment shall be taken, until a

Chairmen of the Board shall be absent therefrom, an Executive Vice President, or
if the Chairman of the Board, the President, all Vice Chairmen of the Board and

(ii) otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, or (iii) a proper subject for the meeting which is timely submitted

      For business to be properly submitted by a stockholder before any annual
meeting under subparagraph (iii) above, a stockholder must give timely notice in
writing of such business to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be considered
timely, a stockholder's notice must be received by the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 120 calendar days
nor more than 150 calendar days before the date of the Corporation's proxy
statement released to stockholders in connection with the prior year's annual
meeting.

However, if no annual meeting was held in the previous year, or if the date of
the applicable annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the
date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, a
stockholder's notice must be received by the Secretary not later than 60 days
before the date the Corporation commences mailing of its proxy materials in
connection with the applicable annual meeting.

      A stockholder's notice to the Secretary to submit business to an annual
meeting of stockholders shall set forth: (i) the name and address of the
stockholder, (ii) the number of shares of stock held of record and beneficially
by such stockholder, (iii) the name in which all such shares of stock are
registered on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, (iv) a representation
that the stockholder intends to appear at the meeting in person or by proxy to
submit the business specified in such notice, (v) a brief description of the
business desired to be submitted to the annual meeting, including the complete
text of any resolutions intended to be presented at the annual meeting, and the
reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (vi) any personal or
other material interest of the stockholder in the business to be submitted, and
(vii) all other information relating to the proposed business which may be
required to be disclosed under applicable law. In addition, a stockholder
seeking to submit such business at the meeting shall promptly provide any other
information reasonably requested by the Corporation.

      The chairman of the meeting shall determine all matters relating to the
efficient conduct of the meeting, including, but not limited to, the items of
business, as well as the maintenance of order and decorum. The chairman shall,
if the facts warrant, determine and declare that any putative business was not
properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed
by this Section 7, in which case such business shall not be transacted.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7, a stockholder
who seeks to have any proposal included in the Corporation's proxy materials
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under Regulation 14A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

      SECTION 8. Voting. Except as otherwise provided by law, each holder of
record of shares of stock of the Corporation having voting power shall be
entitled at each meeting of the stockholders to one vote for every share of such
stock standing in the stockholder's name on the record of stockholders of the
Corporation:

      (a) on the date fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 of Article
VII of these By-laws as the record date for the determination of the
stockholders who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting, or


                                       4
<PAGE>

      (b) if such record date shall not have been so fixed, then at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of such meeting shall
have been given, or

      (c) if such record date shall not have been so fixed and if no notice of
such meeting shall have been given, then at the time of the call to order of
such meeting.

      Any vote on stock of the Corporation at any meeting of the stockholders
may be given by the stockholder of record entitled thereto in person or by proxy
appointed by such stockholder or by the stockholder's attorney thereunto duly
authorized and delivered or transmitted to the secretary of such meeting at or
prior to the time designated in the order of business for turning in proxies. At
all meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum shall be present, all matters
(except where otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-laws) shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting interest of
the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote
thereat. Unless required by law, or determined by the chairman of the meeting to
be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by ballot. On a vote by
ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by the
stockholder's proxy as such, if there be such proxy.

      SECTION 9. List of Stockholders. A list, certified by the Secretary, of
the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote shall be produced at any
meeting of the stockholders upon the request of any stockholder of the
Corporation pursuant to the provisions of applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-laws.

      SECTION 10. Inspectors of Election. Prior to the holding of each annual or
special meeting of the stockholders, two inspectors of election to serve thereat
shall be appointed by the Board, or, if the Board shall not have made such
appointment, by the Chairman of the Board. If there shall be a failure to
appoint inspectors, or if, at any such meeting, any inspector so appointed shall
be absent or shall fail to act or the office shall become vacant, the chairman
of the meeting may, and at the request of a stockholder present in person and
entitled to vote at such meeting shall, appoint such inspector or inspectors of
election, as the case may be, to act thereat. The inspectors of election so
appointed to act at any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the
discharge of their duties, shall be sworn faithfully to execute the duties of
inspectors at such meeting, with strict impartiality and according to the best
of their ability, and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. Such
inspectors of election shall take charge of the polls, and, after the voting on
any question, shall make a certificate of the results of the vote taken. No
director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector of an
election of directors. Inspectors need not be stockholders.

Committee or until the earlier termination as a director. The Chief Executive
Officer shall always be designated as a member of the Executive Committee. The
Board may by resolution appoint one member as the Chairman of the Executive

said Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer shall preside at all such meetings.

Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board shall preside at all such meetings.

of the Executive Committee present shall choose a chairman to preside at such
meetings. The Secretary, or if the Secretary shall be absent from such meeting,
any person appointed by the chairman, shall act as secretary of the meeting and
keep the minutes thereof.

      SECTION 2. Powers of the Executive Committee. To the extent permitted by
law, the Executive Committee may exercise all the powers of the Board in the
management of specified matters where such authority is delegated to it by the
Board, and also, to the extent permitted by law, the Executive Committee shall
have, and may exercise, all the powers of the Board in the management of the
business and affairs of the Corporation (including the power to authorize the
seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but
excluding the power to appoint a member of the Executive Committee) in such
manner as the Executive Committee shall deem to be in the best interests of the
Corporation and not inconsistent with any prior specific action of the Board. An
act of the Executive Committee taken within the scope of its authority shall be
an act of the Board. The Executive Committee shall render in the form of minutes
a report of its several acts at each regular meeting of the Board and at any
other time when so directed by the Board.

members of the Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business, and the act of a majority of the members of the Executive Committee
present at a meeting at which a quorum shall be present shall be the act of the
Executive Committee. Participating in a meeting by means of a conference
telephone or similar communications equipment allowing all persons participating
in the meeting to hear each other shall constitute presence at a meeting of the
Executive Committee. The members of the Executive Committee shall act only as a
committee and individual members shall have no power as such.

      SECTION 5. Other Committees. The Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, designate members of the Board to constitute other
committees, which shall have, and may exercise, such powers as the Board may by
resolution delegate to them, and shall in each case consist of such number of
directors as the Board may determine; provided, however, that each such
committee shall have at least three directors as members thereof. Such a
committee may either be constituted for a specified term or may be constituted
as a standing committee which does not require annual or periodic
reconstitution. A majority of all the members of any such committee may
determine its action and its quorum requirements and may fix the time and place
of its meetings, unless the Board shall otherwise provide. Participating in a
meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment
allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other shall
constitute presence at a meeting of such other committees.

      In addition to the foregoing, the Board may, by resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, create a committee of indeterminate membership and
duration and not subject to the limitations as to the membership, quorum and
manner of meeting and acting prescribed in these By-laws, which committee, in
the event of a major disaster or catastrophe or national emergency which renders
the Board


                                       9
<PAGE>

incapable of action by reason of the death, physical incapacity or inability to
meet of some or all of its members, shall have, and may exercise all the powers
of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation
(including, without limitation, the power to authorize the seal of the
Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it and the power to
fill vacancies in the Board). An act of such committee taken within the scope of
its authority shall be an act of the Board.

      SECTION 6. Changes in Committees; Resignations; Removals; Vacancies. The
Board shall have power, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, at any
time to change or remove the members of, to fill vacancies in, and to discharge
any committee created pursuant to these By-laws, either with or without cause.
Any member of any such committee may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Board or the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary. Such resignation
shall take effect upon receipt of such notice or at any later time specified
therein; and, unless otherwise specified therein, acceptance of such resignation
shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any vacancy in any committee,
whether arising from death, resignation, an increase in the number of committee
members or any other cause, shall be filled by the Board in the manner
prescribed in these By-laws for the original appointment of the members of such
committee.

institution, or from any firm, corporation or individual, and for such loans and

Corporation or any other corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign,
or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, for which any director or officer of the Corporation served in any
capacity at the request of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such
person or such person's testator or intestate was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or served such other corporation, partnership, joint


                                       15
<PAGE>

venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity,
against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses,
including attorneys' fees actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such
action or proceeding, or any appeal therein. Such indemnification shall be a
contract right and shall include the right to be paid advances of any expenses
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding,
consistent with the provisions of applicable law in effect at any time.
Indemnification shall be deemed to be 'permitted' within the meaning of the

      SECTION 1. Stock Certificates. The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, or shall be uncertificated shares. Each owner of
stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, in such form
as shall be approved by the Board, certifying the number of shares of stock of
the Corporation owned. To the extent that shares are represented by
certificates, such certificates of stock shall be signed in the name of the
Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or a Vice Chairman of the Board or the
President or a Vice President and by the Secretary and sealed with the seal of
the Corporation (which seal may be a facsimile, engraved or printed); provided,
however, that where any such certificate is signed by a registrar, other than
the Corporation or its employee, the signatures of the Chairman of the Board, a
Vice Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary, and transfer agent or
a transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation upon such certificates may
be facsimiles, engraved or printed. In case any officer, transfer agent or
transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation ceases to be such officer,
transfer agent, or transfer clerk before such certificates shall be issued, they
may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if they
were still such officer, transfer agent or transfer clerk at the date of their
issue.

      SECTION 2. Books of Account and Record of Stockholders. There shall be
kept at the office of the Corporation correct books of account of all its
business and transactions, minutes of the proceedings of stockholders, Board,
and Executive Committee, and a book to be known as the record of stockholders,
containing the names and addresses of all persons who are stockholders, the
number of shares of stock held, and the date when the stockholder became the
owner of record thereof.

      SECTION 3. Transfers of Stock. Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made on the record of stockholders of the Corporation only
upon authorization by the registered holder thereof, or by an attorney thereunto
authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary or
with a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and on surrender of the certificate or
certificates for such shares properly endorsed, provided such shares are
represented by a certificate, or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer
power and the payment of all taxes thereon. The person in whose names shares of
stock shall stand on the


                                       16
<PAGE>

record of stockholders of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for
all purposes as regards the Corporation. Whenever any transfers of shares shall
be made for collateral security and not absolutely and written notice thereof
shall be given to the Secretary or to such transfer agent or transfer clerk,
such fact shall be stated in the entry of the transfer.

      SECTION 4. Regulations. The Board may make such additional rules and
regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-laws,
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificated or
uncertificated shares of stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize
any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents or one or more
transfer clerks and one or more registrars and may require all certificates of
stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

      SECTION 5. Fixing of Record Date. The Board shall fix a time not exceeding
sixty nor less than ten days prior to the date then fixed for the holding of any
meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
dissent of the stockholders may be effectively expressed for any purpose without
a meeting, as the time as of which the stockholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at such meeting or whose consent or dissent is required or may be expressed
for any purpose, as the case may be, shall be determined, and all persons who
were holders of record of voting stock at such time, and no others, shall be
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent, as the case may be. The Board may fix a time not exceeding sixty days
preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making of any
distribution or the allotment of rights to subscribe for securities of the
Corporation, or for the delivery of evidences of rights or evidences of
interests arising out of any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock or
other securities, as the record date for the determination of the stockholders
entitled to receive any such dividend, distribution, allotment, rights or
interests, and in such case only the stockholders of record at the time so fixed
shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, allotment, rights or
interests.

      SECTION 6. Lost, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates. The holder of any
certificate representing shares of stock of the Corporation shall immediately
notify the Corporation of any loss, destruction or mutilation of such
certificate, and the Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued by it which the owner thereof shall
allege to have been lost or destroyed or which shall have been mutilated, and
the Corporation may, in its discretion, require such owner or the owner's legal
representatives to give to the Corporation a bond in such sum, limited or
unlimited, and in such form and with such surety or sureties as the Board in its
absolute discretion shall determine, to indemnify the Corporation against any
claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss or destruction
of any such certificate, or the issuance of such new certificate. Anything to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation, in its absolute discretion, may
refuse to issue any such new certificate, except pursuant to legal proceedings
under the laws of the State of New York.

      SECTION 7. Inspection of Records. The record of stockholders and minutes
of the proceedings of stockholders shall be available for inspection, within the
limits and subject to the conditions and restrictions prescribed by applicable
law.

      SECTION 8. Auditors. The Board shall employ an independent public or
certified public accountant or firm of such accountants who shall act as
auditors in making examinations of the consolidated financial statements of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. The auditors shall certify that the annual financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and shall
report on such financial statements to the stockholders and directors of the
Corporation. The Board's selection of auditors shall be presented for
ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting. Directors and officers,
when acting in good faith, may rely upon financial statements of the Corporation
represented to them to be correct by the officer of the Corporation having
charge of its books of account, or stated in a written report by the auditors
fairly to reflect the financial condition of the Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws or any resolution of the Board or
any committee thereof, the Corporation or the Board or any committee thereof is
authorized to take any action after notice to the stockholders, directors or
members of any such committee, or after the lapse of a prescribed period of
time, such action may be taken without notice and without the lapse of any
period of time, if, at any time before or after such action shall be completed,
such notice or lapse of time shall be waived by the person or persons entitled
to said notice or entitled to participate in


                                       18
<PAGE>

the action to be taken, or, in the case of a stockholder, by an attorney
thereunto authorized. Attendance at a meeting requiring notice by any person or,
in the case of a stockholder, by the stockholder's attorney, agent or proxy,
shall constitute a waiver of such notice on the part of the person so attending,
or by such stockholder, as the case may be.

                                    ARTICLE X

      These By-laws may be amended or repealed or new By-laws may be adopted by

Stock options to purchase 25,390,405 shares and 287,300 shares were outstanding
as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise price
during the respective periods was greater than the average market price of the
common shares and, therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive. In
addition, 3,031,183 restricted stock units as of June 30, 1999 relating to the
company's Long-Term Performance Plan were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share as their effect would have been antidilutive. Net
income applicable to common shareholders excludes preferred stock dividends of
$5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999.

Stock options to purchase 24,542,800 shares and 417,500 shares were outstanding
as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise price
during the respective periods was greater than the average market price of the
common shares, and therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive. In
addition, 2,953,924 restricted stock units as of June 30, 1999 relating to the
company's Long-Term Performance Plan were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share as their effect would have been antidilutive. Net
income applicable to common shareholders excludes preferred stock dividends of
$10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999.

million, respectively, representing the pre-tax income that would be required to
cover those dividend requirements based on the company's effective tax rate for
the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999.
