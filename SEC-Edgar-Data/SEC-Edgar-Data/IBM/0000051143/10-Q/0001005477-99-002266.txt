Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. In the opinion of the management of International Business Machines
Corporation (the company), all adjustments necessary to a fair statement of the
results for the unaudited three month periods have been made.

2. The accumulated gains and losses not affecting retained earnings line of
stockholders' equity comprises foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. Net earnings and
accumulated gains and losses not affecting retained earnings were $906 million
and $949 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

3. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities." This statement establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments. It requires an entity to recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and to measure those instruments at fair value. Additionally, the fair
value adjustments will affect either stockholders' equity or net income
depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge and, if so,
the nature of the hedging activity. The company will adopt this standard as of
January 1, 2000. Management does not expect the adoption to have a material
effect on the company's results of operations, however, the effect on the
company's financial position depends on the fair values of the company's
derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of adoption.

4. The tables on pages 21 and 22 of this Form 10-Q reflect the results of the
company's segments consistent with the company's management system. These
results are not necessarily a depiction that is in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, e.g., employee retirement plan costs are
developed using actuarial assumptions on a country-by-country basis and
allocated to the segments on headcount. A different result could be arrived at
for any segment if actuarial assumptions unique to each segment were used.
Performance measurement is based on income before income taxes (pre-tax income).
These results are used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the
performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

5. Subsequent Events: On April 27, 1999, the stockholders of the company
approved amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number
of authorized shares of common stock from 1,875 million to 4,687.5 million,
which was required to effect a two-for-one stock split that the company's Board
of Directors approved on January 26, 1999. In addition, the amendments reduced
the par value of the common shares from $.50 to $.20 per share. Common
stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 1999 are entitled to
receive one additional share for each share held.

      The Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q have been adjusted
to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

      On April 27, 1999, the company announced that the Board of Directors
approved a quarterly dividend increase of 9 percent from $.22 to $.24 per common
share or $.12 per common share after the two-for-one stock split. The dividend
is payable June 10, 1999, to shareholders of record May 10, 1999.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)

      On April 27, 1999, the Board of Directors also authorized the company to
repurchase up to an additional $3.5 billion of IBM common shares. The company
plans to repurchase the shares in the open market from time to time, based on
market conditions.

      On April 30, 1999, IBM sold its U.S. Global Network business to AT&T. This
sale is part of a broader agreement announced in December 1998 under which AT&T
will acquire IBM's Global Network business for $5 billion in cash. The company
expects the sales of the non-U.S. portion of the business to take place
throughout the remainder of 1999. More than 2,900 IBM employees will join AT&T
as a result of the sale of the U.S. business. In addition to the sale, IBM and
AT&T have agreed to enter into outsourcing contracts with each other. The
company will outsource a significant portion of its global networking needs to
AT&T. AT&T will outsource certain applications processing and data center
management to the company.

      In response to its changing workforce and the competitive environment in
which it operates, the company announced amendments to its U.S. retirement plan,
its U.S. supplemental executive retirement plan, and the U.S. retiree medical
plan (the Plans). The amendments were announced on May 3, 1999 and are effective
July 1, 1999, do not have a significant effect on the projected benefit
obligations of the Plans.

ITEM 2.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                    FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,1999

      The company's first-quarter results reflect significant improvement in its
Asian business and double-digit revenue growth in Europe and the Americas. The
company's operating results were led by services and software which together
produced 60 percent of the company's gross profits for the quarter. The Personal
Systems group also had substantially improved results this quarter, due to the
changes in its business model during the past year and continued strong sales
growth. The company continued to move forward its strategy to reposition the
S/390 with an increase of more than 80 percent in MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) shipments in the first quarter. Also within servers, AS/400 and
RS/6000 revenues declined due to product transitions. The Technology group
results were mixed, with growth in hard disk drives (HDD) offset by continued
weakness in memory chips.

      While the company had a strong first quarter, there are a number of
uncertainties facing the company in the remainder of 1999 including ongoing
weakness in some parts of Asia and Latin America; continued price pressure in
personal computers, HDDs and semiconductors; and the unknown effect of the Year
2000 issue on customer purchases. The company will continue to focus on
increasing revenue with particular emphasis on addressing customers' needs to
build integrated e-business solutions through the use of the company's hardware,
services, software and technology. In addition, the company continues to invest
judiciously, reduce infrastructure and optimize the deployment of the company's
employees and resources to maintain or improve its pre-tax profits.

      As a result of the company's share repurchase program, the average number
of common shares outstanding was lower by 76.6 million than the first quarter in
1998. The average number of shares outstanding in the quarter was 1,823.8
million compared with 1,900.4 million in the first quarter of 1998. There were
1,814.8 million shares outstanding at March 31, 1999.

      Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 1999 increased 15.3 percent
or about 14 percent on a constant currency basis. Services revenue remained
strong and software continued its momentum as middleware continued its strong
growth. Hardware revenue grew more than 17 percent, due in part to strong sales
of personal computers. The G5 models of the S/390 shipped nearly twice as many
MIPS in the quarter as last year.

      Revenue for the quarter from the company's end-user business totaled $8.8
billion from the Americas (formerly reported as U.S., Canada and Latin America).
This represents an increase of 12.5 percent (about 14 percent in constant
currency) compared with the first quarter of 1998. Revenue from Europe/Middle
East/Africa (EMEA) was $6.3 billion, up 20.0 percent (about 18 percent in
constant currency). Revenue from Asia-Pacific increased 20.2 percent (about 13
percent in constant currency) to $3.5 billion. Original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) revenue across all geographies totaled $1.8 billion in the first quarter
of 1999, a 5.2 percent increase (about 5 percent in constant currency) compared
with the year-earlier period.

      The overall gross profit margin was 35.7 percent in the first quarter
compared with 36.6 percent in the first quarter of last year. The decline in
gross profit margin continues to reflect the changing mix of the company's
business to services, and a decline in margins in the company's hardware
business related to a shift from servers to personal computers which have a
lower gross profit margin.

      Total expenses increased 4.7 percent compared with last year's first
quarter. The company's expense-to-revenue ratio improved 2.6 points over the
first quarter of 1998 to 25.4 percent.

      The company's tax rate was 30.0 percent in the first quarter compared with
32.0 percent in the year-earlier period as the company continued to benefit from
generating increased profit in markets with lower effective tax rates.

      Revenue from hardware sales increased 17.3 percent (about 16 percent on a
constant currency basis) for the first quarter of 1999 compared with the first
quarter of 1998.

      Technology revenue increased slightly in the first quarter of 1999, versus
the comparable period in 1998. The increase was driven by growth in HDD storage
products, storage tape products and custom logic products. That growth was
partially offset by lower semiconductor revenue, primarily due to lower dynamic
random access memory (DRAM) prices year over year. Although DRAM prices were
down over 40 percent from the first quarter of 1998, prices have stabilized
since the fourth quarter of 1998. The company continues to evaluate alternatives
to mitigate the effect of memory price pressures on its results. These
alternatives include realigning alliance structures, rebalancing sources of
supply and redirecting product focus.

      During the first quarter of 1999 the company signed two major technology
contracts. Dell Computers signed a seven year contract valued at $16 billion for
the purchase of personal computer parts from the company. The company also
entered into a five-year strategic technology and business alliance with EMC
Corporation valued at $3 billion.

      Despite pricing pressures, Personal Systems revenue had very strong growth
in the first quarter of 1999 when compared with the same quarter last year. The
increase was driven by higher revenue for both commercial and consumer personal
computers and a richer mix to mobile and server products. The company introduced
new models across its brands - ThinkPads, commercial desk tops, Aptivas,
workstations and Netfinity servers. With respect to direct channel sales, the
company continued to add to its build-to-order manufacturing capability. The
company further expanded its colocation program which enables channel partners
to improve their inventory turnover and continues to work with its channel
partners to further expand its advanced fulfillment initiative.

      Server revenue declined slightly in the first quarter of 1999 versus the
first quarter of 1998. The decline was driven by lower revenue from AS/400 and
RS/6000 products, partially offset by increased revenue from S/390 servers. New
AS/400 mid-range products with Northstar technology, which doubled the
performance of these models, were introduced late in the first quarter of 1999
and sales volumes increased significantly while RS/6000 products showed strong
revenue growth in Asia and Europe. These increases were more than offset by
lower revenue in North America. The S/390 products are increasingly being used
in e-business, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and business intelligence. In
addition, the total delivery of computing power increased over 80 percent as
measured in MIPS versus the first quarter of last year.

      Hardware gross profit dollars increased 11.2 percent in the first quarter
of 1999 from the comparable period in 1998, primarily due to the strong recovery
of the personal systems business. The change in mix between personal systems and
servers had a negative effect on the gross profit margin. DRAM prices and price
pressures on HDD products also had a negative effect on gross profit margin.

      Global Services revenue increased 19.1 percent (about 18 percent on a
constant currency basis) compared with the first quarter of 1998. The increase
in revenue was driven by strong growth in strategic outsourcing, systems
integration and product support services across all geographies. These increases
were partially offset by lower revenue associated with maintenance offerings. In
the first quarter, new contract signings amounted to $9.8 billion. Most of those
contracts are for strategic outsourcing agreements and involve a full spectrum
of the company's services and product offerings. Those signings include the
outsourcing agreement between the company and AT&T as discussed on page seven of
this document.

The company recently announced new service offerings that help small and
medium-sized businesses as well as Fortune 500 companies create value from
e-business. These offerings will create websites that help customers improve
their competitiveness. Some offerings support software that integrates commerce
websites with back-end systems and corporate data.

      Services gross profit dollars increased in the first quarter by 15.9
percent when compared with the year-ago period. The gross profit margin decline
was a result of services, which has a lower gross profit margin than
maintenance, becoming a larger percentage of the total Global Services gross
profit than in the comparable quarter of 1998. The gross profit margins for
services and maintenance individually were flat year over year.

      Revenue from software grew 10.4 percent (about 9 percent on a constant
currency basis) in the first quarter of 1999 versus the same period in 1998. The
growth reflects the company's continued emphasis on growing its middleware
business across IBM and non-IBM platforms. Middleware products comprise data
management, transaction processing, Tivoli systems management, and Lotus Notes
messaging and collaboration. Middleware is a key component of the company's
e-business solutions.

      In addition, operating-systems software revenue also showed growth,
primarily in S/390 and RS/6000 offerings. S/390 software revenue is generated
from recurring license charges on the entire install base of IBM and non-IBM
MIPS capacity. Thus, growth in the install base over the past three quarters
drives increased recurring license fees.

      Software gross profit dollars for the first quarter of 1999 increased 12.4
percent versus the same quarter of 1998. The improvement in gross profit dollars
was due to lower levels of amortization costs associated with previously
deferred development spending. The improvement will level out over the next
three quarters.

Results of Operations - (continued)

      Global Financing revenue declined 1.9 percent (about 3 percent on a
constant currency basis) in the first quarter of 1999 versus the same period in
1998. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower used equipment
sales, due to lease extensions. The decrease was partially offset by higher
financing income primarily in North America and EMEA. Financing originations
increased nearly 20 percent in the quarter to $9.5 billion, with more growth in
commercial financing than in customer financing.

      Global Financing gross profit dollars increased 16.2 percent versus the
first quarter of 1998. The increase was driven by lower cost of borrowing and by
Global Financing's increased use of the company's Global Treasury Centers rather
than external banks as a funding source.

      Revenue from Enterprise Investments/Other decreased 6.4 percent (about 8
percent on a constant currency basis) in the first quarter of 1999 versus the

Results of Operations - (continued)

      Selling, general and administrative expense increased 5.8 percent from
first quarter 1998. The increase was primarily driven by expenses associated
with growth areas like e-business (that is, expenses associated with the
company's own web-related sales), additional sales people for software and
commissions associated with the strong quarterly sales. The company continues to
aggressively manage infrastructure expense and its overall portfolio to allow
for investment in growth segments of the business.

      Research, development and engineering expense was essentially flat for the
first quarter of 1999 when compared with the same period of 1998.

      Interest on total borrowings of the company and its subsidiaries, which
includes interest expense and interest costs associated with rentals and
financing, amounted to $363 million for the first quarter of 1999. Of this
amount, $4 million was capitalized.

      The effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 1999 was 30.0
percent versus 32.0 percent for the same period in 1998. The company continued
to benefit from generating increased profit in markets with lower effective tax
rates.

Financial Condition

      The company continued to make significant investments during the first
quarter to fund its future growth and enhance shareholder value. These include
expenditures of $1.3 billion for research, development and engineering, $1.1
billion in plant, rental machines and other property and $2.1 billion for the
repurchase of the company's common shares. The company had $5.4 billion in cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities at March 31, 1999.

      Current assets declined $2.6 billion from year-end 1998 with declines of
$2.5 billion in accounts receivable and $.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents,
and marketable securities, offset by an increase of $.3 billion in prepaid
expenses. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
resulted primarily from the stock repurchases and capital expenditures, offset
by cash generated from operations and debt financing. The decline in accounts
receivable was attributable to the collection of typically higher year-end
accounts receivable balances, while prepaid expenses reflect the seasonal
increases from year-end levels.

      Current liabilities declined $3.5 billion, reflecting declines of $3.0
billion in payables and accruals (resulting primarily from seasonal declines in
these balances from their typically higher year-end levels), $.3 billion in
taxes, and $.2 billion in short-term debt.

Investments

      During the first three months of 1999, the company continued to invest in
its rapidly growing services business, primarily in the management of customers'
information technology, as well as in manufacturing capacity for hard disk
drives and microelectronics. The company's capital investment for plant, rental
machines and other property was $1.1 billion during the first quarter of 1999, a
decrease of $.1 billion from the comparable 1998 period.

      In addition to software development expense included in research,
development and engineering expense, the company capitalized $.1 billion of
software product costs during the first three months of both 1999 and 1998.
Amortization of capitalized software product costs was $.1 billion during the
first three months of 1999, a slight decline from the comparable 1998 period.

      Investments and sundry assets were $22.5 billion at March 31, 1999, a
decrease of $1.0 billion from year-end 1998, resulting primarily from decreases
in non-current sales-type lease receivables and notes, and deferred tax assets.

      Total debt increased $.6 billion from year-end 1998, as non-global
financing debt increased $1.1 billion, and debt in support of global financing
assets declined $.5 billion. Stockholders' equity declined $1.1 billion from
December 31, 1998, as the increase in the company's retained earnings was more
than offset by the common share repurchases.

Liquidity

      The company maintains a $10.0 billion committed global credit facility as
part of its ongoing efforts to ensure appropriate levels of liquidity. As of
March 31, 1999, $8.8 billion of this confirmed line of credit remained unused
and available for future use.

      On February 1, 1999, the company issued $600 million of 5 3/8% notes due
February 1, 2009. The net proceeds from the issuance of this debt was used for
general corporate purposes.

      At March 31, 1999, the company had an outstanding balance of $.9 billion
in assets under management from the securitization of loans, leases and trade
receivables.

Year 2000

      The "Year 2000 issue" arises because many computer hardware and software
systems use only two digits to represent the year. As a result, these systems
and programs may not process dates beyond 1999, which may cause errors in
information or systems failures. Assessments of the potential effects of the
Year 2000 issues vary markedly among different companies, governments,
consultants, economists and commentators, and it is not possible to predict what
the actual impact may be. Given this uncertainty, the company recognizes the
need to remain vigilant and is continuing its analysis, assessment, conversion
and contingency planning for the various Year 2000 issues, across its business.


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

Year 2000 - (continued)

      With respect to its internal systems, the potential Year 2000 impacts
extend beyond the company's information technology systems to its manufacturing
and development systems and physical facilities. The company has been addressing
these issues using the same five-part methodology it recommends to its
customers: (1) assessment and strategy; (2) detailed analysis and planning; (3)
implementation; (4) maintaining readiness of converted systems; and (5) Project
Office Management. The company has completed most conversion and testing
efforts, with extended system integration testing and contingency planning
projects scheduled throughout 1999. The company estimates that at the conclusion
of its various Year 2000 efforts, including conversion, testing and contingency
planning, it will have spent a total of approximately $575 million over a
multi-year period. Although the company believes its efforts will be successful,
any failure or delay could result in the disruption of business and in the
company incurring substantial expense. To minimize any such potential impact,
the company has initiated a global contingency planning effort designed to
support critical business operations.

      As part of its ordinary course product development efforts, the company's
current product and service offerings have been designed to be Year 2000 ready.
The Year 2000 readiness of the company's customers varies, and the company
continues actively to encourage its customers to prepare their own systems,
making available a broad array of product, service and educational offerings to
assist them (see the IBM Year 2000 Home Page at
http://www.ibm.com/IBM/year2000/). Efforts by customers to address Year 2000
issues may absorb a substantial part of their information technology budgets in
the near term, and customers may either delay or accelerate the deployment and
implementation of new applications and systems. While this behavior may increase
demand for certain of the company's products and services, including its Year
2000 offerings, it could also soften demand for other offerings or change
customer buying practices from past trends. These events could affect the
company's revenues or change its revenue patterns.

      The company is continuing its assessment of the Year 2000 readiness of its
key suppliers in an effort to establish that the company has adequate resources
for required supplies and components. With respect to third-party products the
company may remarket or provide with the company's offerings (such as
third-party software pre-loaded on the company's personal computers), the
company relies on its business partners and other third parties to be
responsible for the Year 2000 readiness of their offerings. A failure of the
company's suppliers, business partners and other third parties to address
adequately their Year 2000 readiness could affect the company's business. As
part of its contingency planning efforts, the company is identifying alternate
sources or strategies where necessary if significant exposures are identified.

      Further, some commentators believe that a significant amount of litigation
will arise from Year 2000 issues. The company continues to believe that it has
good defenses to any such claims brought against it.

      Finally, the Year 2000 presents a number of other risks and uncertainties
that could affect the company, including utilities and telecommunication
failures, competition for personnel skilled in the resolution of Year 2000
issues, and the nature of government responses to the issues,


                                      -16-

Year 2000 - (continued)

among others. While the company continues to believe that the Year 2000 matters
discussed above will not have a material impact on its business, financial
condition or results of operations, it remains uncertain whether or to what
extent the company may be affected.

      The Year 2000 statements set forth above are designated as "Year 2000
Readiness Disclosures" pursuant to the Year 2000 Information and Readiness
Disclosure ACT (P.L. 105-271).

in the computation of diluted earnings because the options' exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common shares, and therefore, the
effect would have been antidilutive. Net income applicable to common
shareholders excludes preferred stock dividends of $5 million for the periods
ended March 31, 1999 and 1998.
