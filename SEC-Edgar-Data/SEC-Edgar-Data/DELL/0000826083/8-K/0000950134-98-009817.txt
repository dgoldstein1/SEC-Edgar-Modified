ITEM 8 -- CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR.

         On December 11, 1998, the Board of Directors of Dell Computer
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), approved a change in the
Company's fiscal year from the Sunday closest to January 31 to the Friday
closest to January 31. This change will be effective for the current fiscal year
ending in 1999. Consequently, the Company's current fiscal year will end on
Friday, January 29, 1999. The two days that would otherwise have been included
in fiscal year 1999 (i.e., January 30 and January 31) will be included in fiscal
year 2000, and the activities for those days will be included in the Company's
quarterly and annual reports for fiscal year 2000.

         This change in the fiscal year end will have no material effect on the
financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for either fiscal year 1999 or
fiscal year 2000.
